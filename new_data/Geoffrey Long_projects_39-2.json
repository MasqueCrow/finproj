[{"backer": "Geoffrey Long", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Story Engine: Deck of Worlds is a set of 240 cards for creating imagined lands, local lore, and story-driven world maps you can instantly explore through writing or roleplay.\nContaining hundreds of open-ended worldbuilding prompts created by a talented international team of writers, the deck is ideal for worldbuilders, writers, loremasters, storytellers, DMs, teachers, and RPG groups of all kinds. \nThe deck features 6 simple card types that work together to create complex settings with a meaningful past, present, and future. With trillions of potential combinations and open-ended scalability, you can build anything from a city full of unique districts and landmarks, to a sprawling land of diverse terrain types, ecosystems, cultures, and civilizations. \nCombine Deck of Worlds with the original Story Engine Deck to fill your world with prompted characters, encounters, artefacts, story hooks, and more. By pairing the two, you can essentially explore and play in a creatively generated world using your preferred medium or RPG system.\nAlong with the standalone Deck of Worlds, we have also unlocked stretch goals for 3 new expansions and 6 new booster sets for the original Story Engine Deck, which you might know from our 1430%-funded Kickstarter project with 3,500+ happy backers.\n Deck of Worlds contains 6 types of cards that you can assemble into micro-settings.  \nEach micro-setting represents a unique area with its own geography, lore, features, and current events. You can organically assemble multiple micro-settings into a connected world map full of diverse cities, sprawling wildernesses, ancient secrets, vibrant cultures, multifaceted politics, and endless storytelling opportunities.\nYou can set the scale of your map to represent the kind of world you want to create, from an epic continent to a small city, and even use small side-maps to explore areas of interest in greater detail.\nLike The Story Engine Deck, the Deck of Worlds only has two formal guidelines:\n1) Don\u2019t put the deck away until you create something. It can just be a word in a notebook or an idea in your head.\n2) Ignore any card, rule, or guideline that doesn\u2019t help you create.\nBut I\u2019ve put together guiding principles to help you get as much mileage out of your deck as possible.\nThe 6 card types weave together threads of the area's past, present, and future to create a holistic, immersive setting.\nRegion Cards, Landmark Cards, and Namesake Cards establish the geography of your world.\nOrigin Cards, Attribute Cards, and Advent Cards provide past, present, and future lore for those locations. These cards have been contributed to by an international team of writers, including Akira Keith, Athar Fikry, A.Z. Louise, Brendon Alekseii, Cae Hawksmoor, J.D. Harlock, Juliet Kemp, Michael Barker, Pedro Galicia, Peter Chiykowski, Sarah Loch, and Shiv MacFarlane.\nThe text prompts written on cards are called cues. All cards except for Region Cards contain multiple cues. Whenever you draw a card with multiple cues, choose one cue from that card to use for your worldbuilding and ignore the rest.\nYou can create a micro-setting in less than 5 minutes.\n1) Draw a Region Card. Place it on your map. This provides the underlying environment type of your micro-setting.\n2) Draw a Landmark Card. Choose one cue. Tuck the card under the Region so only the chosen cue is showing. This expands your micro-setting and provides a point of interest.\n3) Draw a Namesake Card. Choose one cue. Tuck the card under the Region or Landmark so that only the chosen cue is showing. The Namesake Card provides the Region or Landmark with an in-world nickname.\n4) Draw an Origin Card. Choose one cue. Tuck the card under the Region or Landmark so only the chosen cue is showing. The Origin Card provides the Region or Landmark with a lore-based backstory.\n5) Draw an Attribute Card. Choose one cue. Tuck the card under the Region or Landmark so only the chosen cue is showing. The Attribute Card provides the Region or Landmark with details about the area or the people who live there.\n6) Draw an Advent Card. Choose one cue. Tuck the card under the Region or Landmark so only the chosen cue is showing. The Advent Card provides the Region or Landmark with an event that could change the future of the area and/or serve as a story hook.\nWhen tucking cards, you may rotate cards and place them in any orientation that allows you to read the cue and remember which card that cue applies to. \nYou may also allow more or less of the card\u2019s surface to show to expand the area of the micro-setting.\nWhen you are done arranging your cards, you can take as much or as little time as you like to interpret the cues that make up your micro-setting. You can make notes, or move on and create another micro-setting immediately.\nYou can also create a complex micro-setting by following the same set of steps, but drawing and placing 2 Landmark Cards, 2 Namesake Cards, and 2 Attribute Cards during their respective steps. For example:\nArrange your assembled micro-settings into a continuous map to build your world.\nYou can move card clusters, rearrange the cards inside, and switch cues as you go. The goal is for the cards to provide a simple and fluid system for assembling and workshopping the details of your world.\nHere's an unscripted video of improvising a micro-setting in just a few minutes, which led to a second setting connected to the first through lore and story. Closed captions are available.\nThere are also multiplayer modes for collaboratively creating a shared world and its lore with other players, which is a great way to kick off a group tabletop roleplaying campaign or write stories in a shared universe.\n Micro-setting clusters give you freedom to assemble a massive world map out of connected regions, or focus on a small area in detail. \nWhile the artwork on the cards is not to scale, you can space card clusters to reflect a consistent scale of distance between them. You can also shift how much of each tucked card is showing to expand or contract areas to better reflect their scope, and adjust your tucking patterns to change the shape of the individual area. The deck is designed to encourage non-gridded maps with irregular shapes.\nDepending on the size of the world you want to build, I recommend the following guidelines.\n To map a continent roughly the size of Middle Earth, assemble 14-20 micro-settings in a 30\u201d x 25\u201d space. Treat 1 inch as ~50 miles (~80 km).\n To map a country roughly the size of Thailand, assemble 9-14 micro-settings in a 25\u201d x 20\u201d space. Treat 1 inch as ~20 miles (~32 km).\n To map a city roughly the size of modern London, assemble 5-7 micro-settings in a 20\u201d x 15\u201d space. Treat 1 inch as ~1 mile (1.6 km)\nI may tweak these values as playtesting continues.\nNote: D&D estimates that the average character can travel 24 miles in a day without incurring penalties. Other sources estimating foot travel in the medieval period have suggested 9-14 miles.\nWe brought in some of our favorite authors and artists to help create some sample settings using alpha copies of The Story Engine: Deck of Worlds. \nTheir original creations will be illustrated as limited-edition collector postcards available through Kickstarter as well as digital lore releases available for free on our website, but with early access for Kickstarter backers!\nYou'll be able to read about and explore 13 portable micro-settings. These will be created by a team of guest authors\u2014Alina Pete, Brent Lambert, Carrie Cuinn, CL Clark, Elizabeth Aoki, Jordan Shiveley, and Victor Manibo\u2014and a team of international artists\u2014Angel Muro, Aysha, Beth Sparks, Cam Adjodha, Frances P., Grace P. Fong (\"Fictograph\"), Kuutti Ter\u00e4v\u00e4, Lauren Ring, Mel Uran, Megan McCurdy, Sabaa Bismil, Thaleia Demeter, and Tiago Sousa.\nSee below for some sample artwork from the portfolios of the creative team!\nArt from the portfolio of collaborator Tiago Sousa.\nArt from the portfolio of collaborator Beth Sparks.\nArt from the portfolio of collaborator Angel Muro.\nArt from the portfolio of collaborator Sabaa Bismil.\n\nThe core deck of 240 cards (all card stretch goals unlocked!) is designed to create imagined worlds in any genre, although it lends itself especially well to fantasy.\nTo explore different genres and encourage creators to focus on different aspects of their worldbuilding, we're also releasing a range of expansion sets via stretch goals (all unlocked).\n Three genre expansions are available upon launch.\nThe genre expansions each contain 60 cards: 8 Regions, 12 Landmarks, 12 Namesakes, 8 Origins, 12 Attributes, and 8 Advents. The Region and Landmark Cards are a mixture of entirely new cues and cues from the main deck with variant genre artwork. The Namesake, Origin, Attribute, and Advent Cards are all 100% new.\nWorlds of Myth & Magic Fantasy Expansion contains evocative fantasy imagery and worldbuilding prompts.\nWorlds of Chrome & Starlight Science Fiction Expansion contains imaginative sci-fi imagery and worldbuilding prompts.\nWorlds of Blight & Shadow Horror Expansion contains creepy, unsettling, and uncanny horror imagery and worldbuilding prompts.\n Three cartography expansions have been unlocked!\nThe cartography expansions each contain 60 cards: 8 Regions, 12 Landmarks, 12 Namesakes, 8 Origins, 12 Attributes, and 8 Advents. The Region and Landmark Cards are a mixture of entirely new cues and cues from the main deck with variant artwork on specialized climates. The Namesake, Origin, Attribute, and Advent Cards are all 100% new.\nWorlds of Tide & Tidings Coastlines Expansion contains prompts for developing coastal areas.\nWorlds of Sand & Story Deserts Expansion contains prompts for developing dry, hot, and arid areas.\nWorlds of Frost & Fable Arctic Expansion contains prompts for developing cold areas.\n\n Three creative expansions have been unlocked!\nShared Hearths & Common Creeds Culture Keyholes Expansion features 60 special Keyhole Cards loaded up with 240 culture-focused worldbuilding questions that act as keyholes for opening larger aspects of your setting. \n Depending on the level of detail you want to explore your setting in, you can tuck 1-3 questions per micro-setting, answering these questions as you write your setting notes, or layering in the questions when you have completed your world map and want to know more about an area. For more details on alternate ways to use these cards and how to apply them on a deeper level, see our May 31 project update.\nFresh Ink & Ancient Song Lore Fragments Expansion features prompts for creating in-world lore fragments in a variety of media: poems, prayers, floorplans, sketches, drinking songs, campfire stories, overheard conversations, tavern jokes, and more. \nThis deck allows storytellers to create prompts by combining two new card types. \nThe expansion contains 30 Opus Cards that provide a specific creative challenge or medium to create in, and 30 Flourish Cards that provide optional style challenges to focus the creative process.\n\nHeroes' Quests & Fools' Errands Adventure Prompts Expansion is a deck of 60 Adventure Cards that create customizable story hooks set in your world. They provide a simple quest/adventure framework with sockets for attaching details taken from your setting or cards drawn from The Story Engine Deck. They essentially can turn Deck of Worlds into a loosely structured solo RPG using your preferred RPG rules.\n\nThe Story Engine Deck was a breakout Kickstarter success that quickly grew into a set of genre expansions and subgenre boosters.\nYou can by downloading the free demo from our website, but essentially, you arrange 5 types of cards to create a bottomless supply of story prompts. \nPLAY\n\nWe are also launching 3 new expansions and 6 new boosters for The Story Engine Deck as stretch goals (all unlocked!) in this Kickstarter.\nUNLOCKED!

The international team of contributing writers is currently punching up the deck and expansions with some really creative and evocative prompts. \n\nThe stretch goal expansions have all been written and many have been designed, although a few are not yet in final layout. In particular, the Lore Fragments Expansion, Culture Keyholes Expansion, and the non-image cards from the Story Engine expansions have been written (minus writer team punch-up) but not put into final layout yet. We are also still producing artwork with the EMBERWIND team for the 12 new Anchor cards in the Enchanted Items Expansion.\n\nThis is my 7th Kickstarter, and over the past decade of designing and delivering successful crowdfunding projects, I've learned many lessons about how to deliver a project despite any obstacle that might come up\u2014and how to keep backers in the loop every step of the way.\n\nMy last project, The Story Engine Deck, overfunded 1430% and ran into unprecedented challenges like national manufacturing shutdowns in China, the COVID-19 pandemic, one nearly-shipwrecked cargo vessel, Europe snap-shutting the border mid-fulfilment, and the UK leaving the EU in the final weeks of delivery.\n\nI communicated with my backers throughout the process and I always make sure every backer gets what they pay for.

In Paperback Adventures, you get to play as the protagonist in one of Paige's wild brainstorming sessions. Conquer a menagerie of pulp novel characters in this solo deckbuilding word game.\nJust like in the original game Paperback\u2014and its follow up, Hardback\u2014you will build your own deck of cards throughout the game, and those cards will have letters to help you spell words every turn. But in Paperback Adventures, instead of testing your wordsmithing wit against other players, you will use your words to defeat a series of AI enemies in \"roguelike\" fashion.\nPaperback Adventures is a solo-focused game. It was designed from the ground up as a strategic, highly-replayable solo word game. There are also additional gameplay variants for cooperative play between two players.\nHere are the stretch goals we've unlocked!\nCommunity Stretch Goals\nPart of what makes Kickstarter great is the opportunity to hear what matters most to backers. Here are some of the additions and changes we\u2019ve made thanks to our backers\u2019 feedback.\nAs the game developed and grew, we wanted every character to have their own cards and unique styles of play, but with the Fowers Games history of small box games we also wanted to keep an affordable price point for the game. So we decided on a modular system that lets you play the game whether you buy one character or several.\nHere's what the Paperback Adventures core box contains:\nRulebook\nEnemy Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\n12 Enemy Cards\n12 Reward Cards\n7 Penalty Cards\n7 Enemy Vowel and \"?\" Cards\n26 Item Cards\n26 McGuffin Cards\n7 Penalty Card Sleeves\nAs long as you have at least one character box, the core box contains everything else you need to play the game. The core box also has space to store the bonus content from each of your character boxes (note: not all content from those boxes), allowing you to set up a new game more quickly.\nSo what comes in a character box? Each protagonist in Paperback Adventures plays distinctly, with different core items, starting items, and a unique 10-card starting deck. Additionally, every protagonist has their own growth deck of 50 cards that offers different paths and playstyles every game session.\nBut a character box doesn't only provide new content when you choose that character. Inside each character box you'll also find a few new enemies and a few new bonus items and McGuffins that go into your core box and add additional content no matter which character you pick for a given game.\nEach character box has bonus enemies, items, and double-sided McGuffins (like this one!)\nThe more character boxes you add, the more variety and wacky combinations you get. \nHere's what comes in each character box:\nCharacter Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\nCharacter Card\n6 Enemy Cards\n6 Reward Cards\n60 Letter Cards\n6 Core Item Cards\n4 Bonus Item Cards\n4 Bonus McGuffin Cards\n60 Letter Card Sleeves\nThe protagonists are not only unique from a gameplay standpoint, they also come from wildly different genres and have their own graphical style and artistic design. Here are the playable characters in Paperback Adventures:\nOur final character is a Pirate\u2014he is currently awaiting a proper name to be voted on by the backers!\nWord-heavy playstyle\nBarrage cards get bonuses for longer words\nCan drain the enemy's life!\nCan copy the effect of an item\u2014effectively using it twice\nCrew cards come back from the fatigue pile\nTry out the Tabletop Simulator demo on Steam!\nIn a single game of Paperback Adventures, your protagonist will face off against nine randomized enemies of escalating difficulty.  To make matters worse, your health total persists from enemy to enemy. Luckily for you, each enemy also offers randomized rewards to help you power up quickly to meet the challenge. \nYou'll need to beat each enemy one by one by spelling words with the cards in your hand. Each card has symbols that either damage the enemy, block the enemy's incoming damage to you, or provide you with mana so you can use your items. You'll also be able to activate the unique ability of one of your cards.\nThe game is divided in a trilogy structure, where you'll battle two normal enemies and a boss for each \"book\" in the trilogy. You can stop a game session after completing one book (~45 min) or even after any enemy through a \"save game\" feature that will keep your current deck, items, and rewards separate in the game's box. To beat the game, you'll need to defeat all nine enemies in the trilogy.\nOne goal from the outset of this game's design was to find ways to streamline the typical deckbuilding roguelike experience found in digital games for tabletop play. Two essential systems deliver the gameplay variation and combos needed for the genre while keeping player upkeep at a minimum: the splay system and the hex and boon counter system.\nYour word is ready\u2014which way will you splay?\n When you spell words each turn in Paperback Adventures, you'll need to also choose which way to splay your word, so that only one edge of each card is showing except for the top card. The only card ability visible will be on the top card, and that's the ability you activate. Here's an example of how it works:\nWhen you splay left, you count all the icons on the left edge of each card. The top card is the last letter of the word.\nWhen you splay right you count all the icons on the right edge of each card. The top card is the first letter of the word.\nThe splay system forces you to make tough choices\u2014do you want more blocks or more hits this turn? Or maybe which card is your top card matters most. To make that decision even tougher (and to keep every battle moving), the top card also gets fatigued for the rest of the battle. You'll get it back for the next enemy, though!\nHex and boon counters allow protagonists and enemies to support a wide range of playstyles without adding too many rules and overhead for players to track. Hex counters affect the character they are on negatively, while boon counters affect the character they are on positively. So these counters are always contextual--one enemy's hex counters might cause accelerating damage, while another enemy's hex counters limit your card draw.\nHere is a link to the current working rulebook for Paperback Adventures\nWe know that some players will want a tougher challenge, especially after completing a few runs. So we\u2019ll be including a system called Plot Twists.\nEvery Plot Twist comes with two distinct challenges, one on top and one on bottom, for the entirety of your run. Here is one condition card unlocked earlier in the campaign:\nEach challenge has a difficulty number assigned to it, with \u201c1\u201d being the lowest difficulty. Before starting a run, you can choose an overall challenge level for your run and then mix and match challenges from the various Plot Twists until the collective difficulty numbers add up to your desired challenge level. This way, you can experience brand new challenge combinations while also making the game better fit your experience and skill level.\nYou can splay the Plot Twists underneath your player tray, showing only the new rules from your chosen challenges so that you can quickly reference them. Those rules will stay the same throughout your run.\nWhile Paperback Adventures was designed from the start as a solo experience, we also knew that people would enjoy playing it with others. We\u2019ve been playtesting and working behind the scenes to bring some two player variants to the table that not only open up a seat for an additional player but also open up new ways to approach the game.\nTwo-Headed Giant\nThis cooperative mode really leans into the idea of co-op play. The two players must work in tandem using the same character, deck, and token tracker. But here\u2019s the kicker: you split your starting items and McGuffins between the two of you. Additionally, you alternate taking turns, which means your items and McGuffins are only available half the time. Anytime you gain an item or McGuffin, you both gain one!\nA lot of the fun in this variant comes from working together to find the best words and setting each other up for big turns. Don\u2019t just take our word for it though; check out this gameplay video where we show off the mode over a couple different enemy fights.\nDouble Trouble\nIn the Double Trouble mode, each player has their own character to play! They team up against a pair of enemies, but they must coordinate their attacks and share certain resources\u2014like the wild card!  (To make this possible, one enemy uses the tray from the unused character.)\n Paperback Playthrough with Aaron of GameEnthus and designer Skye Larsen\nPlaythrough from a Live Stream with Ruel Gaviola on Tabletop Tonight\nBook 2 Gameplay from a Live Stream with Richmond of BramBeard Gaming\nJason Perez with One Stop Co-op Shop\nYou won't get too far in a roguelike without sweet loot. Reward cards for each enemy will give you two options to choose from. You have to choose which set of loot is more important to keep progressing.\nItems provide powerful effects that can be used once per turn, but you'll need mana to activate most of them.  \nExamples of a McGuffin and item with completed art\nMcGuffins are always double-sided, and you'll get to choose which McGuffin will help you more. These powerups provide modest effects, but don't require mana for use. Find the right ones for some spectacular combos!\nEvery character letter card is also upgradeable. When a reward says you upgrade a card, flip the card over and put it back in its sleeve. Some card upgrades add extra icons to the card, while others improve or even alter the card ability.\n\n Shipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager after the campaign.  We ship customs friendly.\n Tim Fowers, co-designer, has piloted many successful games including Burgle Bros, Fugitive, and Paperback \n Skye Larsen, co-designer, has finally justified his Creative Writing degree (sort of)\n Jeff Krause, development, worked with Tim on Sabotage and Burgle Bros 2 \n Ryan Goldsberry, illustrator, helps bring all of Tim's games to life\n Noah Adelman, product design, has designed components and storage solutions for many successful games through his company Game Trayz\u2122\n We'd also like to thank Andrew Colin Beck for our logo design, Nate Stebbing for the animation work in our Kickstarter video, and Fernando Cunha for our gameplay animations on this page.\nWe will use a pledge manager to help our backers get their copy of Paperback Adventures as quickly as possible.

Two million years ago, new forces began to stir...and everything changed.\n\n TUKI: Fight for Fire\nAt the dawn of humanity, during a prolonged period of hardship and drought, three lost children meet a mysterious traveler named Tuki. Together, their search for the Motherherd of all Buffalo leads them far north through the dangerous territory of a rival species called the Habiline. The Habiline hunt and kill anyone found using fire. Tuki's reputation precedes them and soon they find themselves at the center of unwanted attention not only from Habiline warriors, but of gods and giants!\n Welcome! \nI'm Jeff and this is my first Kickstarter. Thank you for coming! I'm not sure what took me so long, since I've been self-publishing for years! 2021 is the 30th anniversary of BONE #1 which my wife Vijaya and I put out in July of 1991 through our imprint Cartoon Books. For folks who are unfamiliar with me or my comics, BONE is a single story, a fantasy epic that is sometimes divided up in nine volumes. More recently, I self-published my science-fiction noir story RASL from 2008 to 2013. Both books are still in print and going strong.  And now, to mark the birthday of BONE and Cartoon Books, we are announcing my next self-published project - TUKI: Fight for Fire! \nIf we reach our goal, TUKI: Fight for Fire will be released this July, 30 years to the month of BONE #1, to be followed in October by a second volume TUKI: Fight for Family. Both books are part of this campaign. \nThis campaign includes two original graphic novels \n Book One TUKI: Fight for Fire by Jeff Smith\n144 pages, 11.375 x 8.875 trade paperback, full color cover, b&w interiors \nThis book is complete and ready for the printer\n\n Book Two TUKI: Fight for Family by Jeff Smith\n144 pages (approx.) 11.375 x 8.875 trade paperback, full color cover, b&w interiors\nThis book is 95% finished with only the final two chapters to be inked. We will keep you updated on its progress\nIf funded, to be shipped as they are printed:\nBook One: July 2021 (30 years after the release of BONE #1 in July 1991)\nBook Two: October 2021\nA Passion Project\nAs with my previous works, BONE and RASL, the former inspired by a love of adventure stories, comic strips and epics, the latter by science fiction, physics and noir, TUKI follows this pattern of personal passions. In this case, my interest in the fantastic heroes of pulp fiction, mythical lost realms and human evolution.\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by evolution. I visited Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, the famous archaeological site occupied by many early humans over time. Standing down amongst the rocks and dirt, looking up at the swaying trees above the gorge, I had a vision of multiple human species walking around and interacting with each other. It was almost like seeing an echo of something that really happened.\nThere was a moment, two million years ago when that actually could have happened. Two million years ago, more than one species of human existed at the same time.\n\nA Note on Paleoanthropology \nEvolution, unlike the neat bumper sticker that shows a single line of primates slowly standing upright, is in reality much messier and more scattershot. Isolated groups evolved separately over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. Two million years ago, many different kinds of humans were all roaming upright on two legs across  east Africa.\nYou will meet some of them in this story. Australopithecus, the species that the famous Lucy was from, part hominid, half human from the waist down. The Habiline people, still shaggy, but with a bigger brain who developed the stone hand axe, a precision tool. And more.\nDuring this amazing epoch, the world was devastated by climate events that threatened to wipe out the struggling humans. Drought caused changes in the landscapes and massive migrations bringing the humans into conflict with each other. Then came the greatest upheaval yet - a new human, tall and strong, with the biggest brain of all, enters the scene bearing a power never before seen...the ability to control fire.\nHere begin the terrors, Here begin the marvels.\n\nI hope you'll join me!\nREWARDS!

As a new recruit your abilities and resources are limited so you'll need your wits about you to try and survive. Push your luck to press deeper into the unknown or play it safe and live to fight another day. The choice is yours!\nThe game includes a deck of rooms that you must explore. Some will contain harmless frog swarms, whereas others will hide dangerous frog monsters or even more notorious foes from Hellboy's past! The differently coloured dice represent your limited resources and you must choose carefully when selecting which ones to roll. If you run out of dice or wounds, it's the end of your turn.\n The thrilling Dice Game isn\u2019t the only way to back this Kickstarter because we\u2019re also funding FOUR brand-new expansions for Hellboy: The Board Game. Designed by original developers, Needy Cat Games, each of these expansions builds on the tension-packed, co-operative experience of Hellboy: The Board Game but turns the danger up to 11, thanks to the all-new optional Ragnarok mode.\n\nThat\u2019s right, saving the world just got a whole lot tougher as enemies become stronger and more difficult to defeat. Ragnarok mode can be used to offer an additional challenge to not only these new expansions, but the core game as well. It's perfect if you've breezed through the previous Case Files and want an even tougher experience!\nPlease note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\nYou\u2019ve played through the core game, Darkness Calls and The Wild Hunt. Now it\u2019s time to bring the saga to a close with The Storm and The Fury. Armed with a certain magical sword (no spoilers here, just in case), Hellboy must face his toughest foe yet: Nimue in her dragon form. This is the biggest miniature we\u2019ve made for Hellboy: The Board Game and it\u2019s not going to be easy to take her down.\n3D renders of miniatures.\nThe Storm and the Fury includes new miniatures, an epic Case File, new Deck of Doom cards, new Encounter Cards and a new playable version of Hellboy.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\n\n\nHELLBOY AND THE B.P.R.D.\nBut that\u2019s not all for Hellboy: The Board Game fans because with the storyline complete, it\u2019s time to move onto a whole new chapter inspired by the B.P.R.D. graphic novels. These three new expansions focus on a different element to make your games of Hellboy more unpredictable and action-packed than ever before.\nWith Hellboy gone, the B.P.R.D. faces a range of horrifying new minions as the world descends into chaos. The Hell on Earth expansion introduces new minions to add to your missions. From swarming Crickets, to demons and Ogdru-Hem mutants, you\u2019re going to wish you were only facing the Frog Monsters from the core game. This expansion includes 15 minion miniatures, the Nesting Site Case File and Encounter cards, plus all the minions can be mixed into existing missions using the previously released B.P.R.D. Archives expansion.\nIf only it were just the minions you needed to deal with... but they're the least of your concerns. In Pandemonium some all-new bosses are here to try and end the world. This expansion includes The Flood Case File, Enemy cards, Unexpected Threat Hammerhead card, Encounter cards and Boss Behaviour Cards.\nWith all that, you\u2019re going to need some new heroes and the B.P.R.D. is here to save the day. End of Days includes new playable agents \u2013 Ted Howards, Sledgehammer, Evolved Abe Sapien and Flaming Liz Sherman \u2013 plus the Eviction Notices Case File, character-specific Deck of Doom cards and Requisition Cards. Use these new agents to tackle the new expansions or return to your favourite missions from the original game and play them again with a fresh cast of heroes.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\nCombined with the original Kickstarter or the core game, these new missions make Hellboy: The Board Game infinitely replayable. Please note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\n\n\n Tabletop Gaming magazine plays a prototype version of Hellboy: The Dice Game.\nJames from Needy Cat Games and B.P.R.D. consultant Edwin, talk about what you can expect from the new expansions! Rob from Mantic's audio does get better... we promise, plus all the important stuff comes from James and Edwin anyway.\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. There is a risk that shipping may increase if any new tariffs or taxes are imposed for certain countries. We are VAT registered in the UK and will pay VAT for orders in the UK and EU countries.\nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\n\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Syria, South Africa, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. We are also unable to ship to PO boxes.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.\nInformation about the retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy and B.P.R.D. are \u2122 & \u00a9 Mike Mignola. Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, and all other prominently featured characters are trademarks of Mike Mignola.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. With this project, the expansions are all written and approved by Dark Horse, the miniatures and game components are approved by Dark Horse. Meanwhile, the Dice Game is also approved by Dark Horse.\n\nWe predict that we will begin shipping in June 2022 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes. COVID is still causing some issues with manufacturing and this could also impact the final shipping date.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 17 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War, DreadBall Second Edition, Star Saga: The Eiras Contract, Warpath, TerrainCrate, Kings of War: Vanguard, Hellboy: The Board Game and TerrainCrate 2. We currently have two outstanding Kickstarters, League of Infamy (mostly shipped) and Hellboy: The Roleplaying Game (digital rewards have been delivered, physical rewards are due to be shipped this year). \n\nREFUNDS\nUpon request refunds may be given within 14 days of the campaign ending, including fees. Following that time, refunds may be given minus Kickstarter and payment fees. In order to request a refund you must contact support@manticgames.com\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy backing this campaign you acknowledge that the components, artwork and game elements may change in the final edition. This means some elements may differ from those shown here following the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nIf you do not complete the pledge manager within the time specified when the pledge manager is sent, you agree that your contribution to the campaign was a donation and your pledge is fulfilled. Of course, we will use our discretion on a case by case basis. Completing the pledge manager is the ONLY way for us to confirm your shipping address and pledge details, as well as making sure we hit the production timelines.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that you will pay for any shipping and any import or other duties required in your country. If you refuse to pay customs or duties and do not accept the package, it will be destroyed and you will not be eligible for a refund.

Well here's a chance to see all the nuts and bolts of how one is put together...\n My name is Declan Shalvey, an award winning artist/writer from Ireland. I've been a freelance artist for over 10 years working for publishers such as Marvel and DC Comics on characters such as Moon Knight, Wolverine, Batman, Hulk and many more. I have also developed creator owned projects at Image comics, on books such as Injection, Savage Town and Bog Bodies.\n\nTIME BEFORE TIME is my latest creator owned series, debuting May 12th. The series begins in the year 2140, and to escape that world with no future, many turn to the  Syndicate, a criminal organization who, for the right price, will  smuggle you back in time to a better life. After working for the  Syndicate for years, out main characters Tatsuo and Oscar decide to steal one of their  boss\u2019s time machines\u2014but soon find that the one thing you can\u2019t run from  is your past.\n\nThis series is a new ongoing image series from myself and the creative team behind the recent and excellent WRITE IT IN BLOOD graphic novel. The Final Order Cutoff (FOC) to order #1 is soon; April 19th. To celebrate this new project, I'm doing something a little different... I want to pull back the curtain on the creation of an original series, for process junkies everywhere.      \n TIME BEFORE TIME: Process Edition is a 48 page process book, about making the new Image series, revealing the creative process behind developing the first issue of the series.  This is not the Image comic book that will be in comic stores; this is a book about how the comic was made. It's a rare opportunity to see all the raw elements of a comic develop into a finished piece of work.\nWhy Kickstarter? Well, this is an experiment for me, I've often been told that I should make some process projects though I haven't been sure how to release them. I also felt a companion process book would be a great way to dig deep into process material in a way that wouldn't be possible in a regular comic or trade collection. I've never launched a project on Kickstater before (though I've backed too many to remember!) but with a new Image series, I felt it would be an unique opportunity to put out a book like this and establish a platform to do more in the future. \n Process Edition interior pages\n\nOur TIME BEFORE TIME: Process Edition backers get access to...     \n\n-Interviews with creators\n-Co-writing conversation, with Declan Shalvey and Rory McConville\n-Art process, by Joe Palmer (including sketches, layouts)\n-Script to art comparisons, with commentary by creators.\n-Cover process, by Declan Shalvey\n\nBook designed by TIME BEFORE TIME, DECORUM and IMAGE+ designer Sasha Head\nRewards include limited edition prints, stickers, trading cards and opportunities to get signed books/ sketches from Declan Shalvey and even an original piece of TIME BEFORE TIME artwork, made specifically for this campaign.\nTIME BEFORE TIME trading card set (six in set)\nExclusive TBT Kickstarter print by Joe Palmer\nExclusive TBT Kickstarter print by Declan Shalvey\nExclusive TBT original artwork by Declan Shalvey\n'Syndicate' sticker\nThere's more!

It's common for TerraBeast's organic carapace to form blight and attract unhealthy creatures. They rely upon Astors to help keep them healthy. It is unknown how TerraBeasts spawn-- it's believed that Astors may play a role.\n\nThe world of the Terrabeast is procedurally generated and will be different each time you begin a new adventure. As the world grows, your actions help to shape it. If you maintain a healthy TerraBeast, the new biomes that grow will be fertile and healthy. Do you want to create more forests? Plant lots of trees and new biomes will be forests too.\n\nThe world is divided into different biome types, Grasslands, Forest, Mountains, Desert, and many more! Each Biome attracts different OddFauna and has specific needs to remain healthy. \nOddFauna thrive in their favorite biomes.\n\n\nGame Development Plan\nThe game is currently in Pre-Alpha and being developed for PC and will be released on Steam as an Early Access Game. (Wishlist Today!) Early Access will allow us to get it into player hands, get their feedback and have the time to use that feedback to shape the game. We are looking to our community of players to help us make the game as awesome as it can be. \n\nWe are making Alpha & Beta Access available as reward tiers. If you want to get your paws on the game as early as possible back at those levels! Alpha and Beta members have access to special discord servers that we will be reaching out to for feedback. Alpha and Beta backers will be able to vote on certain game decisions and help steer the development of the game.\n\nIf the Kickstarter gets funded, it will allow us to port the game to the Nintendo Switch! We will be able to buy Switch dev kits and ensure the game will perform amazingly on the console. I am incredibly excited at the prospect of developing for my favorite console. It will be a lot of work, but with your support, we will make it happen. OddFauna promises to be amazing on Switch! The Switch version of the game is available as an add-on item and with an estimated delivery date of Q1 2023.\nWe are a husband and wife team. Emma is the Creative mastermind behind OddFauna. She has been creating the cast of characters for years now. A few years ago we started talking more and more about how great a video game would be in her world. Last year, Cliff quit his AAA game development job to make it a reality! We finally are able to expand this awesome universe, and it is such a privilege to get to partner together on this creative journey.\nOur little family\nEverything in the game is hand-sculpted by Emma. This gives the world a very unique style. They are then hand-painted by Emma and handed off to Cliff. Cliff Photoscans them cleans up the models.

Licensed under CC 4.0", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are an experienced team, and we understand many of the risks we face. Here are our plans to deal with these risks.\n\nFinancial risk: We are confident that this amount of funding will allow us to deliver a solid game that meets our goals. We have put a great deal of our own funds into the development so far. It was important to us to put our own money into the project first and get the game to a solid place before reaching out for support. We will continue to fund the game if the Kickstarter is not successful, but it will not be as big and polished as we are hoping.\n\nSchedule risk: Our timeline is short, especially with only two of us working on the game. We have been meticulous about keeping the game in scope. To make sure we hit our goal, we have a roadmap that extends beyond shipping. A successful Kickstarter will allow us to hire experts to help in areas like music, community management, etc. This will allow us to focus on what we do best: making the game.\n\nGameplay : With just two people it can be challenging to make any game. Proper scope, experience, and passion is the key. With your support we will make OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast an amazing experience.

When you\u2019re invited inside for an evening\u2019s entertainment, what could possibly go wrong? Will you Cuddle with Cats or Thwart a Thief? Will you Brawl Over Brandy or Fall Prey to the Plague? At Hemlock Hall, awful amusements become deadly diversions with the flip of a card.\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a darkly humorous stand-alone competitive storytelling card game for two to five players. To win, you make your characters suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death.  The player with the most negative score wins. And in Gloomier, the winner gets the final word: Who was the murderer? How did the heist end? You decide!\nGloomier features transparent plastic cards, allowing a character\u2019s score \u2014 and story \u2014 to evolve as cards are stacked on top of each other. You don\u2019t need prior experience to play Gloomier, but Gloom fans will find that A Night at Hemlock Hall expands the storytelling aspect of Gloom with new, specially-designed story prompts. And this full stand-alone game includes 6 new Stories and 14 new Guests that can be used with any edition of Gloom. So dare to enter Hemlock Hall, and see what delightful disaster awaits!\n\nLike all Gloom games, Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a storytelling game. Stack transparent cards to boost your score and make your characters\u2019 tales the most tragic \u2014 while blighting opponents with good fortune. Then, tell the story of these miserable misanthropes.\nWhen you play an Untimely Death card on a character, they die and their negative score is locked in, but the story continues until all of one player\u2019s characters have perished. Then, all players tally their scores.The player whose characters had the most tragic lives (and the most negative score) is the winner.\nPoints are important, but the best part of Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is building increasingly sad, and increasingly silly stories with your fellow players. If you like Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addams Family, or A Series of Unfortunate Events, we think you\u2019ll enjoy the absurd dark humor of Gloomier.\n\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall contains:\n 110 transparent plastic cards (including 14 new Guests, 6 Story cards, a new cast of Characters, and a variety of new Modifier, Event, and Untimely Death cards to bolster your tragic tales)\nA 12-page, color, totally redesigned rulebook \nAn attractive tuckbox \nIt\u2019s a standalone expansion, which means you can play it by itself or combine it with any other Gloom games.\n\nGloom fans have been asking for it for years, and it\u2019s finally here \u2026 a box big enough for all your Gloom games!\nThe luxurious Grief Case is large enough to hold every Gloom game produced thus far \u2014 that\u2019s roughly 1500 Gloom cards \u2014 plus all your rules and extras, and your darkest secrets. (It\u2019s even got room to accommodate another four full Gloom games or eight expansions, for when you add future Gloom games to your collection.)\nThis case is extremely sturdy! 4mm thick laminated chipboard will make this the strongest game box in your collection, sure to hold up to a lifetime of use. Or, of course, 'til Untimely Death.\n Soft Touch finish adds a luxurious velvety-soft texture for instant tactile appeal and resistance to fingerprint marks. It also makes sliding the lid off the box both quick and satisfying.\n Spot gloss and red metallic foil add texture and shine to highlight design elements.\nThis deluxe box comes with its own thick acrylic dividers, so you can sort and cross-reference your games and cards in whatever way makes the most sense to you.\nAnd more!

Germany was already decimated by the First World War, and the Spanish Flu ravaged the country from border to border. It was during these unsettling years that the world's first horror-fantasy magazine was published.\nPublished in Munich from 1919-1921, DER ORCHIDEENGARTEN was a predecessor to the American pulp Weird Tales, and is considered the first horror-fantasy-science fiction periodical. The series collected macabre and mysterious tales from the finest European literary minds, from well-known names like H. G. Wells to now-obscure titans like Hanns Heinz Ewers. Many of the stories have been collected and translated over the years, so in this series of books we focus on the artworks, nearly all of which have remained unpublished for a century.\n\nGrotesque medieval etchings representing the human relationship with death, strange occult woodblocks that consider what lies just beyond the veil of human understanding, and sinister Expressionist visions as tangible manifestations of anxiety.\n\nFrom our current perspective of global uncertainty and the looming presence of a deadly, devastating virus, the artworks and stories of DER ORCHIDEENGARTEN -created in the same climate, a century ago\u2013 are uncannily resonant today.\nFounded four years before the iconic American magazine Weird Tales launched in March 1923, Der Orchideengarten was published immediately after the First World War, when German art was at its height of decadence and debauchery. The magazine included copious illustrations of themes ranging from suspense and terror to crime and the eerily-erotic. The stories were written by the European counterparts of H. P. Lovecraft and Arthur Machen, and the artworks were by artists both well-known and painfully obscure: Heinrich Kley, for example, was Disney's inspiration for Night on Bald Mountain in his film Fantasia, and is one of the artists well-represented in the magazine. The stories have been reprinted and translated over the past century, but the artworks remain undiscovered treasures\u2013 until now.\nRewards: The Book \nPERILOUS GARDEN: The Art of Der Orchideengarten Vol. 6 is the sixth book in our 'Art of Der Orchideengarten' series, and the third of three volumes completely documenting the magnificent and macabre artworks from the year 1920 of Der Orchideengarten magazine, the legendary German supernatural horror periodical published from January 1919 until November 1921.\nPERILOUS GARDEN: The Art of Der Orchideengarten Vol. 6\nPaperback, 5.5\" x 8.5\"\n80 pages\n60+ illustrations\ncontains every artwork from issues 16-24, published in the year 1920\nThe magazines were printed with letterpress debossing, creating rich, dense text and images; we are capturing the artworks in ultra-high, crisp resolution for maximum detail.\nPostcard Set\nSet of ten 5\" x 7\" postcards featuring five ghastly images from PERILOUS GARDEN (two copies of each image pictured).\nT-shirt\nSuper soft discharge print on high quality, vintage feel 100% cotton t-shirt available in sizes S-4XL (size selected in project survey).

We've prepared the materials, and by pre-ordering a copy of the book and spreading the word, you can help us make a documentation of this very rare and very obscure magazine come to life. Der Orchideengarten gets mentioned frequently in books, at fantasy conventions, and at certain full-moon cauldron gatherings\u2013but the same low-resolution images get shared over and over again. This book is an opportunity to explore the artworks in depth, with synopses and snippets of the stories, and high resolution scans made from a pristine collection. We love tactile experiences, and in a hyper-stimulating digital era there is nothing more meditative than thoughtfully turning the pages of a well-crafted book. With your help, we can perpetuate this romantic educational experience.\nFounded in 1999 by Thomas Negovan, Century Guild has presented Art Nouveau and Symbolist Art in both their Chicago (1999-2013) and Los Angeles (2012-2018) galleries, as well as in numerous international art and antiques fairs across the last two decades- including fourteen years as a major presence at San Diego Comic Con International. Works previously in the Century Guild collection are on permanent display in a number of important institutions, including The Art Institute of Chicago, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Detroit Institute of Art and have been exhibited at The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Minneapolis Museum of Art, and The Art Gallery of Ontario. The limited edition books published by Century Guild are desirable for their academic content, fine quality, and collectability; many out-of-print volumes command high prices on the secondary market.\n\nThank you for your support of our mission to document and preserve rare, obscure, and historically important artworks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPERILOUS GARDEN is the sixth publication in our 'Art of Der Orchideengarten' series; the previous five books in the series were each successfully funded and fulfilled on Kickstarter.

And from the look of it, it could be something special.\" - Jason Micciche,  Brutal Gamer \nLittle Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends is a 2D non-linear platformer with 4 playable characters that players can freely switch between. Each character's unique powers help players explore a huge cartoon world and can be chained for wild amounts of mobility! The game features artwork inspired by the groundbreaking 1905 Little Nemo in Slumberland comic, hand-drawn keyframed animation, and a huge cast of surreal creatures and characters!\nNightmare Fiends is a game I\u2019ve wanted to make for years after seeing the original artwork of Winsor McCay (c. 1866-71 - July 26, 1934), the creator of Little Nemo and a pioneering comics artist and animator. McCay\u2019s world is a sprawling surreal landscape of creepy mushroom forests, glittering ice caverns, and majestic architectural wonders with tons of weird and memorable characters. The comic goes beyond a simple fantasy, featuring an intricately drafted world and innovative panel layouts; it\u2019s beautiful, evocative, weird, and at times hugely meta. McCay himself was a massive influence on the likes of Walt Disney, Carl Barks, Art Spiegelman, and Maurice Sendak (among many others). While previous video game takes on Little Nemo exist, our goal is to create an explorable world from McCay\u2019s original (now public domain) vision, using animation techniques that McCay himself laid the groundwork for while updating Slumberland for modern audiences.\nThe game plays like Shantae or Demon\u2019s Crest with a splash of Little Samson. From Nemo's bedroom, players enter the dream world;  forests, palaces, the night sky, ice caves, and a twisted funhouse  await. Using  character's unique powers, players uncover each dream's secrets to grow in power and defeat the Nightmare Fiends once and for all.\nFeatures\nTake control of 4 characters on your trip through Slumberland! The brave Nemo, the magic-wielding Princess, the mischievous clown Flip, and the agile royal guard Peony - an original character created for this game!\nEach character has unique ways to attack and explore. Players can switch between them quickly to create powerful combos and find hidden areas!\nWake Nemo up and explore his house, featuring rooms with hidden items, artifacts to make your characters stronger, and production artwork!\nExplore surreal environments based on episodes from the original Little Nemo comic.\nFeatures gorgeous hand-drawn animations as a tribute to animation and comics pioneer Winsor McCay\nWe are coming to Kickstarter to ask for your help funding production on the game. If we reach our goal, we will be able to bring you an exciting, inventive, beautifully hand-animated platforming game made by experienced industry designers. Going beyond our goal, though, will help make this tribute to Winsor McCay and Little Nemo the stuff of dreams! \nA major feature of the game is the extensive hand-drawn animation, done in Blender 2.9\u2019s 2D Animation toolset. Each character requires DOZENS of hand-drawn frames. First, we sketch out each character's key poses on paper or within Blender, then draw the frames in-between in rough form to refine movements (also known as \"pose to pose\"). We put these rough frames onto the in-game characters to make sure that they  work during gameplay, at which point we apply ink and paint.\nWe make thumbnails and rough sketches to plan out our characters' motion, poses, and timing, then finish them off with clean ink and paint.\nBosco the Dragon animation (with test background)\nWinsor McCay is considered by animators and historians alike to be one of the most important figures in American animation, having made groundbreaking films like Gertie the Dinosaur and The Sinking of the Lusitania. As such, we're doing our best to incorporate ideas he created (he invented what eventually became \"pose to pose\" animation) into our own animation. We're also playing a little bit of \"what if?\" by  incorporating ideas that came after McCay, such as Disney's 12 Principles of Animation or smear frames, to his characters. For some of these characters, we're the first to animate them since McCay himself.\nPlayers switch between 4 main characters - Nemo, Peony, The Princess, and Flip - each with different abilities for attacking and navigating levels. \nNemo glides through the air by harnessing Slumberland\u2019s magic. This lets him cross long gaps and slow his fall. He attacks with a wooden sword attack that lets him hop off enemies in the air.\n  Peony can climb walls, reaching high-up areas that other characters can\u2019t. She attacks by placing bombs around her that explode in colorful firework displays.\nFlip grapples and swings with his spring-loaded boxing gloves. He also uses these gloves for powerful attacks.\nThe Princess hovers straight through the air with her magic. She can also attack by charging up magical blasts.\nLarge, non-linear levels with multiple goals in each encourage exploration and require players to use all 4 characters to uncover all of Slumberland's secrets. When not dreaming, Nemo's house is the hub of  the game world. While awake, Nemo can explore his house to power up or find items that will help him reach new areas in Slumberland. When players are ready for another adventure, Nemo goes to bed and can select which world to dream about.\n Nemo's House - When Nemo is awake, he can explore the different rooms in his house to find  hidden items that might evoke dreams of the game's various levels. Exploring the different levels of the game will help Nemo find keys to the house's different rooms.\n The Night Sky - The first step of Nemo's journey. This level features wind-sneezing clouds, airships, and an angry moon!\n The Mushroom Forest - The wild forests that stand outside of Slumberland's gates. Nemo and friends encounter woodland giants, trees to climb, and kid-eating clowns.\n Slumberland - Slumberland is home to Morpheus's palaces, gardens, and parade grounds. Nemo and friends explore Morpheus's halls while fighting back the Fiends' attack.\n The Ice Palace - Jack Frost's Ice Palace features dazzling crystalline structures, blizzard machines, and snowball-throwing creatures. No slippery surfaces here!\nIf we reach specific stretch goal levels, we will be able to add these areas to the game: \n The Fiends' Realm - Nemo and friends take the fight to the Fiends' door. Face down the nightmare creatures in their brutalist home turf.\n Befuddle Hall - A  labyrinth of surreal architecture and optical illusions! This dimensional nexus is where Slumberland is at its trippiest (and most meta!)\n Doctor Pill is Slumberland\u2019s premiere physician. Nemo and his friends buy supplies from his traveling cart.\n Mysto is one of Slumberland\u2019s best wizards. She will build platforms to summon the Dragon Trolley so players can travel quickly around the dream worlds!\n Bosco is a magical dragon and Slumberland\u2019s fastest Dragon Trolley! Nemo is initially put off by the chair in his mouth\u2026\n Mister Bunion is a wanderer who just wants to rid himself of his everyday worries, which he cares around in a briefcase labeled \"Dull Care\", so he tries to leave it behind in levels. What happens if you return it to him? \n King Morpheus is the ruler of Slumberland and the Princess\u2019s father. The Nightmare Fiends seem particularly focused on him\u2026\n The Moon \u2013 Usually a passive observer, this sentinel of the Night Sky has been made aggressive by the Nightmare Fiends.\n The Pie Eaters \u2013 These vicious clowns already made travel through the Mushroom Forest a hassle, but the Nightmare\u2019s power has made them even more monstrous.\n Phobetor \u2013 One of the Nightmare Fiends. He is a master of bad dreams and attacks Nemo and his friends with illusions. \n Thanatos \u2013 Brother of Phobetor and a Nightmare Fiend. Attacks with brute strength. \n Nyx \u2013 Queen of the Nightmare Fiends and ruler of the night. She attacks with magic and darkness. \nWith more to be revealed in the stretch goals! \nWe've made an original Little Nemo in Slumberland comic just for you!

Help us reach it to find out! \nThe game is in the prototype phase and planned to be released for PC, Mac, and Nintendo Switch. We are exploring partnerships to help us bring it to other platforms and potential physical releases. \nDevelopment screenshot of Ben testing out Flip's swinging physics\nThe technical side is being done by Benjamin Cole of PXLPLZ, who released the games Star Saver and Robo Puzzle Smash after spending years in AAA project management and development. Ben has done a great job laying down the foundational systems for the game around which we can create content. Independent designer Adrian Sandoval has also been working hard on designing the mechanics for the game, how character states affect one  another, and prototyping them in the game\u2019s environment.\nWe've used lots of tools from our toolbox to build the game's art. Blender 2.9's 2D animation tools have been indispensable for this process.\nAsset generation is a huge task. It\u2019s being handled primarily by me (Chris Totten of Pie for Breakfast Studios) in Blender 2.9\u2019s 2D Animation toolset with some assistance on concept art and animation from interns from Kent State University\u2019s Animation Game Design program. Each character requires dozens of hand-drawn frames. A ton has already been done, but we still need to do more enemies, additional main character and NPC animations, and the major bosses. Each level also requires tons of drawn environment art tiles and sprites so that we have lots to work with in the level design phase.\nIf we reach the $125,000 stretch goal, we can hire an additional developer to help further develop mechanics and elements of  the game.\nIf we reach $200,000 we can hire a professional writer to help us enrich the game\u2019s story.\nIf we reach $250,000 stretch goal, we can hire another animator to assist with fleshing out the game\u2019s visual identity.\nWe are planning for a potential release date of late 2022, but are also exploring various Early Access release options so folks can have access to a version of the game sooner and we can collect player feedback. A more solid schedule will be released for backers as the campaign progresses.\nA game and world of this scope will need the help of a community. Reaching our vision and doing justice to Winsor McCay\u2019s artistic legacy will require resources, focus, and time. The initial goal will  help us put together a fun, lighthearted action game with lots of fun references to beloved versions of Slumberland. Higher stretch goals will allow us to bring our full vision to life. This will include things like:\n Paying outside help \u2013 compensating other industry professionals for working on our passion project is a high priority for us. Working with other developers and artists, while also having access to talented writers as well as sound and musical talent will help create a better game.\n Improvements and quality assurance \u2013 we won\u2019t be happy with a merely  functional game, we want to create a game that celebrates the artistic  contributions of Slumberland. To do that, we need to take community feedback and work with testers to iron out any bugs that can get in the way of your travels.\nOur initial plan for the game is for a PC and Mac release via Steam. We are also able to bring the game to the Nintendo Switch, though the timeline for that is being evaluated to account for any additional porting development and testing required for that process. Our plan is to release for all current-generation consoles and will be actively seeking assistance in this regard.

This iconic scene has been recreated in comics, cartoons, and film.\nThe Dec. 3, 1905 Little Nemo in Slumberland strip where Nemo meets the Moon.\nThe August 5, 1906 comic featuring Bosco the dragon and his driver.\nThe February 25, 1906 Little Nemo in Slumberland comic, featuring the Pie Eaters.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a huge creative endeavor and will continue to be.

All in all, we are humbled and excited that so many have already put their confidence in us and want to continue to show we are worthy of that confidence.\n\nA lot of folks have asked us about acquiring rights to Little Nemo in Slumberland.

Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready.

I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues.

Germany was already decimated by the First World War, and the Spanish Flu ravaged the country from border to border. It was during these unsettling years that the world's first horror-fantasy magazine was published.\nPublished in Munich from 1919-1921, DER ORCHIDEENGARTEN was a predecessor to the American pulp Weird Tales, and is considered the first horror-fantasy-science fiction periodical. The series collected macabre and mysterious tales from the finest European literary minds, from well-known names like H. G. Wells to now-obscure titans like Hanns Heinz Ewers. Many of the stories have been collected and translated over the years, so in this series of books we focus on the artworks, nearly all of which have remained unpublished for a century. \n\nGrotesque medieval etchings representing the human relationship with death, strange occult woodblocks that consider what lies just beyond the veil of human understanding, and sinister Expressionist visions as tangible manifestations of anxiety.\n\nFrom our current perspective of global uncertainty and the looming presence of a deadly, devastating virus, the artworks and stories of DER ORCHIDEENGARTEN -created in the same climate, a century ago\u2013 are uncannily resonant today. \nFounded four years before the iconic American magazine Weird Tales launched in March 1923, Der Orchideengarten was published immediately after the First World War, when German art was at its height of decadence and debauchery. The magazine included copious illustrations of themes ranging from suspense and terror to crime and the eerily-erotic. The stories were written by the European counterparts of H. P. Lovecraft and Arthur Machen, and the artworks were by artists both well-known and painfully obscure: Heinrich Kley, for example, was Disney's inspiration for Night on Bald Mountain in his film Fantasia, and is one of the artists well-represented in the magazine. The stories have been reprinted and translated over the past century, but the artworks remain undiscovered treasures\u2013 until now.\nThe excellent copies of the magazine in our permanent archive are photographed for these books; the cover for issue 12 features a sinister Black Mass with a council of mysterious, red-hooded figures.\nRewards: The Book \nMALEVOLENT VISIONS: The Art of Der Orchideengarten Vol. 5 is the fifth book in our 'Art of Der Orchideengarten' series, and the second of two volumes completely documenting the magnificent and macabre artworks from the year 1920 of Der Orchideengarten magazine, the legendary German supernatural horror periodical published from January 1919 until November 1921.\nMALEVOLENT VISIONS: The Art of Der Orchideengarten Vol. 5\nPaperback, 5.5\" x 8.5\"\n80 pages\n60+ illustrations\ncontains every artwork from issues 9-15, published in the year 1920.\nThe magazines were printed with letterpress debossing, creating rich, dense text and images; we are capturing the artworks in ultra-high, crisp resolution for maximum detail.\nPostcard Set\nSet of ten 5\" x 7\" postcards featuring five ghastly images from MALEVOLENT VISIONS (two copies of each image pictured).\nMalevolent Visions Pin \n A 1.75\" nickel pin with black rubber double-clutch\nPerfume from Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab\nOur beloved friends at Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab have created a limited edition perfume inspired by the book!\n\nMALEVOLENT VISIONS- Blood orchid, ylang ylang, bourbon vanilla absolute, rose cream, frankincense, pink pepper, clove, and opium tar accord. \nFull-size 5mL perfume oil in amber vial.\nThe Art of Der Orchideengarten Vol. 1-3 books + BPAL perfumes\n\nCentury Guild Patronage Prints \n Century Guild Letterpress Prints\nAll five Malevolent Visions letterpress prints, shown with the custom, handmade paper folio\nFive deluxe, limited edition letterpress prints\nBlindstamped with the Century Guild emblem\n11\" x 14\" on deluxe cream paper\nThe complete set of all five Malevolent Visions letterpress prints also includes a custom folio featuring deluxe, handmade marbled paper specifically designed for this project by Brazilian artist Renato Crepaldi \nAdd ons\nIf you missed the first four books in this series, which document the complete artworks of Der Orchideengarten magazine from the year 1919 and the first part of 1920, there are special pledge levels for you to get ALL FIVE volumes - Malevolent Visions, Withering Heights, Eldritch Bloom, Sinister Harvest, and Diabolical Fantasia! \n\nIf you need to fill in specific gaps in your series collection, all of the books, pins, and postcard sets from Vol. 1-5 will be available as add-ons in the project survey.

We've prepared the materials, and by pre-ordering a copy of the book and spreading the word, you can help us make a documentation of this very rare and very obscure magazine come to life. Der Orchideengarten gets mentioned frequently in books, at fantasy conventions, and at certain full-moon cauldron gatherings\u2013but the same low-resolution images get shared over and over again. This book is an opportunity to explore the artworks in depth, with synopses and snippets of the stories, and high resolution scans made from a pristine collection. We love tactile experiences, and in a hyper-stimulating digital era there is nothing more meditative than thoughtfully turning the pages of a well-crafted book. With your help, we can perpetuate this romantic educational experience.\nFounded in 1999 by Thomas Negovan, Century Guild has presented Art Nouveau and Symbolist Art in both their Chicago (1999-2013) and Los Angeles (2012-2018) galleries, as well as in numerous international art and antiques fairs across the last two decades- including fourteen years as a major presence at San Diego Comic Con International. Works previously in the Century Guild collection are on permanent display in a number of important institutions, including The Art Institute of Chicago, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Detroit Institute of Art and have been exhibited at The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Minneapolis Museum of Art, and The Art Gallery of Ontario. The limited edition books published by Century Guild are desirable for their academic content, fine quality, and collectability; many out-of-print volumes command high prices on the secondary market.\n\nThank you for your support of our mission to document and preserve rare, obscure, and historically important artworks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMALEVOLENT VISIONS is the fifth publication in our 'Art of Der Orchideengarten' series; the previous four books in the series were each successfully funded and fulfilled on Kickstarter.

Now, as we work together to push forward as a society at the close of an excruciating and tumultuous year, we can think of no message more appropriate than the one that Mucha shared 121 years ago.  \n\nThe Project:\nFor 20 years, Century Guild has been devoted to championing and carrying forward the work of elegant and obscure artists into the 21st century.  One of the world's leading galleries in the realm where Symbolist Art, Expressionist Art, and Art Nouveau overlap, Century Guild exhibits important artifacts from 1880-1920 and rare works on paper by early 20th century artists including Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Felicien Rops, Egon Schiele, and Alphonse Mucha. We share these works through the more permanent presence of educational publishing, and by producing limited edition facsimiles of the rarest and most popular artworks in our collection. \nAlphonse Mucha's Le Pater is a beautiful study of the Judeo-Christian Lord's Prayer through a non-denominational, mystical lens. Originally published in an edition of only 510 copies in 1899, this series of rare artworks by the quintessential Art Nouveau artist was his deeply personal exploration of the Lord's Prayer. Born from a desire to create a dynamic interaction between his most important artwork and the viewer, Mucha created a multi-dimensional presence for the text that overflows with artistic metaphor, Christian mysticism, and Masonic symbolism, allowing the viewer an opportunity for deeper understanding of the spirit and intentions.\nIn 2019, we published a book that documents the artworks and text of Le Pater in its entirety, along with rare historical photographs and detailed analysis of the content. As we approach the December anniversaries of both the original 1899 publication of Le Pater and the 2019 publication of our book, Le Pater: Alphonse Mucha's Symbolist Masterpiece and the Lineage of Mysticism, we're celebrating with a new project to make shirts, enamel pins, and canvas book bags to help spread this important message.\nThe Rewards:\nMetal pins\nT-shirts\nSoft, cotton blend t-shirts available in Vintage Black and Vintage Blue, all sizes.\n Tote bags\nSturdy canvas tote bags available in Black and Natural\nBooks\nLe Pater: Alphonse Mucha's Symbolist Masterpiece and the Lineage of Mysticism\nLe Pater: Alphonse Mucha's Symbolist Masterpiece and the Lineage of Mysticism is the most beautiful art book we have created to-date, and the most important book on metaphysical and Symbolist art in decades.  Author Tom Negovan explores mystical Symbolist art from Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471-1528) to William Blake (1757-1827) and Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939), with stops at the Invisible College (1618) and Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan's legendary occult Salon Rose+Croix (1892).  Along with fascinating details from the seances and metaphysical experiments conducted in Mucha's studio, the book also has chapters devoted to Bing's salon L'Art Nouveau and the Exposition Universelle of 1900.

The game uses a d6 narrative dicepool system that constantly pushes the story forward.\nAt character creation, players select a Bloodline, Origin and Post, each with a variety of options to inform and customize a character's background and playstyle:\nThe four core bloodlines of the Wildsea: the cactuslike Ektus, Ardent survivors, hive spider Tzelicrae, and fungi Gau.\n Your Edges represent the way in which your character is most used to solving problems. Your Grace, Iron, Instinct, Sharps, Teeth, Tides, or Veils. \nYour Skills are more specific areas in which your character has training or a natural advantage. Things like Climbing, Charming, Cooking, Breaking, or Scavenging. \nYou also have Aspects - gear, traits, or companions - that can be used, expended, or damaged throughout the course of play. \n Resources are useful oddities, short term expendables used for things like whispers, scavenge, and specimens.\nYour known Languages allow you to engage with different people and cultures in the diverse world of the Wildsea.  \nFinally, your Drives and Mires define your personality, motivation, and long term goals. \nEach crew will also have their own ship, a vessel capable of braving the unique challenges of the lingin tide. You might cut a path with a chainsaw-ridged prow, drag yourself with hooks and grapples or scuttle from branch to branch on insectile limbs.\nCustomize and upgrade  your ship by designing its Size, Frame, Hull, Bite, and Engine, and outfitting  it with different Fittings. Make it your home on the waves! \nStories and Characters develop as the crew pursues milestones, while time in the game is abstracted through three distinct phases: scenes, montages, and journeys. \nThe Wildsea will initially be presented in landscape, 11.5 x 8.5'' inch (~29 x 22 cm) hardcover book with around 200 pages of mostly black and white interiors punctuated by full color spread chapter headings.  \nMockup. Artwork and Design of Physical Book not final. Design shown is a hardcover perfect bound edition that would only be unlocked should we reach certain stretch goal milestones.\nAs the campaign grows, so will the quality and contents of the book. Should we reach certain stretch goals, we will upgrade the physical book to a 3-piece clothbound, full colour, sewn book sure to be a centerpiece of any collection. For more information, see the Stretch Goals section below.\nThe initial funding goal of $15,000 represents the bare minimum for the creators to produce and print physical copies of the book and recoup the funds already expended by the creator to the artists. \n\nCommunity Copies: At Collector's Edition and above tiers, we'll include additional digital Community Copies to be claimed by the public. Community Copies provide a way for those with less means to enjoy content and are a feature of Itch.io. When our page on the platform goes live, we'll add Community Copies commensurate with the amount of backers we have at higher tiers.\n\nShipping is not included in the pledge levels for this campaign and will be calculated and added on when we are ready to ship via Backerkit. This is a production Kickstarter and it may be up to a year before we start shipping out physical copies. It would therefore be inaccurate  to include the shipping rates as part of the funds raised for this campaign. \nAs in: you will not be charged additional VAT or Customs Taxes on your shipped goods.\nMythopoeia is currently in the process of partnering with fulfillment centers based all over the world to deliver customs-friendly shipping, including to Europe and Oceania.  According to our most recent quotes, packages for a <1kg (~2 lbs) package average around $7.50 to the USA, UK, Germany, and Netherlands and around $20 to Oceania and Canada. \n\nShipping has been quite tumultuous in recent months due to the ongoing pandemic and politics. Canadian postage from the USA seems to have taken a dramatic spike over the past four years. This is a problem we are actively working on. If you know any local Canadian or Australian distributors for USA goods, we would love to hear from you! \nClick through to Felix's Twitter.\nClick through to Pierre's Instagram.\nClick through to Omercan's Instgram.\nClick through to Katy's Instagram.\nClick through to Kyllian's Instagram.\nClick through to Alexis' Instagram.\nClick through to Liam's Soundcloud.\nClick through to say hello to Ric [@Cerebric] on the Discord!\nClick through to Ryan's Twitter.\nClick through to Mythopoeia.\nClick through to Mythopoeia's Itch.io\nIf we reach our initial goal of $15,000, we'll include new Origins for character creation not seen in the Quickstart Rules! We'll also throw in a set of digital wallpapers and other high resolution Wildsea Artwork as part of the Kickstarter exclusive digital bonuses. \nAt $17,000 we will be able to commission a full Wildsea Soundtrack from the amazing Liam P. Vaughan, composer of Thrash, Tangle, Sink, the song used in our Kickstarter video!  \nAt $20,000 we'll be able to afford to turn the book from mostly black and white to full colour! To do so will require us to go back and recolour about two thirds of our total art assets - a significant endeavor! \n\nAt $25,000 we'll bring on board a Professional Layout Artist to help design the final look of the book!  We'll also produce and release Virtual Play Surfaces to facilitate online play on your favorite platforms of choice.\n\nAt $30,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists as well as commission an expanded bestiary from bestiary artist Katy Shmeckerel (@schmeckerel)! \nAt $32,000 we'll release the SRD for the Wild Words Engine, allowing you to hack and release your own games! To celebrate this milestone, we'll also be commissioning Creators to create new content for the Wildsea including new factions, beasts, and  ships, and perhaps even additional Reaches...\nAt $35,000 we'll be able to upgrade the specs of both the Standard and Collector's Edition of The Wildsea! This may include things like an offset print run, three piece clothbound hardcover, and embossed finish. \nAt $37,000 we'll include a chapter on Arconautics - the study of the weird and strange. Arconautics presents an array of additional options for both players and Fireflies that want to embrace the extraordinary - alchemists, augurs, ironbound automatons, manipulators of metal and plantlife. Includes new bloodlines, origins, posts, skills, and hazards! \nAt $40,000 we'll be able to spare no expense when it comes to printing the book, including being able to lower our carbon footprint by printing locally. We will also will look into more printing bells and whistles like foil stamping, endsheets, booksmarks, et. all.\nAt $42,000 we'll be able to bring on even more Creators to create content for the Wildsea! We'll announce if we get here, but preliminary discussions have included an appendix on gardening, and ventures deep into the undiscovered waves...\nAt $45,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists yet again and commission more artwork for the final book. Perhaps we might even be able to include an illustrated Chart or three...\n At $50,000 we'll be able to produce a fully realized actual play of the Wildsea for your viewing enjoyment! This may include partnering with an existing show or perhaps striking out on our own. Details to come if we get here! \nAt $55,000 we'll be able to add a set of ship creation options, unique hazards and Firefly guidance based around the ideas of exploring the upper skies and lower branches. Now we just have to work out what to call a submarine... \nAt $60,000 we'll set aside a portion of the funds to subsidize the shipping fees for the project. This will hopefully enable us to lower shipping rates by $1-2 dollars per package, depending on a number of factors. Internally, what this means is that no matter what we will allocate a portion of our funds raised to shipping costs, which we'll then pass the savings unto you when it comes time to charge and fulfill via Backerkit.\nAt $65,000 we're going to pay Wildsea creator and designer Felix Isaacs more! The majority of funds raised from  the last stretch goal to this one will go directly to Felix in addition to his overall cut of the campaign and future sales.\nAt $70,000 we'll be able to raise the per word rate of the various designers and writers we are bringing on board to the Wildsea (which I promise we'll announce soon in a future update). Freelance game design is not exactly a lucrative profession but we're committed to building a bigger tent and providing opportunities to others when and where  we can.\nAt $75,000 we'll be able to design and manufacture a set of custom  wooden Wildsea Dice which will be available to purchase as an Add-On via BackerKit. This is something we wanted to have ready for the start of the campaign but alas simply ran out of time. Nonetheless, reaching this tier will give us the resources to begin the process of making these dice in earnest.\nHandcrafted dice from Might Dog Games. Now available as add-ons.\nAt $85,000 we'll include the last content update for the core book: The Farthest Reaches. Consider this an expansion of the Arconautics chapter already unlocked detailing the furthest corners of the Wildsea. More obscure content, to be announced if we get here!\n\nFinally, our ultimate goal at $100,000 will allow us to lower shipping rates yet again, reducing the rates by another $1-2 per package. In the interim, the funds raised to get this tier will allow us to pay the principles of the project just that little bit more :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a production Kickstarter, the primary risk is that the book still needs to be created in full before printing and distribution can begin. For that reason we typically like to run print Kickstarters where the product is already completed instead, but sometimes that's not possible when launching a new and amazing project like the Wildsea! \n\nRay and Vince bring over six years and 13 projects worth of crowdfunding experience into this campaign. We know how to produce beautiful books and communicate with our backers and fans on every step of the process. We strive to have 100% satisfaction guaranteed when it comes our projects - ask our past backers about their experience! \n\nWe gave ourselves a wide breadth for the campaign - almost a full year - but should we meet and exceed our goals, we will use that time to build a better world filled with gorgeous art and a handsome book you'll be proud to have on your shelves. There is always the possibility that things may be delayed further. We will do our best to deliver in a timely matter while maintaining transparency and striving always for the highest quality work possible.\n\nShipping is another major uncertainty heading into the year 2021. The state of global politics means that things like postal rates and customs and tariffs are in a constant state of flux. Brexit and the USA/China trade war may impact the printing and manufacturing of the Wildsea in ways we cannot foresee. Nonetheless, we will do our best to navigate these uncharted waters, just as we have done for the past four years. \n\nBacking this project means you're not only buying the book, but helping produce the work to make it real. For that we can't thank you enough. Together, we'll build something amazing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "HARDSHIP TIER", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF at a reduced price for those experiencing financial hardship.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}], "stat": ["458 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "DIGITAL COLLECTION", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["509 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "PRINT EDITION", "descp": "A single copy of the physical edition of the Wildsea: RPG.

With our friends from all over the globe, we've worked incredibly hard for months to lay the foundation of our upcoming festival this October 16-24. We\u2019re planning nine full days of 24-hours-a-day programming, streamed for the entire world to participate, with opportunities to play, network, learn, talk, and more. \nThe ability to open our doors to the world and cross boundaries, space, and time, to showcase games is an exciting new development for IndieCade. This campaign was created to sustain where we go next: we're scaling our digital platform to exist beyond just this year's festival. Here's a look at the framework for Anywhere and Everywhere:\nHow we share games and connect.\nWhy we need your support\nWe\u2019re raising funds to boost our ability to showcase games, and to build the architecture for our online headquarters. Moving our entire operation to the internet has been a challenge with hard costs, but the space we\u2019re creating will be a lasting change. We want ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE to be a place that the indie community can benefit from all year round. It will be a sustainable venue to experience new games, meet with developers, and see the latest updates from our network. Your support will allow us to set up our initial digital infrastructure, and to create a more rich and open platform. We\u2019re designing this space with experience at the forefront, where genuine connections can be made.\nHow we'll use the money\nOur first ever Game Dev Sketchbook\nWe wanted to make a unique reward for our backers, so we've gathered some of IndieCade's most talented alumni and friends to produce a special book of sketches and handwritten notes from game developers all over the world. The pages of the GAME DEV SKETCHBOOK will be a personal, inside look at ideas that sparked some of your favorite indie titles. We're currently collecting assets and confirming participants, but we're eyeing at least 50-100 pages in a minimalist, square-formatted book. We'll use the time between now and printing to finish gathering assets from creators, finalize print details, and optimize the format to the highest quality. This book can't exist without your support, and backing this campaign will give us the ability to produce a rare artifact of indie games history.\n Featuring sketches from creators who made: \nJOURNEY | EXPLODING KITTENS | THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE | EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK | GORAGOA | DICEY DUNGEONS | VVVVVV | MUTAZIONE | FUJII | WHAT THE GOLF | CARD OF DARKNESS | WATTAM | MYST | CREAKS | BABA IS YOU | SPELUNKY | THE ENDLESS FOREST | NUCLEAR THRONE | STORYTELLER | WALDEN, A GAME | IBB & OBB | THUNDERBIRD | MULAKA | KEEP TALKING AND NOBODY EXPLODES | COSMIC TOP SECRET | OXYGEN NOT INCLUDED | MAGIC TRICK | HEADLINER: NOVINEWS | KLEPTOCRAT: HOW TO HIDE DIRTY MONEY| AND MANY MORE! We'll be updating the campaign each week with additional confirmed contributors.\nMockup\nImportant note on shipping: Shipping for all physical rewards will be calculated and charged at a later date. We are working hard to find the correct printing partner that can handle distribution for us.\nOff the menu rewards\nWe've also got a few extraordinary rewards to offer for your support. We were able to source these hard-to-acquire items from some of our favorite developers:\nABS vs THE BLOOD QUEEN Fightstick by BumbleBear\nKlaxo Radio Hour by Haunted Ephemera\n\u0337L\u0337i\u0337n\u0337e\u0337 \u0337W\u0337o\u0337b\u0337b\u0337l\u0337e\u0337r\u0337 \u0337b\u0337y\u0337 \u0337R\u0337o\u0337b\u0337i\u0337n\u0337 \u0337B\u0337a\u0337u\u0337m\u0337g\u0337a\u0337r\u0337t\u0337e\u0337n\u0337 Sold out!

Here's a breakdown of the ticket types and experiences we're offering for this year's festival. Each week we'll be updating the campaign with news on confirmed sessions, speakers, games, and events that you can attend next month and onward.\nPlease note all festival tickets will be delivered October 2020, and physical rewards will follow at a later date.\n\nLastly, rare and limited IndieXchange tickets are available this year, exclusively through our Kickstarter campaign. IndieXchange is our festival's annual one-day track focused on advanced developer sessions and content, and is not usually open for sale to the public.\n\nThank you\nMore information is available at https://anywhere.indiecade.com.\nThank you for your support <3 -IndieCade Staff\nFollow us @indiecade: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge ahead of us is finding the right printing and shipping partner for the Game Dev Sketchbook. We want to make sure the books arrive on time and are protected during transit, and that shipping costs are appropriate for every backer. Although we have done quite a bit of research already, choosing our final partner will require a second leg of followup. We think the extra time spent on this step will ultimately lead to a better product for everyone that buys the book.\n\nThe other challenge we're facing is completing the architecture for ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE. We have created an entire framework for our festival, but we need to continue building out the platform and figure out how to translate that to a sustainable, long lasting digital venue. We're incredibly excited for this transformation. In order to solve this puzzle we'll need both community feedback as well as lessons learned from the festival.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur entire platform will be a permanent digital venue to showcase independent games, designed to be a long lasting resource for the indie games community.

It is a game filled with grassy fields, mossy shrines, herds of chubby bumblebees, opossums in sundresses, salamanders with suspenders, starry night skies, and the most beautiful sunsets you can imagine. You might be a tamarin who dances with small and forgotten gods, a leporine mail carrier who relies on moths to get packages where they belong, a little lizard with a big heart and a mysterious past, or a near-endless number of other thrilling possibilities. No matter what, we\u2019re always travelers\u2014animal-folk who go from village to village and get to see the length and breadth of all the world of H\u00e6th. The seasons will change as we play, and we will change with them. But I can\u2019t tell you all that will happen on our journey together, along the winding dirt road and amid the grassy fields. We\u2019re just going to have to find that out together.\nWill you join me?\nThe Journey Ahead\nWanderhome makes use of a unique game system inspired by the No Dice, No Masters engine, developed by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum for Dream Askew and Dream Apart. Each player will make a character with the help of one of fifteen possible playbooks, making choices about their personality, animal-form, look, and passions. Each of these playbooks give you a radically different approach both to navigating the setting and growing over time. From the carefree Ragamuffin to the introverted Poet, from the Guardian and their young ward to the lonely Exile, from the cheerful Dancer to the moody Veteran, there is plenty of space in Wanderhome to imagine every possible world that lives in your heart.\nOnce you\u2019ve created your character, you and your fellow travelers guide them through the dreamlike pastoral world of H\u00e6th. There are no dice in Wanderhome. Instead, you can inconvenience yourself or step outside your comfort zone in order to get tokens, and then turn around and spend those tokens to tackle larger problems and help make the world a better, kinder space.\nQuote from Vincent and Elliot Baker of Lumpley Games\nQuote from Samuel Mui Shen Ern, Babblegumsam\n\nAs you arrive at each new place, you\u2019ll build it together using a combination of thirty-six distinct natures, including farms, fields, lakes, ports, glens, and towers, among many, many more. Each nature gives you the tools you need to imagine and articulate both the literal and metaphorical aspects of the place you find yourself in. These places have kith, ordinary people living ordinary lives, navigating a world that is both peaceful and difficult in its own ways. Each kith is made out of traits that range from crafty and adventurous to many-faced and oracular. These traits give kith things they can do to define their personality, articulate the problems in their life, and push the journey forward (for good or for ill.) Sometimes you\u2019ll be able to help the kith with their problems, but more often than not you\u2019ll just spend time with them and learn more about the world.\nSketches by Kimberli Johnson, Nadhir Nor, and Letty Wilson\nWanderhome is structured with an emphasis on safety and care, built on my own work designing safety mechanics and constructing alternate safety approaches beyond the industry standards. It features a bespoke set of safety mechanics built around empowering players to guide the story however they want, which are used consistently throughout the game. It is also designed to collaboratively set the tone and articulate a version of H\u00e6th that's perfect for your group. \nWanderhome is a GM-agnostic game\u2013while you can play with a Guide facilitating the world, you can also approach it without anyone in charge, where everyone takes equal part in the collaborative conversation. And while you can play Wanderhome in as little as 3-4 hours, the longer you stay with Wanderhome the more the world will grow with you. The months will pass over time and as each season concludes you\u2019ll get to make new choices about your character, advancing them in new directions and helping them grow in ways you didn\u2019t think was possible. If you play long enough, eventually your characters will retire or grow apart, and the journey will continue with brand-new travelers and a vast world ahead of you.\nThe free playkit is available on Itch now! (Art by Letty Wilson)\nThe World of Haeth\nWanderhome is set in the wholly-original fantasy world of H\u00e6th, inspired by the works of Brian Jacques, Tove Jansson, and Hayao Miyazaki. The game hints at and builds a mythological language around forces like the bitter King of the Floating Mountain, the Lily Rebellion, the Slobbering God and the blade that killed her, and the fall of the great dragons of old, but refuses to elaborate or define them\u2014leaving that exercise to the players through the journey itself. Instead, Wanderhome is focused on the lives of ordinary people, and the world that exists for farmers, merchants, and crafts-folk.\nWanderhome is a world filled with animal-folk and their buggy livestock. Unlike many worlds with animal-folk, there is no morality or judgement ascribed to the various animals of H\u00e6th\u2014a snake is just as capable of being a kindly farmer as a rabbit, and you can\u2019t assume much about someone based on what animal they are. You might find a fluffy shepherd with a herd of bumblebees, a shrewish merchant riding a stag beetle the size of a house, a lonely fox riding a grasshopper from place to place, or a praying mantis that hangs out in a gecko\u2019s pocket.\nQuote from Avery Alder, Buried Without Ceremony (Art by Jennie Lindberg)\nWanderhome also features an original calendar of new months and seasons, with its own cycle of holidays and traditions. From flowery Bloommeadow to brisk Firetop to snug and quiet Snowblanket, each month is both rooted in potentially familiar natural cycles but with a unique twist. Each place you travel to has a different expression of the seasons in it - no matter how many times you travel through the year, it will always feel different. If you play Wanderhome long enough, you might even encounter unique phenomena that create a new twist on the calendar. \nThe H\u00e6th is a world full of queer love, hope, happiness, and community. It is a land that was once ravaged by violence, but is putting itself back together again. Wanderhome dares to imagine a better world, one where money and power are distant stories from a bygone age, and we can learn to begin the process of healing.\nThumbnails by Danny Kyobe and Jo Thierolf\nKickstarter\nWanderhome, like all projects, is a dream that can only be created with your help. In an industry dominated by exploitative hiring practices and low wages, I believe it\u2019s possible to release a large-scale high-quality game where everyone is paid what they\u2019re worth. While the funding goal is higher than most Kickstarters, I refuse to get away with underpaying or undervaluing the incredible artists, writers, designers, and creators who are willing to pour their heart and soul into this game. Wanderhome is ambitious, but the hope is to make something unlike anything else in the role-playing game space.\nThe final copy of Wanderhome will exist in two forms\u2014a complete digital PDF copy of the game, and an approximately 150 page 8.5\u201d square softcover in full color, printed by Mixam Press and published by Possum Creek Games. Wanderhome will feature a cover by Sylvia Bi, illustrations by Letty Wilson, and full-page pieces by more than a dozen different artists, each with a unique style and perspective on Wanderhome. These talents are being directed (and the book is being designed) by the one-of-a-kind Ruby Lavin, with editing by Kazumi Chin and Luke Jordan.\nHere is how the budget is being distributed:\n $5,000 for game design and editing.\n $7,000 for layout and all the incredible art.\n $4,000 for printing and production.\n $800 for Backerkit, who will be handling shipping after the Kickstarter.\n $1,800 for Kickstarter and credit card fees\nMockups of the Book (design not final)\nHardcover Now Available!\nPDF Tiers\nSoftcover Tiers\nHardcover Tiers\nMerchant Tiers\nPilgrim Tier\nThe Team\nJay Dragon\nJay is a queer lyrical game designer who lives in the Hudson Valley. You can generally find Jay writing games about community, trauma, and our relationship to the land; talking about games on Twitter and Patreon; or sitting by the creek with a bunch of flowers and some zines. Jay is the founder of Possum Creek Games, and has managed three wildly successful Kickstarters before Wanderhome. Jay's first game, Sleepaway, is the winner of an ENnie Judge's Spotlight Award, and has been nominated for two IGDN Indie Groundbreaker Awards - Most Innovative and Game Of The Year.\nRuby Lavin\nRuby is a graphic designer and illustrator living in Philadelphia. She likes texture, critical theory, fantasy, and weird plants. Ruby has previously been involved in the Kickstarters for Strong Female Protagonist, Sleepaway, Venture & Dungeon, and the recently-concluded Wickedness, making this her fifth Kickstarter involvement. She is the Art Director at Possum Creek Games, and you can find her portfolio here.\nKazumi Chin\n\nKazumi is an educator, organizer, poet, and game designer. They are the author of Having A Coke With Godzilla, and have written a number of acclaimed indie RPGs, including (but not limited to) Malinche's Dream, Recollection, and Doggos & Doggos. They believe in a world without prisons and policing. \nLuke Jordan\nLuke is a game designer, editor, and educator who writes games that are specific, sincere, spooky, and sad. They love painterly landscapes, heartfelt poetry, slice-of-life storytelling, and Watership Down (and, therefore, Wanderhome). They publish games through Games From The Wild Wood, and are known for their experience and mastery of the No Dice, No Masters engine. Games of theirs include Heaven Has No Taste; And Other True Statements, Grand Guignol, and Heaven in the Dust. \nThe Artists\nSylvia Bi\nSylvia Bi is an illustrator, designer, and full time book gremlin. By day, she designs over at Random House Children's Books, but by night she collects a terrifying number of earrings, draws nostalgic worlds, and gobbles up graphic novels.\nLetty Wilson\nLetty Wilson is an award-winning Scottish artist who spends a lot of time thinking about moss. Her work includes an ongoing webcomic, Owl People, about fairies doing crimes; illustrations for the Choose-your-own-path book Into the Dungeon, written by Hari Conner, among other books; and comics about devils, queer insects, flowers who are also knights, and the importance of worms.\nCam Adjodha\nCam is an artist and illustrator in New York City.

She is constantly watching aesthetic baking videos and cat videos, and one day aspires to also have  a cat. For now, she is satisfied with her thriving mint plant. You can check out her website here.\nConner Fawcett\nConner is a illustrator/artist currently living in the north-west reaches of America.  He once slept in a small cave, at the end of a narrow glacier valley along side several small bats. The bats didn\u2019t seem to mind. You can keep up to date on their work on Twitter and Instagram.\nLauren Henderson\nLauren is an artist/illustrator living in New England dabbling in various kinds of work including pre-production/concept art, tabletop  game art, private commission and personal projects, but her work almost always includes animals or green environments.

These will probably be available on Backerkit instead of through tiers, but we'll keep you posted!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWanderhome is completely finished, and no additional content needs to be created. However, I can imagine hiccups in production, manufacturing, and distribution. While this is Possum Creek Games' fourth project with Kickstarter, it is on a scale we haven't previously worked with, and there might be issues ensuring a speedy timeline with the many artists. While we've spent the past several months preparing for the larger scale of Wanderhome, we still admit there might be logistical complexities.\n\nAdditionally, we live on a precipice right now. The world is in the midst of a series of enormous crises, and the United States that Wanderhome will be distributed in might be very different than the United States of the summer. Our timeline has already been prepared with the acknowledgement that COVID, the rise of the far right, fallout from the American 2020 election, or goodness knows what else might meaningfully and dangerously impact the project. We will keep you informed and be very upfront throughout the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nBoth the softcover and hardcover editions of Wanderhome are printed using eco-friendly inks and papers.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Kith And Kin", "descp": "Even just $1 can help make Wanderhome a reality.

Download by clicking the image below...\n Optional Extras are additional purchases that you can add to your pledge. If you would like an Optional Extra, simply increase your pledge amount by the cost of the chosen Optional Extra. After the Kickstarter has finished, the extra funds will be added to the pledge manager where you can select your chosen items.\nCreated by Mantic Games, the board game publisher behind Hellboy: The Board Game, and the team at Red Scar Publishing, Hellboy: The Roleplaying Game is a totally new way to experience the inspirational work of Mike Mignola.\nIn this standalone game, you become a member of the B.P.R.D. and build your character from the ground up. Will you be a researcher skilled in the study of the occult, a hard-nosed B.P.R.D. security agent, a rookie with hidden supernatural powers and more\u2026 the choice is yours.\nBased on the hugely popular 5th Edition, we\u2019ve made sure that Hellboy: The Roleplaying Game truly captures the experience of the graphic novels. We\u2019ve added new mechanics \u2013 such as Doom and Ingenuity \u2013 along with unique classes and feats that drive the agents of the B.P.R.D. in their mission to wipe out supernatural threats.\nWhen creating your agent, you\u2019ll have a range of skills to choose from. Will you specialise in science, technology, investigations, or become an expert in the study of the occult? Making the most of your special skills will be key in piecing together the clues and completing the case.\nAs you create your unique agent, you must first choose their origin, including:\n Remarkable human \u2013 The Bureau attracts skilled people from around the world with a range of training that will be vital in the field.\n Psychic \u2013 Some individuals have supernatural powers that defy explanation.\n Ghosts \u2013 Bound to the mortal realm, these agents can interact with the physical world and use their ectoplasmic powers to turn the tide.\n The Cursed - From the undying, to the demonic (horns are optional), the vampiric, and the favoured servants of supernatural entities, the cursed have unique boons\u2026but also banes.\n The Fae - Ranging from those who have gained the unseen kingdom\u2019s favour, such as Alice Monaghan, or the replaced individuals who remain supplanted by the shapeshifters and servants of the Fae, they have insight to illusions and old magics and tales.\nWith your origin and role chosen, you will also be able to fully customise your agent using a selection of unique feats. Ranging from combat to supernatural and even B.P.R.D. specific, the variety of feats on offer will allow you to add truly distinct characteristics and flavour.\nOf course, you\u2019ll be heading into the field, so make you sure you prepare adequately. The equipment chapter offers a wide range of tools to aid an agent\u2019s investigation. There is also a unique requisition and inventory system to make your gear selection run smooth and simply.\nCan't make it to your RPG session? Don't worry, with the Backup Agents system you can still be involved with the game. Just like the board game, Backup Agents can be called in when things are getting tough to help the team. \nAs well as a new agent, fresh to the B.P.R.D. there is also the option to play as legendary characters, like Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Johann Kraus and, of course, Hellboy himself! These are all pre-generated characters and are a great place for newcomers to start, especially if they\u2019ve never experienced an RPG but want the thrill of punching a frog monster with the Right Hand of Doom.\nAs the GM, you\u2019ll be able to create smaller case files or an entire chronicle, packed with twists and turns. Tell your own adventures set within the inspirational Mignola-verse and use your favourite Hellboy: The Boardgame miniatures of iconic villains to represent the monstrous challenges you must face, like the insidious frog monsters or Rasputin himself. \nDuring play, the GM and players will be able to add to the narrative through the innovative Doom and Ingenuity system. Doom is generated when players fail certain tests and gives the GM a pool of resources they can spend to advance the Grand Conspiracy or provide a narrative twist. Meanwhile, Ingenuity shines when agents pass a test with a stroke of brilliance. Ingenuity has a range of uses to help players solve the mission.\nJust like the boardgame, you\u2019ll have all you need to begin your adventures in the world of Hellboy and the B.P.R.D. The 240-page book contains all the rules you\u2019ll need for learning 5th Edition, along with detailed instructions on creating your character and an epic Case File to play through. Check out the chapter breakdown below to see what\u2019s inside. \nGet a taste for the game with the quick start, which includes an example scenario and pre-generated characters ready to hit the tabletop. The quickstart is a great taste of the full Hellboy: The Roleplaying Game experience and, although it doesn't contain all the unique and special rules that make the RPG so engaging, it provides a fantastic starting point.\n Here you can find what will be inside the full version of the game.\n Join Mantic, Needy Cat Games and Red Scar in our play through of the scenario from the quickstart.

With this project, the writing is almost finished but will need final sign off from Dark Horse Comics and Mike Mignola. Once signed off, it will them be laid out and that will also need to be signed off. We have worked with Dark Horse and Mike Mignola on Hellboy: The Board Game, so don't anticipate this being an issue. The dice need to be tooled and then manufactured, the miniatures are already tooled and will just need to be manufactured. \n\nWe predict that we will begin shipping in May 2021 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes. \n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 18 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War, DreadBall Second Edition, Star Saga: The Eiras Contract, Warpath, TerrainCrate, Kings of War: Vanguard, Hellboy: The Board Game and TerrainCrate 2. We currently have just one outstanding Kickstarter: League of Infamy (due to ship in November and currently in production). \n\nREFUNDS\nUpon request full refunds may be given within 14 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

We also cannot ship to PO boxes and you must provide an alternative shipping in this circumstance. There is a risk that shipping may increase if any new tariffs or taxes are imposed for certain countries.\n\nAlthough we are aiming to deliver Hellboy: The Roleplaying Game to Kickstarter backers before the game is available at retail, production and shipping delays can lead to delivery at the same time or following the retail release.

There\u2019s no license you can obtain or standard path for you to follow. The business of comics is chaotic and complex and can riddle you with questions like:\nHow much money do I need to publish my comic?\n  How much money should I charge for my comic?\n  Does social media matter?\n  How can I work with comic shops to market the comics?\n  How do I select a printer for your books?\n  THE BUSINESS OF INDEPENDENT COMIC BOOK PUBLISHING answers these questions and more. Organized in three easy-to-read parts (pre-production; production; and post-production) with chapters devoted to topics including intellectual property management; production; distribution; sales and advertising; marketing; and everything in between.\nTHE BUSINESS OF INDEPENDENT COMIC BOOK PUBLISHING explains the business and legal concepts of the comics industry so you can maximize your creativity. By minimizing doubt and frustration around the business end of things, you can get back to the thing you love: publishing and creating comics!\nGamal Hennesey\nComic book attorney and business consultant Gamal Hennessy taps into more than 2 decades of experience to break down the complex comics business into layman\u2019s terms. When he\u2019s not practicing law, Hennesey writes novels and provides both practical business advice and inspiration.  THE BUSINESS OF INDEPENDENT COMIC BOOK PUBLISHING is edited by Aftershock editor-in chief Mike Marts, and features a foreword from writer and Heavy Metal executive editor Joseph P Illidge. It\u2019s a book by pros, for pros and aspiring creators alike. If you\u2019re serious about a career in comics, this book is an essential read.

That\u2019s just a few words that described my experience with Gamal and his services. I felt very positive with the work he did and when the need comes about, I would go to him in a heartbeat.\u201d\u2014 Tim Smith, acclaimed artist for Black, Marvel, DC and Archie Comics\n\u201cGamal has provided me with excellent advice on potential publishing contracts on several occasions, and he steered me away from some deals that just weren\u2019t right for my own goals. As a result, I was able to place my creator-owned properties in better situations. I highly recommend Gamal for any comics creator facing the legalese of a publisher contract.\u201d\u2014 Rob Anderson, Writer of Creature Cops, Rex the Zombie Killer and My Little Pony\n\u201cDeadline oriented expert. Innovative, strong and detail oriented professional. He is not only a responsible and hard working General Counsel but also an inspiring professional. I have had the pleasure of working with Gamal since we both left CPM and I have seen him turn his passion into his profession. It's amazing to work with such a person.\u201d\u2014Sara Erickson, Creative Director Design & Development, Hasbro\n\u201cGamal was the first attorney who bothered to explain my contracts to me. He wasn\u2019t just interested in tweaking language, he wanted to increase my understanding of contracts going forward.\u201d\u2014 Andy Schmidt, President of Comics Experience\n\u201cGamal is very knowledgeable about IP and Entertainment law and very professional, but that\u2019s just the minimum. He went above and beyond the call and he took the time to make sure I felt listened to and not only that I understood things, but that I felt understood as well. I have already recommended several people to talk to Mr. Hennessy and I hope to work with him for years to come!\u201d\u2014Ian Powers, President of Dragon's Gate Entertainment, Ltd.\n\u201cI went to Gamal to help me a create work for hire contract and to give me a legal analysis to protect my work. He was incredibly helpful and explained things thoroughly in my consultation. He was also reasonably priced in comparison to many others that I\u2019d inquired after which was a huge help for a small business owner.\u201d\u2014Jack Wallace, President of Disposable Fiction Inc.\n\u201cI hired Gamal to help me put together a boilerplate contract for use as a freelance writer, so I would have clear terms to hold clients to. Gamal directed the conversation, asked me the right questions about what was important to me, and helped me put together a contract that has since served me well (and that I haven't once had to enforce). He was quick, responsive, and far more affordable than just about any other lawyer you're likely to find.

It was named one of the Top Ten Books of 2001 by LA Weekly, has been used as a primary text at leading game design programs, made the annual Editor\u2019s Choice list on Amazon.com, was nominated for an IPPY Award, and fueled the retrogaming renaissance that has since steamrolled mainstream culture. \nSupercade also triggered a new wave of classic game books and theory that transformed the perception of videogames from kids' toys into a medium finally taken seriously as an art form, with several games profiled now in the permanent collection of MoMA. \nAfter its release, I was asked by readers and retro game fans when I\u2019d do a sequel. I honestly never thought it was important... until now.\nIn the years since Supercade was first published, the next generation of gamers have come of age. They were raised in the aftermath of the crash, the grand arcade palaces of the early 80s replaced by battered Neo Geo cabinets in laundromats and the few remaining game parlors begging for play. These are the children of the Nintendo Entertainment System \u2014 the home console that saved the US game industry after Atari effectively destroyed it \u2014 who grew up on DuckTales, New Coke, and America Online.\nOver the past two decades they\u2019ve expressed an intense passion for the games of their youth \u2014 Street Fighter, Space Harrier, and Super Mario \u2014 which are now equally, if not even more relevant than the games of the golden age. So to celebrate them I propose... \nThe new volume will chronicle the next era of gaming history, beginning with the NES and including the release of Sega Master System, SNES, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, Amiga, Game Boy, Atari Jaguar, N64, PlayStation, Xbox and more, as well as the companies, creators, and technologies that drove us into the digital future.\nImage courtesy Nintendo of America Inc.\nI\u2019d been negotiating with the previous publisher for years to do the sequel, though we were sadly unable to agree upon terms. Fortunately, I retained the rights and am free to publish the book myself... but I'll need your help.\nSupercade was an expensive book to print and I don't want to compromise on quality. The next volume needs to be even BETTER than the original.\nI'll be establishing a new publishing imprint to release Supercade v.2 and hopefully more books in the future with a focus on games and dedication to awesome design... if this campaign is successful there will be more to come, including a series of visual histories of iconic game developers and franchises. \nCover image will be revealed to Kickstarter backers after launch\nI wanted to launch the new book on Kickstarter not only to help offset the costs, but also to build awareness and allow the gaming community to be a part of the process this time. There were some serious omissions in the first book (ahem, Quantum) that may have been avoided if more eyes were on the content. Your feedback will be critical to the evolution of the book and the greater the participation, the greater the next volume of Supercade will be.\nPlease help make this book a reality! \n\nOverview\nThe next volume of Supercade will chronicle the period from 1985-2001 and will be even more comprehensive than the first with over 450 full-color pages. I'll work closely with backers and contributors to ensure everyone's favorite games and systems are included. The book will be similar in style and format to the original, though with more radical 90s flair, so the two volumes will make a matched set.\nPlanning to ship the books in Fall 2021 to coincide with the 20th Anniversary of the original Supercade, which was released in September 2001.\n\nP R I N T I N G\nI've partnered with one of the premier art book printers in Europe to ensure that this volume will be of even higher quality than the original... from the design to the printing, no expense will be spared in the production.\nHere are the specs:\n10\" (25.4 cm) square\n450+ pages\n4C process throughout\nPremium coated paper\nMatte cover lamination\nPerfect binding\n4 lbs (2 kg)\nFeaturing premium paper stock with stretch goal upgrades including metallic foil, gloss varnish, PMS spot colors, and gatefold inserts, this volume will level up in every conceivable way.\nFor the text we've selected 135gsm GardaMatt Smooth, a woodfree coated paper with an ultra smooth surface and exceptional whiteness that's acid-free, dramatically reducing the likelihood of age-related damage.\nThe first volume of Supercade contained some unfortunate printing errors which may have been prevented if I\u2019d been permitted to go on press. Be assured that I will be there at every step of the process to ensure there are no missing pages (seriously, that really happened... look closely at \"1979\") or other production issues.\nI\u2019ll be on site this time, laptop in hand, to correct problems as they arise.\nThe only real criticism of the first book was inconsistent image quality, the result of receiving low res jpegs at the last minute for some features and not having enough time or resources to source better scans. For this volume I've planned a longer schedule, will recruit a photo editor to help wrangle art assets, and will take extra care to make sure all images are of the highest fidelity for optimum print quality.  \nWe will be printing an open Softcover Edition, total run to be determined by backer support (minimum initial run of 1000 copies), plus an EXCLUSIVE limited Hardcover Edition for campaign backers with premium end papers and Smyth-sewn binding. Rare hardcover copies of the original Supercade sell for over $250 online.\nHardcover Edition will not be sold on Amazon!\n\nF U N D I N G\nOne of the biggest struggles with the first volume of Supercade was not having an adequate production budget... I made up some of the difference personally, but still lacked the resources or support required to produce the book I had envisioned. I\u2019d designed the original Supercade with spot colors and gatefold inserts that were omitted from the final product. This is one of the reasons I chose to self-publish and launch the sequel on Kickstarter.\nI wanted the next volume of Supercade to not only meet, but EXCEED expectations.\nThe initial funding goal is set at the dead minimum required to produce the lowest print run of books and rewards with fulfillment, taxes, and Kickstarter fees (8-10%) added. It includes no compensation for my time or additional costs. That said, the more this project surpasses that goal the more awesome it will be... stretch goals will allow me to expand the scope, upgrade the specs, and increase the print run.\nMost important, funds raised beyond the production requirements of the press will go toward the stewardship of the Supercade Collection, supporting the preservation and restoration of rare games and allowing me to produce more public exhibitions.\n\nS T R E T C H   G O A L S\nI'm including several stretch goals that will unlock additional print upgrades to make the book so much cooler than the original...\n Gloss UV varnish (throughout) @ $40K - UNLOCKED!\n PMS fifth color (one signature) @ $45K - UNLOCKED!\n 4-page \"Timeline\" gatefold (update) @ $50K - UNLOCKED!\n PMS fifth color (two signatures) @ $55K - UNLOCKED!\n Metallic foil stamping (hardcover) @ $60K - UNLOCKED!\n PMS fifth color (three signatures) @ $65K - UNLOCKED! \n 4-page \"Super Mario\" gatefold @ $70K - UNLOCKED!\n PMS fifth color (four signatures) @ $75K - UNLOCKED!\n Enhanced dust jacket (printed 4/4 with spot UV) @ $80K - UNLOCKED!\n PMS fifth color (five signatures) @ $85K - UNLOCKED! \n 4-page \"Tomorrow\" gatefold (Akihabara) @ $90K - UNLOCKED! \n PMS fifth color (throughout) @ $95K - UNLOCKED!\nWhat's most exciting... the campaign has surpassed $100K so I will now be able to publish the 20th Anniversary Collector\u2019s Edition (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727\nThis limited edition will include BOTH volumes of Supercade \u2014 an exclusive Anniversary Edition of Supercade v.2 with an exclusive Anniversary Edition of the original Supercade  \u2014 presented in a custom slipcase with foil-embossing, spot UV, embellished dust jackets, and all sorts of awesome.\nUltimate Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nCollector's Edition reward tiers will be added June 23rd @ 12pm PT and will include some incredible new pledge perks!\n\nContributors\nAs with the original Supercade, I'll ask leading academics, influencers, and journalists to write about their favorite games and systems... some familiar names will return and new friends will be invited. So far I have recruited \"Art of Atari\" author Tim Lapetino, Edge magazine contributing editor Chris Schilling, \"I Am Error\" author Nathan Altice, Kotaku co-founder Brian Crecente, \"Play Anything\" author and game designer Ian Bogost, \"The Art of Video Games\" author and curator Chris Melissinos, Funomena founder Robin Hunicke, Arcade Tokyo's Roland Ingram, \"Power-Up\" author Chris Kohler, Boss Fight Books founder Gabe Dunham, Starlords developer Mike Mika, former Kill Screen editor Chris Priestman, Boing Boing co-creator Mark Frauenfelder, and YACHT frontwoman Claire L. Evans, among others.\nThis time I also plan to reach out to more modern game developers to discuss the games that most influenced them, as well as some celebrities with a profound love of games. These features will be presented as sidebar interviews or included as part of the Epilogue. So far I have commitments from Tim Schafer (Br\u00fctal Legend), Tomonobu Itagaki (Dead or Alive), Eugene Jarvis (NARC), Masaya Matsuura (PaRappa the Rapper), John Romero (Doom), Warren Spector (Deus Ex), and Invader.\nThat's just a start.\nIt was devastating to lose contributor Ralph Baer, creator of the Magnavox Odyssey and author of the Foreword to the original Supercade, who passed away in 2014. I was so fortunate to spend time with him, poring through his archives and hearing his amazing stories first hand.\nAlthough it would seem an impossible task to find someone worthy to follow, I'm thrilled to share that the Foreword to the next volume will be written by Xbox creator Seamus Blackley... the omega to his alpha.\nContent\nPicking up where the original Supercade left off, the sequel will cover the years 1985 through 2001, with a focus on the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, SNES, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, Game Boy, 3DO, Amiga, Atari Jaguar, the launch of Sony\u2019s PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Virtual Boy, N64, sixth gen consoles, the rise of PC and online gaming, 90s arcades, and so much more. \nImage courtesy Sony\nThis volume will explore the profound shift that occurred during this era as home consoles met and rapidly surpassed the technical ability of arcade games to become the dominant force in interactive entertainment.\nIt will be similar in style and design to the original Supercade, loaded with full-bleed spreads of game imagery, profiles of developers and publishers, interviews with game designers, and essays on the most significant games and systems of the era, as well as obscure games that were critically and historically influential.\nEach year will highlight the companies, home consoles, franchises, computers, arcade games, technology, media, and cultural events that defined that moment in time.\nHere\u2019s the rough outline...\n\n1985\nNintendo Entertainment System\nSuper Mario Bros.\nAmiga\nAtari ST\nCommodore 128\nRare\nThe Oregon Trail\nUltima IV\nWhere in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\nJAMMA\nCommando\nEmpire Strikes Back\nGauntlet\nGhosts 'N Goblins\nGradius\nHang-On\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\nPaperboy\nRoad Blaster\nRoad Runner\nSky Kid\nSpace Harrier\nTime Gal\nVertigo\nYie Ar Kung Fu\n\n1986\nAtari 7800\nSega Master System\nDragon Quest\nThe Legend of Zelda\nMetroid\nStadium Events\nBethesda\nUbisoft\nApple IIGS\nPortal\n720 Degrees\nAlex Kidd\nAlien Syndrome\nArkanoid\nBig Event Golf\nBubble Bobble\nIkari Warriors\nOutRun\nPlaychoice\nRBI Baseball\nSuper Sprint\nRampage\nVs.

Due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different countries may receive their rewards sooner than others. Some countries may also not be deliverable owing to Covid-19 shipping restrictions. I'll be working with an experienced fulfillment provider with warehouses in the USA and UK to minimize delays as much as possible. \n\nPlease be sure to check in throughout the campaign for updates to this page. I will diligently communicate any and all issues to backers as quickly as possible and will do everything I can to stay on schedule and have books delivered in time for the holidays.\n\nThank you so

You are racing down the streets, desperate to escape into the safety of the countryside. If your cart is the first out of town you and your cart-mates win! Or do you? Some villagers on your cart may secretly already have the plague. If you leave town with a plagued villager on your cart, you will catch the plague and lose! What will you do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? And who will you trust (or betray) along the way? \nBristol 1350 is a social deduction and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes.\n Thank you to all of our backers for an incredible campaign!\nIf you missed the campaign you can make a late pledge here until fall 2020.\nBackers can view project updates for information about delivery and add-ons.\nPlease visit our website or Facebook for the latest information on Bristol 1350.\nWe are excited to offer a Deluxe edition of the game! Depending on later demand, this Deluxe edition may be exclusive to Kickstarter, and at most it will be in rare distribution or only available at conventions. Beyond the core Standard edition of the game (+9 extra Kickstarter characters + stretch goals) the Deluxe edition includes: \nThe 6 Deluxe coins to scale.\nEvery Kickstarter backer of Bristol 1350 (Standard or Deluxe) will receive 9 extra character cards in a special foil pack to add to their core copy of the game (for 18 total characters!) These characters will not be available after Kickstarter and are our way of saying thank you. We will reveal a new character every few days in the section below!    \n\n\nWe have upgraded every single component in the game with the space available in the box. Each upgrade represents our dedication to making high-quality and high-performing games at an affordable price. While we hope to include most of the upgrades listed above in future editions, they are only guaranteed for this first Kickstarter Standard and Deluxe printing of the game.   \nThe level of textural detail on the book, front and back, is kind of mouthwatering.\nBristol 1350 is a social deduction (lying & backstabbing) and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes. The game is enjoyable at all player counts, with lower counts leaning towards strategy and higher counts leaning towards social deduction, lying, and trust.\nIn the game each player begins in one of the three carts behind the starting line. Your goal is to be on the first cart to escape from the town. However, if anyone on your cart has the plague when you finish, everyone on that cart dies of the plague! Play continues until an all-healthy cart crosses or until everyone has the plague.   \nYou can view the full rules and print and play at this link. Note that the rulebook design is still underway, and if you want to play the print and play you'll need to construct your own dice and carts.\nYou can play for free online with Tabletop Simulator or with Tabletopia. \nAs they become available, translations of the rulebook will be available on our website. We currently have translations available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Greek. \nSome of the intriguing mechanics are discussed by The Board Game Critic in this video. \nA full playthrough of a 5-player game can be seen at this link. \nA full playthrough of a 1-player game can be seen at this link. \nBristol 1350 is Volume 4 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. Each game accommodates at least 2-9 players. \nGames in the Dark Cities Series have already sold over 150,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 5, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! Each of these games is available in certain reward levels and as add-ons.\nYou can add an unlimited number of copies of any games in the Dark Cities Series to your pledge! Just add the amounts listed above and after the campaign you'll select which extra games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section, post a comment, or shoot us a message. \nYour shipping cost does not increase for add-ons regardless of your location or the amount of extra games you order. You will receive all add-on games at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery April 2021).  \nThe 18 original character paintings by Sarah Keele are available to purchase! The paintings are 8 x 10 inches and made with mixed media acrylic on masonite board. You can see some of the intricate details below. Email sarahmkeele@gmail.com for more details or to check availability of a specific character.    \nThough this is not an add-on you can get through the campaign, the people at Next Level Board Gaming are selling 3D-printer files so that you can create an EPIC 3D version of the Bristol 1350 board that you can use with your copy of the game. You can see more details by clicking the picture below.\nRegardless of order size or add-ons, shipping costs are $6 USA, $8 UK/EU, $10 Australia/Canada, $12 for the rest of the world. We work hard to find the best shipping rates out there, and we subsidize some of the shipping costs so that you don't have to pay as much. \nTo avoid extra VAT or customs fees, games will ship to depots around the world (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) before being shipped to you. For non-depot countries, in most cases there will not be extra VAT costs because the price of our games is low enough to avoid the duties threshold.\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. Due to unreliable mail systems, we will not perform reshipments destined for Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, or South Africa. \nThese days there are many projects that wait to charge shipping until AFTER the campaign ends in order to shift the risk from the creators to the backers. We have \"done our homework\" in regards to shipping costs and are prepared to take on unexpected risk. What you pay now for shipping is ALL that you will pay for this reward.\nDISCOUNTED PRICE | Normal MSRP of the Standard Edition will be $25. If we release the Deluxe Edition to the public it will be at least $45. We also offer the best shipping prices we can during the Kickstarter campaign.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE CARDS | The 9 Kickstarter Exclusive character cards (for a total of 18 characters in your game) will never be available again and will be unavailable to the public. Additionally, campaign stretch goals, as well as the Deluxe version, are only guaranteed through Kickstarter.\nEARLY ACCESS | Receive and play the game before anyone else in the world. \nJOIN OUR TEAM | Get first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We will take your feedback into account before launching production.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem, back in 2015. Those backers are the ones that allowed us to quit our day jobs and make games full time. We've had more great experiences with the launch of Tortuga 1667 and Deadwood 1876. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community is incredible. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.\nOur thoughts are with those around the world suffering from Covid-19. We have been planning and preparing for this launch for over two years, but it has coincidentally lined up with the pandemic that our world now faces. We considered delaying the project but after a lot of thought and encouragement from our community we ultimately decided to launch. As with all our games, part of this game's purpose is to educate about the history of the world. Bristol 1350 explores the history of the worst pandemic our world has ever faced: the Black Death. The people of 1350 faced huge challenges, and today those challenges are perhaps more relatable than ever. We will be donating $3,000 from our own pockets to Action Against Hunger to assist in getting food and medicine for those most in need. (Per Kickstarter regulations, funds raised within Kickstarter will not be directly donated and have no effect on the donation amount).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th project, and our first 3 have been delivered on time and as promised. Our factory is at full capacity and our shipping partners are optimistic that by next year when this is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues in regards to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated on any unforeseen issues that may arise. As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! \n\nSalem 1692: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kickstarter. Thank you again!\" -Bored Gamer\n\nDeadwood 1876: \"Thank you again for such a wonderful campaign and game! All your games are creative, refreshing, and each have unique mechanics that keep the fun going for hours. The historical component too makes for an added boon. Thank you also for a unique genuineness you bring to your customer experience. It is a prize how you answer each customer individually and how you care about the quality of your interactions as much as you care about the quality of your product and gameplay. I\u2019m excited for the fourth city and experience!\" -Steph Troyer\n\nAfter the campaign we will use a pledge manager system called CrowdOx to send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey up until a few weeks before we ship.

Despite all these differences, these survivors will have to cooperate if they want to survive the cold, hunger and hostile threats, but they will also have to unveil the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of the colony founded by their lost King to be worthy of the Saga that will retain their name.\nHEL: The Last Saga is a highly narrative campaign game, with paragraphs to read according to what the players accomplish. The game mechanisms mix exploration, tactical combat with resource management. Storytelling and background are ubiquitous and replayability comes from the unique way you have to replay a failed mission.\nClick on the image to know more about the HEL-in\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\n\n\n NARRATIVE ALL THE WAY\nTell. Listen. Choose or test. Everywhere. Anytime. The game engine is based on the discovery or the triggering of events that lead to narrative chapters. These events can be hidden on the game board, placed on the turn track or on any other game component. The story  unfolds as you resolve these chapters by making choices, performing tests or simply listening.\nUNIQUE HEROES\nPlay strong characters. Each Clan member has their own story, strengths and weaknesses. You will learn about them as you play them, by acquiring new individual Hero cards in a non linear way. Some of these cards will be the result of choices you made during the adventure.\nSCENARIO BASED \nConquer a mysterious land, found a colony and resolve mysteries. Scouting missions, search or rescue parties, raids, escape, defence, investigation, or intrigue. Whether it's located on the modular and expandable wilderness game board or in the colony camp, each scenario provides a new challenge to overcome in order to gain access to the next scenario.\nPREDATORS & PREY \nFace hidden threats, which are controlled by a predation-based AI system. Use your perception and your pets to detect these threats before you face them, as an ambush can be fatal. Your enemies are vicious enough to target the most vulnerable or the highest ranking members of your group.\nWORSHIP SYSTEM\nBeg your gods to help you. Use your willpower, offerings, and the fervour of your companions to obtain permanent modifiers that will benefit all who share your faith.\nSURVIVAL... \nExploit scarce resources to survive and keep your clan together. Hunt for food. Collect that precious wood that will be a source of heat and an essential material for your constructions. But above all, maintain high morale to avoid sinking into defeat.\n...HORROR\nNight will eventually fall. For months. Second half of the campaign will take place into darkness. But only for Heroes who survive long enough to see the sunset. Forget every little knowledge or petty victory acquired. New rules. New threats. New objectives.\n\nThe USA, European Union, Canada, Australia, and UK will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe above is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns and an estimated final weight of the Core pledge at 5kg. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGeneral\n\nThis is our ninth Kickstarter and we\u2019ve learned a lot from our previous eight. Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is being printed and ongoing for a delivery by the summer, Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves this year. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest development is finished and is going to production now and Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production this summer.\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates at least once a week, plus our posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our videos on YouTube.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is June 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

When the last of the magic orbs that once powered their city is depleted, she faces her fears and embarks on an unexpected journey into the heart of the jungle to save her home.\nAlong the way, Naiya discovers her own self-worth as she and her foxdragon friend navigate the treacherous jungle and learn about her own relationship with the world\u2019s magic.\nAru (left) & Naiya (right)\n Naiya - An independent young teen of 14 years, Naiya loves to spend her time outside. She finds freedom in climbing rooftops and hidden passageways on her errands within the city as a house servant to a spice merchant. Always curious about the greater world, she enjoys learning through books. Naiya has a soft spot for animals, caring for those she finds abandoned in the city.\nAru - A young foxdragon brought to the trade city of Ora, Aru has no recollection of his past. His curiosity and fondness for food can, at times, get him into a bit of trouble. Aru is a loyal friend & companion. \n While Naiya and Aru's story can stand on words alone, the illustrations throughout the book add glimpses into their world for a more immersive experience.\nEach chapter begins with a unique full-page textile pattern, and the following spreads contain a variety of vignette, half and full-page spread illustrations to complement the text.\nThe book is a standard comic book size at 6.625 x 10.5 inches, chosen for comfortable chapter reading as well as an immersion into imagery that flows from page to page. \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\" is 282 pages long, 24 chapters and 78,000 words.\n\nThe outlining stage of \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\", my studio space and a thumbnail sheet of all the pages + illustrations in the book.\nAbout Naomi VanDoren: I am a visual artist and author based in Northern California. For the past six years, I have been working independently as an artist on creator-owned projects like my yearly art books, which I have Kickstarted in the past.\nIn my storytelling, I strive to capture the adventures of my youth in the jungles of Indonesia and pay homage to the beautiful culture in which I spent over 14 years. \"Naiya and the Foxdragon,\" and the tropical world of Antarah in which it takes place, was born out of a desire to fully dive into storytelling and create an immersive world using inspiration from where I grew up. It also was born from a love of the fantasy genre, epic quests that sweep you off your feet and endearing characters you feel a deep connection with.\nIf you're curious about my writing style I encourage you to check out the first chapter of \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\" which takes place 10 years before the rest of the book, when Naiya is still a young child.\nIf you're a fan of the Ghibli films, Avatar the Last Airbender, and even The Hobbit, I think you'll enjoy this book too.\nWhy an illustrated novel? I've loved reading and writing just as much as I love art. Rather than create a book that was art-focused, or heavily writing focused I decided I wanted a book that celebrated both in a way that allowed a reader to escape deeper into the world that I've created.\n This project is going to print as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends!\nI've spent the last 2+ years working on this project so that I can bring you something that is nearly complete and ready for print. As a Kickstarter backer myself, I appreciate creators that are transparent about the status of their projects. In that spirit, here is what has been done with \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\", what is being wrapped up, timelines for printing etc.\nWriting: All of the writing from outlines through the final draft of the book are complete. I've worked with a professional developmental editor twice to perfect the story, run the project through beta readers and had a copy editor proof the book. The only thing that I plan to do in regards to the text is one final round of quick copy editing (1/2 way through already) for that last look as well as adding any words I find to complete the appendix page.\nIllustrations: All of the illustrations have been designed and are in their final form linework-wise. This involved reference gathering, some 3D designs for some of the locations, character design, and lots of time for the composition and inking process - all of which are now complete. I'm going through the bulk of each illustration and adding the final touches of color to each (1/2 way through this process at this point). I estimate this to take 2 weeks while the campaign is live. Check-in on the status here.\nDesign: The full book has been designed from a rough draft to the final draft. While I have a background in graphic design, this book is being handled by a designer that has publishing experience. The only thing that remains in this stage of the project is to typeset the file and export it for print.\nPrinting: I'm working with a printer currently and finalizing files once the campaign is over. I've received a blank sample copy of the paper that will be used with the book along with the cloth for the Special Edition.\nTimeline after the campaign ends: The timeline for the book production begins after this Kickstarter campaign is complete and I receive the Kickstarter payment from the campaign to make the order (which is usually 2 weeks after it ends, on or around the first week in April). Once I receive it, I am able to move ahead with printing. The estimated time for printing is 3 months from handing files over to the printer in April until books being physically at my door in July. I'm allowing a month for shipping your rewards out with the exception of books with remarque sketches which I have allowed for additional time to complete. I will be preparing shipping materials as well as any additional rewards during the waiting period for the books to arrive.\nShipping: Will be collected after the project is complete and the books are printed and ready to ship in or around June or July. Please see more about shipping in the \"Shipping\" section at the bottom of this project page.\nDoes not include shipping. Click on the image to find out more about changing your pledge amount.\nAll stretch goal goodies are for all backers, any tier!\nShipping for this project will be collected after the project is complete and the books are ready to ship. In order to give you the best price for shipping, I've decided to handle shipping after the campaign and through Backerkit. This allows me to better estimate how much shipping will be with a physical sample book as well as not inflate the Kickstarter funding goal which is for printing.\nHere is a shipping table to help you estimate what shipping may cost. I ship artwork internationally frequently however it is impossible to get exact shipping estimates without a finished sample book in-hand.\n*All original paintings will be shipped insured.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the third Kickstarter that I've run. My previous two were designed similarly with a project that was already complete and both were delivered before their estimated due dates. This project is, however, a much larger project. I've done my best to simplify some aspects of it and thought ahead in regards to printing timeline, shipping, packaging etc. I have added some padding in the fulfillment timeline to be able to stay on target.\n\nWhile there are many things I can plan out ahead of time I realize there are always unforeseen circumstances that may arise in regards to working with such a large order of books that are out of my control.

All games have been created along Italian authors and the illustrators that you have already seen in our previous titles. Each game has its own identity and the boxes are as small as 12x8 cm. You can carry them with you, slide the matchbox and play in just 20 minutes with cards and small bits that will make the whole experience so satisfying!\nNatural phenomena have had an odd behaviour lately, seasons seem to have been disrupted and animals are migrating in the wrong direction. The 24 East Asian traditional solar terms are out of sync. Your seasons must find their alignment so the sun can find its route again and set the order right among all living things.\nIn 15 days, players will take alternating turns. Each turn choose 2 out of 4 possible actions, trying to receive the  animals pawns for special abilities and completing sets of Season cards for the most points at the end of the game.\nMenace is approaching you. There seems to be a way out, but as a Samurai your first move is to reach for your weapons. Your basic instincts to run and hide have dissolved since the only option left is to fight for your honour. You are a rock and will hold tight, fighting the opponents face to face, using your weapons until the the very end.\nEiyo is a fast paced game where you need to strategically manage your weapons to defeat hordes of enemies. You will need to survive the attacks while gaining honour points that will be crucial at the end of the game.\nAfter relentless days spent diluting solvents and heating liquid mixtures in vials, the air is damp, while the old and overused books stored in the library of your laboratory smell of humidity and dust. The end of the day is approaching and you have just found the perfect transmutation. You decide to stay a little longer, but you know the candles will stay on until they consume completely.\nRebis is a 1\u20134 player game. To win, you have to play your alchemistic ingredients wisely in order to brew the best elixirs and find the right time to brew them to get the most points.\nThe multiverse has spoiled you given the vastness of incredible places and creatures to meet and observe. You smell spices from miles away, your pores dilate, your gills tickle and your three stomachs are growling like an echoing symphony. You get to the source of the tasty fumes faster than a ray of light, your taste buds start working as a glowing sign shows up on the horizon: \u201cServing succulent food and spicy, quenching potions during satellite setting hours.\u201d\nSpace Lunch is a 1-2 players, short, set-collection game. To win, you need to grab your preferred dishes before it\u2019s too late by choosing Food cards from the table. However, beware! Your opponent might interfere with your plans.\nThe new surface of Earth is at its most bleak appearance. It may seem completely infertile and arid, but on the horizon promising mountains of mud and clay arise higher and higher. Golems, the magical mutable creatures, are being summoned with synergies among the resources of the earth.\nGolems is a card collection game where you can use every card in two different ways. You have to decide whether you want to boost your Golem for victory points or save the resource to summon further Golems. With the use of Gems and special Runes you will be able to maximize your strategy to become the best Golem summoner.\nWe have always created games that we really enjoy playing and the Matchbox Collection is no exception, but every time we launch a new line of games, it is fundamental for us to understand if our vision resonates with you.\nAfter a year since our last campaign, we are very excited to share a brief moment with you to shape this new creation together; and this is among the most interesting and rewarding moments for us.\nKickstarter and retail are two very different worlds and both of them are extremely important for us, but sometimes you want to create something regardless of the production boundaries, and Kickstarter is the best place to shape the games we dreamt of exactly the way we envisioned them.\nThundergryph exclusive is a new way for us to experiment, understand the product better and find the best way to make it work; and while we are not offering a retail option, it doesn\u2019t mean that this line won\u2019t have a possibility of hitting retail.\nThese games might become a collectible exclusive to this campaign, but they could reach more players in the future as well. For now, this campaign is the best chance we have to offer them to you directly at an honest price and make these games happen.\nWe really appreciate your support and we thank you for being the foundation of our imagination.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs this is our 7th campaign, we feel that it is important for us as creators to share with you what we have learnt throughout all the other campaigns and during 2019.\n\nTIMELINE IS EVERYTHING.\n\nWhile we always set important goals for the year, revising the timeline is something we have been doing for the past 3 years, and it was not a surprise for us that Tang Garden was about to create an important change in our timeline for 2019. \nShaping the games together with our backers is one of the most interesting things of being a Kickstarter creator, but all of this additional content needs to be meticulously calculated before the campaign starts to add enough buffer time to the communicated timeline, while still being unaware of how successful a project will be.\n\nRevising the timeline affects your perception towards us and affects the company stability by postponing future releases.\n\nNEW WORKFLOW AND KICKSTARTER.\n\nWhen you back one of our campaigns, you are not pre-ordering a product, you are really helping us make the game happen. This is a feeling we don\u2019t want to lose, but we also understand that a game needs to be fulfilled at the right pace.\n\nFor the Matchbox Collection, we segmented the potential success of the project into four different outcomes and we have decided to establish the proper buffer based on the best-case scenario. This gives us room to listen to our community without compromising what we love the most about launching on Kickstarter: shaping a game together.\n\n**Please refer to our timeline section on Kickstarter, where we show how we have organized the production and freight for the Matchbox Collection.**\n\nA SETTLED PIPELINE IS MANDATORY.\n\nStarting 2019, we decided to split our team into groups. We would be working at the same time on different projects and we would request help from freelancers if needed, without compromising our main tasks as a team.\n\nToday, we are much more solid as a team, having a greater confidence on facing the challenges that the future holds, and we owe all of this to you and your support towards our projects.\nWe will always be grateful and we will always be prepared to listen and learn from your advice.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "The Matchbox Collection", "descp": "The complete collection of all five Matchbox games and all unlocked stretch goals.\nAfter the campaign, shipping costs will be collected at Backerkit, our pledge manager.

When I was 16, I saw The Little Mermaid in its original run in the theater. I had always been a fan of Disney movies, but for some reason that one struck a chord in me. When I got home that night, all I could think about was that film, particularly the scene of Ariel in her grotto, singing about wanting more. I kept picturing how her hair moved in the water, how beautiful the color and light was, and how much I related to that song. I listened to the soundtrack on repeat and spent hours drawing that character. That movie was what made me want to be an artist.\nIn the past few years, being a Pop Culture artist and attending comic book conventions, I have been thinking a lot about what makes people become a fan of characters and stories from books, movies, games, or music. I have also been thinking about how and why people express themselves as ardent fans. They imagine themselves in these stories by cosplaying, through Disneybounding, by creating fan-art, or in writing fan-fiction. They attend conventions to share and celebrate their passion for these stories with other people. I feel like all of his is a way to bring the magic out of our favorite stories and into our real lives. This was the original inspiration for Celara: a little fangirl.\nSome of my own personal favorite fictional characters are Ariel, Elsa, Tiana, Princess Leia, Anne of Green Gables, Dottie Hinson, Buffy, Wonder Woman and Hermione. These characters resonated with me for many different reasons, but above all, because they were creative, strong-willed and they never quit. I have art on my walls and Funko Pops on my shelves of all of these characters, not just because of how fun they are, but also to inspire me in my own life to go after my dreams and to not give up or give in to self-doubt. This is what inspired my \"She-Series,\" an ongoing collection of portraits that I have been working on for the last few years. \n\nThe Title:\nI was a student at Ringling School of Art Design (now Ringling College) back in the mid-'90\u2019s. I spent two years in the Resident Assistant program, as an alternate and as a full-fledged R.A. I learned a lot from that program and at the end of it, our mentor gave us each a small rock that had words engraved on them. Mine said \u201cNever, Never Quit.\u201d  Twenty-three years later, that rock is still on my desk. It has moved with me to multiple states and multiple homes, and is always right where I can see it as a constant reminder. I thought it would be a great title and message for my first children's book. When I was an elementary school Art teacher, I taught Kindergarten through 5th grade. All of these enthusiastic little six years old would throw themselves into their art, just happy to be creating. But as I watched them get older, they would start to judge themselves because they didn't think their drawings were \"good enough\" and eventually they stopped drawing altogether. \nAt first when I created Celara, it was to show off my love of being a \u201cfangirl.\u2019  But with this book, which is her origin story, I wanted to take that one step further. I wanted to try to encourage children not to quit when things get too hard.  I also wanted to share what inspires me and what keeps me from giving up when pursuing my dreams gets hard. I hope kids will take away from Celara's story that\u2019s it\u2019s OK to like things, to be passionate about things, to celebrate that and get excited about it. It\u2019s OK to be a geek or a fangirl and to showcase that. And when you are chasing your dreams, it is important to believe in yourself and know that everyone experiences doubt, fear, and frustration, but to still take risks and know that it won\u2019t come all at once. Be patient with yourself. Practice, practice, practice, and never, never, EVER quit. \n\nSynopsis\nCelara is a creative little girl with a huge imagination. Her little orange friend is named \"Reverie\". She loves whimsical adventure stories with mazes and strange creatures, music that makes her feel like she is under the water with a mermaid, and movies that take place in magical, far away lands. She loves stories in all forms, be it books, films, games, and songs. She dresses up and acts out scenes from her stories, sings along at the top of her lungs to her favorite songs and loves to draw her favorite characters and hang them around her room. One day, while daydreaming, she has a great idea. What if she created her own stories, her own characters? She sits down to work, only to discover it might not be as easy as it sounds.  She gets frustrated, maybe she\u2019s not good enough? Maybe she can\u2019t do it. It's hard. It\u2019s so scary to create something new, what if no one likes it? But, she discovers that if you practice, if you don\u2019t quit, and you aren\u2019t too hard on yourself, that\u2019s when the magic happens\u2026..\n\nSample two page spreads\nThis book will be aprox. 9 1/4 inches by 9 1/4 inches. At the moment, it is 22 full page spreads, the blue line in down the middle of these pictures is the spine of the book. My goal is to have the book finished and to the printers by the end of June.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much to my friends and  family for all the love and support, and to everyone who has been following my work on social media, coming to my tables at conventions, supporting my Patreon and Etsy store!

The first was for a Celara calendar, and it was a big sucess!\n\nThe biggest risk is if we run into any production delays with our printer that would then delay our shipment of these books to you. We have a great printer who we are confident will do everything they can to finish and deliver these on time, and we have tried to build in some extra time so we can meet our goal. \n\nThe art and writing of the book is well underway and something I have built time into my schedule to complete very soon. I plan to communicate every step of the way about status of this project and be fully transparent about any delays or issues, and how we are addressing them, should they arise. \n\nWe will keep you

It's about wandering through an old city with new eyes, and was inspired by trips to cities such as Venice and Montreal. If you'd like to check it out before backing this zine you can find the plaintext version on my Itch.io page here. \nAlone Among the Twisting Trees is a new game I'm writing for inclusion in this zine! It's about getting lost in a mysterious forest and the strange artifacts that you find inside. It was originally conceived through playstorming with Quinn Vega and Avi Margolis as an adaptation of another game I wrote, Alone on the Rocky Beach (not included in this zine).\nIn addition to these games, there are a ton of other hacks that have been inspired by Alone Among the Stars. If this zine doesn't stick out to you but you're still looking for a cool single-player experience, I'd recommend checking out the rest of these hacks! I've tried to compile all of them in this Itch collection, Alone at the Table. \nI think anyone can make a game, and hacking is a great way to get started. A number of the hacks in the Alone at the Table collection were made by first-time designers, and in order to make hacking the game even easier I'm including a template that you can fill in to make your own hack in the back of the zine, as well as a page or two of useful design tips to get you started. You could even use the journaling pages to start playtesting!\n\"In Alone in the Ancient City, designer Takuma Okada translates the melancholy, No Man\u2019s Sky-esque galaxy-wide wandering of Alone Among the Stars into a more humble joy, one of discovering a city on your own. Ancient City captures the feeling of traveling through a place with a history and weight belonging to others, but wholly unfamiliar to you. Okada eschews the oft-trod territory of metropolitan tourism and spectacle in the pursuit of a more intimate exploration. This game is Urban Pastel at its finest.\" - Caro Asercion, designer of i'm sorry did you say street magic \n\"Are you playing Alone Among the Stars? And following the Twitter account? Get on it. @among_stars_\" - John Harper, designer of Blades in the Dark\nAlone On A Journey: a collection of solo adventuring games is a 28 page zine featuring this amazing cover art by Shannon Kao. It will include these three Alone games in a new layout by Quinn, a blank template of an Alone game with some pointers so you can make your own hack, and blank journaling pages in the back of the book so you can start writing right away. \nthe cover for the zine!\n The zine is 5.5\"x8.5\" and will be printed through Mixam. The cover will be color on 110 lb. paper with a matte finish, and the inside pages will be black and white on 80 lb paper. \nIn the spirit of Zinequest, I've tried to keep the budget low while paying collaborators fairly. The total comes out to $500 given a 50 print run. \n$225 for printing, shipping, and fulfillment: This should cover a 50 zine print run and shipping related costs for a mix of US and International orders. \n$75 for the cover art by Shannon: The art is already paid for and completed, but this covers the amount that I paid out of pocket for it already.\n$150 for layout by Quinn: This is a tentative layout budget for about 20 pages, some blank journaling pages, and a cover.\n$50 for fees: This is to cover Kickstarter fees!\nAs you may have noticed, I haven't really budgeted for paying myself. This is partially because I've already made some money off these games selling them on Itch.io, but it's also because I really want this project to fund and put it out in the world. If it funds over the goal, the first thing I'll be doing is paying myself and upping the print run to 100 copies. Beyond that I've been throwing around some ideas for stretch goals but haven't settled on anything yet, and I don't really want to assume a huge overshoot given the nature of Zinequest. If it looks like we will though, I may announce some extra goals on this page. \nHi! My name's Takuma Okada, and I'm a Japanese American writer, musician, and game designer. I started making games almost two years ago now, and I'm really excited to finally have the chance to make one of my first games into a physical zine! Some of my other games include Stewpot: Tales From a Fantasy Tavern, Chess: Two Kingdoms, and Etude of the Evening. I love beautiful places and strange objects and try to make them easy to find in my games.\nQuinn Vega is a queer game designer, graphic designer, and musician based out of Portland, OR. Her games include For The Honor, Lightning Kissed, and cowriting Songs for the Dusk with Kavita Poduri. When she is not making or playing games she works making microphones and leading her band, The Variants. You can find her on twitter @Mx_quinn and her work at mxquinn.itch.io.\nShannon Kao is an artist from Seattle who works in comics and illustration. She's interested in stories about how places\u2014real & imagined\u2014shape the people in them.

However, I've been a stretch goal contributor for several now and have experience meeting those kinds of deadlines.

The result is a fantasy collection where you create the story.\nThe collection has been professionally photographed to showcase Jeff\u2019s textures and paint strokes to give viewers the intimate feeling that they are holding the actual sketchbook.

Jeffrey Alan Love is just plain brilliant.\" \u2014 Mike Mignola\nNotes From the Shadowed City is the travelogue of a young man  who sets off on a journey to research magical swords. He finds himself  stranded in a land he does not know and enters a city with no name over  which looms an ominous floating citadel. As he seeks a way home, he  fills his notebook with drawings and observations of his life in this  strange place. It is full of masked swordsmen, cities that walk, ancient  gods, swords made from petrified trees and dragons that move mountains.  There\u2019s also a mysterious woman who captures his heart.\n\u201cThe Thousand Demon Tree is incredible. What Jeffrey Alan Love has done with this book is to firmly cement himself as one of the most important artists making ominous and fantastical narrative work today.

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having an 18 year record of delivering nearly 100 books of the highest quality. I've run over ten previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Jeffrey Alan Love, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published nearly 100 books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before.

The Green New Deal. The scientists of the IPCC demanding that the world take the urgency of the 1.5\u00baC target seriously. Greta Thunberg\u2019s school strikes for climate. The acceleration of clean energy technologies. The growing divestment movement. U.S. presidential candidates embracing the need for action. A resurgence of climate journalism. Even the survival of the Paris Agreement, despite Donald Trump\u2019s bluster and threats. More people than ever before are serious about winning the fight to stop our climate emergency from becoming a full-blown catastrophe.\n\n For those of us who\u2019ve been in this fight a while, these are thrilling days.\n\n These are also terrifying times, though. Most of us know that despite our growing momentum, we\u2019re still losing the fight. Fossil fuel companies and other dirty industries are still using their political clout, propaganda of denial and predatory delay to slow progress and block the bold actions we need.\n\n And we know what losing means: Rising seas. Burning forests. Rivers running dry. Ferocious Storms. Wars and collapses. Trillions of dollars in damage, year after year. Hundreds of millions of people on the move, looking for somewhere safe. Losing the climate fight means terrible and tragic losses for our kids and their kids and generations to come. Losing the climate fight might mean losing civilization itself.\n\nThe clock is ticking. Faced with a set of dire problems that get worse every day, winning too slowly becomes basically the same thing as losing outright. Many of us worry we just can\u2019t win fast enough.\n\n You know what? We\u2019re right to worry. Despite all our new momentum, our old strategies are largely failing us.\n\n That\u2019s because our strategies are based on old thinking, and old thinking is dangerous now. We\u2019re going through what futurists call a \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d \u2014 a time when previous experience can\u2019t ready us for what is coming \u2014 precisely at the moment when we\u2019re all being forced to make a bunch of hard, serious choices.\n\n It's not easy to figure this stuff out for yourself. Much of what we read, see, hear and learn about the planetary emergency is out-of-date. When our thinking suddenly catches up to the scope, scale and speed of the problems we face, we often get a sort of mental whiplash. I call this experience \"the snap forward.\"\n\n However, once we see the disruptive new forces emerging around us \u2014 once we snap forward \u2014 the moment we\u2019re in begins to look less like a long losing battle and more like a set of opportunities for breakthrough victories. This short book shows how fresh thinking can help us win the climate fight, and win it fast.\n\n In it, I share the tools to make that leap. I explain the nature of this discontinuity, and unlock the secrets of climate foresight. I unpack why the Carbon Lobby\u2019s apparent power is in fact a front for fragility. I explore the ten core new strategies available to us, right now, for winning fast. Most of all, I give readers the tools to make a bigger difference in their own work, communities and political lives.\n\nThe Snap Forward is the book this moment needs. In fact, I started writing this book two years ago precisely because I saw this moment coming. And I'm rushing to get it out this summer because speed matters now.\n\n I've spent years on the front lines, learning how to see the planetary future and make moves that matter. I've worked as a journalist, NGO leader, futurist and strategic advisor on five continents. This is the most important work I've ever done.\n\nHere's the thing: I need your help bringing it to the world.\n\n I\u2019ve got a manuscript. I need a couple months to polish it \u2014 with the help of my colleague Justus Stewart \u2014 and some financial support to help me hire an editor and designer to get it to publication. Once done, I'll deliver it as an e-book and in print-on-demand hard copy.\n\n Please help launch this important set of ideas into the world. \n\n\n\n\nAbout Me:\n My work explores the future of humanity and the fate of the Earth. I ask how we can better understand the connections between nature and human systems, how we can imagine the powerful solutions we need, and how we might build a sustainable civilization.\n\n I\u2019ve been pushing the boundaries of climate foresight and disruptive sustainability for years, as a writer (Carbon Zero), editor (Worldchanging), and strategic advisor to some of the most forward-thinking groups and businesses in the world.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what others say about my work:\n\n\u201cAlex Steffen\u2026 lays out the blueprint for a successful century.\u201d\n     \u2014The New York Times \n\n\"You really, really should be reading Alex Steffen. Really. He\u2019s telling the story of the future.\u201d\n     \u2014Bill McKibben\n\n \u201cThere are two kinds of futurists. The first explore the variations of what exists and project the future from those tea leaves. The second, and by far the rarer, peer around the curve of time and reimagine the future as much as foresee it. Alex Steffen is the latter!\u201d\n     \u2014Paul Hawken, Project Drawdown\n\n \u201cWhen CEOs want to navigate the world's mega-challenges and prepare for a volatile world, they look to business strategists like me. And when business strategists want to challenge and hone our own thinking about the future, we look to Alex Steffen.\u201d\n     \u2014Andrew Winston, author The Big Pivot and Green to Gold\n\n \"Alex Steffen is an extraordinary visionary.\"\n     \u2014Rebecca Solnit\n\n \u201cAlex Steffen delivers foresight that's powerful even for professional futurists. His ability to envision the underlying structures of change brings clarity, purpose and inspiration out of the fog of future possibilities.\u201d\n     \u2014James Goodman, Director of Futures, Forum for the Future\n\n \u201cAlex Steffen is one of the most insightful futurists on our struggling planet. He brings compelling and wide-ranging ideas about staying relevant and he is alert to new opportunities. He synthesizes what is known, what the new trends are on the horizon\u2014a terrific intellect offering up deep and thoughtful considerations critical to modern leadership success.\u201d\n     \u2014James P.

The most common issues are production delays due to plastic quality, shipping delays due to vessel schedules and weather, and customs clearance when the goods come into America. There is always the potential that one of these things could cause a delay in the delivery of pledges of this campaign to backers. When these types of delays do affect campaigns, we're quick to update backers with the current situation.\n\nFinally, while it's unfortunate, it isn't uncommon for first printing of games, whether they're Kickstarted or not, to have small typos and print errors.

Players can then use these Treasures to perform great Feats such as slaying fearsome giants (or are they windmills?) and dueling their rivals.

Also includes the Knight's Gear cards for players to start with.\nTHE JOURNEY DECK: Contains 54 cards, consisting of the following card types\n22 Encounter cards - Cards that feature situations that players respond to by making up stories with Chivalry cards. \n16 Love cards - Characters from Don Quixote that players may win the favor of by making up poems using Chivalry cards. These characters each grant special effects. \n16 Feat cards - Special cards used to win the game. Drawing one triggers a Feat round, where players compete to overcome a challenge with their strength and win the card. \n1 6-SIDED DIE\n\n1 TURN CARD\nINSTRUCTION BOOKLET\nBox dimensions: 8.2 x 4.7 x 1.4 in\nThe cards feature hand-painted watercolor illustrations by the game's designer. \nBasic summary  \nThe game has 3 decks: Journey, Chivalry, and Treasure. Players hold a hand of 5 Chivalry cards, which each have a phrase from a book of Chivalry on them and sometimes a special effect. Players draw cards from the Journey deck and each card features a thing they need to react to with a story made up of text from their Chivalry cards: this sets the pacing and main action of the game. The Treasure deck contains objects that players can win by telling the best stories to become more powerful.\n\nPlayers choose the length of the game by deciding how many Feat cards, cards that have players compete using their knight\u2019s strength, will be drawn from the Journey deck before the game ends: 3, 5, or 7. The player that has won the most Feat cards after that many Feats have been drawn and resolved (i.e. best of 3, best of 5, etc.) is the winner.   \nGameplay description  \nPlayers each start with 3 Knight\u2019s Gear cards; which represents their starting weapon, steed, and helmet; that may be replaced as they win better equipment. One player draws a card from the Journey deck, which contains people, things, and situations encountered by Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the book. The player who drew the card becomes the judge, and the other players tell stories, which must include phrases from their Chivalry cards, about how they would react to these situations. \n\u201cDo you see over yonder, friend Sancho, thirty or forty hulking giants? I intend to do battle with them and slay them.\u201d\nThe number of Chivalry cards the player must use and the type of story varies based on the type of card drawn from the Journey Deck. If it is an Encounter the player must tell a story that includes text from 1 of their Chivalry cards. The judge chooses the best story and the winner gets to draw from the Treasure Deck. If the card drawn from the Journey deck is a Love card, then each player must recite a love poem to the character on the card that includes text from 3 of their Chivalry cards. The judge, playing the part of character on the card, decides who has won their favor and gives the Love card to the winner, granting them strength and special abilities. In both situations, the judge is compensated by getting to take any Chivalry card they wish from those played by other players.  \nAfter a player has turned over a Journey card and the card is resolved, all players draw or discard Chivalry cards until they have a hand of 5. The turn token is then passed to the player on the left and they may draw a Journey card.  \nFeats  \nThe Journey deck also includes Feat cards, which have a challenge for all of the knights to undertake. Each Feat card includes a difficulty rating. Starting with the player who drew the Feat card, players take turns rolling a die and adding the result to their total strength rating from all of their Treasure and Love cards. If the total is higher than the difficulty of the Feat, then they have made a successful feat attempt. Players may block one another\u2019s feat attempts by playing Chivalry cards from their hand that have special effects useful during this phase of the game.  \n\u201cThou hast seen nothing yet.\u201d\nThe first player to make 2 successful feat attempts wins the Feat and gets to keep the Feat card. The player with the most Feat cards after the agreed number of Feat cards has been drawn from the Journey deck wins the game.\n$15 - Squire\n$25 - Curate (LIMIT OF 50!)\n$30 - Knight Errant\n$35 - Ingenious Gentleperson\n$45 - Scholar\n$50 - Enchanter\n\n$60 - Beacon of Chivalry\n$75 - Governor\n$100 - Knight of Legend\n  $140 - Sovereign (Teacher tier)\nRight now we are focused on raising enough money for a print run of the game, but we have several stretch goal tiers planned!\n\n$20,000 - We will add tuck boxes for the game's decks to the packaging\n  $25,000 - We will design and add custom-engraved dice to the game featuring symbols from knightly heraldry\n  $30,000 - \u00a1Haremos una segunda impresi\u00f3n de La Mancha en espa\u00f1ol!\n  $50,000 - We will design an expansion for the game based on the role Sancho Panza and other squires play in the novel\n\n La Mancha has already won several awards from international tabletop competitions! \n\nAs a designer, I\u2019m very interested in finding connections between games and the arts, so as I recently read Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, all I could think was, \u201cI want to play this, but I don\u2019t know HOW.\u201d One day, I received an e-mail from a member of our tabletop group: everyone should design a new game and we will play the outcomes at our next get-together. This was my chance!   \nThroughout the novel, Don Quixote imagines that his mundane surroundings are things that he read about in books of Chivalry: windmills are giants, inns are castles, and so on. Wouldn't it be fun for players to do the same? I wanted the game to feature everything I love about deep storytelling and role-playing games, but in an approachable package that anyone could pick up. \nMy first prototype was an Apples to Apples-style game where players respond to short prompt cards featuring everyday situations with reaction cards containing Chivalric text. The first playtests went okay, but I quickly discovered that the more fun prompts were those closer to the novel itself. Soon players were waving invisible swords in the air, declaring their undying love to one another, and butchering classic Broadway songs (yes, there is a card that references Man of La Mancha.) Beyond being a fun and approachable storytelling game, La Mancha is a deep storytelling engine, letting players experience Cervantes in a new way, and even add their own spin to his classic tales. \nABOUT PIE FOR BREAKFAST STUDIOS\nPie For Breakfast Studios is an award-winning Northeast Ohio-based game development studio and advocacy organization creating experimental projects that combine games with the arts and humanities.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed.

It is topped by two giant Herons that can, in turn, carry twenty passengers on a circular flight.\nThe 22 branches of the Tree are more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) long, half of which is accessible by foot. The vegetation takes root in the steel and the public has access to incredible gardens which they can discover branch by branch, like a succession of hanging terraces connected to each other.\nThis City in the Sky harbors a bestiary of mechanical animals.\nL\u2019Arbre sera implant\u00e9 dans une carri\u00e8re, un \u00e9crin de granit face \u00e0 la Loire. Son orientation plein sud lui conf\u00e9re un v\u00e9ritable microclimat. Que vous arriviez \u00e0 pied, en navette par le fleuve ou par le haut de la carri\u00e8re, l\u2019image de l\u2019Arbre s\u2019impose, unie avec les falaises du sillon de Bretagne dont la v\u00e9g\u00e9talisation naturelle magnifiera les jardins suspendus.\nL\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons fera de cette carri\u00e8re un des plus beaux \u00ab jardins urbains du monde \u00bb.\nBien s\u00fbr il y aura des interactions entre l\u2019Arbre, les falaises et le jardin. Le projet continue d\u2019\u00e9voluer !\nThe Tree will be planted in a quarry, a garden sheltered by granite cliffs, along the banks of the river Loire, where its south-facing orientation will give it a true microclimate. Whether you arrive on foot, by boat or from the top of the quarry, the Tree\u2019s image will impose itself, and the cliffs and their vegetation will magnify the Tree\u2019s hanging gardens.\nThe Herons' Tree will turn the Chantenay quarry into one of the most beautiful \u201curban gardens\u201d in the world.\nOf course there will be interactions between the Tree, the cliffs and the garden. The project continues to evolve !\nImaginez un enfant de 9 ans install\u00e9 sur le dos du H\u00e9ron. Devant lui, la t\u00eate du H\u00e9ron se d\u00e9coupe dans le ciel, ses yeux bougent, le bec et le cou sont mobiles. \u00c0 droite et \u00e0 gauche, il peut voir les 2 grandes ailes de l\u2019oiseau battre lentement pour contr\u00f4ler son vol. L\u2019enfant vole, il sent dans la machine chaque battement d\u2019ailes et fait partie de l\u2019animal...\nLes visiteurs de la Cit\u00e9 dans le ciel assistent \u00e0 toutes les phases du vol qui magnifient l\u2019animal et la machine. Ce voyage est encore plus fou que l\u2019embarquement dans le Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant !  \nPicture a nine years old child on the back of the Heron. The Heron\u2019s head stands out against the sky in front of him, its eyes move, its beak opens, and its neck moves. On each side he can see the bird\u2019s two great wings gently flapping in the air to control its flight. The child flies : he feels each wing beat; he is one with the bird.\nThe visitors of the City in the Sky witness every phase of the flight which glorifies both the animal and the machine. This trip is even wilder than riding aboard the Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant !\nDepuis l\u2019ouverture des Machines de l\u2019\u00eele en 2007, nous \u00e9tudions un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me propre \u00e0 l'Arbre par le biais de la branche prototype, d\u00e9j\u00e0 foul\u00e9e par plus de 4 millions de visiteurs. Cette branche pr\u00e9figure l'une des 22 branches qui constitueront l'Arbre aux H\u00e9rons. Cela nous a notamment permis de tester la solidit\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la v\u00e9g\u00e9talisation de ces jardins suspendus. Les contenants qui accueillent les plantes permettent de planter des arbres au sein m\u00eame de l\u2019Arbre. Actuellement, nous exp\u00e9rimentons l\u2019implantation de micros paysages dans les fourches des branches.\nSince the opening of Les Machines de l\u2019\u00eele in 2007, we have been developing an ecosystem unique to the Tree using the prototype branch, which has been walked on by more than 4 million visitors so far. This branch prefigures one of the 22 branches of the future Herons' Tree. This has enabled us to test its solidity, the safety of its access, and the growth process for the hanging gardens. The planters we installed enable us to grow actual trees in the Tree. At the moment, we are working towards the creation of micro-landscapes amidst the forks of branches.\nDans l'Arbre aux H\u00e9rons, l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux jardins suspendus se fait gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un escalier \u00e0 double r\u00e9volution situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du tronc : l\u2019un sert \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e, l\u2019autre \u00e0 la descente. Le public emprunte les branches v\u00e9g\u00e9talis\u00e9es et les passerelles pour passer d\u2019une branche \u00e0 l\u2019autre et parvenir au sommet de l\u2019Arbre. Depuis les belv\u00e9d\u00e8res, \u00e0 30 m du sol, il d\u00e9couvre alors les H\u00e9rons, la Loire et Nantes. Le parcours dans les jardins suspendus se termine sur un bar-terrasse implant\u00e9 sur une branche basse. La capacit\u00e9 des jardins est de 300 personnes.\nL\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons est une machine de ville accessible \u00e0 tous. Comme pour le Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant sur sa piste, le public viendra librement le d\u00e9couvrir et observer cette Cit\u00e9 dans le ciel !\nIn the Herons' Tree, the hanging gardens are accessible via a double helix staircase located inside the trunk : one to go up, the other to go down. The visitors walk along lush branches and footbridges to go from branch to branch before reaching the top of the Tree. From the different galleries 30m (100ft) above the ground, they will discover the Herons, the river Loire, and Nantes. The walking circuit through the hanging gardens ends at a patio bar built into a lower branch. The hanging gardens can accommodate 300 visitors.\nThe Herons' Tree is an urban machine, accessible to everyone. Just like the Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant, visitors will be free to discover and observe this City in the sky !\nTous les animaux qui peupleront l\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons sont construits dans l\u2019Atelier de la compagnie La Machine. Ils seront \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le en exp\u00e9rimentation dans la Galerie des Machines et test\u00e9s par le public jusqu\u2019en 2021. Nous continuons un travail de recherche et de construction pour enrichir ce bestiaire m\u00e9canique.\nDepuis le 10 f\u00e9vrier de cette ann\u00e9e, une grande maquette au 1/5e de l\u2019assemblage tronc, branches, \u00e9tais et racines est pr\u00e9sente dans la Galerie et les premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la voli\u00e8re m\u00e9canique sont \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir : un colibri g\u00e9ant butinant une fleur ainsi qu\u2019un vol d\u2019oies sauvages.\nEn 2022, les visiteurs d\u00e9couvriront tout au long de leur balade dans les jardins suspendus, d'\u00e9tranges animaux m\u00e9caniques qui vivent et s'animent dans l'Arbre : fourmis et araign\u00e9e g\u00e9antes, chenilles arpenteuses, insectes, mammif\u00e8res ou encore rongeurs et bien s\u00fbr des oiseaux m\u00e9caniques. Pendant ces 4 ann\u00e9es de la construction de l'Arbre, nous vous ferons d\u00e9couvrir la trentaine d'animaux qui peupleront la Cit\u00e9 dans le ciel !\nAll the animals which will inhabit the Herons' Tree are built in the workshop of La Machine company. One after the other and until 2021, they will be showcased in the Galerie des Machines and tested by the visitors. We are moving forward with our studies and constructions to enrich this mechanical bestiary.\nSince February 10th of this year, a big 1/5 scale model of the assembly of the trunk, branches, support beams and roots is being showcased in the Galerie des Machines, as well as the first elements of the mechanical aviary: giant hummingbird harvesting a flower, and a flight of wild geese.\nIn 2022, visitors will discover, as they walk in the Hanging Gardens, strange mechanical animal living in the Tree : ants, a giant spider, inchworms, insects, mammals, rodents and mechanical birds. During the 4 years of construction of the Tree, we will show you the 30 animals which will inhabit the City in the sky ! \n                                    L'araign\u00e9e dans la Galerie des Machines ( par Morvan Frangeul)                                                      Spider in the Galerie des Machines ( by Morvan Frangeul)\nPLAY\n\nA partir de 10\u20ac, vous recevrez le titre de copartage num\u00e9rique de l\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons en HD.

They have always been open for anyone to print (or even edit!) their own decks.  Generominos and the code used to create them are Apache-licensed opensource and Creative Commons. But professionally manufactured decks feel nicer, and are less time-consuming to manufacture.  So this Kickstarter is raising money to fund a medium-sized run (100-1000 decks) so that we can all get a deck at a lower price.\nHow the Cards Work\nGenerative methods often involve taking one kind of data and transforming it into another.  Interactive artworks often involve using novel interfaces to generate a feed of data, and also use interesting output devices to display some feed of data.  Alternative controllers may create streams of data that are different from traditional button-based games.\nA challenge in designing these systems is understanding how the data generated by the input turns into the data needed to create the output. A generative interactive system can be modeled as a pipeline of data streams: Data streams are created by inputs The data undergoes a chain of transformations The resulting data streams are output somehow ...But data comes in many forms: numbers, text, vectors, graphs, and more!\nData streams can't magically convert from one type to another. But, many kinds of transformations are available as tools to turn one data-type into another. Sometimes these transformations even generate new interesting kinds of data themselves.\nThe Generominos cards are a constructive model of how pipelines transform the datastreams generated from inputs into the type of data needed by the outputs, though a series of compatible transformations. Like Dominos, each card has some sockets, only in this case, we can have several sockets for input (on the top), and several for output (on the bottom). Some cards may not have input sockets, others may not have output sockets. Here is an example card:\n There are 16 kinds of data, and 3 kinds of sensors.  This may seem like a lot, but there are a lot of kinds of data to play with in the real world! They are color-coded by general type to suggest which types can cross-convert easily.\n You can build systems by connecting some number of inputs to some number of outputs (and elaborating with input and output modifier).  Use transformation cards to turn one data type into another.  Data symbols must always match! (Or be in the same family, for advanced users more familiar with technology)\n3 hypothetical systems designed with the Generominos (the rightmost one is IdleHands, playable at www.galaxykate.com/apps/idlehands)\n Costs\nI've considered a number of different options, but I think I may stay with MakePlayingCards, as I've already proofed the deck through them, and their turnaround time was faster than PrintNinja's projected time.  If there are 500 or more orders, I'll upgrade to nice custom print boxes, but for less then that, the Generominos will ship in a plain brown box.\nCost calculations\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the cards are designed and ready to print! A few cards are going to be changed and added, after playtest results, but the deck is at its final form. It's already been uploaded and printed at MakePlayingCards.com, and the results came back great! \n\nThe major risks are if I switch to PrintNinja in order to get the nicer boxes. Their listed prices are cheap, but the turnaround time is longer and I haven't proofed there.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "One Deck", "descp": "One box of 160 Generominos cards, with instruction sheet and 21 Grant Inspiration cards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["114 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 27 or more", "title": "Buddy Pack - 2 Decks \ufffd", "descp": "By special request: get two packs with a $3 discount from full price", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Classroom Pack - 6 Decks!", "descp": "A $10 discount and enough decks to serve a class of 30", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Shipping....still", "update_content": "Hey all, sorry for the lack of updates.

Here's a little excerpt to stoke your interest....Along with a new spot illustration from the inimitable Peter Bagge!\nEnjoy, this is just the tip of the iceberg! Tell your friends about FULL BLEED, still a few days left to subscribe!\nGAVIN EDWARDS: Do you remember your first trip to London?\nALAN MOORE: I think so. It was in a hired mini-bus with my uncle and my parents and my cousins and my brother. It was in the very early '60s and there were milk bars everywhere, which we thought terribly exotic.\nGE: I've heard of milk bars, but I've never seen one outside of A Clockwork Orange. Did they literally serve milk, or were they ice-cream shops?\nAM: I'm not even sure. I think it was a kind of caf\u00e9 with coffee, tea, and milk. It seems strange looking back now\u2014they can't have served just milk. It was very bohemian in London in the '60s. I presume they just didn't serve alcohol and there was presumably a pretty fast trade in pep pills going on instead. I remember going to the London Zoo and finding that a bit unnerving\u2014I didn't like seeing animals in cages\u2014except when there was an elephant that evacuated its bowels all over one of its keepers spectacularly. I shall never forget that. That was when I was six or seven. I didn't go to London again until I was a teenager and starting to get involved with the early part of comics fandom. I could never live there\u2014it's a bit of a nightmare\u2014but it's a fascinating city. I still go down about once a month.\nGE: You referred earlier to Promethea as an American comic book\u2014do you think of your projects as having a national identity?\nAM: Well, my relationship with America and American comics has changed quite a lot. When I started out, there was an English comics industry and there was this glittering, colorful American comics industry over the sea. I'd grown up reading the British comics but I'd also grown up reading a huge amount of American comics: they were in color and there were more of them. I was really excited when, in my mid-20s, I was brain-drained and I went to work for America. Since then, I've seen the English comics scene more or less atrophy because most of the big talents went overseas. I have a much more jaded image of the American comics industry now. In fact, at this point I would say that the mainstream American comics industry is the single thing that poses the biggest threat to the comics medium. The American comics industry thinks of creators as fuel cells that are to be used and then thrown away, which is done with every major creator that has ever graced its halls. It has grown up and made concessions only when it absolutely has to\u2014and if it had the chance, it'd claw those concessions back. I have a huge number of friends in America and they are wonderful people, but America as an entity is the ugliest I've ever seen it. It's come to me to feel as if the policies of the comic-book industry are pretty much American foreign policy, but writ small. It's the same mixture of greed and deceit and gladhanding. I have started thinking that perhaps it would be good to distance myself from the big American companies because I don't want to end up like Herg\u00e9; I don't want to be remembered for having made a fantastic contribution to graphic literature but too bad he was a Nazi collaborator. I don't want to be a Vichy comics writer.\nGE: Did you name America's Best Comics yourself?\nAM: Yeah, just because it sounded corny and archetypal. I wanted something that sounded like it had been around since the '40s. They're a lot more knowing than something like Watchmen\u2014there's an ironic distance in the storytelling.\nGE: Was the motivation for doing those comics, like Tom Strong and Top 10, that you wanted to expiate for the imitators of Watchmen?\nAM: Yes, I wanted to at least leave the American comics industry in the state that I found it, as you would any hotel room. With all this dark stuff, I felt that it had, through no fault of my own, had an influence on the mainstream industry that I didn't like. It seemed to have removed a lot of the joy and imagination that attracted me to comics in the first place in favor of a relentlessly dark, pessimistic sort of phony cynicism\u2014a knee-jerk cynicism that I didn't think that the innocent characters of American comics had really been designed to carry. It was an experiment: I wanted to reinvest the mainstream with some of those elements that I felt had been thrown out with the bathwater back in the '80s.\nArt by Peter Bagge\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy Kickstarter? \n\nIn days of yore, running a magazine, one had to rely on two important sources of revenue \u2014 advertising and subscriptions. Well, FULL BLEED is 100% ad free. To realistically sustain a publication of this magnitude, reaching out directly to fans is necessary. In other words, subscriptions. In this day and age, Kickstarter provides us the opportunity to interact with prospective readers, not compromise on quality, and remain free of advertising.\n\nWe want this project to get as much visibility as possible BEFORE launch, to arm ourselves with the information to make the best publication we possibly can. Kickstarter's community easily provides the best resource for that. IDW:PDX and Woodworks plan to be in business for years, generating content that can be sold anywhere under the sun. We want to build excitement for what we're launching here, and Kickstarter is the best place to spread that word far and wide to the people we want to reach -- you.

Forced into hiding, the Princess will reemerge leading a formidable band of loyal warriors in an effort to help the Samurai defeat the Demon Overlord.\n    'Lost in a bamboo forest, his Shogun murdered by an evil supernatural force, a lone samurai collapses to his knees with an anguished cry. Disgraced and humiliated at having failed to save his Master, the Samurai prepares to commit seppuku. But a voice stops him. A voice emanating from a cursed severed head who offers to guide the Samurai on a quest for vengeance. Thus begins the tale of...'The Haunted Swordsman'.\nThe first chapter of THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN , THE SWORD OF WHISPERING DEATH, will be a stand alone tale. However, with each Kickstarter stretch goal that is reached , a new continuing chapter in the epic tale will be unlocked and will be able to be filmed.  \n For each new short film chapter, director Kevin McTurk will bring together his team of professional puppeteers, camera and lighting technicians, top creature effects artists, amazing voice talent and phenomenal sound designers and musicians, to create a visually captivating tale of revenge, honor, love, and betrayal.\nAs each short film chapter is unlocked,  a new reward bonus item (yet to be announced) will be sent to EVERYONE that contributes at the DVD/Blu-ray level (or higher)!

Each new gift will be offered as a separate reward package or can be an ADD ON to your original order. \n      A RETURN TO KICKSTARTER\n I am absolutely thrilled to be returning to Kickstarter. In 2013, I set out to make The Mill at Calder's End and created a Kickstarter campaign to raise $32,000. The campaign was a fantastic success and I raised over $65,000.\nThe Mil at Calder's End was an official selection at over 60 film festivals worldwide and won 14 awards, including the 2015 Grand Jury Prize for Best Animated Short at the Seattle International Film Festival. In addition, I was honored to have Guillermo del Toro purchase the Grimshaw puppet for his personal Bleak House collection. \nThe puppet was also personally selected by Guillermo for the traveling museum exhibition At Home With Monsters, which premiered here in Los Angeles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), and continued on to Minneapolis Institute of Art and then on to the Toronto Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO).\nREVIEWS OF MY EARLIER GHOST STORY PUPPET FILMS\n\"THE MILL AT CALDER'S END IS TOLD WITH A PASSIONATE SENSE OF STORYTELLING IN A MEDIUM THAT BOTH ENSHRINES AND REINVENTS THE OLD CLASSICS.\" -Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water, Hellboy)\n\"BREATHTAKING...AN INNOVATIVE AND ENGAGING USE OF PUPPETRY...\" -Sir Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings)\n\"CREEPY...FILLED WITH SOME REALLY COOL HORROR IMAGES...

The work of Jim Henson (The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and his Storyteller television series) is a great inspiration to me and I am hoping to bring his sense of wonderment and artistry to The Haunted Swordsman.\nIn 2012, I was honored to work with Heather Henson (Jim's youngest daughter) on my first film. Heather produced The Narrative of Victor Karloch as one of the short films for her Handmade Puppet Dreams Film Series and was a guiding force in helping me create the haunted world of Victor Karloch.\nTHE FILMMAKING APPROACH\nThe Haunted Swordsman will be told with the traditional Japanese theater puppetry technique known as bunraku. Each puppet figure is controlled by three (or more) puppeteers dressed in black and hidden behind each character. It is my goal to make a film that celebrates practical effects and therefore there will be very little computer generated imagery in the final film. In my first film, The Narrative of Victor Karloch, I utilized several silent film era camera techniques, such as a shot of a miniature ship on a stormswept ocean (which, in fact, was made up of painted flowing garbage bags). For The Mill at Calder's End, the Apparition (see below) was puppeteered in a water tank.  I plan to continue to use many more of these 'old school' techniques to give a hand crafted look to The Haunted Swordsman.\nFrom my experience working as a special effects artist in Hollywood for over twenty years, I have been fortunate to work with the most talented creature effects artists,concept artists, and puppeteers in the industry.\nThis film celebrates two of my great loves: the art of puppetry and suspenseful storytelling. I promise that The Haunted Swordsman will be unlike any puppet film you have ever seen before.\nThe Apparition puppet (voiced by Barbara Steele) filmed in a water tank for THE MILL AT CALDER'S END.\n  Preparing a pre-dawn location model shot of the windmill for THE MILL AT CALDER'S END.\n    Production Stills from THE MILL AT CALDER'S END. A combination of practical sets, greenscreen composite shots, miniatures (including a Model T on a converted exercise treadmill), and the full size \"Bramblegore\" creature.\n  For THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN.

This will be the full size insert version for the animatronic head.\n  ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nKevin McTurk | Director\nA professional creature effects artist, cinematographer, model maker, and puppeteer, Kevin McTurk has been working in the effects industry for over 20 years.

Every frame of this film is essentially an effects shot. The \"actors\" of this film are the sculpted puppet characters that are controlled by three puppeteers dressed in black (or green screen) behind each puppet. Therefore, one of the single greatest challenges is how to film the puppets and hide the puppeteers from camera. There will definitely be a number of shots that will require \"rotoscoping\" ( digitally erasing puppeteers from the shot, frame by frame). In addition, every element of the puppet world - wardrobe, props, and sets - must be custom built for the film.\n\nIn terms of production scheduling, \"THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN : SHORT FILM ONE\" should be completed within a 6-8 month time frame.The shooting schedule could possibly be delayed if puppeteers and/or technical crew members are unavailable on shoot days due to better paying jobs or out of town work and would therefore force us to reschedule. But the ultimate goal is to start shooting this fall and reach post production in the spring/early summer..\n\nHow will the Kickstarter money be spent?\n\nHere is a short breakdown of the budget: \n30% Puppet Construction,Costuming,Sets,and Props \n30% Cast, Camera/Lighting/Stage Rental/ Crew \n20% Post Production (Sound Mixing/Digital Compositing/Color Correction)\n20% Kickstarter Rewards and Shipping\n\n\nTHANK YOU in advance for supporting THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN.. \nYour contributions will enable this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision that few have ever attempted!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "MESSAGES FROM THE SWORDSMAN", "descp": "For our minimum donation you'll win our heart-felt gratitude, access to exclusive THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN updates, and an online \"Thank You\" credit for the world to see at TheSpiritCabinet.com.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "THE MILL AT CALDER'S END DOWNLOAD", "descp": "Winner of over a dozen festival awards including the Grand Jury Award for Best Animated Short at the Seattle International Film Festival, THE MILL AT CALDER'S END is a gothic ghost story inspired by the work of Edgar Allan Poe, M.R.

We hit our goal under 2 days after we started the campaign! The show of support in the first day has been so incredible. Now we will really be able to take Miss Fisher internationally by sending our our cast and crew to proposed filming locations in London and Israel.\n  Campaign Overview\nWe know that you want more Miss Fisher! Let\u2019s work together to bring back Miss Fisher and her crime fighting cohorts\u2026this time to the big screen.\nWe're finalising the film script of Miss Fisher & the Crypt of Tears - and we want to bring you along for the adventure - but, we need your help to fund a gap in our financing, and prove to our investors that we have a strong fan-base who will come out to watch the film. \nTo do this we have set up a Kickstarter Crowdfunding Campaign for Miss Fisher the Movie, where supporters of the series can pledge funds toward the making of the film. Please pledge as little or as much as you can so we can make the film a reality. If all goes to (Nathan's) plan, we hope to start production in mid-2018.\n  Project Overview\nEvery Cloud Productions is proposing to produce a feature film building on the successful Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries television series, and is undertaking this Kickstarter campaign to raise a portion of the production budget for the film. \nSet in the late 1920\u2019s, Miss Fisher & the Crypt of Tears honors the heightened exoticisms of the murder mystery genre as the Honourable Miss Phryne Fisher, lady detective, escapes the small screen and takes off on a global adventure - via romantic wayside stops in the Far East, glamorous sojourns in the mansions of London, and a battle to survive the rolling sands of the Arabian Desert long enough to find the missing treasure, solve numerous murders and break all aviation records as she wings her way home again!\n      Background\nMiss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries is based on the novels of Australian author Kerry Greenwood. The stylish and Honourable Miss Phryne Fisher solves crimes with derring-do and continues her playful frisson with Detective Inspector Jack Robinson.\nOur lady sleuth sashays through the back lanes and jazz clubs of late 1920\u2019s Melbourne, fighting injustice with her pearl handled pistol and her dagger sharp wit. Leaving a trail of admirers in her wake, our thoroughly modern heroine makes sure she enjoys every moment of her lucky life.\nThe televsion series of Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries ran for 3 seasons and a total of 34 episodes across it\u2019s run. The series premiered on ABC TV in Australia, and has sold to 247 territories in 179 countries (we don\u2019t know how that works either).\nIt screens or has screened on platforms including ABC (Aus), Netflix, Acorn Online, Foxtel (Aus), Channel 5 (UK), UKTV\u2019s Alibi Channel (UK), France3 (France) \u2013 titled \u201cMiss Fisher Enqu\u00eate\u201d, Rai (Italy), Knowledge Network (Canada), Kanal 5 (Sweden), PBS (USA), Sony Germany (Germany), Globosat (Brazil) \u2013 titled \u201cOs mist\u00e9rios de Miss Fisher\u201d, as well as other territories including Norway, Denmark, Singapore, Hungry, Poland, Malaysia, Austria, and various pan territory deals including Asia and Latin America.\nWe always had grand plans to bring Miss Fisher to the big screen. She\u2019s a natural action hero - the female version of James Bond or Indiana Jones. After season 3 premiered in Australia 2 years ago, the desire for Miss Fisher didn\u2019t die down, and as our cast and crew went off to do different parts of the world, all the while we continued to develop the idea of turning Miss Fisher into a movie.\nAfter much scripting and development later we\u2019re finally here, but to make the leap to the big screen we need your support to prove to our investors that we have a strong fan-base that will come out and watch the film. We see crowdfunding as a great way to engage further with you - the incredible Miss Fisher fans around the world. We want to share this experience with you all and take you along for the ride.\nHow will the funds will be used?\n  Miss Fisher & the Crypt of Tears will be a stand-alone theatrical release, and promises audiences exotic locations, sumptuous interiors and glamorous costumes as the world of Miss Fisher takes the leap from the small screen.\nWe need your support to bring Miss Fisher to the big screen. Kickstarter funds will be an important component of the film budget and the funds raised will be used to elevate Miss Fisher to the cinematic experience she deserves, including international locations, visual effects, production design, and of course more glamorous costumes.\n International Locations\nPhryne has got to be able to fly beyond Australian shores to cement her position as a bona fide international action hero. To do justice to Miss Fisher\u2019s global adventure outlined in the script, we hope to film in countries around the world such as Morocco, Israel, and London which are all under consideration.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Miss Fisher movie project faces the normal risks of film production - but with the same team who created the series, we will work to ensure the film is likewise properly funded, has contingency plans and is fully insured before we go into production. \n\nOur biggest challenges are co-ordinating the schedules of our lead cast and crew and locking down a date to film. We will endeavour to bring back as many of the key cast as we can to make the film a success.\n\nMiss Fisher & the Crypt of Tears is a mid range budget feature being produced out of Australia, so there are always challenges to manage big budget ideas with limited resources but having made 3 seasons of the series, we know we can elevate Miss Fisher to the big screen. \n\nWith regard to delivering on our rewards, we will work hard to get your merchandise, script excerpts, postcards and other rewards to you safely and on schedule.

Simultaneously haunting and hauntingly beautiful, BOTC is guaranteed to tickle your fancy.\nThe anthology features 35 different creators from British Columbia, the Pacific Northwest, and abroad--and the stories within are sure to thrill and terrify.\n\"The Cove\" by Michael Elliott & Lindsay Ishihiro\nBones of the Coast will be published by the Cloudscape Comics Society, a non-profit comic collective based out of Vancouver, BC. Cloudscape seeks to promote and publish independent comic creators in British Columbia. The society has successfully published eight books to date, including six anthologies (Waterlogged, Mega Fauna) and two creator-owned projects. \n\nWhile Bones of the Coast does hope to frighten and unsettle you, we explicitly did not accept sexual violence. Nevertheless, Bones of the Coast is not recommended for younger readers and contains body horror, strong language, and one instance of self-harm. \nBones of the Coast was edited by Shannon Campbell, Jeff Ellis, and Kathleen Jacques, and will feature the talents of:\n- Kelly Aarons\n- Chloe Chan\n- Anastasia Chernaya\n- Michael Elliott\n- Kevin Forbes\n- Mindy Fraser\n- Britt c. h.\n- Abby Hontiveros\n- Abby Howard\n- Lindsay Ishihiro\n- Sean Karemaker\n- Emily Lampson\n- Christian Haruki Lett\n- Reetta Linjama\n- Sam Logan\n- Nina \"Space Coyote\" Matsumoto\n- Oliver McTavish-Wisden\n- Angela \"Jam\" Melick \n- Sf\u00e9 R.

Each story in the anthology features at least one BC creator, but our full list hails from around in the world. \nOur initial goal is for $29,200 Canadian, which, at the time of posting, is about $23,000 USD. The breakdown is such that The largest chunk of this fee (37%) goes towards reimbursing contributors for their time and talents. Roughly 24% goes towards printing fees for the 220+ page full-colour anthology, with 27% allocated to help subsidize the cost of shipping. (Canadian shipping is very, very expensive--especially for a book the size of BOTC. While we are asking you to pay additional shipping fees, this is with reduced cost baked into the total for the Kickstarter.) Finally, an additional 12% is reserved for Kickstarter fees & unexpected expenses. \n\"Don't Go to the Island\" by Sf\u00e9 R. Monster & Kalyna Riis-Phillips\n\nBut wait! The actual cost of producing Bones of the Coast, a labour over a year in the making, was actually more than that. BOTC has just already been the recipient of a $3000 small-press publishing grant from the Government of Canada, helping to promote & publish independent creators. So thank you, Canada! (We forgive you for the terrible shipping)\n The full list of rewards can be seen in the column to the right, but may we highlight, for your temptation:\n\nThe Sasquatch Sighting ($35)\nThe Sasquatch Sighting reward tier\n  With this reward tier, you'll receive a physical copy of the book along with a digital PDF and a set of digital wallpapers featuring art from our various contributors. In addition, you'll also receive three limited-edition Bones of the Coast postcards. \nCadborosaurus & LIterary Cadborosaurus ($60)\nWith these reward tiers, you'll receive the same items from the Sasquatch Sighting in addition to an original, one-of-a-kind sketched monster illustration (provided by Kelly Aarons, Mindy Fraser, Abby Hontiveros, Abby Howard, Emily Lampson, Christian Lett, or Sam Logan) or an original, one-of-a-kind beautifully handwritten horror story (written by Michael Elliott). \nOgopogo ($90)\n\nThe Cadborosaurus Deluxe! As above, but you'll receive a colour monster sketch card. \nA sampling of Cadborosaurus & Ogopogo sketch cards, by Emily Lampson, one of the contributing artists\nOriginal Commissions ($100 and $150) \n\nWith these reward tiers, you'll receive the same items from the Sasquatch Sighting as well as an original commission provided by Emily Lampson, Abby Hontiveros, or Lindsay Ishihiro. Funding at this tier is split between the artist and the campaign; restrictions apply based on the tier and artist selected, and you should expect a 1 to 3-month delay in receiving your completed commission--more depending on your communication with the artist!\n\nAbby Hontiveros - $100\nAt $100, Abby Hontiveros will draw an original digital black & white commission based on your request, as per the example below:\nAbby Hontiveros, $100 commission\nAbby Hontiveros - $150\nFor an additional $50, Abby will paint a full-colour commission for you, which can be done by watercolour & gouache or copic marker:\nAbby Hontiveros, $150 commission\nLindsay Ishihiro - $100\nAt $100, Lindsay Ishihiro will draw you a full-colour bust of a character of person or your choosing, coloured digitally and printed out as a hi-res art print: \nLindsay Ishihiro, $100 commission\n\nEmily Lampson - $100\nAt $100, Emily Lampson will draw an original black & white commission based on your request, as per the example below:\nEmily Lampson, $100 commission\nEmily Lampson - $150 \nFor an additional $50, Emily will draw a full-colour commission for you, done in traditional media or digital and printed out, as per your preference:\nEmily Lampson, $150 commission\nPhantasm ($100)\n\nAt this tier, you'll received everything in the Sasquatch reward tier as well as one of Sean Karemaker's unique, hand-crafted resin ghosts, as pictured below. You'll be able to pick the colour, so your ghost will be truly one of a kind.\nPhantasm - Sean Karemaker's Ghosts ($100)\nAn Original Comic Page by Ren\u00e9e Nault ($350)\n In this tier, you'll receive all items found in the Sasquatch Sighting package as well as an original, watercoloured 9.5\" x 14\" page from Ren\u00e9e Nault's Bones of the Coast story \"Sandpipers\", pictured above. Ren\u00e9e's comic pages typically go for $400 on their own, so this is an excellent and delightful steal. Funds at this tier are split between Ren\u00e9e and the campaign. Thank you, Ren\u00e9e, for this gorgeous contribution!\nAn Original Comic Page by Anastasia Chernaya ($350)\n You'll receive all the items in the Sasquatch tier as well as the above original page, beautifully illustrated and coloured on 9.6x6.6\" paper by Anastasia Chernaya, the artist of \"Home\". \nAn Original Comic Page by Abby Hontiveros ($350)\nYou'll receive all the items in the Sasquatch tier as well as the above original page, gorgeously painted by Abby Hontiveros for \"Ponderosa Pine\". \nAn Original Comic Page by Emily Lampson ($350)\nYou'll receive all the items in the Sasquatch tier as well as an original inked comic page from Emily Lampson's Bones of the Coast story \"Countenance\". \n BOTC is Cloudscape's most ambitious project to date, and as such we are delighted to think of ways to make it even more ambitious. However, our biggest priority is in ensuring that our incredibly talented artists get the compensation they deserve, so that they can continue to make incredible stories--in this anthology, and the next. \n$35,000 - FUNDED!\nThis funding tier ensures that everyone who worked on the book receives a pay bonus for their time and efforts. Show our creators that you love their work and want to support them!\n$42,000 - FUNDED!\nAt $42,000, not only do we give all our contributors another pay bonus, but we'll also add a spot gloss to the cover of the book. Who knows what hidden figments will be revealed?\nUP NEXT: $48,000 - Spot Foil!\nAt this funding tier, our contributors received yet another pay bonus, ensuring you've done your mightiest to support creators you love--and help foster new talent in the community. But you'll also get a shiny spot foil to help make your Bones of the Coast as spiffy as possible!\nWe have other stretch goals in the work, but they're shrouded in the mist for now.

While Cloudscape has years of experience and seeks to promote & support independent cartoonists in whatever way it can, this will be the first Cloudscape anthology to offer its creators a page rate. This is CRUCIAL as artists simply cannot make time for dedicated, beautiful comics without the funding to do so. \n\nThat said, our $29,200 funding goal ($22K USD) is very much on par (and even slightly below) most successfully crowdfunded comic anthologies, and we're confident that with our stunning line-up of comics, we'll be able to hit that goal.

In Elsinore you play as Ophelia, a young noblewoman of Denmark, who awakes from a terrible vision: in four days, everyone in Elsinore Castle will be dead. To make matters worse, the vision has inexplicably thrown her into a time loop. Forced to relive the same four days over and over again, Ophelia must learn to survive in Elsinore, doing everything in her power to change the future. \nElsinore is a point-and-click adventure game with time loops; at its core, it's Shakespeare meets Majora's Mask/Groundhog Day. We're experimenting with combining story-creation mechanics to produce something we feel is truly new.\nDynamic Story Engine: Elsinore uses a story simulation engine to determine which events occur based upon your interactions. Lie, forgive, assassinate, befriend, or destroy \u2014 the actions you can take at any stage are numerous, and the game immediately responds.\nIntelligent Character Behavior: Each character manages their own lives, schedules, needs, desires, and plans over the course of each time loop. Even the smallest interaction has an impact on the world around you.\nLearn from Previous Loops: Over the four days within each time loop, the player can explore dozens of different outcomes for even minor actions, each time learning new information.\nBecome a Diplomat: Understanding each character's motivations isn't just part of the story -- it's necessary for Ophelia's survival. Characters are complex and have long histories with each other; all of them are keeping secrets.\nLife-or-Death Decisions: In a Shakespearean world, most roads end in tragedy, and characters are quick to meet a grisly fate. Hard decisions and terrible trials force players to think on their feet.\nHearsay & Evidence: Instead of concrete dialog choices in Elsinore, the player is tasked with gathering bits of information -- gossip, rumors, stories, lies, journal entries, bloody daggers, bottles of poison, and more -- and using them to convince characters to act. By \"presenting\" a piece of Hearsay or Evidence to a character, that character will change their course of action. You have dozens of pieces of information at your disposal at any given moment, and each one is a valuable tool in the right situation.\nReal-Time Implications: As you use Hearsay & Evidence, characters adapt their behavior on the fly. A normally kind and generous character may be driven to murder, and a dangerous character can be persuaded to lay down their sword. The right piece of information can even stop an ongoing massacre in its tracks.\nSimultaneous Action: Lots of things are happening all over Elsinore Castle at any time of day -- but you can't see them all at the same time. Choosing which events to attend and which ones to pass up is an important part of gathering new information. \nTime-Loop Puzzles: Moving the surrounding story forward will require the player to deeply understand and manipulate the time loop. Giving the right piece of information to a character at the wrong time can have disastrous results. \n\"Hey, that doesn't sound like much money. Is this enough to finish Elsinore?\"\nOur budget may seem small, but it's exactly what we need. All of us have day jobs -- as full-time employees in the game industry, students, or freelancers. Our jobs allow us to eat and pay student loans, but they don't allow us to spend the amounts we need to bring Elsinore over the finish line at a level of polish we'll be satisfied with.\nBy funding this campaign, you're saving us from months (or years) of saving before we can afford to finish Elsinore. We sincerely appreciate it!\n1000 Backers: Alternate Costumes - If we reach 1000 backers, we'll include a set of alternate equippable costumes for the main cast (Ophelia, Hamlet, Gertrude, Claudius, Polonius, and Laertes) with the released game!\n$15,000: Basic Voice Acting - At this tier, we'll be able to record a set of Fire Emblem-like voice-over emotes and lines for each character, as well as pay an audio engineer to post-process the lines for maximum quality.\n$18,000: The Pirate Ship + New Character - Did you know there are pirates in Hamlet? THERE TOTALLY ARE! If we reach this tier, Ophelia will be able to join Hamlet in getting captured by pirates at sea. This area will contain content which ties back to the main game's storyline. All backers will also get to vote on a BRAND NEW character to be added to the game -- from a top-secret selection!\n$23,000: Additional Animation - At this tier, we'll be able to hire a professional animator to add to our staff of 1 artist and 1 technical artist. This will greatly improve the number of animations we can have in the game and add to the polish of each one.\n$30,000: Castle Town - Similar to the Pirate Ship tier. At this tier, players will be able to access portions of Castle Town - the town that lies beneath Elsinore in the Danish countryside.

In the notes field, remind me which items you added on, and they will be shipped with your existing tier rewards.\nHere we are again, Doc.\nMy name is Kris, and I've been a cartoonist since 2000. In 2012 I launched Broodhollow, a cosmic horror adventure comic set in the 1930s, done in the style of comics from that era. It's about Wadsworth Zane, an unlucky encyclopedia salesman who travels to the peculiar town of Broodhollow to collect a mysterious inheritance. But a series of supernatural encounters leaves Zane wondering how much of what he sees in Broodhollow is real, or just in his mind.\nThe Kickstarter for the first book was a huge success! Thank you! Now the story continues in the second book of the series, Angleworm. Zane has settled into everyday life in Broodhollow, but is plagued by unsettling nightmares. When a tragedy strikes the town in the dead of winter, Zane is left wondering how far he's willing to go to end his nightmares once and for all...\nThe first Broodhollow book Kickstarted last year and thanks to backers, it looks incredible. I want to print the second Broodhollow book with the same quality level as the first -- if not higher! \nThis Kickstarter isn't about raising money to tell the story. Book 2 is done, and you can read it for free online starting with Book 1 right now.\nBroodhollow is full-color, and digitally painted. Book 2 was even more challenging than the first -- I wanted very much to turn the horror convention of darkness and shadow on its head. Many of Angleworm's scares come from staring into the blinding white of a monstrous winter storm.\nI will again be working with printing professionals who will help me translate the comics you see on screen to the printed page. There are a lot of details and subtle colors that I want to make sure the book captures!\nThis Kickstarter is about the production of a book -- so all backers at all listed reward tiers will be getting a copy of Angleworm, be it digital, softcover or hardcover.\nIn addition to the book, higher tiers will also be receiving other goods, such as...\nFor the first time, I'm working with local shops to make the quality of this year's goods even better than last year! \nAnd at higher tiers, you can commission a personalized Cadavre comic strip from me, or even have me render you as a member of Broodhollow's restless dead.\nIf Book 2 goes over the target funding goal, we enter stretch goal territory, which heightens the experience for everyone. Goals will be revealed as we get close to them!\nACHIEVED! At $35,000, I'll release a new pack of hi-res wallpapers and avatars to all backer levels.\nACHIEVED!

Backers who pre-order the book will get it at a special discounted rate over its release price, along with access to other exclusive content!\nIce-Bound's ground-breaking game engine uses combinatorial narrative, a cutting-edge type of sculptural fiction that promises the reader deep exploration, and a rare level of reactivity to their actions. It's part of our ongoing research at the Expressive Intelligence Studio with people like Michael Mateas, the creator of Fa\u00e7ade. \n\"[A]n amazing project... Aaron\u2019s work is consistently some of the most unusual, format-expanding stuff being done in IF.\" -- Emily Short\nWe've both previously undertaken projects that push at the border of digital storytelling (Aaron literally wrote the book on it) and have received recognition for our work in augmented reality. If you want to hear more about our chops, check out the About The Team section below. As for us, we'd rather talk about...\nThe Story\nIce-Bound begins with Carina Station: a remote, abandoned polar base. Under the weight of passing decades it's sunk into the ice, with each successive owner building new levels on top. Now the station is an unmapped labyrinth of history, littered with relics left by researchers and explorers stretching back in time the deeper one descends.  \nWhen the writer Kristopher Holmquist chose Carina Station as the setting for his new novel, he was struggling in obscurity, working in a tiny unheated New York apartment. After his death from a rare neurological disorder, the unfinished fragments were published on a whim... and became incredibly popular, with thousands, then millions of fans wanting to know how the story was meant to end, and what lay at the bottom, the lowest level, of the mysterious polar station.  \nThirty years into the future, a clever publisher, Tethys House, commissions an artificial intelligence \"simulacrum\" of Kristopher Holmquist, called KRIS. Charged with finishing the now-legendary novel, KRIS wrestles with self-doubt. Is he as good as his original? What has Tethys kept from him about his life, and death? And how was the unfinished story ever meant to end?\nThe Book\nHalf of the Ice-Bound experience is an 80-page full color art book: the Ice-Bound Compendium. Filled with Holmquist's personal files, unfinished chapters and alternate drafts, collages of research and strange, distorted transmissions, the book mingles Holmquist's story with those of his creations. It isn't clear where these images came from, but one thing is certain: KRIS desperately wants to see it.  \nKRIS's desire is the catalyst for the game's dependence on the book. Viewed through a camera, markerless augmented reality allows KRIS to recognize the book page, overlaying information from his subconscious. Scrawls of annotations fill the margins, revealing new layers of story. Pictures flicker and come to life. Check out the video below, it's hard to put into words but very cool.\nPLAY\n\nThe AR is more than just a gimmick, and the book isn't just a feelie: it's critical to unlocking the full story. But to explain, we'll have to tell you about the game.  \nThe Game  \nIn the game you'll descend through eight levels of Carina Station, helping KRIS complete stories of the people who lived there: driven researchers, psychopathic maintenance crews, haunted soldiers and desperate explorers. A cutting-edge system for dynamic interactive narrative lets you shape and explore thousands of variations on these stories like sculpting with clay.\nYou can arrange the story however you like, but in order to progress, you need to convince KRIS that your version of the fiction is correct. You need proof your story is the way the \"real\" Holmquist would have written it, proof which lies in the corrupted notes littering the Compendium. \nBut the Compendium also contains restricted information, things Tethys House doesn't want KRIS to see. By showing KRIS pages from the Compendium you can convince him your chosen endings to Ice-Bound's stories are correct. But think carefully: things in the book might also shock him, traumatize him, or change him. As you move deeper through the station you also build a deeper and more personal relationship with KRIS, deciding which parts of his missing past to reveal to him, and which he's better off not knowing.\nPlatforms\nIce-Bound will launch on the iPad 2 or newer, and on Windows PCs with webcams. We're also actively pursuing a port to Mac OS, but can't guarantee it just yet. It should also be easy for us to port it to an Android tablet, but we're focusing on a Mac version first.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIce-Bound is a self-funded indie game, a labor of love we've been working on in our spare time since summer 2013. We've finished the system behind the game, much of the content, and have already shown the current version at several book art, interactive narrative research, and indie game events (our Venn diagram is awesome). We're nearing completion and foresee no problems in finishing the digital game portion of the project.  \nThe printed book, however, offers some unique challenges. While print-on-demand services are popular, they aren't as cost effective as we'd like, and the app's image recognition tech demands a level of control over printing options that most of these services don't offer, such as using particular kinds of ink, paper, and printing processes to minimize glare on the page. What we really need is a professionally printed run from a real book printer--but the minimum quantity for such a run puts it out of our price range as indie developers. That's where you come in!  \nIf we reach our funding goal, we'll be able to do a professional print run of the Ice-Bound Compendium, and everybody wins: we get to make a high quality book, and sell it to you at a lower price than would be possible through a print-on-demand service. In addition, having guaranteed pre-orders up front lets us give our Kickstarter backers a discount off the final retail price: this will be the cheapest way to get a Compendium and experience Ice-Bound.  \nWe're still finishing up both the book and game, but we're confident we'll be able to get the project completed by the end of the year, putting delivery and the game's release in early 2015.\nRewards\nWe'll mail you a postcard from Carina Station, with our heartfelt thanks!   \nReceive a Compendium and game access once we release. This is a special price for our backers as thanks for your support in getting us out the gate!  \nAccess to the released game, and a Compendium signed by us! When KRIS sees our signatures, it may stir some memories that otherwise would remain hidden...\nTwo copies of the Compendium with game access, and two postcards from Carina Station. It's dangerous to go alone...take a friend!\nA signed Compendium with game access, and your choice of either three book-sized prints (roughly 8\"x10\") or one poster-size print (roughly 12\"x18\"). These will be high-quality reproductions of Compendium pages--we'll give you a choice between multiple options once the campaign concludes.  \nBe among the first to explore Ice-Bound with a special 30-page prototype Compendium, and access to an early version of the game. Immemorialize yourself in the game's credits, and of course receive a signed copy of the final Compendium once the finished game is released.  \nJust like an Early Explorer, except with more authorial intent: send us a short memory or anecdote of your choosing and we'll adapt it to KRIS's info-banks, to appear amongst the swarm of memories as you use the app to delve into his past.  \nJust like an Early Explorer, with a penchant for memory tinkering: we'll work with you to design a full \"story card\" for Ice-Bound, used by our combinatorial narrative system to build the stories of Carina Station. You'll get a special code that will prioritize your story card while playing, and a \"Story Contributor\" credit on the game. (We'll spend up to an hour brainstorming/designing with you via Skype, but the final content of the story card is at our discretion.)\nJust like an Early Explorer, except privy to conspiracy. We'll design you a special, custom-tailored Compendium page. This page will be fully AR-equipped with its own unique augmented content. You can choose whether to share this page with the world, or keep it to yourself as your own personal apocrypha. You'll also get a prominent \"Patron Explorer\" credit on the game, book, and website. (Page design will be based on a special design session with you where we'll share secrets about the story world and chat about your interests and ideas.)     \nAbout the Team\nAaron A.

We've built several custom authoring tools to help the remaining story creation go smoothly (and have learned how to tell stories for Ice-Bound's unique narrative system, after much experimentation!) so we're expecting to have the app finished up and ready to release in early 2015.\n\nWe've done our homework on the logistics for the book, and have already partnered with both a printer and distributor. Our printer is based in Hong Kong and estimates about ten weeks for printing and delivery, which is why we've put the estimated delivery date for the standard backer tiers in April (assuming the book's ready to send to the printer by early January). One challenge is that the book has very specific requirements for it to work optimally with the app's augmented reality, so we may need to spend more time working with the printer to make sure the books are exactly what we want. We'll keep backers appraised of any delays.\n\nWe've already made most of the book and the game... our biggest challenge now is getting enough support to afford a professional print run.

Together, we look forward to changing the future of games and health through biofeedback!\nMiss out on the campaign?\nDon't worry! Check out our website at www.nevermindgame.com for the latest updates on the project and details on how to get the game when it launches!\n3 DAYS TO GO: Randy Pitchford Offers His Support!\nAmong all the amazing tweets and messages we've seen over the past few days on social media, we were thrilled to see Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford (of Borderlands fame) offer his support for Nevermind, noting:\nRemember: When you back Nevermind, you are not only supporting our ability to create a unique biofeedback horror game, you are also helping to open the door for a wide variety of uniquely compelling biofeedback-driven experiences moving forward!\nJoin us today! Help us forge the future!\nNevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced horror adventure game that takes you into the dark and twisted world within the subconscious minds of psychological trauma victims.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nAs you explore surreal labyrinths and solve the puzzles of the mind, a biofeedback sensor monitors how scared or stressed you become with each passing moment. If you let your fears get the best of you, the game becomes harder. If you\u2019re able to calm yourself in the face of terror, the game will be more forgiving.\nNevermind\u2019s goal is to create an unforgettable gameplay experience that also teaches players how to be more aware of their unique internal responses to stressful situations. If you can learn to control your anxiety within the disturbing realm of Nevermind, just imagine what you can do when it comes to those inevitable stressful moments in the real world\u2026\nFor more info, check out this playthrough of the original proof of concept of Nevermind by Markiplier!\nWARNING: Some of the content in this video depicts intense imagery and situations relating to the psychological trauma experienced by a fictional character. This video and all Nevermind content in general, may upset, disturb, and act as a trigger for some viewers/players. As always, your discretion is advised.\nBack in February 2014, we launched a Kickstarter for Nevermind in the hope that it would let us make the first biofeedback-enhanced horror game a reality. Although we didn\u2019t end up hitting our funding goal (we came close!), our campaign got the attention of the fine folks over at Intel, who approached us about creating Nevermind to support their new Intel\u00ae RealSense\u2122 camera technology.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nFast forward to October, and Intel has provided us with the support to make an incredible experience for PCs leveraging the RealSense camera. This includes raising the quality bar for the game, creating two brand new levels, and supporting their new RealSense camera technology (which can detect your heart rate using only their camera).\nThis has been HUGE for us. We\u2019ve been able to use the funding to hire a team, secure a small studio space, get the equipment we need, and really dig into making Nevermind a reality. For that, we can\u2019t thank Intel enough!\nThat said, this is just the beginning -- there is SO much more we want to do with Nevermind to realize its full potential!\nOur dream for Nevermind has always been to provide as much game as possible for as many platforms as we can so you don\u2019t have to invest in additional biofeedback hardware.\nIf this new Kickstarter is successfully funded, it will allow us to create the following:\nINCREASED DEVICE SUPPORT\nAlthough we already support the Intel RealSense camera and the Garmin Heart Rate Chest Strap, we want to support EVEN MORE ways in which we can track your Heart Rate data, including potential solutions such as:\nWild Divine Iom Sensor\nApple Watch\nAffectiva Affdex software (no new hardware needed)\nIntel BioSport Headphones\nIntel Basis Peak Smartwatch\nThe Dash\nMio LINK\nThis is by no means a complete list, but rather a subset of devices we would like to support. The more prominent the device, the higher it will be on our list!\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nYou may notice that this time around we didn\u2019t include a biofeedback sensor reward tier option. That is because we\u2019re hoping to find a way to provide a solution that doesn\u2019t require *any* additional hardware (or, minimally, support as many existing hardware options as possible). In brief, we don\u2019t want you to spend $100 on a chest strap that you may not even need!\nMAC VERSION\nWe know many of you out there are Mac users -- we want to make sure that you are able to play Nevermind (with sensor support) as well!\nOCULUS RIFT INTEGRATION\nWe\u2019re HUGE believers in the potential of the Oculus Rift to change immersive experiences as we know them. Furthermore, games like Nevermind are uniquely equipped to capitalize on some of the most compelling elements that virtual experiences like Oculus have to offer. For example, imagine a horror game that plays with the fact that we know exactly what is/isn\u2019t in your peripheral vision. We can\u2019t WAIT to bring Nevermind to Oculus, including tuning all existing content to suit the technology.\nXBOX ONE VERSION\nAlthough the game would be primarily played with the controller, the Xbox One's basic Kinect 2.0 comes with built-in biofeedback technology just waiting to be tapped into! This was one of our most common requests from the first Kickstarter campaign, and we have gotten TONS of great support from the folks at ID@XBOX. We have the kits - now we just need the funding to make it happen!\nNOTE: For those of you that don\u2019t own an Xbox One, this version will minimally help us generate additional revenue, which will - in turn - be poured back into making more great level content for Nevermind!\nNEW LEVELS AND MORE!\nLastly, we want to create more great content for Nevermind. Even with the new levels from Intel, we are only scratching the surface of the breadth of ideas and topics that we want to tackle with Nevermind. Trauma affects us all in so many ways that we often don\u2019t realize -- with Nevermind, we have a unique opportunity to use our surreal, immersive canvas to shed light on psychological trauma in a manner other media can\u2019t.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nNaturally, all of us are pretty excited about Nevermind and its potential - but don\u2019t just take our word for it. Here is just some of the press coverage we received with just our early proof of concept version!\nAs seen in: Kotaku, Polygon, Huffington Post, Fox News Business, Upworthy, GameTrailers, Joystiq, IGN, GameInformer, WiredUK, GamesBeat, FastCompany, PCGamer, KillScreen, BloodyDisgusting, GizMag, PSFK, Rock, Paper, Shotgun and many more!\n\u201cThis sounds super cool, if you ask me.\u201d - Kirk Hamilton, Kotaku \n\"And it works. Not only was the game obviously tuned to my emotional state, by the end of the journey I found myself pausing and taking a deep breath to slow my heart rate and more calmly tackle the nightmares that confronted me.\" - Brian Crecente, Polygon\n\u201cIt\u2019ll play a bit like a free-roaming version of Myst, but with the scare factor of Slender and the visual aesthetic of a Nine Inch Nails video directed by Kyle Cooper of Se7en\u2019s title sequence fame. You know, the stuff bad dreams are made of.\u201d - Will Johnston, Xbox One Gamer Magazine\n\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in seeing this game come to [...] Xbox One, fund it. If you support indie game developers, fund it. If you love horror, fund it. Hell, if you just take games seriously and think that they have more applications than just fun and random bits of escapism, fund it.

The sky is the limit! \nNEVERMIND T-SHIRT (LIMITED EDITION)\nA unique Nevermind T-shirt that will be designed and printed ONLY for Kickstarter Backers.\nMore T-Shirt designs will be made available depending on how popular this reward ends up being!\nHARDCOVER ART BOOK (SIGNED)\nA physical, hardcover edition of the Nevermind Art Book from the folks at Blue Canvas (makers of The Art of Journey) containing 40+ pages of concepts, sketches and commentary from the development of the game (including unused materials) - signed by the team!\nMockup of final printed Art Book\nHARDCOVER ART BOOK (PERSONALIZED)\nAs above, but also personalized via a unique creepy doodle by Erin!\n\nRELIC IN THE HALL OF FEARS\n(PLUS A SKETCH OF YOUR OWN PERSONAL FEAR)\nThere is a special room in the Neurostalgia institute dedicated to chronicling fear and trauma triggers of past patients. If you support us at this level, you will be asked to provide us a list of your fears (the more unique the better!) and we will create a unique \u201crelic\u201d statue in the final game dedicated to your fear! (final content subject to creative discretion of the dev team)\n\nUpon completion of the campaign, we\u2019ll send out a survey to all backers to get a list of your fears. We will do our best to accommodate as many of your first requests as possible, but it is likely that SOME fears will be shared amongst backers. That said, regardless of the final statue, you will receive a unique, one-of-a-kind sketch by Erin representing your fear!\nNOTE: Each fear sketch will be unique, but each in-game model MAY be shared.\nUNIQUE POSTCARD DRAWING BY ERIN\nA unique, Nevermind inspired hand-illustrated postcard-sized piece by Erin!\nORIGINAL CONCEPT PAINTING\nYou will be able to choose one of a variety of original concept art pieces (primarily paintings). Backers will get to choose on a first come, first served basis. Pieces will range in size - 4x5 inches and up!\nNevermind is - at its core - an adventure game (in the spirit of classic games like Myst), where you must explore strange worlds and solve puzzles to unlock the terrifying mystery that lurks within each patient\u2019s inner psyche. \nIn Nevermind, you are a Neuroprober at the Neurostalgia Institute - a unique physician of the not-too-distant future who, through the use of cutting-edge technology, is able to venture into the minds of psychological trauma victims for whom traditional treatment methods have proved ineffective.\nPhotos represent the patient's memories - discover and collect them to ultimately solve the mystery locked within their mind. (all gameplay is \"Work in Progress\" content)\nAs such, each \u201clevel\u201d in Nevermind takes place within the surreal subconscious of one of these victims. Your goal is to explore the often dark and twisted world within, solving abstract puzzles as you recover fragments of memories (represented by photographs) surrounding the traumatic event. \nTraumatic experiences, especially those left untreated, take their toll in countless ways, often triggering other serious problems as the victim\u2019s subconscious desperately tries to cope. As a result, the patient\u2019s mind doesn\u2019t take kindly to those who attempt to peel back these layers, often prompting it to lash out in terrifying, unexpected ways.\nOnly the most vigilant of Neuroprobers can survive the horrors of the mind to help their patient find peace at last. \nCan you?\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nNevermind uses biofeedback technology to detect your Heart Rate Variability while playing. When you start to become scared or anxious, the game will dynamically respond to your stress levels, which in turn directly affects gameplay.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nNevermind currently supports both the Intel RealSense camera and the off-the-shelf Garmin Heart Rate Monitor strap (similar to what one would use for exercise).  Nonetheless, our goal is to support as many hardware devices as possible to ensure every player has the opportunity to use a low cost, multi-function biofeedback device to \u201cenjoy\u201d the true Nevermind experience.\nNO HARDWARE? NO PROBLEM.\nAlthough the biofeedback element takes Nevermind to the next level, you can always play Nevermind without ANY biofeedback hardware and still have a great time. In the absence of hardware technology, we use secondary responsive cues (such as camera and player movement) to emulate the biofeedback experience.\nOne exciting facet of Nevermind is its potential to serve as a full-fledged therapeutic tool for those who struggle with challenges - mild or severe - relating to stress, anxiety, PTSD, or other similar conditions. Although informal testing results have been promising thus far, we are excited to be in discussion as we speak with researchers who are eager to explore Nevermind's potential impact via rigorous clinical trials.\n\nAs a prime example of our passion to create \"games that give back\", one of our long-term goals is to craft a health-centric version of Nevermind specifically targeted to help actual patients develop tools to manage and ultimately overcome their conditions. Funding from this Kickstarter Campaign will help support these efforts.\n\nNevermind started as a 2012 MFA thesis project at USC\u2019s Interactive Media Program, led by industry veteran Erin Reynolds - who returned to academia to pursue new ways to create \u201cpositive\u201d games for traditional gaming audiences. After an academic year, Erin and the Nevermind student development team were able to create one fully-functional level - a proof of concept that demonstrated Nevermind\u2019s unique vision and the feasibility of the core technology.\nNevermind has since been featured in numerous festivals and conferences, and nominated for several awards for innovation and technical achievement, including at IndieCade, Games for Change, SIGGRAPH, Unity Unite Awards, and the Serious Games Showcase and Challenge.\nNOTE: We have temporarily disabled the link below due to some reports that browsers are errantly marking it as potential malware.

This demo contains a rough version of the Neurostalgia Clinic and one full level (~45-90 minutes of gameplay).\nIf you want to play the old demo with true biofeedback functionality, you will need to use a Garmin Heart Rate Chest strap ($35) and an ANT+ USB stick ($45).\nWARNING: Some of the content in this demo depicts intense imagery and situations relating to the psychological trauma experienced by a fictional character. This demo and all Nevermind content in general, may upset, disturb, and act as a trigger for some viewers/players. As always, your discretion is advised.\nNevermind is being built by Flying Mollusk - a small, multifaceted, close-knit team of experienced developers each dedicated to both supporting and pushing each other to create the immersive, polished, compelling experience that players deserve.\nFor more about Erin and her inspirations for Nevermind, check out this fantastic (and in-depth!) interview with Jonathan Holmes on the Destructoid 'Sup Holmes Podcast!\nAs a result of Intel\u2019s generous support to help get us started, every dollar you contribute to this Kickstarter will go directly into making our campaign goals a reality! Below is a brief breakdown of how our funding will shake out for our current goal (breakdown for stretch goals may vary):\n20% - Additional biofeedback sensor integration, R&D, and support (including support for Mac-friendly devices)\n20% - Oculus Rift development and support (mostly Engineering)\n20% - Xbox One / Kinect 2.0 integration, optimization and support (mostly Engineering)\n15% - Production, Design, and Art support as needed for aforementioned goals\n10% - Kickstarter and Amazon Fulfillment Fees\n10% - Taxes\n5% - Unfulfilled payments\nNOTE: This last entry is not an expense per se, but statistically ~5% of Kickstarter payments are never able to processed due to account issues, so alas, we need to take it into account.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about Nevermind and it\u2019s potential to change the way we look at positive games, biofeedback technology, and horror games as a whole.\nJoin us in helping to make this revolutionary new experience a reality so we can share this game to help and entertain players around the world. We are extremely passionate about this opportunity, and all your support is hugely appreciated.\nHere's to continuing the journey ahead!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNevermind combines exciting, cutting-edge technology with the uniquely immersive experiences that video games have to offer. That said, much of this technology, has yet to be successfully integrated into a commercial video game. While we see this as an incredibly exciting challenge and are confident that we'll figure out solutions to any issues that arise (given our past experience with the proof of concept), it does present an element of uncertainty. \n\nIf we reach our funding goal, we will do everything in our power to research the current and future consumer-level biofeedback sensor options available. We will try our darnedest to make Nevermind as compatible as possible with as many sensors as possible - including sensors that are Mac-compatible, the Kinect 2.0 sensor, etc. However, at the end of the day, there is always a small chance that some of the sensor options available just won't work - and we won't know for certain until we have our hands on them and the dedicated time to deeply research them. It's a bit of a catch 22 because the Kickstarter funding will provide the resources necessary to this research and development, but it\u2019s also very likely that certain sensor options won't work as well as we'd like. \n\nIn particular, although we feel confident that we will be able to find at least one solution (both the Apple Watch and Affectiva Affdex software come to mind), we do not yet have a Mac-friendly biofeedback sensor solution fully tested.\n\nThe good news is that we already have one sensor fully working on Windows PC (the Garmin chest strap) and are in the process of integrating another sensor (the Intel RealSense 3D Camera). We've done a ton of research on other sensor options and wouldn't have launched this Kickstarter campaign if we weren't confident that there are many other very viable sensors out there just waiting to be hooked up to Nevermind.\n\nNonetheless, we want to make sure everyone is aware of the potential uncertainties of the adventure ahead!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Nevermind Merch!", "update_content": "Hi Everyone!\nGuess what?!

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you.

If we make it to $10,000 I'll do principle photography work on a followup of knitting projects for book lovers using librarians as some of the models using the backdrop of the Las Vegas desert.

Librarians: do you have requests of what would be useful to you? Let me know.\n\n\n$6,000 New Stretch Goal: Documentary Video! - Goal Met!\nIf we can get to $6,000 I can afford to bring a videographer with me and shoot a short documentary about why libraries are important.

Backer update coming soon.\n*** EDIT ***\n\nIn February of 2014 did a photo essay called \"This is what a librarian looks like\" which was published by Slate Magazine and instantly went viral, rapidly becoming the most popular photo essay they'd ever run. That project consisted of thirty portraits and interviews with librarians on the challenges they faced and the role libraries play in a world where many people have reliable Internet connections and amazon prime accounts. \n\nI realize that the story is incomplete and I want to go to the ALA's big conference this summer in Las Vegas and try and do at least a hundred portraits and interviews to get a bigger, broader, picture (so to speak) of what libraries and librarians are doing today. \n\nUltimately I'd like to see this come out as a book, but more immediately I want to create a touring gallery show that can be easily hung and shipped for libraries, galleries, coffee shops and offices and make it available for libraries to show, for free, to help tell the story.

With the help of our incredible backers, we have unlocked every stretch goal, funded a staggering 60 worlds, and reached 1000% of our original funding target. This has been an incredible campaign and we are deeply grateful for the support we've received.\n(Are you a backer looking for your Beta invite? Please see the first FAQ at the bottom of this page \u2014 the info you need is there!)\n\u201cStorium is everything I never knew I always wanted in a game.\u201d \u2014 Eve Jacob, playtester\nStories are part of what makes us human. They\u2019re all around us, from books and movies to TV and video games. Experiencing a good story can be one of life\u2019s great pleasures. But telling your own can be even more fun!\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve devoted the last year of our lives to creating Storium, the online storytelling game. We\u2019ve been playtesting an early version for months with hundreds of people. The feedback has been amazing, and we\u2019re ready to bring Storium to the public. We need your help to make it happen.\nStorium is a web-based online game that you play with friends. It works by turning writing into a multiplayer game. With just your computer, tablet, or smartphone, you can choose from a library of imaginary worlds to play in, or build your own. You create your story\u2019s characters and decide what happens to them. You can tell any kind of story with Storium. The only limit is your imagination.\nStorium uses familiar game concepts inspired by card games, role-playing games, video games, and more. In each Storium game, one player is the narrator, and everyone else takes on the role of a character in the story. The narrator creates dramatic challenges for the other players to overcome. In doing so, they move the story forward in a new direction. Everyone gets their turn at telling the story.\n\u201cStory and Game had a baby, and it\u2019s Storium. This is vital stuff, equal parts revolutionary and fundamental \u2014 giving the old ways of storytelling a major digital upgrade.\u201d\u2014 Chuck Wendig, novelist and screenwriter\nThe following three-minute video gives you a glimpse of our current beta playtest:\nWhat makes Storium special?\nTotal freedom: You decide what happens in your story.\nMultiplayer: Write and play with your friends, online.\nAsynchronous: Play at your own pace.\nWorlds: Pre-made playsets that help you tell stories in different settings and styles.\nSomething for everyone: You can tell any kind of story you want!\n\u201cStorium is one of the most fascinating systems I\u2019ve ever used to facilitate games, and it\u2019s helped me fall in love with storytelling all over again.\u201d\u2013 Lillian Cohen-Moore, playtester\nThis campaign funds the work that\u2019s needed to launch Storium to the general public. That means:\n1. Worlds for you to play in\nStorium needs a wider library of what we call worlds. Each world is a complete playset that gives you all the tools you need to play a game in a certain style or fictional setting. This includes virtual playing cards that drive gameplay, ideas for stories, pre-made characters, and backstory. We\u2019ve assembled an award-winning group of novelists, game designers, storytellers, and artists to create these worlds. Some worlds are wholly new, while others are adaptations of worlds you\u2019ll recognize.\n2. Important features\nThere are key features that Storium still needs. Your support will help us build them. This list is subject to change based on prioritization and technical feasibility, but here are a few of the examples we are considering:\nReal-time play: Chat and play live with your friends when they\u2019re online.\nShared narration: Give everyone in your game a chance to be the narrator.\nParallel storytelling: Play out two scenes at the same time with different characters.\nImproved support for tablets and smartphones: Play using interfaces created specifically for your mobile device.\n3. Technology and team\nOperating an online service like Storium can be a labor-intensive and expensive task. While it's easy to use and play, behind the scenes Storium is a complex piece of engineering. It requires dedicated, ongoing developer attention. We also have to pay for servers, storage, and a number of underlying services upon which the system relies. As Storium grows, these costs increase. \n\nWe\u2019ve been working full-time on Storium without pay for over a year now. That\u2019s how much this project means to us. We've set our target goal as low as possible, but anything we raise beyond that helps ensure that as Storium grows and evolves, we\u2019ll be able to keep up by investing in the technology and people we need.\n\n\u201cStorium revolutionizes storytelling not by new bells and whistles but by returning it to its most pure form in this most complex of ages \u2014 dynamic characters and people telling evocative and passionate stories.\u201d \u2014 John Adamus, playtester\n\n\n\nHere's a visual overview of the rewards we're offering!\nAnd here are more details about a few of the more popular rewards:\nBeta player\nEvery backer at the BETA PLAYER ($10) level gets instant access to our current beta test of Storium. You\u2019ll find an invitation URL in campaign update #1 (backers only). This URL enables you to immediately sign-up, start a game, and invite your friends to play with you.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is an early test version of Storium. We expect it to change and grow quite a bit before the public launch. As a beta player, we welcome your feedback. There\u2019s a \u201cGive feedback\u201d button at the top of every page that goes to a built-in playtesters-only feedback system.\n\nMember\nWhen it launches to the public, Storium will have a modest annual membership fee of $25 per year \u2014 the equivalent of just $2 per month. Becoming a backer at the MEMBER ($20) level gets you your first year of Storium membership (starting on the date we launch publicly) for just $20.\n\nMembers will also be granted a special ability when Storium launches publicly: the use of our forthcoming World Creator tools to build their own Storium worlds and share them with the Storium community.\n\n(By the way, there will always be a free version of Storium \u2014 and it will be the full game, not a demo version. You\u2019ll be able to play up to three games, with full functionality, before you have to pay any membership fee!)\n\nWe want to grow Storium into a sustainable business, and we want to do it without plastering the game with advertisements. Our membership fee will help make that possible.\n\nThe Deal\nOur campaign starts by funding ten worlds, but we have dozens more in the works from a wide array of award-winning creators. Every backer at THE DEAL ($40) level will get a year of Storium membership, plus early and ongoing access to every world that we fund through this Kickstarter. This means you'll always be able to play games in these worlds, regardless of whatever they end up costing in the future.\n\n(When Storium launches publicly, many of our Kickstarter worlds will have a small fee for usage. Much like how Apple's App Store works, Storium world creators will have the option of charging app-like prices for their worlds. We will then pass on the majority of the proceeds to the world's creator! We hope this will become great new way for players and fans alike to support the authors and designers whose work they love.)\n\n\"I work nights and weekends and haven\u2019t been able to game with my friends in years.

Watch these playthroughs the current proof of concept of Nevermind!\nMarkiplier\nSean \"Day[9]\" Plott\nNevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced horror adventure game that takes you into the dark and twisted world within the subconscious minds of trauma victims.\nAs you explore surreal labyrinths and solve the puzzles of the mind, a biofeedback sensor monitors how scared or stressed you become with each passing moment. If you let your fears get the best of you, the game will become harder. If you\u2019re able to calm yourself in the face of terror, the game will be more forgiving.\nNevermind\u2019s goal is to create an unforgettable gameplay experience that also teaches players how to be more aware of their internal responses to stressful situations. If you can learn to control your anxiety within the disturbing realm of Nevermind, just imagine what you can do when it comes to those inevitable stressful moments in the real world\u2026\nAlthough the biofeedback element takes Nevermind to the next level, you can always play Nevermind without ANY biofeedback hardware and still enjoy it as a surreal, mysterious, atmospheric adventure game. \nMore details in the FAQ at the bottom of this page!\nAs seen in: Kotaku, Polygon, Huffington Post, Fox News Business, Upworthy, GameTrailers, Joystiq, IGN, GameInformer, Wired UK, GamesBeat, FastCompany, PCGamer, KillScreen, BloodyDisgusting,\nGameZone, GizMag, PSFK, Rock, Paper, Shotgun and many more!\n\"...let's just say it's like if Telltale made a creepier, slightly more puzzle-oriented horror game that makes you question your own sanity.\" - Tina Amini, Kotaku\n\u201cThis sounds super cool, if you ask me.\u201d - Kirk Hamilton, Kotaku \n\"And it works. Not only was the game obviously tuned to my emotional state, by the end of the journey I found myself pausing and taking a deep breath to slow my heart rate and more calmly tackle the nightmares that confronted me.\" - Brian Crecente, Polygon\n\u201cIt\u2019ll play a bit like a free-roaming version of Myst, but with the scare factor of Slender and the visual aesthetic of a Nine Inch Nails video directed by Kyle Cooper of Se7en\u2019s title sequence fame. You know, the stuff bad dreams are made of.\u201d - Will Johnston, Xbox One Gamer Magazine\n\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in seeing this game come to Windows, Mac and possibly at least the Xbox One, fund it. If you support indie game developers, fund it. If you love horror, fund it. Hell, if you just take games seriously and think that they have more applications than just fun and random bits of escapism, fund it. I did.\u201d - Jonathan Gronli, Technology Tell\nPLAY\n\nNevermind is - at its core - an adventure game (in the spirit of classic games like Myst), where you must explore strange worlds and solve puzzles to unlock the terrifying mystery that lurks within each patient\u2019s inner psyche. \nIn Nevermind, you are a Neuroprober - a unique physician who, through the use of cutting-edge technology, is able to venture into the minds of psychological trauma victims for whom traditional treatment methods have proved ineffective.\nPhotos represent the patient's memories - discover and collect them to ultimately solve the mystery locked within their mind.\nAs such, each \u201clevel\u201d in Nevermind takes place within the surreal subconscious of one of these victims. Your goal is to explore the often dark and twisted world within, solving abstract puzzles as you recover fragments of memories (represented by photographs) surrounding the traumatic event. \nTraumatic experiences, especially those left untreated, take their toll in countless ways, often triggering other serious problems as the victim\u2019s subconscious desperately tries to cope. As a result, the patient\u2019s mind doesn\u2019t take kindly to those who attempt to peel back these layers, often prompting it to lash out in terrifying, unexpected ways.\nOnly the most vigilant of Neuroprobers can survive the horrors of the mind to help their patient find peace at last. \nCan you?\nNevermind started as a 2012 MFA thesis project at USC\u2019s Interactive Media Program, led by industry veteran Erin Reynolds - who returned to academia to pursue new ways to create \u201cpositive\u201d games for traditional gaming audiences. After an academic year, Erin and the Nevermind student development team were able to create one fully-functional level - a proof of concept that demonstrated Nevermind\u2019s unique vision and the feasibility of the core technology.\nNevermind has since been featured in numerous festivals and nominated for several awards for innovation and technical achievement, including at IndieCade, Games for Change, SIGGRAPH, Unity Unite Awards, and the Serious Games Showcase and Challenge.\nIn light of Nevermind\u2019s critical success, Erin decided to take the plunge - leaving her industry job to commit herself fully to make her dream of a full-featured, commercially viable version of Nevermind a reality. With your support, Nevermind will be the next great horror adventure game - unlike anything you've played before!\nBIGGER, BETTER, SCARIER\n The final commercial version of Nevermind will contain at least 4 levels (more if we hit our stretch goals!), for 5+ hours of gameplay PLUS the time and resources to feature even higher quality environments to complement a broader variety of new, more terrifying themes and traumas.\nPLAY\n\nMORE WAYS TO PLAY\nAlthough the current prototype is only available for PC, we will also be bringing Nevermind to Mac. On that note, we are thrilled to report that Nevermind has been pre-approved by Valve for release on Steam!\nFurthermore we are excited to explore supporting the Oculus Rift and the Virtuix Omni, and are actively in conversation with Microsoft about bringing Nevermind to the Xbox One!\nNevermind uses biofeedback technology to detect your Heart Rate Variability while playing. When you start to become scared or anxious, the game will dynamically respond to your stress levels, which in turn directly affects gameplay. \nPLAY\n\nThe current demo features full biofeedback integration using an off-the-shelf Garmin Heart Rate Monitor strap (similar to what one would use for exercise) as a means of proving out the technology. As part of Nevermind\u2019s development, we will be aggressively looking to support as many biofeedback sensors as possible, especially those with existing market penetration. This includes upcoming devices from Garmin and Polar, as well as innovative camera technology like the Xbox One\u2019s Kinect 2.0.\nNO HARDWARE? NO PROBLEM.\nAlthough the biofeedback element takes Nevermind to the next level, you can always play Nevermind without ANY biofeedback hardware and still have a great time. In the absence of hardware technology, we use secondary responsive cues (such as camera and player movement) to emulate the biofeedback experience. \nNonetheless, our goal is to support as many hardware devices as possible to ensure every player has the opportunity to use a low cost, multi-function biofeedback device to \u201cenjoy\u201d the true Nevermind experience.\nNOTE: We are currently in discussion with hardware partners to try and secure biofeedback sensors at a discounted rate exclusively for our Kickstarter backers. WE CANNOT PROMISE THIS DISCOUNT, but we hope to have an update before the end of the campaign. \nThe best way to ensure you get the necessary hardware is to back the project at the Nevermind R&D Director level!\nOne exciting facet of Nevermind is its potential to serve as a full-fledged therapeutic tool for those who suffer from issues - mild or severe - relating to stress, anxiety, PTSD, or other similar conditions. Although informal testing results have been promising thus far, we are excited to be in discussion as we speak with researchers who are eager to explore Nevermind's potential impact via rigorous clinical trials. \nAs a prime example of our passion to create \"games that give back\", one of our long-term goals is to craft a health-centric version of Nevermind specifically targeted to help actual patients develop tools to manage and ultimately overcome their conditions.\nPLAY\n\nTo make the most of every resource made available, Nevermind will be built with a small, elite, multifaceted, close knit team of experienced developers each dedicated to both supporting and pushing each other to create the immersive, polished, compelling experience that players deserve.\nErin Reynolds - Creative Director / Artist / Designer\nErin is the Creative Director, Project Lead, Artist, and Designer for Nevermind, and remains the core visionary behind its growth into a full-featured product. She strongly believes in the power of games to have a positive impact on the lives of players, and has dedicated more than 10 years of game development experience as a Designer, Artist, and Producer at studios small and large to make it happen.\nIn addition to her games being nominated for awards at many festivals, in 2011 she won multiple awards from the White House for her work creating positive games, and has been recognized by Red Bull (via the Stratos project) as part their efforts to explore the limits of human potential.\n Greg Hillegas - Project Manager / Designer\nGreg brings over 18 years of development experience in game design, production, and creative consulting experience as an integral member of AAA development teams that created award-winning titles across a host of different platforms, including the Medal of Honor and Call of Duty series. Greg will be responsible for managing the day to day production of the project, while also supporting development via level and puzzle design. Furthermore, Greg will be a key contributor to establishing relationships with external partners to help bring Nevermind to as many platforms as possible.\nMichael Annetta - R&D Producer (Emergent Tech & Therapeutic Applications)\nMichael is a Producer and Designer with over 10 years of experience who specializes in emergent technology - primarily in stereoscopy and transmedia - and thus will be exploring relationships with technology and therapeutic partners to maximize Nevermind\u2019s reach and impact.\n Derek Baird - Composer\nDerek composed the original, haunting score for Nevermind, including helping to design its unique dynamic audio system. He will reprise his role as the primary composer for the final project.\nNewt & Loki - CSOs (Chief Sleep Officers)\nHaving been involved in the games industry for their entire lives, Newt and Loki are dedicated to collaboratively covering any and all sleep needs on behalf of the team. This will allow Erin and the gang to stay up for weeks at a time and stay 110% focused on making Nevermind the best game it can be. \nEngineers, Artists, and more!\nWith the news that Nevermind was being developed further, a number of top tier developers from around the industry (including some original team members) have expressed interested in rejoining the team. This includes hardware and gameplay engineers, environment artists, animators, and more. \nMany of these future team members are waiting in the wings, eager to join the project! However, due to existing commitments, they cannot publicly reveal their involvement. That said, once certain funding goals are hit, we can't wait to share more about those who will be joining us!\nFor more about Erin, the team, and her inspirations for Nevermind, check out her fantastic (and legthy!) interview with Jonathan Holmes on the 'Sup Holmes Podcast!\nDigital Download of NEVERMIND (PC or MAC)\nA digital download (via Steam) of the final version of Nevermind on the available platform of your choice.

We also love to doodle!  One day, I taught Charlotte about circuit boards and capacitors - and guess what we did?  Yes, we doodled!  We doodled, created games and told each other amazing stories about our computer circuit cartoon characters.\nThen I had my a-ha moment, as a society we lack computer science characters in children's learning media.  By using a cartoon character/avatar, I was able to spark my daughter's interest in computer science and make learning fun for her!  This is when the Giggle Chips were born!\nOur Project \nInspired by my \"kidpreneur,\" we created the Giggle Chips' ABC Computer Science Game Cards.

It\u2019s just that they were equally immersed in everyone else\u2019s.\n-- from \"The Invention of Separate People,\" by Kevin Brockmeier (one of more than twenty new short stories to be included in the next edition of Unstuck)\nUNSTUCK #3\nUnstuck is an annually published anthology series. We emphasize stories, poems, and essays with elements of the fantastic, the futuristic, the surreal, and the strange. Over the past two years, we've featured new work from writers like Steve Almond, Aimee Bender, Kate Bernheimer, Jedediah Berry, Arthur Bradford, Matthew Cheney, Brian Conn, Caitlin Horrocks, J. Robert Lennon, Jonathan Lethem, Elizabeth McCracken, Ed Park, Mary Ruefle, Donald Revell, Tomaz Salamun, Rachel Swirsky, Daniel Wallace, and Dean Young. We've been praised in The New York Times, Tor.com and Poets and Writers, and reprinted in Harper's and Electric Literature's Recommended Reading.\nOur upcoming third edition is going to be our best yet, with contributions from Matt Bell, Kevin Brockmeier, Edward Carey, Matthew Derby, Rikki Ducornet, Amelia Gray, Etgar Keret, Paul Lisicky, Michael Martone, Joe Meno, Rick Moody, Patrick Somerville, Kellie Wells, and many others. Like the first two volumes, #3 will feature dozens of original line drawings by Matthew Domiteaux.\nThe stories in the book will include robots, ghosts, cowboys, sentient lakes, miracle elixirs, matadors, mermaids, and circus magic. Want to know more? Every day during this Kickstarter drive, we'll add a new excerpt from Unstuck #3 to our blog.\nSHORT STORY CONTEST\nThrough the 30 days of this Kickstarter campaign, we'll be holding our second flash fiction open. Entry to this contest is free for our Twitter followers. We'll accept any fiction submission of fewer than 1000 words. Our final judge is Amelia Gray, author of THREATS, Museum of the Weird, and AM/PM. Winning stories will be published in Unstuck #3. More details are available here.\nA ONE-OF-A-KIND COLLECTIBLE\nFor our top reward this year, we've come up with something really unusual. We're creating a mini-anthology called The Unstuck Guide to Food and Drink. This book will include a few of the best and weirdest food-related stories and poems we've published in our first three volumes. It will also feature some new drawings by Matthew Domiteaux (who, by the way, used to be a chef). We're going to print and bind, at most, ten copies of this collectible book. Every one of them will be numbered and unique, made by hand by Associate Editor Janalyn Guo.\nYou can see some of Janalyn's beautiful books in the photos below, and in the video above. The backer reward books will vary as dramatically as the books in these pictures: different bindings, different colors and patterns, different page sizes, etc. The only thing that all ten books will have in common is the content.\nSTRETCH GOAL\nWe currently plan to publish Unstuck #3 in a perfect-bound print edition and as an e-book in the PDF format. If we reach our stretch goal of $10,000, we'll hire a professional e-book designer to convert Unstuck #3 to the Kindle and EPUB formats. (If your backer reward includes a PDF edition, you'll have the option of switching to one of these other formats.) Any funds we raise beyond that point will be used to expand our print run (and our distribution, through Ingram, to North American bookstores), and perhaps to give some sort of payment to a few of the people, like our illustrator, who have donated their work for the past few years.\nABOUT UNSTUCK BOOKS\nWe're an independent, volunteer-driven 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so certain donations may be tax-deductible.

We have a process that has been proven to produce more meaningful exchanges. We want to engage the American people in broad, civil conversations around the most divisive subjects, starting with the issues surrounding gun violence. \nYeah, we've been worried about that too, and we're not the only ones. That's why we've developed this technique (and the technology to run it) called Small Group Dialogues. What we've learned is that even though conversations on the web often suck, that's not because people do. The early and lasting implementation of the web just wasn't built for civility. We've used SGD before and studied the impact. It fosters civility and transforms arguments into discussions. \nIn short, participants are put into small groups sorted for diversity, and asked to commit to make regular contributions over a fixed period of time. They are also asked to participate using their real name. This combination of small groups, commitment to each other and transparency about identity are the critical combination that allows civil conversation to take place. The best of these conversations and the insights from participant surveys become the material for a capstone report. Want to know more about the process? The report \"Transforming Dialogues\" (PDF), jointly funded by the MacArthur Foundation and the Markle Foundation, goes deep.\nEach small group dialogue session lasts for three weeks, with new groups starting on a rolling basis as participants sign up. The overall effort, America On: Guns, will open first groups in December and continue to form new ones through January, with the last dialogues concluding in February. We expect to have the major report completed and distributed by the end of March.\nWe can move more nimbly using Kickstarter than through a long granting cycle, but more importantly, Kickstarter lets us connect directly to you, the people whose voices we want in this important conversation. Through direct contribution of program costs, you become part of the community crucial to its success.  \nBecause we've been developing this technology continuously for 15 years (we used it recently with the Smithsonian Museum of American History), we're able to deploy these dialogues quickly. Reaching out to communities of participants, curating the live conversations and developing and evangelizing the resulting report are all about having a team dedicated to the effort. If just 500 people pledge $15, we'll launch America on Guns in December. If we exceed our goal, any additional funds will go towards expanding the participant outreach and enriching the depth and breadth of the report. If you'd like to pledge more (or less) than the $15, we'd of course appreciate it (you can use the \"Other\" button in the pledge process) but we believe we could bootstrap from a passionate community of small donors. We'd love your support, and we need your voice!\nAll backers of the project, starting at the $15 Community Level, will receive early invitations to the first dialogue groups and your name as a Friend on the America On website. You'll also have access to an early draft of the resulting report to provide additional feedback for the final version. \nIf you'd like to give a bit more, the $25 Supporter Level throws in a \"Be Civil\" coffee mug. The Advocate Level comes in at $50 and sets you up with a \"Be Civil\" cell phone charger for your commute.\nAnd finally, the $300 Producer Level includes the Community Level perks and provides a chance to learn more about the SGD process through a web-based workshop, and a lunch with the team in New York City. \nAfter the dialogues are completed, we\u2019ll combine pre- and post-participation surveys with extended excerpts from the best of the conversations into a report to distribute more broadly. The report\u2019s goal is to focus on the benefits of civil discourse for identifying common ground and surprising insights, in the hope of softening the hardened lines of disagreement. We\u2019ll distribute this report broadly to the press, action organizations and politicians. \nWe're GMD Studios, a small innovation shop focused on how to create more meaningful experiences for communities and groups.

Or did you used to play tabletop minis games and had to stop because of your busy schedule? Or maybe you play all the time and want a way to get your friends or family members into miniatures gaming too. Well, these are some of the reasons why we're creating Golem Arcana - the digitally-enhanced miniatures game. \nThe key to Golem Arcana\u2019s seamless connection between the tabletop and your mobile device is the Bluetooth-enabled Tabletop Digital Interface Stylus (TDI). The stylus sends the tabletop game information to your touchscreen phone or tablet, making record-keeping automatic. Important game information is all quickly searchable at your fingertips. Plus, all Golem Arcana figures come fully assembled and painted* so you can start playing right out of the box. \n*If you want to paint your own figures, then check out the unpainted resin figures in the Optional Items Menu down the page.\nHere are the highlights of a live Grudge Match between two of our engineers. Check it out to see which one lost his beard!  \nThe Golem Arcana Base Game, along with your smartphone or tablet, provides everything you need for a great, fast-playing, two-player skirmish. From there, you can EXPAND Golem Arcana to field larger armies of Golems, create larger battlefields, and play with up to eight players.\nGolem Foundry, by Kekai Kotaki\nGolems are giant magical constructs of branch, bone, and stone which are mastered in battle by combat Mages called Golem Knights and the royal Blood Knights. \nGolems are crafted in four size classes: War Sprite, Ogre, Titan, and Colossus.\nThe world of Golem Arcana was sculpted by the Ancient Ones, who crafted the Golems. While much of their magical knowledge has been lost in the millennia since they ascended, the crafting of Golems is still possible, governed by the few remaining magical Codexes they left behind.\nRegardless of the Reward Tier you select, all of these Golem figures are also available for purchase on the Optional Items Menu. \nGolem Arcana is balanced by players agreeing upon a point value for the armies they field. Each unit in the game (Golems, Knights, and Ancient Ones) is worth a set amount of army points, so you select the ones you want, add up their value and start playing, And don\u2019t worry about making a mistake - the App does all the math.\nThere are three types of characters used in Golem Arcana armies: Golems, Knights, and Ancient Ones. They represent three layers of gameplay you can combine to customize your army and create new strategies.\nWar Council, by Kekai Kotaki\nGolems, represented by the pre-painted miniatures on the game board. \nGolems are ridden into combat by mighty Golem Knights, who are represented digitally in the Golem Arcana App. Each Golem Knight has a powerful special ability that augments the Golem's - and sometimes the whole army. Part of your strategy in designing a Golem Arcana army is to pair specific Golem Knights with specific Golems to create a beneficial combination of abilities.\nExtraordinary Golem Knights, known as Blood Knights, are the direct descendants of the Ancient Ones. Due to their celestial bloodline, and in addition to their special ability, Blood Knights may also channel the magical energy of the Earth - called Mana - to an Ancient One ancestor. In exchange for Mana, the Ancient One will bestow Miracles, Blessings, and Curses to Blood Knight descendants to aid them on the battlefield. Both Blood Knights and Ancient Ones are represented digitally in the Golem Arcana App.\nHamazi Maelstrom, by Kekai Kotaki\n\u201cBlood, Bloodlines, and Golems are the materials from which history is built.\u201d \n- Jauti Ishtimesh, Learned Master of the University of Ur\nThe setting for Golem Arcana begins after the meteoric rise and fall of the Great Khan. In the ensuing chaos, conquered tribes and clans rise up to reclaim their sovereignty, neighboring empires mobilize to reclaim lost territory and honor, all as the heirs of the Khan battle each other for control of the Uruk Dominion. \nThe Empires, Tribes, and Clans of Golem Arcana are led by powerful Blood Knights whose ancestry determines which codexes of Golems are fielded in their armies.  \nThe World of Eretsu is filled with stories both ancient and new. Yet Golems do not create history. That is the sole purview of people, as you will see in these short Tales of Eretsu.\nLORE: THE DARK WITCH \nLORE: TOOLS\nNadanna inherited her father's warrior heart and fiery crown, but she desires control of his entire Dominion and will happily kill her half brothers and sisters to secure it.\nA powerful and proven warrior-mage whose bloodlines trace back to the Urugal and Gudanna Ancient Ones, Raga (Princess) Nandanna has already drawn several of the Empire\u2019s key regiments to herself. She has mobilized them in her efforts to protect the Dominion and to eliminate any rivals for its throne. Jahnu, Great Khan, fathered over 100 children by almost as many wives, but left behind only 4 wives and 27 children - 26 of which Nandanna will need to cow or destroy in order for her to occupy her father\u2019s Saddle Throne.\nRead more about the Crown of Uruk in these short tales.\nLORE: CHILDS-PLAY\nLORE: NEGOTIATIONS\nPrincess Dasra mobilizes her Golem regiments to seek revenge on The Great Khan by retaking her lands and destroying his heirs in the process.\nThe thousand-year-old Hamazi Empire\u2019s prosperous northern region is ruled by the Raga Dasra, great-granddaughter of His Highness the Supreme Emperor. Dasra stings from humiliation at having to pay tribute to the Great Khan after the defeats she suffered from the armies of the Lower Empire and seeks to right the scales by capitalizing on the collapse of his Dominion. As sinuous and cold blooded as the snake of her family crest, she carefully calculates every move in her secret campaign to capitalize on the collapse of his Dominion and assume the Empire\u2019s Gilded Throne.\nRead more about the the Upper Hamazi Empire in this short tale.\nLORE: THE VIPER PRINCESS\nPrince, outcast, mercenary, and now as the last of his bloodline, Vanya leads the remains of his tribe against the Empire that destroyed his family and their lands.\n\u201cYou cannot grow unless you put down roots\u201d was the motto of Vanya\u2019s great-grandmother, who convinced the Samula Tribe to give up their nomadic life over a three hundred years ago. After his wild ways caused his mother to expel him from the tribe, Vanya became a mercenary fighting for outlying Zikia Tribes and Urugal Clans who were attempting to stop the onslaught of the Uruk Dominion. Vanya returned home years later to find his mother dead and her orchards a charred tombstone to his great-grandmother\u2019s vision. Rallying the Tribes\u2019 survivors, he now leads them against the Hamazi Empire whose greed and arrogance resulted in the scorched Zikia land.\nRead more about the Samula Tribe in this short tale.\nLORE: UTSUKA\nThe Blood Mage Rudatha has orchestrated the capture of many of his siblings, for he alone understands the Khan's true legacy.\nRaja Rudatha - or the \u201cSpider Prince\u201d as some call him - never leaves the serenity of his library, but his webs of information and influence cover the Dominion like a blanket. Yet land is not Rudatha\u2019s focus, for he alone among his vast number of siblings understands the Great Khan\u2019s true legacy. Where most see only the lands taken from conquered enemies, Rudatha sees in each of his father\u2019s conquests another Ancient One bloodline woven into his own. Each of the Great Khan\u2019s heirs is a weapon, for each represents a different combination of Ancient Ones that he or she can call on for supernatural support in battle. Rudatha plans to collect the whole set.\nRead more about the Blood of Uruk in this short tale.\nLORE: WEBS OF THE SPIDER\nLORE: THE DARK GARDEN\nSudhamra, prince of the people, has converted a rebellious populous into new regiments who unknowingly march to war only to reclaim the Emperor's lost honor.\nBorn to a Zikia Princess who had escaped from the Emperor\u2019s harem, Sudhamra grew up in the rebellious slums of his people in the Lower Hamazi Empire. Forcibly recruited into the army, he gained glory in battle and rose quickly through the ranks to be the youngest commander ever of the Empire\u2019s elite Western Wind regiment. When the armies of the Lower Empire where humbled by the Great Khan, only Sudhamra\u2019s Western Wind stood tall, but even so, it was a shock when he was selected to be Raja, Prince of the Lower Empire. After 500 years of the Lower Empire being ruled by Princes sent from the North, the people have a Prince of their own and they shower him with undying loyalty. Now Raja Sudhamra marches with the support of his people to reclaim the honor of the Empire!\nRead more about the Lower Hamazi Empire in this short tale.\nLORE: STRANGE MESSAGES\nLORE: THE JADE GUARDIANS\nGiven as a child to The Great Khan to secure a peace treaty, Izvari returned home to till her father and take his throne. She now seeks justice from those that once called her \"sister\".\nBefore he became the Great Khan, he was Jahnu Khan of Clan Uruk, whose ancient enemy was the neighboring Clan Sunu. But Jahnu was not like his ancestors. When he attacked Clan Sunu, it had nothing to do with tribal feuds - he was looking for the lost Codex of the Gudanna. As soon as Jahnu raided the tomb he was looking for, he stripped it of clues and sued for peace with Clan Sunu, agreeing never to attack them again as long as he lived. Bijin, Khan of the Clan Sunu, agreed and offered his daughter Izvari as a gift of thanks. Izvari became one of the Great Khan\u2019s wards and was educated by the Uruk court\u2019s best tutors but she was savagely schooled by the heirs to Jahnu\u2019s Saddle Throne. Izvari may have shed more tears at Jahnu\u2019s funeral pyre than her own father\u2019s but that will not stop her from destroying his children and reclaiming the lost honor of her Clan.\nRead more about the Clan Sunu in this short tale.\nLORE: IT IS OUR WAY\nWhen you pledge at the Blood Knight tier, just drop us a Kickstarter mail letting us know which character you\u2019re interested in (along with an an alternate), and if it\u2019s still available, we\u2019ll update the image to say it\u2019s taken.

Again, use Kickstarter mail to let us know and we\u2019ll update the image below to let everyone know how many slots are left in each faction.\nThe items below are available for purchase right now in the Optional Items Menu. \n100% cotton preshrunk (\"Ultra Cotton\"), crew neck, men (S to 5XL), ladies (XS to 3XL)\nElite Units\nMany factions in Golem Arcana boast Elite Units with their own unique back-stories and tactical abilities. These Elite Units of four pre-painted plastic figures each sport their own special edition paint & statistics and come with an Elite Unit banner for their bases to call attention to their special status on the battlefield. Elite Units will have separate army point values than standard figures to ensure game balance.\n                                                                                  To purchase Optional Items:\n1. Find the stuff you want to buy on the Optional Items Menu and add up the prices\n2. Choose a reward tier (if you haven\u2019t backed the project yet) or press the blue \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button (if you\u2019ve already selected a reward tier).\n3. Enter the TOTAL of all the stuff you want AND the amount you pledged in the \u201cPledge amount\u201d box.\nIn the example above, Robin backed the project at the $110 Warrior Tier and wants to buy a War Sprite for $11, a Titan for $15, and a Colossus for $44, bringing her total to $180.\n4. Select \u201cContinue to the next step\u201d and follow the instructions. All you\u2019re doing at this point is \u201cbanking\u201d a lump sum to use on figures after the Kickstarter is over.\n5. Once the Kickstarter ends, we\u2019ll send you a link to a special backer tool that will contain the lump sum you've already banked. All you need to do then is select the stuff you want!\nWe're very excited to share our vision for where Golem Arcana can go if we exceed our funding goal. Watch the video below to find out what's possible.\nThe key to Golem Arcana\u2019s seamless connection between the tabletop and your mobile device is the Tabletop Digital Interface Stylus (TDI).\nThe Golem Arcana App knows where all your figures are because each figure\u2019s base and the game board are covered with invisible microdots. When you touch a figure with the stylus, information is transferred to the app via Bluetooth technology. The App immediately identifies which figure it is, all its capabilities, and its position on the game board. When you touch the stylus to a new region of the game board, the app instantly knows whether the move is valid or not.\nWhen you touch an enemy figure, the App automatically can tell if the attack is blocked by intervening terrain, what the range modifiers are, what the terrain modifiers are, and applies the benefits or drawbacks from characters\u2019 active magical abilities.\nThe Golem Arcana App knows all the game rules so you can\u2019t accidentally break them. You don\u2019t need to read a rulebook because everything you need to know is available on screen or with a tap of your finger or your stylus. New players learn the game quickly by following the onscreen prompts and listening to the audio feedback. Record keeping is a snap because the App tracks everything for you. It\u2019s a referee, rule book, and tracking device all-in-one. Together, the TDI stylus and App allow you to focus on what's important: face-to-face tabletop gaming in the exciting new game world of Golem Arcana (more on that later).\nBut the benefits of connecting your figures and terrain to your mobile device go way beyond automating the rules, eliminating the reference books, and handling all the record keeping for you. Golem Arcana brings features previously found in computer games to tabletop gaming. Features such as:  \nDYNAMIC SCENARIOS - Download new scenarios (such as King of the Hill, Control Points, and Defense) that keep the game fresh and evolving with new objectives, victory conditions, and terrain conditions. For example, in an Inferno scenario, all forest regions are on fire and do extra damage to any golems knocked into them.\nUPDATES & NEW CONTENT - Game mechanics and modifiers automatically update based upon our latest playtest data. No need to keep track of game supplements, errata sheets, or changes - the app does it for you! And we plan on a steady release of new content including: Campaigns, Golem Knights, Blood Knights, and Ancient Ones which will be directly available via in-app purchase.\nCOMMUNITY - Automatically upload leaderboard data, receive notifications of local events, play in easy-to-run tournaments, and more.\nSAVE GAME - Press the button, clear the table, and seamlessly resume play at any time.\nAnd these are just the beginning of the digital enhancements made possible by Golem Arcana\u2019s digital technology. Check out our STRETCH GOALS section to hear about some of the amazing things we can do if the project gets funded!\nNote that you do not need to be online to play Golem Arcana. You only need to connect to the Internet to download new updates and content, upload your game results, or take advantage of some community features.\nGolem Arcana is early in development so the game mechanics will continue to evolve, the user interface will be iterated upon several times, and the game balance will be changed and refined. If you choose to participate in our Beta Test Group Reward Tier, you can be part of that iteration process.\nMechanics Video\nThe video below provides an overview of the deeper mechanics and the kind of strategies and tactics that can emerge from using the Golems, Golem Knights, and Ancient Ones abilities in combination with each other.\nPDF of Prototype Rules\nHere's a link to a PDF that walks you through the rules that were used in the prototype played by more than 600 people at GenCon and PAX Prime. Note that while they form the foundation of the rules for the final game, there will be many changes between their current state and the final version.

We consider it to be very low.\n\nHardware Design and Production: Our working prototypes need to be turned into production-ready designs and we need to develop the Bluetooth 4 adapter for older phones and tablets. This is currently in the initial design phase. We have developed hardware before and have a proven hardware engineering team already contracted for the project.\n\nOverseas Manufacturing: The game pieces will be produced in China and thus may possibly be subject to production delays, shipping delays, and custom delays, but we have experience with Chinese manufacturing and will do all that is possible to minimize these potential risks. We have established relationships with several miniature figure factories and have already started vetting electronics factories for the production of the TDI stylus. \n\nApp Store Policies: The mobile App stores occasionally adopt new policies which may impact aspects of the game development and distribution. Should any policies impact our plans, we are confident that we will be able adapt those plans to be acceptable to the App stores. \n\nWe've done our best to minimize all the risks as far as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if, for some totally unforeseen reason, the game can't be delivered at all.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Final Update: The Book of Eretsu, Amulet of Numenesh, and New Expansions!", "update_content": "Hail, Knights of Eretsu!\nThe Book of Eretsu is Here!  \nJordan"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "The Book of Eretsu Update, New Golems, and BattleTech!", "update_content": "Hello backers!  \nIt's hard to believe it's been just a year since we released Golem Arcana at GenCon in 2014.

Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, steeped in blood and treasure hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease. Echoes of a dark and violent past from the dead eras resonate throughout and he can't help but listen.\nHyper Light Drifter is a 2D Action RPG in the vein of the best 8-bit and 16-bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.\nVisions for this game have been fluttering in my skull for ages; something dark and fantastic, with giant forests to navigate, huge floating structures to explore, deep crumbling ruins to loot, massive throngs of enemies to rend, and behemoths both flesh and mechanical to overcome. I want it all to be as beautiful as possible, forging color with the dark and eerie wastes and intimidating landscapes. It plays like the best parts of A Link to the Past and Diablo, evolved: lightning fast combat, more mobility, an array of tactical options, more numerous and intelligent enemies, and a larger world with a twisted past to do it all in.\nRip through enemies with responsive, fun combat; engaging and brutal. Upgrade weapons, discover new equipment and trek deeper than ever.\nTraverse a dark, detailed and interconnected world with alternate paths and secret loot. Miyazaki films have taught me that beautiful animation and design add life to a world. From characters to background elements, everything is lovingly crafted while I hum show-tunes and squint suspiciously at the flickering pixels until they perform as intended.\nA challenge - The game is accessible and easy to pick up, but difficult to master and complete; enemies and hazards become more vicious and numerous, so players must use clever tactics to avoid death. (Some yell hurtful phrases at players simply to bring tears to the cereal bowl below.)\n  Core Mechanics\nPrimary weapon - Composed of phase shifted Hard Light (also known as Solid Light), your sword acts as the primary means of offense; it's quick, brutal, and can slash through most anything. Best of all it never runs low on energy.\nSprite Companion - An indispensable personalized drone, the Sprite manages your inventory virtually, maintains your shields, seeks out hidden paths and lights the way in the darkest of times. Functionality may be expanded with new modules.\nSecondary items - You'll come across a variety of advanced weaponry, items and gear throughout your travels; Light Rail Pistols, Heavy Rifles, various hi-power explosives and enemy-aware Seeker Drones. All of these are powered by limited batteries, found scattered throughout the world. \nDefense System - A rechargeable Hard Light Diamond shield which offers total protection from attacks for a short burst of time. If timed correctly projectiles can be reflected back at enemies for extra damage. Can be upgraded to extend duration.\nDash Module - Multi-use gear that enables a triple speed dash; can be used to evade attacks, cut across gaps and chasms, break through certain blocks and rubble and even stun enemies.\nRifle\nRoly Poly\nFrom Sean Ward\nEnemy Sprites\nFrom Nick Wozniak\nFrom Ian Schlaepfer\nBoss Reveals\n#1\nSprite work: Johan Vinet\nName: Rivan The Tamer\nAttributes: User of searing RedShift light, causing great destruction when attacking.

I want to fully indulge this vision, so I will use the funds to further the quality of the game rather than bolster any after-thoughts.\nOn $180,000 Goal:\nThere are so many great artists, illustrators, writers, wonderfully creative people that I'm surrounded by and I want them in on this! I plan to commission small pieces of art to flesh out the world; they can create new character that live in this world, write new lore, and punch out some rad art, all within the limitations of the history and style of this world. All work will be collected in the Companion Art Book and their pieces featured on our site once they start producing!\nOn $200,000 Goal:\nThe Companion Art Book is a physical compendium of knowledge and reference materials, high res unused art assets and never before seen art works for the project. It will also include commissioned pieces and extended lore for the world and characters within created by several artists throughout the community as well as a collection of some of the fan art that has been and continues to be posted. (Love it all!) this will be available for purchase after the campaign has ended, once everything has been commissioned and compiled. \nNotes on PS4 + Vita + Wii U + OUYA support\nREVISION! I'd like for everyone to be able to get the version they want. If you have already contributed at the $10 tier, simply pledge an additional $5 and I'll compose a survey after the campaign is over to determine which version you would like a key for. Cross-buy is undetermined for right now. If you have already contributed at $15 or more, you will be given the choice of PC, Linux, Mac, PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA. That's as simple as I can make it for now!\nDetails on the Challenge Mode\nThis mode will have several mix-up mini quests for you to test your skills at; you'll have wave-based challenges where you fight off increasingly difficult hordes to see how long you can survive as you level up, boss rush runs, speed runs and other odd modes that wouldn't typically fit in the main game. All will have a scoring mechanism that unlocks achievements, plus we are working on local co-op for this mode.\nPhysical Box and Manual\nWe will be able to provide and ship out a slick designed SNES style physical box and manual to go with your digital download! Both printed in full color and shipped directly to you. This is NOW a Reward Tier AND you can get it as an add-on for any Tier if you add $35 to your pledge! The Stretch Goal allows us to offer it outside of the Kickstarter for any who would like to nab it down the line.\nThe game is in a prototype phase, planned initially for PC, though I would love to expand to other platforms. \nHaving worked with Beau Blyth of Samurai Gunn fame on the programming side, the framework for the game is in place - remaining mechanics and the body of the game will slot nicely into current systems. All will be refined until it feels sleek, satisfying and fun. \nThe venerable and talented Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) has been gracious enough to jump on board to compose the soundtrack!\nThe bigger task ahead is asset generation; enemy sprites (which use dozens of frames of hand drawn art, including the major Boss encounters), new level designs (plus fancy lighting!), and sound design.\nIf I reach the $64,000 stretch goal, I will be able to hire a secondary animator/designer which will allow more time to sink into expanding the world.\nThe $75,000 goal will allow for an even deeper soundtrack with bonus tracks plus a SFX pro.\nI have planned for a potential release date in mid 2014, with beta access at least two months prior, allowing time to tweak and bug-fix and adjust according to player feedback. A more solid schedule will become apparent for backers once resources have been assessed.\nThis project has rapidly evolved into a much larger world and story and needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nCompleting this game by mid 2014 requires focus and time; the initial goal will afford me these two (current) luxuries.The higher stretch goals will allow a fully realized version.\nPaying outside help - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals (such as Beau and Rich) need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a sound effects producer/musical talent as well as an animator to assist would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall structure and scope of the game, as well as fine tuning all of the time consuming little things.\nCompany and operation costs - In order to begin selling through any platform I'll need to establish Heart Machine as a full game company, which takes a fair chunk of money and time, plus licensing, living costs and bills factor in.\nImproving and fixing - Getting testers, implementing community feedback, using every ounce of my soul to produce a game I've been dreaming of for decades.\nAccess to the Game \nI have been researching distribution methods. Now I have PC, Mac, Linux (DRM-Free or Steam), PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA.\nThe closed Beta will surely hold some valuable insight, and in order to implement that knowledge delays may happen. I will do my best to keep Backers informed of progress on all fronts.\n  Concepts\nAlex Preston (Heart Machine) -alxpreston.com, @HeartMachineZ\nLead Designer + Animator + Secondary Programming\nI've been an illustrator and designer for a good long while now.

Spread your neon wings you sweet pixelated bastard!\nBeau Blyth (Teknopants) -teknopants.com, @Teknopants\nLead Programmer + Tremendous Hair\nDeveloped loads of rad fast-paced arcade style games including the upcoming super bad-ass Samurai Gunn.

I've been lucky enough to get him aboard on this project to develop the soundtrack; you know he'll deliver something special.\nWill Wiesenfeld (Baths)- bathsmusic.com, @BATHSmusic\nContributor + Super Fantastic Beat-dropper\nA supreme talent and fine craftsman of music and smiles, also known as the one-man pound-storm of deep beats and carnal wailing that is Baths, has produced the trailer track. Is producing another track for the game during production.\nTeddy Diefenbach (TeddyDief) -teddydiefenbach.com, @TeddyDief\nA thoughtful soul who created The Moonlighters and Shove Pro, co-founded Rad Dragon, is a programmer and game designer extraordinaire. Dives deep into things such as systems design, narrative design and his ultimate mission of recreating the golden age of late 90s Squaresoft.\nThe Game\nAll copies will be sent out upon release 2014. Planned platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OSX and now PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA. PC copies can be DRM-free or Steam keys (thanks to our backers pushing us through Greenlight!). Everyone in the $10 tier will get the PC/Mac/Linux game on release, $15 and above will net you an option for PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA, and the $25 tier receives a Kickstarter exclusive version of the game with bonus side quest.\nInstruction Booklet\nA nifty little booklet to bring you back to the days when manuals meant something; revealing a little known move, a secret passage, or simply bolstering the story and context of the world outside of the game. This particular Instruction Book will include all of those items and more, with illustrations to accompany important sections.\nCompanion Book (Art and Stories)\nThis beauty will contain tons of concept illustrations, sprites, sketches, notes on characters and the world, plus revealing knowledge of the finer details of this realm. This process has already generated a lot of assets that won't be used in game, so I'd like to provide a look behind-the-scenes of a project like this. Plus silly drawings of cat creatures and Pork-Peoples will be stuffed into the pages for pure entertainment purposes. Much mocking of lowly creatures shall be had!\nOriginal Soundtrack\nThe master Rich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) will be composing the eerie OST for this game! I'm jazz-handin' all around this room with excitement at this very moment, nearly unable to continue typing! The full OST will be included in digital form at the $40 Tier with bonus tracks. Boom!\nAlternate Drifter\nReceive a Kickstarter-only alternative main playable character to destroy and explore with. He might have a variant weapon, glowing eyes, and sinister intentions.\nResplendent Print\nA 18x24 archival quality print of the main character posing in a fantastic manner (probably with creature parts flying about) will be yours to man-handle or gently place in a frame. Hand signed and numbered, with a lovely thank you note on the rear to haunt you in your sleep.\nImmortal sprite\nYour name will be translated to the in-game rune system, thus immortalizing your very being into this world beyond. These symbols will be used in special locations. Real names only, please. (No, Crack McButtson is not a real name.)\nDesign a dastardly enemy\nPut your skills to use and help design the look, behavior, name and location a new enemy will appear. This is no fools errand; you'll be creating (digital) life itself, and thus comes the responsibility to nurture the sad heap until it's of age to brutalize Drifters every moment it can.\nDesign a mid-boss creature\nHave you always wanted an angry spider to lob shells at you? Well we can help bring your vision to life! Together we will build an entire mid-boss encounter, with behavior patterns, chamber layout, the look of the creature and it's rewards. As above, choose attributes wisely.\nT-Shirt Special\nThe $60 tier will net you a snazzy design from Casey Hunt in small, medium, large or XL. This will be available to purchase sometime after the Kickstarter as well, so those who have already donated won't be left without something to wear.\nParty in the city\nYou'll join us (a bunch of goofy independent developers) for a wrap party evening of hangabouts, Smash Brothers (plus other multi-player games) and general raging at Glitch City, the Culver City Indie game space. You'll also receive a hand-signed print, a few high fives, and some great big smiles. Your name will be listed in the credits under the Major Thank-You section. \nReference Sheet\n  Add-Ons\nYou can add extra rewards to your current tier if you so desire (remember, no need to change your tier, just add the amount and we'll see the amount and a note from you during the survey):\nAdd $5 - Digital OST for the game\nAdd $10 - Unlock the Alternate playable Drifter\nAdd $15 - Additional Copy of the Game for any platform\nAdd $30 - Limited run t-shirt (no international yet)\nAdd $35 - SNES style physical box and manual (no international yet)\nAdd $42 - Limited Compact Print (11x14) (no international yet)\nAdd $60 - Printed Softcover Companion Art Book (no international yet)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter months of planning and writing and drawing and programming the vision for the project became vivid and succinct. That was the biggest hurdle to overcome. The second was exposing this to the public eye, as that can be a terrifying prospect; and here it is.\n\nCreative endeavors like this are difficult and often unwieldy beasts with many mouths to feed and razor-tipped claws to bind. I've written and planned as much as I possibly could up to this point, and with the framework in place I have the bulk of the more difficult obstacles conquered. Issues will come, as they always do in any long-term project, but I feel thoroughly prepared; I have the proper tools and skills and a large support network through our shared community space Glitch City which is bursting at the seams with excellent developers with vast wells of knowledge and years of experience prototyping, building, and releasing games. I feel incredibly lucky to be tapped into this community and to have such reliable friends willing to lend a hand with resources I may need in the future to complete this game.\n \nI've done what I can to get this far through some rather extreme health struggles, and I don't plan to stop.

Even the long-reach goal of a 5-song Broodhollow EP was reached! I can't believe how far this Kickstarter went! \nAs we enter the production and fulfillment phase, you can follow me on this Kickstarter page in the Updates section and Comments sections, as well as on:\nBroodhollow\nTwitter: @krisstraub\nFacebook for Broodhollow\nMy other comic, Chainsawsuit\n\nAnd if you missed the opportunity to back, the softcover books and many of the posters, postcards, pins will appear in my online store after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled.\nHello hello hello! My name is Kris and I've been making comics online since the year 2000. I also wrote the short horror story Candle Cove. You can find me on Twitter at @krisstraub.\nLast year, I started a new horror project!\nBroodhollow is a cosmic horror adventure set in the 1930s. It's about an unlucky encyclopedia salesman, Wadsworth Zane, who is summoned to a small idyllic town to investigate an odd inheritance from a distant relative. But what seem like a series of supernatural encounters could all be an imaginary figment of Zane's obsessive disorders -- which he calls The Pattern. \nThe little town of Broodhollow, West Virginia is charmingly quirky during the day, and terrifying at night, and it only seems to be getting worse the longer Zane stays. He manages to make a few allies, but it's not the people that are the problem.\nBroodhollow wants to get inside your home, and it's desperate for your help. \nMy goal is to raise $27,500 to cover the printing, fulfillment labor and shipping of at least 2,000 high-quality, full-color 124-page softcover books, and a limited number of clothbound hardcover editions, in addition to new pins, posters, and other backer rewards. \nThanks to backers, the proposed book dimensions have been enlarged to at least 7\" x 10.5\" (landscape)!\nBroodhollow will be told in interconnected stories each designed to stand on their own. The first story, Curious Little Thing, is over 110 pages of full-color comics. I'm not asking for you to fund the creation of Curious Little Thing -- it's done. In fact, you can read the entire story right now. I've been giving it away for free online, page by page, since October of 2012. \nThis is my first color comic and my first digitally painted comic. Broodhollow has been about pushing myself to grow as a cartoonist. I will be working with printers and knowledgeable professionals who will help me translate the Broodhollow you see on-screen onto the printed page. I'm very aware that there's a lot of dark scenes in this story with a lot of small, bright details -- I want the books to capture all of them.\nThis Kickstarter is about a book, so backers at all listed reward tiers are getting one -- whether it's digital, softcover or limited-edition clothbound hardcover at the higher tiers.\nIf the goal is not reached by the completion date, no money will change hands and zero books, pins or posters will be made. Bummer!\nWith your contribution, you are helping to bring a unique horror story into the world. The central mystery of Broodhollow is very well fleshed out -- and even though the first book is a complete story, we barely glimpse any of the puzzle at the town's center. It's a twist I haven't seen or read anywhere else, and I want to deliver it to you in future stories.\nSo what gets made if we do hit the goal, besides the book? Oh! What delights await you, dear traveler!\nThe timeless 1930s affect of Broodhollow is a joy to work in, and ideas pour out of me as blood would from an open wound. I've got postcard sets! And 12x18\" cardstock posters!\nAnd I've commissioned fine brass pins for the Society of the Skull and Shovels -- an order we're introduced to in the first story, but one whose importance isn't fully known yet. Luxuriate in their gleam!\nAnd at even higher tiers, I will craft misery for you from whole cloth, by drawing you in Broodhollow fashion being chased by a unique new tormentor of my design! You can even appear in the next story. (I can't promise that it will end well for you.)\nIf Broodhollow Book 1: Curious Little Thing goes over target, I have enhancements planned that will improve the books, the strip and the Broodhollow experience for everyone! And of course, the further we go over the goal, the better able I will be to devote time to more Broodhollow stories in months (and years) to come!\nScroll down after the graphic for descriptions of each stretch goal!\n$30,000 - REACHED - A downloadable pack of hi-res 1920x1080 wallpapers featuring key moments from Book 1 has been unlocked for ALL REWARD TIERS!\n$40,000 - REACHED - A 12x12\" Kickstarter-only print has been unlocked for all reward tiers at and above $33!\n$45,000 - REACHED - ALL softcovers will now feature tasteful spot gloss treatments!

I will produce a video essay series in which I attempt to resurrect the distinctive flavor of switchwater along with the help of Seattle-area beverage enthusiasts. The recipe will be made public.\n$60,000 - REACHED - Enhancements for all books! The softcover will be embossed! The hardcovers will now feature a foil-stamped Skull and Shovels logo!\n$70,000 - REACHED - A Kickstarter-only 1.5\" Cadavre pin for all physical reward tiers at and above $55.\n$85,000 - REACHED - I will produce an ongoing video creepypasta blog review series!! In each episode I will dissect a well-known story from around the internet: Slenderman, smile.jpg, Dead Bart, Squidward's Suicide, Jeff the Killer, Ben Drowned, and more.\n$95,000 - REACHED - I will add a six-page (or longer if need be) backup story to all the books! \n$100,000 - REACHED - Everyone receiving a physical reward ($33 and up) will also get a 1\" enamel town pride pin bearing the Broodhollow motto, crossed shovels, and the settlement year (1811)!\n$105,000 - REACHED - Dr. Angstrom found a repressed goal! Now all tiers receiving postcards will get TWO of each -- one to send and one to keep!\n$115,000 - REACHED - All tiers $9 and above will receive the Ichor Falls: A Visitor's Guide PDF!\n$120,000 - REACHED - The final goal: Myself and others will sift through hours of archival recordings to bring you a 5-song EP of regional music in and around the town of Broodhollow, West Virginia. These songs have not been heard in 75 years.\n\nAdd-on items! You wanted add-ons, especially the Skull and Shovels initiation set!

PASSERBY and TOURIST tiers are not eligible for add-ons, sorry!\nSTEP 1. If you are already a backer, hit the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button. If you are a new backer, hit the \"Back This Project\" button.\nSTEP 2. Make sure you have selected the tier (VISITOR or above) you wish to pledge at, before any add-ons. That's your BASE TIER.\nSTEP 3. Check out the add-on items list above and how much you need to increase your pledge by. For example, if you're backing at the VISITOR level ($33) and want the Cadavre pin, you would now pledge $33 + $14 = $47. \nSTEP 4. Hit \"Continue to Next Step.\" Then confirm your new pledge!\nMake a note to yourself of what you've added on! When the project has completed and the merchandise is ready to ship (estimated mid October 2013), I will send a backer survey asking for important information, like your shipping address. On the survey, there will be a section where you tell me what you've added on.

You can also connect with us on Twitter @ExileGameStudio and Facebook.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nExile Game Studio has been printing award-winning RPG books since 2006, so we not only know what pitfalls to avoid, but we know how to navigate these treacherous waters to deliver a quality product. Plus, this is our third Kickstarter, so we understand how to plan and budget for this kind of project.\n \nHere are a few of the things we\u2019re keeping an eye on:\n\n\u2022 Art: Finding the right artists and fitting into their schedule is not easy, as professional artists are almost always working. So there could be delays not only with finding the right artists but also getting it done in a timely manner. But we have a good relationship with the artists we\u2019ve worked with previously, so we have a pool of people who already know the HEX style to choose from.\n\n\u2022 Writing: Finding writers for Hollow Earth Expedition has always been tricky, as we need people who can put an original spin on a well-known genre. This is especially true for Revelations of Mars, since sword and planet fiction varies so wildly. As a result, we are going to do more of the writing in-house, which means that it may be slower initially, but what we produce should require less re-writing as we fine-tune the vision. But we will use freelance writers as much as possible to speed the book along.\n\n\u2022 Editing and Layout: Sourcebooks are complicated beasts, as they not only contain prose and flavor text, but they also include lots of rules and stat blocks that all need to be checked and double-checked for accuracy. Often, a single person can\u2019t edit the entire book. One person may have a great editorial voice while another may be a wizard with the rules. Consequently, we've used a different team of people for each book, but we\u2019re hoping to get the best of the best back for Revelations of Mars.\n\n\u2022 Printing: We\u2019ve used different printers over the years, but our print buyer works with multiple game publishers to make sure any prospective printer can meet our special needs. With that being said, there can be a dizzying array of things that can go wrong with printing: supply chain problems, mistakes and reprints, and even civil unrest. The last one just happened once, but still. While some of these things are hard to anticipate, rest assured we will do everything in our power to deliver the highest quality book in a timely fashion.\n\n\u2022 Shipping: Next to printing, shipping is the next most unpredictable area. Shipments from printers can get delayed and packages to customers can go astray. But we will do our best to keep you informed and replace missing packages as necessary.\n\n\u2022 Money: We\u2019ve done our best to budget accurately, but sometimes things cost more than expected. As long as it is not a catastrophic overage, we should be able to absorb it. We did try to keep things lean so we could set a reasonable funding goal, so we\u2019re not going to be swimming in money and will be doing our best to say within budget.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "GM Screens Shipped (and HEX 10th)!", "update_content": "Greetings rocketeers!\nGood news!

The world is grounded in a realistic tone mixed with fantasy elements. \nThere's a saying that goes \"science kills magic.\" What makes this era so appealing to us as storytellers is that anything was possible. The world was not fully discovered, science was still in its infancy, and the possibility of creatures and monsters were very real. \n\nThis was a time when creatures that were once considered mythological or fictitious were actually being discovered. Monsters were being excavated in the golden era of paleontology. The Okapi or as it was called \"the African Unicorn\" once considered a mythic creature, was found in the Congo in 1901, and was thereafter adopted as an emblem by the International Society of Cryptozoology.\nLeft to Right, The Okapi, Giant Squid, Tasmanian Tiger, Rhino\nIn the early turn of the century conservation and hunting crossed paths. The conflicting mentality was to find the most exotic animals, kill them, and \"preserve\" them. This was seen as a way of bringing public attention to wildlife and to habitat conservation before they became extinct.\nThe Collection of H.Prestor Sealous (work in progress set)\nA character piece that happens to have creatures; not a creature film that happens to have characters. \n\nOur characters are inspired by the scientists, naturalists, and explorers of the day, which include:\nCarl Akeley: a prolific explorer and the father of modern-day taxidermy\nFrederick Sealous: the famous hunter who inspired Author H. Rider Haggard to create Allan Quatermain who is the basis of Indiana Jones.\nGrover Krantz: the 1960s anthropology professor and the first serious researcher to delve into the world of cryptozoology.\n  Like Indiana Jones, which we love, we want to delve into some fantastical elements; however, we want to keep the consequences of our characters' actions more grounded in reality, death should have a deeper weight. And any character can die.

We want to try doing creature films that don't fall into the typical formula. We want to try a creature film that treats monsters and creatures as plausible, not as fantastical (even if they are). We want to try a tone that isn't typical to this genre of films, blending history with creatures with a tone more in line with, \"There will be blood\", \"Devils Backbone\" and other period tragedies. We realize this is nothing like the Green Ruby Pumpkin, but the truth is we love \"Bambi\" as much as We love the \"Exorcist\"!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecial Thanks to: Yuo Tengara, Alex Alvarez, Darrin Krumweide, Daniel Kho, Chris Gillet, Jonathan Kuo, Matthew Jones, Ian Whittaker, Ha Minh Hoan, Pham Tung Quan and the entire crew for helping us with this presentation.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a period film with creatures is an expensive difficult task but we are confident we can get it done.\n\nWe have an advantage over most filmmakers, although we are asking for many favors to get this done, we can manage to do it ourselves if all goes to hell.\n\nWe own all the gear, the shooting location and we do the fx ourselves.\n$50,000 is going to help us speed things up substantially but sometimes these things take longer than expected. \n\nFew Details:\n\n-Gifts requiring your presence (tours, tickets to the screening, a role in the movie, etc.) mean you must pay for your own travel/lodging.\n\n-Prize requiring on screen presence require certain criteria.

It also teaches you how to leverage other aspects of technology to market and sell your work.  Whether you haven't started your business yet, or have been running one for years, there will be lots of information in this book to help you get to the next level of your success and beyond.\nSTRETCH GOAL:  If we reach $5,000 I'll include for anyone that pledged $20 or more an additional PDF report detailing what I learned about Kickstarter by doing this project.  I did a TON of research before doing this project, but learned even more by doing it.  If you are thinking about doing a Kickstarter, this report will help you learn how to better manage your time and efforts, as well as get Kickstarter specific publicity.\nHere I am explaining 3D printing at SIGGRAPH 2012\nEven if you work for a company right now, wouldn't it be nice to have extra income from your own creative ideas?  Also, we've seen companies go out of business and even be shut down by companies that bought them, firing hundreds of artists at a time. There really is no such thing as \"job security\" any more.\n--\nHere's a sneak peak at the draft version of the table of contents (elements are subject to change) :\nHigh-Tech tools for making art and products, when and when not is the best time to use them? (When are traditional methods a better idea than going high-tech and visa versa.)\nWhat are the tools and what can you make with them? (This is a really long section because there are way more high-tech tools out there than most people realize. This chapter is broken down into sections for 2D artists as well as ones for 3D artists and for inventors / makers)\nWhat Services can make your art and products for you? (broken down into sections for 2D artists as well as ones for 3D artists and inventors / makers as mentioned above)\nWhat tools are available and affordable for you to own? (broken down into sections just as mentioned above)\nWhat software will you need? (free open source and commercial options)\nWhere when and how do you sell your art? (broken down into passive and non-passive forms of income as well as physical and online places)\nHow do you make a living at it? (marketing, how to keep coming up with new ideas {creativity boosting methods}, organization, self motivation and more. This is the section that really gets into the nitty gritty of running your own business no matter what you want to sell.)\n--\nIncluded in the book is a list of links to powerful, free, open-source software you can use to design your art and inventions.  \nA Neo-Artist doesn't have to starve or suffer for their art, so a few of the methods taught in this book use a passive income business model. With these methods, you design your product, and then other people will make, sell, and ship your product directly to your customers for you. This is done \"on demand\" as your customers buy them, and charge you only what it costs to make the goods.  You don't have to invest in keeping stock.  Not only does this require almost no money investment from you, but it also gives you more time to be creative and come up with even more ideas for things to make you more money. Imagine something like Cafe Press, only with much higher quality and your own original designs of jewelry, books, electronics, fabric, etc.  With most of these services, you choose whatever mark-up you want.\nNeo-Artists are passionate about creating and want to share their creations with the world.  So the book also goes into great detail on easy ways to organize your projects and marketing plans.  This allows you to get the most out of the time that you spend working on your business and get back to doing what you love: making things.\nThe book is based on what I teach in an hour-long lecture, as well as in personal consultations.  I am also adding a lot more into the book than there is time to talk about in the lecture.\nTeaching students about using lasers to carve wood from a drawing.\nOver 7 years ago I decided to leave a 12-year career in the animation industry to pursue working for myself.  Early on, I knew that if I could figure out a way to make a living selling my own art, inventions, and ideas, I'd want to help other creative people do it, too.  \nThis is my mission: to help talented people get out of the hum-drum everyday workforce (rat race).  I don't want anyone with creative juices flowing through their veins to waste their talents on making other people rich, while working insanely long hours and rarely being properly rewarded for it.  \nAbout 6 years ago things really started coming together, and thanks to new websites and technology becoming available in the last 4 years, it is now more possible than ever to break free from your day job and make your own way in this world.\nI've put 7 years of hard work, and tens of thousands of dollars into figuring out the best ways to survive without having to take on a day job.  I've filtered out the mistakes, and put all the best methods into this book.  I'm still alive, so it looks like they work!\nAm I promising that buying this book will make you rich?  No.  \nAm I promising that when you buy this book you will make enough money to quit your job? No.\nI do promise that I am putting into this book every successful technique I have used to bring in over $200,000 dollars in sales of my art and other products in countries all over the world. I am also including all of the techniques I use to be more organized and productive. \nHow much money you generate will depend entirely on how much time you put into making and marketing your products, as well as how well your products are received by the public.\nThis book will be a major shortcut for you, because it can save you from making the same mistakes I made early on.\nBy following the methods covered in this book, you will be more capable of getting your art, crafts, products, inventions, etc. out to the people who will want to buy them.  In many cases, as soon as you sell just one item, you will more than pay for the cost of the E-book.  Even if you aren't sure that you want to sell your creations, but just want to learn about the latest high-tech ways to make stuff, this book will teach you all about what is out there, and how to get access to the right equipment.\nMaking your own custom fabric, toys, books, jewelry, electronics, machines, inventions, housewares, tools, and many other items is more accessible and inexpensive than in all of human history.  I've already done the hard work of finding out where to get these things made, and am sharing all that information with you in this book.\nYou will learn multiple techniques I use to \"trick myself\" out of being lazy and get more work done, creating a powerful work ethic.  You will also learn how to cut out the middle man and not need stores, galleries, or agents to get your creations into the hands of people who want it.  This will save you a lot of time, and let you keep more of the profit for yourself.  Of course, I also sell my work in stores and galleries, so there is advice about the best way to deal with them and how to price your work.\n2 different sizes of my designer toy on the shelf at a store in Little Tokyo, LA.\nYou will learn how to create and grow a fan base. \nYou will learn how I got publicity numerous times on the number one morning news show in Los Angeles which promoted me to millions of people.\nWhether you are an inventor, 2D artist, CG artist, sculptor, crafter, or other type of maker, you will learn from my years of experience, as well as from interviews with top people in each of those fields. \nThe only difference between you and big successful companies is that you haven't done the work yet to build the products and fan base.  This book will help you understand how to do that.\nYou will learn how to bridge the gap between you and the people who will want to buy your creations.\nIf you want to start getting your work out there, or supercharge your existing business, pledge now and in a few months you will have in front of you a huge amount of time-tested advice from people who have already gotten where you want to be.  Join the ever growing movement of people who make things and share them with the world!  For less than the cost of a nice dinner, you can have the all of this great knowledge.\nHere is a draft list of the chapters (subject to change):\nHigh-Tech tools for making art and products, when and when not is the best time to use them?

Lincoln really takes his time to study and fully understand the medium he's taking on.  But what makes him really impressive to me is not just his drive and dedication to learn and master the process, the nuts and bolts of a new medium, but his ability to then turn it on it's head and approach it from a different and unique angle. And that's a word that really describes Lincoln to me, UNIQUE. Each and every project I have ever seen from him all possess his unique sense of humor, his unique creativity, and his unique way of looking at the world.\nI always look forward to seeing what's next with Lincoln, because whatever it is it will most definitely be something special.\"\n-Craig McCracken  Creator/Executive Producer: The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\n-----------------------------\nThis Spring, Lincoln Kamm, an Alumnus of the Character Animation Program at CalArts, gave a very inspiring presentation on the use of technology to create art. It was amazing to see the things that were produced.  He stepped you through the creating of the art piece to how to market it.   \nHe showed another way that has supported him throughout his career without the need to rely on industry jobs or other work. He was very thorough and informative on how to create the art, how to produce it, and what to you might want to avoid. This was an option that apparently was very appealing to his audience, as many of them stayed long after the presentation to talk further with him. Everyone should have a chance to see this presentation.  It is another way to think about showcasing your talent.\n-Martha Baxton Senior Administrative Coordinator California Institute of the Arts\nAt the prestigious California Institute of the Arts just after my lecture.\n--------------------\n\"I've seen Lincoln go from animator to business man, marketing expert, and high-tech art tool teacher. He's consulted for me on upcoming products, and has saved me endless amounts of time and money by sharing his expertise. His passion for helping artists bring their ideas to market is apparent.\"\n-Jeff Ranjo Toy Designer and Disney Animation story artist\n---------------------\nHere are some of the rewards to choose from for helping make this happen:\nTo thank you for donating $5 or more, I will email you a PDF of the top 10 tips any maker should know if they want to sell what they make.\nFor $20 you get the main reason I'm doing this Kickstarter, \"The Artist's High-Tech Guide Book\" E-book.

With your help, we will release Lex Laser Saves The Galaxy, Again on Linux, Mac, and Windows in the first half of 2014.\nLex Laser Concept\nDear Implant,\n  If you are reading this, then I've reactivated you, and we're probably in trouble.  DON'T PANIC.\n  You are a computer, or something like a computer, and you think really fast.  You've got plenty of time to think. \n  But as soon as you commit to moving my body, time will move forward just for a split second.\n  At least, that's what you've told me it looks like from your end of things.  From my end, my body turns into an action movie hero and I try to stop screaming in terror.  Don't worry about that right now.  Just know that you can take your time, and I don't mean all the bad things I say.\n  If something happens so that I need to activate you in spite of all the really good reasons not to, it's going to be serious.  So I'm writing a bunch of files in this memory augment for you to read if you need them.  There might not be time for me to explain personally.\n  The basics:  You are a combat implant.  You think so fast that time seems to stand still.  You can take control of my body.  You have subroutines that measure and calculate weapon trajectories and analyze the most likely outcomes of any shot you make.  You can control my hands with perfect precision....  So you don't ever miss.\n  If I've activated you, there's probably something you need to shoot.  It's probably asteroid dwellers of some kind.  They aren't sentient; they are barely alive at all.  Think of them as highly mobile kelp that likes to hang around the heat given off by valuable radioactive ore.  \n  If it's not asteroid dwellers, then try to avoid killing people unless they are shooting at me.  Us.\n  It may look like a bunch of squares with funny pictures to you, but I'm really here and we're really in trouble.  If I die, you die, too.  (I think.)  I can't get out of this without you.\n  And yeah, you can make fun of me later.  I still can't hit anything smaller than an asteroid with a gun.  Get us out of this, and I'll take whatever you care to dish out.\n  You probably don't remember me.  That's a side effect of shutting you down as thoroughly as I did.  I'm really sorry about that, but I didn't have any choice.  If it's any consolation, shutting you down again will almost certainly kill us both.  So welcome back!  We're together again for the long haul.  \n  I've missed you.\n   --LEX\nScreen Concept\nGameplay Overview\nPlay at your own pace, deploying area-of-effect weapons in highly visual tactical puzzles.

Settlers brave the unknown to form new colonies, while the more independent souls homestead alone on distant worlds.\nWith a fervor reminiscent of the Gold Rush, fortune-seekers mine asteroid fields for rare elements and search alien ruins for valuable technology.  But there are scary things in those ruins, things that we don\u2019t really understand. Things better left alone, perhaps.\nLex Laser Concept\nIn this new frontier, Lex Laser is a legend.  S/he is Paul Bunyan, Annie Oakley, Johnny Appleseed, Pecos Bill, Calamity Jane, Davy Crockett.\n\nLex Laser is the lone conscript who fought off 300 zologs in the Battle of Hilbert 5. Lex Laser is the only human to have been made an honorary member of the Vkesti Immortal Council. Lex Laser released, caught, survived, and cured the final outbreak of Smallpox IV.  Lex Laser dug up a fortune in alien artifacts in the asteroids around Rigel - and lost it all three days later.\nIt's hard to be a living tall tale. Despite the fame, or perhaps because of it, Lex Laser just wants to be left alone. Lex Laser doesn't want to save the galaxy, but sometimes, you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that's when you have to act.\nAs the player, you take on the role of Lex Laser's sentient combat implant. You are the secret behind Lex Laser's greatest victories.\nGameplay Details\nYou are Lex Laser's combat implant, the secret of his/her success.  Lex Laser may be an expert technician, spaceship mechanic, and sometime scientist, but when the going gets tough, you take over.\nYou direct Lex Laser in a 2d game world. Lex Laser will be fighting hordes of zarbats, mining explosive crystals, running away from angry robots, looting a scuttled dreadnaught, or exploring an alien ruin, and more.\nLex Laser is turn based. There are no twitch elements to this game.\nMost tactical games rely heavily on numbers to express their core concepts. A tough creature will have more hit points, and the only way to deal with that is to do more damage. In Lex Laser, most foes just take one hit, but there are lots of them.\nLots and lots of them.\nYour challenge is to deal with your enemies quickly, before they overwhelm you.  At higher difficulties, your challenge is to deal with your enemies efficiently, before you run out of ammo.  You do this by choosing the right weapon for the situation, and placing your shots carefully. If you are only destroying one enemy per turn, you are probably falling behind.\nThe result is a blend of tactical combat game and puzzle game.\nFinally, we'll keep you on your toes with variations on the basic combat system.  We'll mingle combat objectives with story objectives, forcing you to make trade-offs. \nLots and Lots Of Enemies (prototype screenshot)\nEquipment\nBetween missions, you use the various technological items and alien artifacts you have found to improve your arsenal.  You won't have to guess at recipes, though.  Lex Laser is a top-notch technician, and can stick almost any mod onto any weapon.\nFor example, the Orthobarrel mod adds a second projectile to every shot from a gun, but always 90 degrees to the right of the main shot, and the gun will take twice as much ammo per shot. Stack the Explosive Ammo on top of that, and you can turn your simple pistol into a mini-multi-grenade launcher. That's fantastic until you find yourself in a museum filled with fragile crystal sculptures - then you might want to go back to the base model.\nYou will also find (or build) sensors, such as a tactical readout that predicts enemy actions, or a life detector that can give you hints about where to go to rescue that last refugee.\nThis equipment mechanic is the primary way Lex Laser improves as the game goes on, so a little creativity here can go a long way.\nInspirations\nGames:  Robots, Gauntlet, Rogue,  Diablo,  Dungeons & Dragons, SSI's Gold Box games,  HERO System, Star Control II, Star Saga, FTL\nFiction:  Heinlein's juveniles, E. E. \"Doc\" Smith,  Babylon 5,  Firefly\n\nMotivation\nWhat am I doing, again?  \nYou will probably not play Lex Laser in one sitting.  When you pick the game up again, you will have to figure out what was happening when you left.  We're making that as easy as possible so you don't mind putting the game down when you need to.\nTo accomplish that, we're increasing the importance of location and relying on highly visual elements like area-effect weaponry.  This helps players jump back into the action without having to refresh their memories about which things do what.  It's all on screen.\nWe're also separating the story elements into short Episodes.  An Episode is a self-contained subplot, much like a single episode of your favorite Sci Fi television show.  These bite-sized chunks are easy to remember, but if you forget, we'll provide a quick summary of the action so far in the Episode.\nOnce you've completed an Episode, you don't need to remember all of the details about it.  Again, we'll provide a short summary.  \"Lex Laser and the Gene-Cow Stampede:  Lex Laser's escape pod landed on Fornax II.  Lex helped the local settlers, who provided a nice meal and a ride to the starport.\"\nDon't traumatize the children! \nLex Laser started out as a game designed specifically for experienced gamers with small children: people who might have to stop playing at any moment, who might go weeks between sessions, who might have to deal with curious faces peeking at their screens without warning- but who still crave the deep, rewarding game experience from the Days Before.\nThis is an under-served market.  (I should know.)\nI've been surprised at what bothers my son and what doesn't.  He really doesn't like sudden surprises in Daddy's game.  He gets very uncomfortable when he hears any sounds of pain.  But he doesn't mind complicated moral situations.  Either they are great conversation starters, or he doesn't understand them yet (which is, frankly, more likely).\nSo while we won't be terrifying you with sudden movements and sounds, and we won't be showing graphic gore and horrible death, adventure mode will present you with complicated situations appropriate for grown-ups.\nThis is not a game for kids.  But it is a game that can be played near them.\nThis game isn't for everyone.  If you've read this far, we're hoping it's for you.\nWill the real Lex Laser please stand up?\n\nWho Is Making This?\nAndrew Haydn Grant (Team Lead) is the Technical Director for the MIT Game Lab (formerly known as the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab), where he has mentored students in code and design, led teams, and helped ship a lot of research games in the past 6 years. He started professional computer game development as a designer/programmer at Looking Glass Technologies in 1994, but has been refining his gameplay and storytelling techniques since beginning as a Dungeon Master in 1980.\nThe team is primarily staff from the MIT Game Lab and alumnae from our programs, including both MIT and RISD students.  These people are battle-tested, and have all shown that they can make fun games on a very tight schedule.\n\"It's an honor to work with this team, and if the Kickstarter fails, you should totally hire these people.

The Kickstarter base amount is assuming that some of the team is working only part-time, and everyone is working at a reduced rate.\n\nWhy is that reduced rate not zero?  Well, for some of us, it is.  But a lot of the team are fighting student loans and other financial commitments that they just can't put off.  On top of that, the people on this team will be turning down other opportunities to work on Lex Laser.\nThat said, here's our budget:\n $6,000 - Legal & Accounting\n $7,500 - Software\n $6,500 - Amazon, Kickstarter, failed pledges: $6,500  (10%)\n$20,000 - Art\n$12,500 - Code\n$2,500 - Sound\n$10,000 - Quality Assurance (play testing)\n\nYes, we're budgeting for Quality Assurance up front.  I wish we could budget more for it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as gameplay, the equipment customization bit is the riskiest. It will make game balance extremely difficult. To combat this, we're prioritizing Puzzle Mode first, complete with weapon mods. Once that mode is solid (and fun!), we'll have a much better idea of what to expect from Adventure Mode weapon arsenals at each stage of the game.\n\nThe main risk is present for all projects. What if something goes horribly awry? We could lose team members, or hit some unknowable stumbling block. Our main defense against this is a highly modular game design that will allow us to cut content until we have a manageable workload. \n\nHopefully, we won't have any such problems. But if we do, we'll give you a smaller, high quality game rather than a larger, half-finished game.\n\n\nIf you like what you see, please pledge!

You might notice that her story bore remarkable similarity to the one told by Jane Austen over 200 years ago...except told through video blogs.\nThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries did what it set out to do...to tell a story in a compelling way using only first-person videos...particularly to tell the story of Pride and Prejudice. And with over 26 million video views and some of the best fans on the internet, it's safe to say that it was a success.\nNow it\u2019s time for some new adventures.OK, so, this DVD set is freaking sweet, it\u2019s so sexy it makes DVG look like a potato. \nWe've got behind the scenes features, commentary, out takes, and interviews with the cast and creators. But a big part to what is unique to the LBD will come to the DVD as well and that is choice.\nIn universe, there are over 150 videos and can be consumed in any way you choose.\nWith the click of a button you could lean back and watch \nLizzie's 100 videos or\nLizzie's 100 videos plus Q&A videos\nLydia's videos\nMaria's videos\nGigi's videos\nand any combination of these.\n\nThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries DVD box set should be in your hands this July 2013\nIt\u2019s going to take us some time to put together another full-on series after wrapping up The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. But we have no intention of leaving you hanging. So here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up.\nYou've seen the Pemberley Digital press release that announced a search for a partner community. And maybe you've even read Gigi\u2019s SXSW interview where she hinted that the search was related to her upcoming move. \nToday, we can tell you that the search is over. A partner community has been selected, and Gigi is going to take you there.\nWelcome to Sanditon.\nBased on one of Jane Austen\u2019s un\ufb01nished novels, Welcome To Sanditon will be a full interactive experience that takes you to the beach town of Sanditon, California as it attempts to revitalize itself into a modern resort destination. \nThrough Gigi\u2019s videos, you\u2019ll meet the residents of Sanditon as she brings the beta version of Domino to reveal the drama in their lives.  But we\u2019re not stopping there.  \nIn The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, you got to interact with the story.  In WelcomeTo Sanditon, we\u2019re taking things one step further --  you\u2019ll get a chance to be a part of the story. \nWe\u2019re busy putting the town together now, and will reveal more details soon. \nWelcome to Sanditon will launch in early May 2013. \nSee you around town.\nSince this Kickstarter is helping to fund both the production and manufacture of a DVD and of a book AND the creation of new content, we wanted to make it clear when things will be delivered. We are going to start spending money on the Sanditon series before we even have the money from the Kickstarter (basically we\u2019re taking out a loan against future revenue) so we will be able to launch that series soon after the Kickstarter ends.\nWe will start the production of the DVD as soon as the Kickstarter is finished. This includes a number of things like filming interviews with writers, cast, and crew, editing outtakes reels from the mountain of content we have from the creation of the series, putting together featurettes discussing the more interesting parts of the project, recording commentaries, and planning and programming the DVD viewing experience. Then we\u2019ll have to wait for the DVD to actually be manufactured before shipping them out of our warehouse sometime in July.\nFinally, around the same time as the release of the DVD, we will be launching our second major series. But to find out more of that, you\u2019ll just have to wait.\nThe Second Major Series will launch in late Summer 2013\nWe also wanted to give you a bit of an idea of how this money is going to be spent. The DVD packaging we\u2019re using isn\u2019t cheap. Getting 8-10 DVDs in one box actually costs a lot of money, so we have to plan for the production of a lot of these sets. The production of the DVDs, books, posters, pins, etc, and the costs of shipping all of those items to you is our biggest line-item. \nThe cost of the production of the DVD, which is being handled by the excellent producer Brit Weisman will be another substantial cost. This is mostly in wages to Brit, editors, designers, and crew for the creation of the DVD content. \nThe production of the Sanditon miniseries is also a large expense, and finally, we\u2019ve included a contingency of just over 10% of our budget, which seems like a safe thing to do to me. \nPemberley Digital is, yes, actually a real company. We are Hank Green and Bernie Su and we are dedicated to the idea of telling compelling stories in new and interesting ways. Thank you for giving us these opportunities.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf the projects that are part of this Kickstarter, the creation of the book and the work on Sanditon are already prepped and ready to go.

You interact with the words as they appear -- your interaction directs the main character.  You swipe the screen, touch words, and manipulate the device -- and that moves the story forward!\nIn a Vidya Book, you matter! The story unfolds in front of you and around you and you control the pace. In a traditional novel the story has one path - it doesn't matter if you're paying attention or not. Here, your attention is integral and your choices matter. \nBook One \nOur first Vidya Book is an epic adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones, Uncharted, and Tomb Raider. Our hero travels the globe uncovering a mystery that spans centuries.\nIt is a story that will appeal to both young and old; a reading experience that will delight early readers while surprising and enchanting lifelong lovers of fiction.\nThe story arc is ready, the first chapter is 'playable'. But we are leaving certain key decisions to YOU. The hero's name, the identities of the key characters (they could be you!), certain plot points, and even the title will all be shaped by you, our backers.\nA Personal Message From Joe Booth, our Founder\nAs far back as I can remember, I've struggled with dyslexia. At school I was amazing in some classes, but a disaster in others. I was coding at age eleven, but I couldn't write a simple paper or read many books. \nI was lucky though. I got into video games just as they took off. My timing was fortunate and I rode that wave and have had the most amazing journey. Unfortunately, the reality for most kids who struggle with reading is very different.\nWhile there has been some great innovation in reading apps for pre-schoolers and early grades there just isn't anything for older kids. \nMy vision is simple. Let's take everything I've learned whilst making video games and apply that to ebooks. Let's make reading as fun as a video games and let's get people passionate about reading. \nPlease help. Back us. Join us. Let's make this happen. \nRevised Stretch Goals\nWhat if we took on one of the biggest challenges for struggling readers today and used the stretch goals to fund additional versions of the book at different reading levels?\nWhy do different reading levels matter?\nBooks are rated by reading level (there are several systems) and interest level. Typically they match; a book aimed a fifth grader has a fifth grade reading level. Makes sense, right?\n\nWell here is the problem: imagine we have a fifth grade kid who is reading at third grade level. He can't read the books at his interest level, he has to read the books aimed at two grades below him. He finds them, well, a bit dumb. He's embarrassed to be reading them in front of his peers. And guess what, he disengages from reading and falls further and further behind. I know this from personal experience as it's what happened to me.\n\nTake my son Jackson. Jackson loves Harry Potter. Jackson loves to do things with his friends. They watch movies together, they play video games together. But, for Harry Potter, only a few of them are able to read the books. It turns out that many of Jackson's friends are at different reading levels. Some are super advanced. Some have dyslexia, disgraphia or are just learning at a different pace.\nI think we can solve this. Why? Because we have been doing this with video games for years. Video games have different difficulty levels. As an industry we signed up to tuning the game for those different levels. So, lets show that we can do this for books and demonstrate to the publishing industry how things should be done!\n\nWhat are the stretch goals?\n$15,000k First reading level \n$21,500k Second reading level \n$28,000k Third reading level\nIf we get close to the third reading level we will detail additional stretch goals\n\nHow will we create the books at different levels?\nEach new reading level would effectively be a new version of the book. We will take the finished book and take it through an editing process.\nThis effort is experimental - much of the contribution will be completed by our community of supporters. \nWe will not hold back the release of the main book for this effort. We estimate that it will take 4-6 weeks to go through the editing process. \nTo be conservative, we are giving a guidance of 12 weeks between the release of the first book and the release of the books at different readings levels. \nWe may not be able to implement every recommendation of best practice for taking books to lower reading levels. There are some recommendations that infer a fewer number of words on a page and the use of visual representation. We won't be able to do that. We will be able to implement other recommendations such as limiting the number of words per paragraph, increase the spacing and font size, and slowing down the reading speed.\nAll additional reading levels will be available to all our backers at no additional cost.\n\nDeveloper Diary Video #1\nThanks for your feedback asking for more detail. I have recorded a developer diary of the first five minutes from our first book...\nThe BACKSTAGE CLUB\nWe want YOU to come on this journey with us. Our BACKSTAGE CLUB gives you access to private forums, exclusive hangouts with the team, and you will be giving YOUR input on key creative and business decisions. \nAnd here is the best bit. You will get preview access to EVERY NEW BOOK we make during your BACKSTAGE subscription period. That means you get to experience the creative process as it happens.\nWe understand the power of affinity spaces for exposing kids to complex language. Some top learning researchers believe that more learning goes on in the social spaces around video games than in the games themselves. This is because of the exposure to complex language. We will focus this club on exposing members to the inner workings of engineering, the creative process and the business process.  \nWritten By You & Rewards... \nIn true KickStarter tradition, YOU will be shaping the story.\nOur hero. We know he's male, early 20s, a journalist and a reluctant  adventurer. But his NAME, some KEY personality traits, his hopes and fears, will be shaped by you.\nOur female lead. She's beautiful, intelligent, courageous, but is she YOU, your GIRLFRIEND, your DAUGHTER?\nThe mentor. Every great story has its Obi Wan Kenobi - will ours be YOU?\nOther characters. The supporting cast, the ensemble of characters who reflect the many dimensions of our hero's journey. Who could you be? \nRed Shirts. Adventuring is a dangerous business, and accidents will happen. Every epic story needs its 'red shirts', those poor characters whose 15 seconds of fame is cut short. How will you die?\nSubplots. YOU will co-write a subplot with our writing staff.\nPersonal dedications. A very personal dedication, only for you.\nGlobal dedication. YOU get to write the master dedication - the one that everyone gets to see.\nPersonal message. A private message, just for you. Come on, nothing too cheeky now!\nThe title. No, you can't buy the title, but we will be shaping this with our BACKSTAGE CLUB.\n\n\n\nWhat Will The KickStarter Funds Cover?\nWe have built the technical and creative foundation, but we need help to cover the final costs to finish writing and programming, and then publish our first book. The $10,000 we seek will go to cover...\nAn illustrator for the book cover artwork\nAdditional writing and game design to finish the first book\nAdditional programming for more mechanics\nAdditional programming to cover server and user profile\nCommunity management\nGeneral publishing overheads (admin, legal, etc)\n\n\nOur Road Map\nWe are using the Lean Start Up methodology. This methodology is all about finding your core, passionate audience and using quick iteration to learn as you go. This is a perfect methodology for KickStarter.\nPhase One - In phase one, we build our initial product (Book One), we find our passionate audience, and get to market as quickly as we can.\nPhase Two - In phase two, we go deep and build out multiple books. We experiment with lots of genres and lots of ideas. We get rapid feedback from you, our audience. We start to test the academic potential for Vidya Books.\nPhase Three - In phase three, we scale. We go to different hardware platforms. We invest in the authoring tools so that many, many authors can publish on our platform. We tackle localization and regional content. We scale the academic reach of Vidya Books and look to make an impact within the classroom.\nPhase One Schedule\nConcept Phase - Sep / Oct 2012 - the initial concept was developed from the driving question, 'what if we invented the book today?' \nPrototype Phase - Nov / Dec 2012 - We developed an initial prototype using an off the shelf engine called Stencyl. This allowed us too iterate and test ideas very quickly. We learned a lot (mostly, that we needed to simplify). \nPre-Production - Jan / Feb 2013 - We switched to Xcode and native iOS development. This allows us to use the beautiful font system built into to iOS. But we needed to go very deep into Apple's libraries to get the performance to do all the things we wanted to do in real time.\nProduction - Mar / Apr 2013 - This is the production time for Book One. This is where we are right now, yeh!\nPost-Production & Release - May 2013. With your support, this is when Book One will be released.  \n\nThe Creative Team\nJoe Booth - Founder.

We just don't have enough data to accurately predict how long awesomeness takes. Our key mitigation to this risk is our strategy. By focusing on small increments, by only focusing on the iPad & iPhone for the first phase, we are reducing the complexity as much as we can.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, many of the core key challenges have been addressed. The code is well structured, optimized appropriately and is easy to maintain. We have some key tasks around servers and profiles, and we need to go through Apple's submission process. Most of the remaining code tasks are around specific interactions or effects that we would like to add. The one key technical question is what happens when the app hits scale both in terms of users and content. \n\nFrom a content perspective, the outline and story arc is complete. The first chapter is done, we've drafted out most of the rest, but of course, this is going to evolve with our backers.\n\nOur stretch goals focus around creating new content. There is risk in some of our assumptions on how much it will cost to make additional books.\n\nSupporting iOS5, iPad 1, and iPhone increase complexity. It may be that for our first version, that we need to focus on a sub set of hardware (iOS6 compatible devices) and then follow up with the other devices.\n\nFinally, please be comfortable backing a project that is trying to be different. If you are the kind of person who hates change, is the last to switch to a new technology, then maybe this isn't for you.

Now that we know what's possible, there's more work to do. $2,000,000 is just the beginning! We've got 30 days, and the more we raise, the bigger and better this movie will be.

It only took you 11 HOURS to cross 2 million dollars? You speedy little marshmallows :) Words can't even express how excited we are. You came through, and I'll keep my promise too. We're going to make the best Veronica Mars movie anyone ever made, and the movie YOU deserve. Because YOU made this happen. But there's still time, and the more we raise, the better we can make it. All of the money you pledge this month goes right back into making this movie the one you've been waiting for, and the movie we've been waiting to make. So call your friends. Rally the troops. Lets break another record.\nLoVe always, \nkristen bell\nDay 1: Messages from Rob & Kristen\nAlmost since Veronica Mars went off the air, there's been talk of making a movie. In that span, I've taken different tactics in dealing with the question of whether it might happen. To be clear, I've always wanted to make a Veronica Mars movie. I love writing these characters and working with these actors. Kristen Bell has always wanted to make the movie.\nThere was a moment, a few years ago, when we thought we had a real shot at making it happen. I developed a pitch that revolved around graduation day at Hearst college -- Wallace and Mac were graduating at least, Veronica had been sidetracked by freeing Keith from prison. Plus, there was a murder in Neptune that was affecting the beach city's spring break business in much the same way a great white shark affected the beach community of Amity. I probably stoked fan fervor in my optimistic comments about the prospects. Warner Bros. wasn\u2019t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.\nAfter that, I tried to tamp down expectations. I didn't want to be guilty \u2014 at least not twice \u2014 of building up hope when the odds seemed so long. Still, without fail, in every interview I do or every place I speak, I get the \"will there be a Veronica Mars movie?\" question. Even after a couple of years of downplaying the chances, I'd still run across blog postings headlined, \"will Rob Thomas shut up about the Veronica Mars movie, already!\" I was trying to. I promise. \nI first found out about Kickstarter a couple of years ago from an Austin musician friend of mine \u2014 Robert Harrison, lead singer of Cotton Mather, the band that gave us \"Lily Dreams On,\" our closing song of season 1. He financed a rerelease of the band's fantastic Kontiki album. Later, I was marveling about Kickstarter with another buddy of mine who said off-handedly, \"You should use Kickstarter to raise the money to make the Veronica Mars movie.\" I chuckled. That seemed like a silly idea in the moment. We'd need millions. But for the next few weeks, the notion was never far from my mind. I started doing the proverbial back-of-a-cocktail-napkin math. The average pledge on Kickstarter is $71. Hell, if we could get 30,000 people to give the average donation, we could finance the movie, particularly if the cast and I were willing to work cheap. The most common donation amount on Kickstarter is $25. Surely, 80,000 of our three million viewers would find that price-point viable! \nOf course, Warner Bros. still owns Veronica Mars and we would need their blessing and cooperation to pull this off. Kristen and I met with the Warner Bros. brass, and they agreed to allow us to take this shot. They were extremely cool about it, as a matter of fact. Their reaction was, if you can show there\u2019s enough fan interest to warrant a movie, we\u2019re on board. So this is it. This is our shot. I believe it's the only one we've got. It's nerve-wracking. I suppose we could fail in spectacular fashion, but there's also the chance that we completely revolutionize how projects like ours can get made. No Kickstarter project ever has set a goal this high. It's up to you, the fans, now. If the project is successful, our plan is to go into production this summer and the movie will be released in early 2014. \nLife has taken Veronica away from Neptune. In the years since spoiling Keith's chances to be reelected sheriff, Veronica hasn't taken a case. But something big is about to bring her back home and back to her calling. My goal is to include as many of your favorite characters as possible. It is, after all, time for Veronica\u2019s 10-year high school reunion. Keep in mind that the more money we raise, the cooler movie we can make. A two million dollar fundraising total probably means cross words are exchanged at the class reunion. Three million? We can afford a full-on brawl. Ten million? Who knows... For some reason the Neptune High class reunion takes place on a nuclear submarine! A Hobbit shows up! There\u2019s a Bollywood end-credit dance number! I\u2019ve always wanted to direct Bill Murray. We\u2019ll figure out something cool. Hey, if that total goes high enough, I\u2019ll bet the good folks at Warner Bros. will agree a sequel is a good idea.\nThanks to everyone who hasn't lost faith.\nRob\nDay 1: A Message from Kristen\ndearest marshmallows... \nI am currently the happiest blonde in a hamster ball the world has ever seen. We have been waiting so long to make this movie dream a movie reality, and it\u2019s because of YOUR commitment, YOUR persistence, that we finally have a chance. We just have one more step to go. \nYou have banded together like the sassy little honey badgers you are and made this possibility happen. i promise if we hit our goal, we will make the sleuthiest, snarkiest, it\u2019s-all-fun-and-games-\u2018til-one-of-you-gets-my-foot-up-your-ass movie we possibly can. \nI promise to give it my all. i promise to work my hardest to give everyone a little bit more Veronica, and i will be oh so honored to do so.  \nI only ask for one thing in return. \nIf I ever die, do me a favor. Go on Oprah and tell the world that I loved kittens. \nLoVe to you ALL, \nkristen bell \nMore Countries!

We reached the initial goal of $32,000 in only six days!!! My heartfelt thanks to all of my friends (old and new) who are helping to bring this haunted puppet film to life! \nI am now setting a new \"stretch\" goal of $50K .

Thank you again and please let others know of this project!\nTHE FILM\nThe Mill at Calder's End is a gothic ghost story in the spirit of Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft that will be told with 30 inch tall bunraku puppets and old fashioned in-camera special effects.Featuring the voices of Jason Flemyng (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,X-Men:First Class) and horror legend Barbara Steele (Black Sunday,The Pit and the Pendulum) , this film celebrates two of my great loves: the art of puppetry and gothic horror.\nFrom my experience working as a special effects artist in Hollywood for over twenty years and now collaborating with some of the most talented creature effects artists,concept artists, and puppeteers in the industry, The Mill at Calder's End will be unlike any puppet film you have ever seen before.\nA FEW EARLY REVIEWS\n\"BREATHTAKING...AN INNOVATIVE AND ENGAGING USE OF PUPPETRY...\" -Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings)\n\"CREEPY...FILLED WITH SOME REALLY COOL HORROR IMAGES...

I have also always had a great love of puppetry and traditional in-camera special effects. The work of Jim Henson (The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and his Storyteller television series) is a great inspiration to me and I am hoping to bring his sense of wonderment and artistry to The Mill at Calder's End. \nIn 2012, I was honored to work with Heather Henson (Jim's youngest daughter) on my first film. Heather produced The Narrative of Victor Karloch as one of the short films for her Handmade Puppet Dreams Film Series and was a guiding force in helping me create the haunted world of Victor Karloch. \nThe Mill at Calder's End is a gothic tale that will be told with the traditional Japanese theater puppetry technique known as bunraku. Each puppet figure is controlled by three (or more) puppeteers dressed in black and hidden behind each character. It is my goal to make a film that celebrates practical effects and therefore there will be almost no computer generated imagery in the final film. In my first film, The Narrative of Victor Karloch, I utilized several silent film era camera techniques, such as a shot of a miniature ship on a stormswept ocean (which, in fact, was made up of painted flowing garbage bags). I plan to continue to use many more of these techniques to give a hand crafted look to The Mill at Calder's End.  \nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nKevin McTurk | Director\nA professional creature effects artist, cinematographer, model maker, and puppeteer, Kevin McTurk has been working in the effects industry for over 20 years.

Every frame of this film is essentially an effects shot. The \"actors\" of this film are the sculpted puppet characters that are controlled by three puppeteers dressed in black (or green screen) behind each puppet. Therefore, one of the single greatest challenges is how to film the puppets and hide the puppeteers from camera. There will definitely be a number of shots that will require \"rotoscoping\" ( digitally erasing puppeteers from the shot, frame by frame). In addition, every element of the puppet world - wardrobe, props, and sets - must be custom built for the film. \n\nIn terms of production scheduling, \"Calder's End\" should be completed within a 10 month time frame.The shooting schedule could possibly be delayed if puppeteers and/or technical crew members are unavailable on shoot days due to better paying jobs or out of town work and would therefore force us to reschedule. But the ultimate goal is to start shooting this summer and reach post production in the fall/early winter.\n\nHow will the Kickstarter money be spent? \n\nHere is a short breakdown of the budget:\n$8K to $10K - Puppet Construction,Costuming,Sets,and Props\n$10K to $12K - Camera/Lighting/Stage Rental/ Crew\n$10K - Post Production (Sound Mixing/Digital Compositing/Color Correction)\n\nOnce the Kickstarter goal of $32K is surpassed, a new \"stretch goal\" will be set. With additional funding, THE MILL AT CALDER'S END will become an even more extraordinary work of puppetry art. The new budget will allow for more intricate in-camera effects, higher quality cameras and lenses, and an enhanced sound mix.\n\nTHANK YOU in advance for supporting THE MILL AT CALDER'S END...\nYour contributions will enable this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision that few have ever attempted!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN - Final 6 Days!

Huzzah!\nWelcome, my friends, to The Daring Adventures of Captain Lucy Smokeheart.\nThe Famous Captain Lucy Smokeheart Herself!\nThe story will follow the adventures of -- you guessed it! -- Lucy Smokeheart, a pirate captain seeking vengeance and lost treasure as she follows the trail of her brother's last voyage.\nThis project will unfold as a year-long story told in monthly installments. Each month you'll receive an episode in ebook form, including a clue or puzzle for you to solve. By the end of the year, these clues will lead you to the online location of Lucy's hidden treasure!\nAnd who's behind all this? I'm Andrea Phillips. I've done writing, game design, or both for such projects as Perplex City, Floating City, America 2049, The Maester's Path for HBO's Game of Thrones, and more. These projects have won a fair shake of awards and critical acclaim. I've also written A Creator's Guide to Transmedia Storytelling, in which I tell you all of my trade secrets.\nNow I'd like to do something new: Take my crazy brain and put it right in front of the reading public.

Will allow me to spend more time on the project, apply more craft, commission extra illustrations, and in general will result in a superior project all around. If I only make that $5,000, it won't pay my mortgage, so Lucy Smokeheart will just be a side project.\nIt's a lot easier to deliver a knockout story when you don't have to write it in stolen midnights between client deadlines, you guys. Every dollar over goal gives me the gift of time.\nAt $7500: All episodes will feature bold cover illustrations (like the one toward the top of the page) by the brilliant and talented Heather Williamee! These will be far superior to the ones I could put together on my own. Just trust me, here.

Then backers download a complete version of the finished game. Rinse and repeat! \nAlong the way we document our process and progress with screenshots, posts, and podcasts. Backers (of $25 or more) download the complete version of Super Clew Land as soon as the Kickstarter is funded!\nUpdate We contacted a few of our indie game heroes to pull together a selection of amazing games that all have their origin in game jams or rapid prototyping. This pack will include special DRM-free, Mac/Windows versions of each game. And every backer who pledges $25 or more will get the Bonus Jam Pack as soon as our Kickstater is funded!\nOrigin Story\nThe Ludum Dare game jam at the end of August was our first time collaborating. Together, over a three day weekend, we created Super Clew Land. Somehow everything clicked. It wasn\u2019t effortless but it felt worth the effort. We should have been exhausted\u2014okay, maybe we were a little\u2014but we didn\u2019t want to stop. We didn\u2019t want to stop working on Super Clew Land and we didn\u2019t want to stop making tight little focussed games within thematic and time constraints.\nWe\u2019ve jammed on games before, usually solo. But after each jam our focus always returned to prior obligations. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool,\u201d we thought, \u201cif we could do this more often?\u201d So we hatched a plan. We would continue working on Super Clew Land for thirty days to prove to ourselves it was possible. It was. The process was just as fulfilling as the original three days. That brings us to now. We want to do it again. And again.\nPlayer Select\nShaun Inman Creator of The Last Rocket, one of Edge Magazine\u2019s Must Play iOS Games. Independent designer, developer, and composer.

We promise to take regular breaks, drink plenty of water, and remain functioning members of society. After each three day crunch we'll have a full thirty days (one month) for polish. Between the two phases we\u2019ll take a few personal days to recharge so we can stay fresh and focused.\n\nFirst and foremost, we want to create games that are fun to play. Can you make a fun game in such a short time? We think so! Between the three of us, we have lots of experience with short, focused game jams. What hurts most games is unfocused gameplay.

The Space is in Los Angeles, but everyone online will be able to participate in our talks, workshops, and exhibitions. All of our programs are open to anyone in the world.\nLA Game Space is a nonprofit center for videogame art, design, and research. It is a place for game innovation, education, and exhibition; where all of us can play and make and study and showcase games.\nOur galleries will host large-scale EXHIBITIONS, interactive installations, performances, and retrospectives that can only be achieved at a space like this. We will be sharing catalogs, exhibition documentation, and the conversations surrounding gallery events online for everyone's benefit.\nOur SPEAKER SERIES will feature new dialogues with both traditional and nontraditional game-makers. Our WORKSHOPS will introduce newcomers to the medium and explore new processes and perspectives with experienced creators. Events will be archived and available (for free) online. They will also be livestreamed, and a moderator at the Space will enable worldwide, remote participation.\nRESIDENCIES are the beating heart of the Space. The residents will be creators from diverse backgrounds working collaboratively to create experimental game projects. LA Game Space will provide residents with work space, exhibition opportunities, and feedback from an equally diverse group of bright minds. Our goal is to free residents from the limitations often presented by commercial game development.\nGAME RESEARCH LABS will enable live gameplay recordings including useful metadata such as button presses, pulse rate, face-tracking, and eye movement. These recordings will be made available online for researchers worldwide. The lab will also provide access to a wide variety of platforms and devices\u2014both historical and contemporary\u2014and support experimental hardware and interface projects.\nWe've been working on this project for over 3 years. Now, after thoughtful planning, building an amazing network of supporters, and finding the perfect location\u2014we need your help!\nWe are located in Los Angeles, but we're part of a global conversation, and we have structured the space and its activities so that everyone can take part in it. Remote participation will be offered for our live streaming workshops and presentations via an online moderator, and all events will be watchable online for free even long after they happen! We'll be posting everything we can online including documentation of exhibitions, the residency program, and the conversations surrounding them.\nIf you care about free information and open archives, you will love our initial research lab project to create an open-source video game experience archive. Since video games are an active medium, it is not enough to archive the games themselves. We will be recording video game playthroughs, along with useful metadata such as button presses, eye-tracking, and pulse-rate\u2014and then archiving this data online for anyone to access.\n\u201cWhen you contribute to this Kickstarter campaign, you are not only receiving great rewards\u2014you're providing essential funds for LA Game Space and you're creating a resource that will produce interesting, exciting games for years to come.\u201d \u2014David Surman, Pachinko Pictures\n\u201c\u2026help shape the future of the greatest art form forever\u2026\u201d \u2014Stick Skills\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that could redefine the idea of what it means to be a game maker.\u201d \u2014Kill Screen\n\u201cIf people like this are so behind it, you know, it's probably worth getting behind.\u201d \u2014Kotaku\n\u201cHead along to the Kickstarter\u2026this is one of the important ones.\u201d \u2014Hookshot Inc.\nDANIEL REHN is a researcher and creator of media/electronic art including video games.

Drama, Comedy, Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy are all explored against the backdrop of a futuristic Victorian Age. \nWe've loved Steampunk for years: Jules Verne, HG Wells, HP Lovecraft, Neal Stephenson, China Mieville, GD Falksen - we could go on and on - but we weren't seeing the worlds they described in their writing portrayed on screen. So we decided to create The World of Steam.\nHow to show a world so vast with so many stories? By following in the footsteps of our heroes and making a new anthology series. An anthology series like The Twilight Zone, Amazing Stories, Tales From the Darkside, or Jim Henson's Storyteller. We felt that when looking at this incredible Steampunk universe, the best way to approach it would be by peering through the keyhole of our existence into the strange new world on the other side.\nWe've envisioned a place with Jules Verne's technology and Jane Austen's dialogue. A world with Charlotte Bronte's rules and Lovecraft's horror. A place where mad scientists, corseted heroines and bold adventurers could make their way, bringing you truly unforgettable characters, beautiful stories, and vistas like you've never seen.\nThe World of Steam is Directed, Produced and Written by Matt Yang King, winner of the CAPE/Hollywood Foreign Press Young Screenwriters Award and actor on shows such as (24, GI Joe: Renegades, and Numb3rs). He is joined by a crack team of creators: Lisa Lassek, Editor (The Avengers, The Cabin in the Woods); Thomas Surprenant, Makeup FX (Emmy winner - Star Trek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer); and Bear McCreary, Composer (Battlestar Galactica, Terminator, The Walking Dead). For the complete credits check out our Facebook Page.\n                       ANNOUNCEMENTS!!!\nDVDs and CDs!!!\nSo when we decided to take The World of Steam to Kickstarter, we didn't think that there would be such high demand for DVD or a CD for a Webseries that hadn't come out yet. But boy have you made your voices heard. We couldn't/can't alter the existing incentives so we put in the DVD at the $40 incentive, but some of you wanted to add it on to your existing cool stuff from our World Class Makers (Yes Brassy Steamington, Daniel Proulx and Col. James Von Siegfried I'm talking about you, so stand up and take a bow!).

This project gathered some of the most inventive and talented industry professionals together to create The Clockwork Heart, the pilot episode. We've come really far, with amazing creatives donating a ton of their time, effort, and expertise to the project.\nBut we need your help to bring the world to life...\nWe live in an amazing time. Used to be, if a Medici endorsed your project, they would require control of your content. Today, a new day has dawned. Kickstarter has allowed thousands of artists just like us to bring deep science fiction stories to life and to connect to audiences everywhere, and it also allows you to speak with your dollars.\nIt's simple. If you like us, help us.\nOur goal is to do two things: To bring you the best entertainment that we can, and to offer you some really astounding incentives to show our appreciation.\nYour donations will go towards the completion of all post-production of the pilot episode of The World of Steam: The Clockwork Heart: Color Grading, Visual FX, Sound Design, Musical Score, Hiring Musicians, Recording and Marketing. It will also allow us to begin pre-production on the first season of The World of Steam, hiring name actors, making extravagant costumes and props, finding distinct locations and expanding our Visual FX.\nOur first season is set for five episodes including The Clockwork Heart. If your generous donations overfund us, we'll be able to bring you a greater scope and breadth to the world and bring you some truly astounding visuals. Every additional $30,000 we make beyond our goal allows us to bring you another episode. \nWe'll help you (or you can read the official line, here). For the next 30 days, you'll be able to make pledges to support us in our Steamy endeavors, ranging from $1 to whatever you can afford without going to debtors prison. You can select one of the incentives - listed to the right - of equal or lesser value to your pledge. You can always pledge more than the minimum to get an incentive that you particularly crave. Your credit card or other account will not actually be charged at the time that you make your pledge, and you can change your mind any time during the 30 day window. \nIf the deadline comes and we have reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged at once, and we get to working on making some really cool Steampunk episodes. But if for some reason we don't make our goal, the whole thing just fades away. No one gets charged, no fees are applied; everyone just keeps their money. Of course, if we fail to meet our goal, then no one gets our cool gear either, which we think would be pretty tragic. Not 'return of Cthulhu' tragic, but sad nonetheless, 'cause we think it's some awesome stuff.\nFor investing in The World of Steam we'd like to offer you our thanks with our special Kickstarter-only Steam Gear.

With your generous donations it becomes possible to begin a trip into a land we've dreamed about since we were kids. Not that that land does not have obstacles: Red Barons, mysterious contraptions and strange monsters from the Underdark. And the journey to creating that world is fraught with peril as well. It deals with the more mundane, but sometimes more difficult obstacles of Time, Money and Effort.\n\nLogistical obstacles of finding or building Victorian locations, designing and constructing props, and the heavy lifting of creating worlds within digital space become a daily hardship. Plus, the task of maintaining a fully professional crew and cast for a multitude of episodes can prove daunting.\n\nBut we have some nice pluses on our side of the data sheet. We have a strong team in place and serious hitters who bring their 'A' game every time. People who have proven their mettle on projects with no budget, to some of the biggest movies of all time (literally).

At the heart of each story is a beautiful, laser cut cameo handmade in felt by artist Haley Moore. \nThe silhouettes represent seven fictional characters, and those seven people are connected by one common thread.  They all had one of these unusual cameos made at a shop in London, and every one of them has disappeared.  \nWhat happened to them is too strange to take on faith; you're going to need evidence.  All we have left are the objects they left behind: letters home and pages torn from diaries, newspaper clippings and old adverts, inventors sketches and photographs, love letters and suicide notes. It will be up to you to dig through the evidence and uncover their stories.\nYou'll come away from the experience, not only with the satisfaction of a good read, but with a wearable memento of the occasion. The cameos are perfect to pin to your a lapel, a hat, or a bag. Only these seven prototypes and a handful of others have ever been made, and now I'm asking you to help change that by pledging to outfit my studio with the right equipment.\nStories of Clockwork and Lightning\nLaser Lace Letters features seven people from different walks of life, living in an alternate London where an all-woman airship corps keeps the peace, tiny robots ferry messages to secret lovers, and the rich build extravagant country homes in the sky.  Photographers point their lenses to to sky for a glimpse of aethereal cities that appear in the bolt of a lightning strike.  The government is building mechanical servants to free mankind from work, and soon the subjects of Queen Victoria will be the happiest and most prosperous in the world.\nBut tucked away in the shadows is a machine that could change everything - a device that can look into people's souls, and - if it sees fit - clip a hole in time and space just the right shape so they fall through.\nCharacters\nEach story in Laser Lace Letters focuses on one person who fell prey to the machine.\nThroughout the campaign, I'll be unveiling a little online experience for each character that gives you an idea of what their story will be like, without spoilers.  So far, I've done a photo shoot, written a historical account of a murder done with tiny robots, solicited names for the Magician, and built interactive fiction out of the forms feature in Google Docs.  Who knows what I'll do next!\nTo find all the characters' experiences in one place, go to LaserLaceLetters.com, and look for new updates throughout the campaign.\nOne-Woman Wonder Show\nI'm a craftsperson with an undying love of story, and a tendency to take my projects to ridiculous extremes of intricacy and depth.  I can prototype and write and design forever, but I can't make a project like Laser Lace on my own - and I definitely can't make it without you.\nIronically, these cameos from a steampunk world can only be made using third milennium technology.  Laser Lace needs a laser cutter to go into production.  We've been prototyping on a shared machine at the Dallas Makerspace, but in order to make more than a handful of them, we need our own equipment.\nA felt mosaic donated to Desert Bus for Hope last year.\nThe laser cutter is one of my favorite creative tools, and one I've brought to bear over the last few years to make some awesome things.  By pledging to Laser Lace, you're not only ensuring that this project happens - you're opening the door to a world of projects I could hardly imagine before.\nNEW! Christmas Rewards!\nWe've added two very special rewards for those who want to give Laser Lace for Christmas.  The stories won't be ready to ship until March, but we can send out some cameos in time for holiday gift giving.  So, for the low price of $42, you can now order one cameo and the digital Letters, and have them arrive by December 24.\nHowever, for $77 you can also order a special experience that will keep giving throughout the year.  At this level, you'll not only get your cameo by December 24, but in March, you'll start to receive parcels containing the physical artifacts that make up each story.  You won't just get the story that goes with your cameo - you'll receive all seven deliciously designed case files, one each month.  It's like a subscription to mystery and adventure.\nYou can also get your custom wax seal by December 24, if you get your custom work specifications sent in by December 7.  We will send out mini pins ASAP, but can't guarantee them delivered by the 24th.\nRewards - UPDATED!\nWe're now offering custom, laser cut wax seal stampers and signet rings, just like the ones we developed while designing our packages, and as seen in the award-winning Instructable.  We will be doing fully customizable seals featuring your initials, message, or any art you provide.\nThe impression size is about 3/4\" wide.  Stamper seals come on a lovely wood handle. The signet rings are both ready to make a wax impression, and great for making a first impression. The band is unisex and adjustable.\nWhen you order your seal, you'll also get a stick of sealing wax in red, gold, or silver, and a digital copy of the Letters.  Larger seals (up to 1 1/2\") are also available for an additional $3 shipping (the post office will require us to mail them differently).\nYou can add a custom seal to any other reward level by adding $40 to your total pledge.\nFor $25, you can get this charming little mini-cameo to wear to your next soiree.  This poor fellow doesn't have his own story, but if you read carefully you might be able to find him in the digital copy of Laser Lace Letters that comes with your mini pin.  You can also get the digital copy alone for $10.\nUPDATE: All THREE alternate mini cameos are now available!  Pledge at the $25 level to get either the original, Nikola Tesla, the Air Pirate, or the Gear Heart mini cameo!  We'll send out an email at the end of the campaign to find out which you'd like.\nYou can also add more mini cameos to any other reward level by adding $25 per cameo to your total pledge.\nFor $50, you'll get one complete Laser Lace Letters story of your choice, including the cameo and story artifacts in one of these lovely packages, and a copy of the digital book.\nEach story in the Letters is like an episode of a television series - each has its own internal arc, and each connects to others. While the series doesn't follow a single narrative from beginning to end, certain threads connect groups of episodes.  \nThe Laser Lace Tales are collections of stories that share a common thread and come together to make a bigger picture.  For $150 you get three cameos, three tangible stories, the digital book and the mini cameo. There are three Tales to choose from.\nOf course, for some, three stories isn't enough.  If you want the full experience, we've also got you covered.\nFor $250, you get a complete set of physical Laser Lace Letters, including all seven cameos and seven tangible stories, the digital book, and the mini cameo.\nWhile we haven't nailed down all the details, the complete set will likely contain over 100 individual story pieces.  It will be a rare and beautiful thing.\nCustom Services\nSeveral of our rewards are for custom services, including:\nCameos with custom silhouettes and any lace from our lace library.\nA full Laser Lace portrait sitting and a new Laser Lace story starring you! This is a deeper story than most, with artifacts from the whole range of my propmaking and storytelling capabilities, using the new laser I'll soon have command of!  Read more about the personal portrait sitting here.\nThe \"Secret Society Package\" - Complete custom cameos of your art for up to 10 people.\nLaser cutting services for one year!\nFor complete details on these rewards, read our Custom Order Specifications.\nPartnerships and Other Cool Stuff\nWhen I said I can't make this project alone, I wasn't just saying that. Laser Lace has from a number of collaborators, from both the US and the UK.\nLaser Lace Letters is an official spinoff of Clockwork Watch, a magnificent steampunk transmedia project that got its start on IndieGoGo one year ago.  If you thought our world sounded similar to theirs, it's because they're the same! Many members of the Clockwork Watch team have already lent their feedback, encouragement, and even their voices to the cause.  You're also going to see special Clockwork Watch cameos in the future if funded, and you can check out bits of Laser Lace in the new issue of the Clockwork Watch comic, Breakaway.\nThis project also incorporates LaMech, a one off tangible story about a tiny robot that I created in 2010.  The LaMech robots will come to life in Laser Lace, saving one life and tearing another apart.\nI'm also collaborating with a number of artists, almost all of them Texans like me.  They're supplying things like illustrations, advertising art, circus posters, and sketches of terrifying machines.  Without these people, Laser Lace wouldn't be nearly as beautiful as its going to be:\nZack Turner, artist of the zombie webcomic Unlife\nHeather Williamee, contributing animator for Cartoon Network's Team Toon\nJohn Kantz, the creator of Search for New Lifeforms\nFox Castillo, ghost enthusiast and official illustrator of LaMech\nJolie Pagel, pug afficionado, sculptor, and creature illustrator", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDESIGN\n\nLaser Lace Letters is a unique type of project, the like of which has never been done by an indie creator before. The thing that makes this story unique is the way it's told - through individual artifacts that you can actually touch. I'm a transmedia artifact creator of seven years. I've worked on everything from award-winning web series, to ARGs for interational films, to vaunted educational games, with object-based stories as my specialty.\n\nLASERS\n\nThe designs for all of the laser cut parts needed for the cameos and their packages are complete. I just need the equipment to produce them on, which the Kickstarter will pay for. I'll be purchasing the laser cutter equipment from a company whose machines I've already been trained on and have used for years, so I expect I'll spend a minimal amount of setup time for the new equipment.\n\nPRINTING\n\nEach packet of Letters involves a number of parts of different sizes, so printing will be an involved process. However, I'll be working with a digital printing house I've used for five years and proofing everything in print to make sure everything comes out perfect.\n\nHANDMADE\n\nEven though the parts are cut by machine, every single cameo, every package, and every set of letters is put together by hand. I've planned carefully to allow enough time for everything to be made by our delivery target, but I'm also working out agreements with other local artists to step in and help, just in case.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Distraction Free", "update_content": "Hello, my dears!\nThe first draft of episode 3 is very nearly done - probably finished today.  It's been a long while, since this story is probably the most complicated and deep in the series.  I've been trying out some new things to help me focus.\n\nI love writing on a typewriter, and I love writing outside.  A lot of Episode 2 was written on an old Remington Portable typewriter, which is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from a steampunk writer.  It's a great environment - your typewriter can't check Facebook or ping you about your email.

Throughout my career, I've worked for many studios including Don Bluth, Electronic Arts, Cartoon Network, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Disney, and many more. In 2001, I left my position as Head of Special Effetcs at Warner Brothers Feature Animation, so that I could pursue being a full time independent artist. I had always done personal work after hours and on weekends, but with my departure from Hollywood, I was hoping that from then on, I could make my art the primary focus of my career. In 2002, I moved to the Pacific Northwest, and began working seriously toward that dream.\nSince leaving the studios and becoming a full time independent artist, I have done books, graphic novels, short films, a video game, live performances, etc, while at the same time, continuing my affiliation with the movie, television and game industries as a freelancer.\nAnd now, I feel ready to tackle my dream of making an independent animated feature film.\nTHE SAGA OF REX: THE MOVIE IN MY HEAD\nTHE SAGA OF REX is labor of love that reflects my deep love for science fiction, strange creatures, otherwordly concepts, and classical animation. When I created THE SAGA OF REX graphic novel, I literally saw it as a movie in my head and treated the whole thing as a fully art directed storyboard. I saw the characters, the effects and the landscapes move in my mind's eye, and tried to convey as much of that feeling as I could on the pages.\nA COSMIC LOVE STORY\nTHE SAGA OF REX is the story of a little fox who gets abducted by a flying saucer and is transported to the planet Edernia, where he encounters the Blossoms, a race of shape shifters.\nOne of the Blossoms, chooses Rex as a potential mate and so the adventure begins. Rex must prove his worth and Aven, the shapeshifting Blossom, must conquer Rex\u2019s heart.\nIt\u2019s a love story. It\u2019s an adventure. It\u2019s an epic journey into an alien world. I am convinced that it will make a fascinating and beautiful film.\nA 1\u00bd TO 4 MINUTE SHORT FILM AT FIRST\nSo, how do I go about making a film of THE SAGA OF REX? Here's my concept: My first goal, before diving into a feature length film is to make a short film. The short will be a self-contained section of the feature film and will be used for the second round of financing (which may or may not necessarily be on Kickstarter). Preferably, the short film will be 4 minutes in length, but shorter will work too (you will help determine the length, but more on that later). So why 4 minutes you ask? Here are my reasons:\nI believe THE SAGA OF REX will be beautiful, visionary, surreal, and fascinating, but I also realize that it will be quite artsy in terms of storytelling. If it is too long, it could be taxing on the audience. This is why I want to make the movie as short as possible, yet I still want it to qualify as a feature film. According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences:\n\"An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of more than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters\u2019 performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique.\"\n40 minutes for a film like THE SAGA OF REX sounds just like what I have in mind\u2014so this is perfect! But in order to be eligible for Academy Award submission...\n\"No more then ten percent of the running time of a film, is allowed to be shown in a nontheatrical medium prior to the film\u2019s theatrical release.\"\nSince I want to have the option of submitting the film, and at the same time, I want to be able to share the footage created through Kickstarter with the world\u2014as soon as it is completed\u2014I need to make sure I play by the rules. Hence, the four minutes limit (40 minutes \u00f7 10 = 4 minutes).\nThe credits will be different in the short film and feature film so I'm not worried about going over 4 minutes with that part of it.\nYOU DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THE FILM\nI evaluated that by working full time, at my regular pace of 50 hours a week, I can produce around one minute of completed film every 8 to 10 weeks. I also need to budget for sound and music since this is not my area of expertise. I already produced approximately 30 seconds of animation so the new footage will be added to that.\nFIRST GOAL - $15,000: I will create ONE minute of new full color animation bringing the total length to 1\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nSECOND GOAL - $30,000: I will create TWO minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 2\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nTHIRD GOAL - $45,000: I will create THREE minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 3\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nFOURTH GOAL - $52,500:  I will create THREE AND A HALF minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 4 minutes. LOCKED!\nFIFTH GOAL - $60,000: In addition to the FOUR-MINUTE SHORT FILM, I will create a TWO-MINUTE THEATRICAL TRAILER featuring 30 seconds of new animation.\nIf we reach the $60,000 mark, I will create a 2-minute theatrical trailer featuring scenes from the short film as well as 30 seconds of new animation. For the new animation, I will cherry pick events from the graphic novel that will display the full breath of what the feature film will look like: spectacular, emotional, poetic, action-packed, mysterious and thrilling.\nAdding 30 more seconds of animation that will be publicly shown before the completed feature film's theatrical release means that I will have to increase the length of the feature film to 45 minutes, so that I still respect the Academy's 10% rule. This is okay\u2014a 45-minute film still falls within the range of what I envision.\nAnything raised above the fifth goal will go back into the production to pay for sound and music, more lavish animation and effects, etc. EVERYTHING WILL GO INTO THE FILM. The bigger the budget, the more impressive this film will be. If you make the calculation (subtract rewards and 10% Kickstarter and Amazon fee), you will see how low the budget actually is for what I'm trying to attempt. That's why any surplus in money would allow me to expand the project further (equipment, software, assistant animator, etc). I'm not here to get rich, I only want an opportunity to do a beautiful film.\nOnce the short film is completed, I will start designing the next phase of financing, as well as planning the potential addition of a small crew. But first, let's do this first part!\nEVOLVING TECHNOLOGY\nWhen I started in the animation industry back in the 80s, I dreamt of a day when the technology would evolve to a point where a small group of artists, or even a single one, would be able to create complex and fully animated films\u2014something that could only be achieved with huge crews and big budgets at the time. Throughout my career, I kept learning everything I could about animation filmmaking while exploring new technologies. I always kept my dream alive of one day making that \"classically animated\" movie that would look like a big budget feature film, only done with a fraction of the cost. The big appeal for me was simple\u2014if the cost was massively reduced, a truly singular artistic vision could be kept untampered.\nWhen digital ink & paint and compositing started making their way into the animation biz in the early 90s, I hooked up with Cambridge Animation from the UK, to help them develop Animo, a 2D software for traditional animators. From that relationship, I made a short film called, PRELUDE TO EDEN, and became one of the spokepersons for Animo (watch the film here).\nDuring that period, Animo became the prime tool for non-Disney animated feature films, being used on movies such as, THE IRON GIANT, OSMOSIS JONES, PRINCE OF EGYPT, THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT, ELDORADO, SPACE JAM and many more. However, 2D animation software from other sources continued to evolve while Animo stagnated. I had to come to the realization that Animo, a product of a now defunct company which hadn't been updated since 2006, was no longer cutting edge. After over 15 years of using Animo for my animation projects, it was time for me to move on. I did some research and found a series of software called Toon Boom. Quickly thereafter, I proceeded to use Toon Boom Harmony 10, their latest offering, to create an animation test based on my graphic novel, THE SAGA OF REX (you can read all about it here).\nToon Boom allowed me to remain 100% paperless and bypass time-consuming steps such as scanning and processing drawings. By working directly within the software with a Cintiq tablet, my process was massively sped up. To test this, I gave myelf a 3-week deadline in an effort to see how much I could accomplish within that time frame. Chosing a simple section of the graphic novel, I was able to singlehandedly create approximately 30 seconds of animation, fully colored and composited. This would have been unthinkable if I would have been hand drawing the animation on paper. Granted, I worked like a mad man for the duration of the test, and this was one of the simplest section of the graphic novel with only one character and very little special effects\u2014most of the book is a good deal more involved and would require more time\u2014but nevertheless, I saw what was possible.\nTHE ORIGIN OF REX\nIn 1997, I was working at Warner Brothers Feature Animation as Special Effects Supervisor. My production assistant at the time, Scott Grieder, really enjoyed my art and suggested that I do a children's book. The thought of illustrating a storybook sounded pretty cool, so I told Scott, \"I'll draw it and you write it.\" I quickly scribbled a drawing of a cute little fox facing a strange creature and gave it to Scott. \"This is your starting point, write something about that,\" I said to him.\nTwo weeks later, before Scott had a chance to begin writing, I had completed twenty more illustrations.\"Here's more inspiration for your story,\" I said while handing him a stack of photocopies.\nAnother fifteen to twenty days later, I called Scott to tell him that the book was finished and that I'd written the whole thing. I couldn't stop myself\u2014it just poured out of me. I was glad to hear that Scott was relieved to have the burden off his shoulders.\nA SEARCH FOR MEANING: THE STORY OF REX was finished in December 1997 and published in July 1998 as an oversized hardcover book, signed and numbered edition of 1000\nI sold the book at trade shows, conventions and to friends, and after a couple of years, sold out all the copies. I didn't want to let the story disappear into oblivion, so in 2002, I colored the illustrations, refined the layouts, and self-published the second hard cover edition. I actually managed to get a distribution deal for the new edition and was able to get the book in several comic shops and bookstores.\nThe color edition eventually sold out and in my desire to keep the story available for readers, I included the original black and white version of the book in PARABLES: AN ANTHOLOGY, a compilation of the first four storybooks I self-published in 2004.\nREX TAKES FLIGHT\nBack in 2004, I was doing a signing at the Golden Apple Comics Booth at the Long Beach Wizard Con. Kazu Kibuishi (Amulet, Daisy Kutter) came to my table and showed me a binder containing the artwork for a comic anthology he was putting together called, FLIGHT. I was very impressed with it. Kazu was familiar with my work and hoped I'd be a part of future volumes, so when I suggested using my REX character, he was very receptive. One of Kazu's goals with Flight was to help artists build their own graphic novels in manageable chunks. Not sure if anyone else took advantage of that, but I, for one, saw a golden opportunity.\nWhen I did the first 17 pages for FLIGHT vol. 2, I had no idea where the overall story would take me. By the time FLIGHT vol. 3 rolled in, I had figured out the overall outline with its main themes and concepts. Within that framework, I kept improvising and coming up with new ideas as I went along.  From 2005 to 2010, I did a new chapter every year and progressively built the story over six volumes of FLIGHT.\nTHE SAGA OF REX was very loosely thumbnailed, and in some cases I didn't even thumbnail at all. I'd go straight ahead with cleaned up and colored pages without knowing exactly what the next page would be like. This method of working would be impossible in mainstream comics, but for a project like REX, being serialized in FLIGHT, it worked well. I found that it kept me constantly on my toes creatively and allowed new ideas to sneak in and surprise me. It made the whole process fun, unexpected and never boring.\nOnce the story was completed, I repackaged the whole thing, added a few pages and sent a mock-up to Image Comics, to see if they would be interested in publishing the graphic novel. I was delighted to get a very enthusiastic response from Image Comics' publisher, Eric Stephenson, and the book was quickly added to their pipeline. The complete SAGA OF REX was published by Image Comics in the fall of 2010.\nREWARDS\nThe rewards will allow you to dig deeper into my universe of strange beings, otherwordly concepts and offbeat storytelling. All my personal art is linked in some manner, and THE SAGA OF REX is very much part of this universe I've been developing over the years.\nEven though, the approximate shipping date for the rewards is listed as October 2013, most items will actually start shipping early in 2013. October 2013 is when I anticipate delivering the downloadable file of the film. The production blog will also become accessible as soon I start working on the film.\nTHE SECRET PRODUCTION BLOG: To share the experience of making the film with the people who back this project, I will create a secret, password protected blog that will document the whole process\u2014elation and frustration, happiness and trauma\u2014I\u2019ll share everything, the art, the tests, the animation\u2014every step of the way.

Seventh Star Press is that kind of publisher, bringing its own love for science fiction and fantasy to the project, and its \"got your back\" attitude for genre writers and other small and independent presses.\nSeventh Star Press is very excited about the opportunity to release this project, but as it is one outside of our originally projected 2012 publishing schedule, a little help from outside is needed to bring this project to fruition.  \nPerhaps the first question that comes to your mind, if encountering us for the first time, is:  Who is Seventh Star Press?\nFormed in the fall of 2008, Seventh Star Press is a respected speculative fiction publisher based in Lexington, KY, boasting works from such authors as Jackie Gamber, Michael West, D.A. Adams, Steven Shrewsbury, David Blalock, R.J. Sullivan, J.L. Mulvihill, and Stephen Zimmer.  The press also features two highly-acclaimed, award-winning artists, Matthew Perry and Bonnie Wasson, whose creative work is featured on the covers and interiors of all SSP releases.\nNow that you have a little more of an idea about us, we would like to introduce you to the particulars of this proposed book project.\nThe Writers Workshop of Science Fiction and Fantasy is a collection of essays and interviews with some of most influential names in the industry; each article covering a specific element of the craft of writing science fiction and fantasy.  The collaborators in this wonderful anthology include:\nNeil Gaiman -- \u201cWhere Do You Get Your Ideas?\u201d \nOrson Scott Card -- \u201cOn Rhetoric and Style.\u201d  \n\nLou Anders -- \u201cNebulous Matters, or Speculations on Subgenre.\u201d\n\nLucy Snyder -- \u201cUrsula K.

WE ARE MAKING A THRILLING ADVENTURE HOUR CONCERT FILM! AND A GRAPHIC NOVEL! AND A WEB-SERIES!\nWe put together words for a living, but right now we are completely speechless. All we can say is thank you. Thank you for giving us the means to realize these goals that we've held for a long, long time. We are flattered and grateful that you like our show.\nAll that remains is to point you in the direction of a couple of rewards that you, as fans, will appreciate.\nThe CONCERT FILM DVD which is being offered here is an EXCLUSIVE, SPECIAL EDITION version and will only be available via Kickstarter. The DVD will include as many bonus features as we can pack in, such as behind-the-scenes featurettes, podcasts, even original content made possible by this very Kickstarter campaign, the web-series, and MORE. \nThe show itself is scheduled for Fall 2013. Tickets to this show will NOT be available for sale. The only way to attend this performance is by reserving your seat through this campaign. The show itself is a celebration of our Kickstarter campaign and our amazing backers, so attendees will enjoy a full evening of entertainment, an onslaught of TAH swag, free raffles for swag bags from cast members and friends, the works. Then end the night with an exclusive, invite-only after party at Largo with the cast and crew. Plus, every audience member will see their name in the end credits, and perhaps even make a cameo in the \"making of\" bonus feature filming live alongside the performance. \nOUR KICKSTARTER GOALS ACHIEVED THUS FAR!\nEasy reward navigation!\nClick for General/stage show/podcast related rewards.\nClick for Graphic Novel related rewards.\nClick for Web-series related rewards.\nClick for Concert Film related rewards.\nA LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THE TAH EXPERIENCE...\nIn March 2005, we gathered a group of friends together to produce a stage play in the style of old-time radio called THE THRILLING ADVENTURE HOUR. Nearly eight years later, we\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to watch TAH grow and evolve into something we never expected. Filling every seat every month at the famous Largo at the Coronet Theater in LA. Sharing our show with the world as a podcast on Chris Hardwick\u2019s Nerdist network. Even producing an entire line of merchandise inspired by the worlds we created. And all for our fans, the most supportive and enthusiastic crowd on Earth. \nCreated by us (TV writers Ben Acker and Ben Blacker), each live performance has featured three genre stories brought to life by The WorkJuice Players, a regular cast of multi-talented actors and comedians such as Paul F. Tompkins (Best Week Ever), Paget Brewster (Criminal Minds), Busy Philipps (Freaks & Geeks), James Urbaniak (Venture Bros), John DiMaggio (Futurama), and a parade of A-list guest stars such as Nathan Fillion, Patton Oswalt, Alison Brie, Jason Ritter, Neil Patrick Harris, Danny Pudi, Ed Helms, Zachary Levi, Chris Hardwick, Andy Richter, Patrick Warburton, Colin Hanks, Dave Foley, Adam Baldwin, Joshua Malina, Joe Mantegna, JK Simmons, and more!\nThis multi-faceted troupe brings to life all manner of characters from an ever-evolving array of recurring worlds and genre backdrops including: \nSparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars: A space western in which a human Marshal protects Mars from robots, aliens and galactic threats with the help of his faithful Martian companion.\nBeyond Belief: Frank and Sadie Doyle are fast-talking married mediums. Although this pair of high-society types would rather enjoy martinis and each other, they usually end up solving paranormal mysteries.\nCaptain Laserbeam: Silly superheroics abound in Apex City, where our high-flying scion of science saves lives from neurotic supervillains.\nJefferson Reid, Ace American: The American Victory Commission's finest agent, his gal, and their kid sidekick stand against the Axis powers in WWII. \nDown in Moonshine Holler: A hobo fairy tale in which a millionaire, after falling in love with the Hobo Princess, renounced his money, became a hobo, and took to the rails to find her. \nAmelia Earhart, Fearless Flyer: Amelia Earhart faked her death to become America's top-secret one-woman airforce. \nTales From the Black Lagoon: Hollywood noir from the Golden age of Tinseltown proves that the facts of the city are much stranger than fiction in the movies it manufactures. \nThe Cross-Time Adventures of Colonel Tick-Tock: A British soldier mends damage to the timeline for her Majesty the Queen. Armed with his trick clock and his sense of duty, Colonel Tick-Tock stands sentry over every century. \nThe USSA Captains' Journals:  The starcrafts of The United Solar System Alliance protect the Solar System from itself and others. Beyond the rim of star-light, wandering in star-flight, their humanity fills the empty void of space. A Sparks Nevada spin-off!\nCactoid Jim, King of the Martian Frontier: Say \"howdy\" to the most earnest do-gooder on the fourth planet! A Sparks Nevada spin-off!\nPlus, in the spirit of old-time radio, each \u201cepisode\u201d features a number of commercials and catchy jingles from fictional show sponsors such as Patriot Brand Cigarettes (\"They're good for your constitution!\") and WorkJuice Coffee (\"Guaranteed to fill you to the brim with vim!\"). \nTHRILLING ADVENTURE HOUR: THE GRAPHIC NOVEL!!! \nThroughout the years, TAH has become the largest and most rewarding part of our creative lives. So as we approach our eight year anniversary, we want to bring TAH to a whole new level. After eight years of listening to THRILLING ADVENTURE HOUR, we want to finally give everyone a chance to see and experience these worlds for themselves in an original graphic novel and (if we hit our target) a series of stretch goals ushering TAH into other media as well!\nWe\u2019re hosting this Kickstarter campaign to finance the production of a really fun graphic novel anthology that recreates the TAH experience in print. The same worlds. The same characters. The same product placement. The anthology will contain a series of short tales set within the various worlds covered throughout the run of the show. We\u2019re writing the script ourselves, and each story will receive a different artist chosen to match the unique tone and personality of each segment.  \nTo give you an idea of the look and feel of the book, take a gander at some TAH-inspired artwork from comic creators around the globe, including Dustin Weaver, Tom Fowler, Dennis Culver, Evan Larson, Andy Hirsch, Natalie Nourigat, Joel Priddy... and one not-as-professional (but just as passionate) illustration from Mark Gagliardi, one of the stars of our show. We're inviting these friends and more from the comics community -- everyone from industry legends Ben Edlund (Creator of The Tick) and Jackson Publick (Creator of The Venture Bros.) to rising stars such as Randy Bishop, Michael DiMotta, Chris Moreno, Doc Shaner, and Jeff Stokely -- into what's sure to become another versatile, all-star team of creative minds bringing our worlds to vivid life!\nBest of all, should we raise enough funds to produce the anthology, Archaia Entertainment, the 2012 and 2011 Eisner Winner for Best Graphic Album New and 2011 Eisner Winner for Best Anthology, has officially committed to print and distribute our anthology nationwide. \nLike most \u201ccreator-owned\u201d graphic novels, the financial responsibility to produce the book itself falls to us. That\u2019s one of the major reasons why Kickstarter has become such an influence on comics and the arts as a whole: we get to retain the rights to our creations. But without a major distributor, the odds are against our book reaching anyone outside of our Kickstarter community. That\u2019s why our anthology's editor and longtime TAH fan Joe LeFavi (contributing writer/editor on Archaia\u2019s hit graphic novel anthology series for FRAGGLE ROCK) facilitated our new publishing partnership with Archaia, a company whose products we love. If we can generate enough support to compensate our creative team and produce the book, every Kickstarter backer will receive a hand-numbered and signed copy from our first print run. If we fall one cent short of our goal, our book will never exist. Yet if we can mobilize our fans and prove that you want to see TAH in print, Archaia has agreed to finance the printing and distribution of our second print run nationwide. So with your support today, we can hopefully entrust our book with an award-winning publisher capable of bringing TAH to fans everywhere.\nBeing completely objective and reasonable here, we intend to produce the best and most beautiful graphic novel in the history of publishing. \nBEYOND THE BOOK: OUR STRETCH GOALS \nIf we are lucky enough to reach our initial funding goal, we want everyone to know that we\u2019re planning to immediately funnel 100% of any additional earnings toward more awesome extensions of TAH in multiple forms of media. Teaming up with Quixotic Transmedia, we\u2019ve lined up a series of exciting stretch goals that expand our horizons in ways we\u2019ve only dreamed. \nFor every stretch goal we reach, we will share a wealth of new and never-before-seen TAH content exclusively with our backers as a special thanks for your support. These include \u201clost\u201d episodes that we\u2019ve never publicly shared, alternate takes of our songs, thanks, and exclusive videos from the cast, guest stars, crew, and fans and friends of the show... tons of really fun and exclusive TAH awesomeness that you won\u2019t be able to find anywhere else! For a taste of what's to come, check out the promo Kickstarter video that we produced starring TV star Jason Ritter and rock god John Roderick... not to mention our alternative (and spontaneous) musical ending!\nIf you're unfamiliar with TAH, check out the following links to learn more: \nA great article on the show in the LA Weekly, \nThe featured podcast on Chris Hardwick\u2019s Nerdist Network,  \nThe Thrilling Adventure Hour website,  \nA comprehensive list of shows on their iTunes podcast page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter eight incredible years sharing Thrilling Adventure Hour with everyone, we're so excited to finally venture into other forms of media and bring you these worlds and characters in ways never before possible. It's a new step for us, but we\u2019ve assembled a fantastic team of top-tier artists and industry pioneers capable of elevating the TAH experience to a whole new level. Because that\u2019s really the goal here. We've written TV, movies, sketch, and more, but TAH has always been the love of our creative lives. It\u2019s our hope that Kickstarter can help us share TAH with more people around the globe and ensure that TAH can continue to grow and endure for years to come. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #79", "update_userinfo": "Important Update from TAH", "update_content": "An update for our favorite Adventurekateers...\nThrilling Adventure Hour storms Seattle alongside Welcome to Night Vale -- & now sets its sights on Chicago \nThe staged show & live audio performance group is taking on the con world with an impressive showing in Seattle at Emerald City Comicon & plans for Chicago later this month at C2E2 April 25-27"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 198, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tah/thrilling-adventure-hour-the-graphic-novel-and-bey", "project_name": "Thrilling Adventure Hour: The Graphic Novel...

Project Eternity (working title) pays homage to the great Infinity Engine games of years past: Baldur\u2019s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.\nProject Eternity aims to recapture the magic, imagination, depth, and nostalgia of classic RPG's that we enjoyed making - and playing. At Obsidian, we have the people responsible for many of those classic games and we want to bring those games back\u2026 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here - we need your help to make it a reality!\nProject Eternity will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration of Baldur\u2019s Gate, add in the fun, intense combat and dungeon diving of Icewind Dale, and tie it all together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of Planescape: Torment.\nCombat uses a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and questing. You\u2019ll create your own character and collect companions along the way \u2013 taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep, and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. \u2026and you'll experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex, difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.\nWe are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.\nWallpapers:   1280x1024 | 1650x1050 | 1920x1080 | 1920x1200 | 2048x1536\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in role-playing games.  We were founded in 2003 by five industry veterans from Black Isle Studios: Feargus Urquhart, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, Chris Avellone, and Chris Jones. While at Black Isle we worked with BioWare, the creators of the Infinity Engine, on the development of the Baldur's Gate series, and were responsible for the creation and development of the Infinity Engine-based Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment game. Also at Black Isle we created the first two titles in the award-winning Fallout series: Fallout and Fallout 2.\nAt Obsidian we have created great games like Fallout: New Vegas and have many amazing people who will work on Project Eternity, including Tim Cain (Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc.), Josh Sawyer (Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Fallout: New Vegas), Scott Everts (Level creator on Fallout, Planescape: Torment, and Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and Fallout: New Vegas), Brian Menze (Vault Boy artist extraordinaire, Artist on Planescape: Torment, Creator of Darth Nihilus), Dan Spitzley (Lead Programmer on Planescape: Torment) along with dozens of other talented artists, programmers, and designers.\nTogether we have been developing computer role-playing games for a very long time, and to this day there is still nothing we love making and playing more than RPGs.\nWe have wanted to go back to our roots and create an epic PC role-playing game adventure for years. But, it's been almost impossible to get funding through traditional methods for a game like this. The great thing about Kickstarter is that we can go directly to the people who love to play RPGs as much as we love to make them. Plus, we don\u2019t have to make compromises with a publisher. We make the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to anyone but you \u2013 our fans.\nOur relationship with you can be even closer with Kickstarter. We can be more transparent with development and give you an inside look to what goes on day-to-day with the programmers, artists, and designers of Project Eternity. We want to give you a behind the scenes look at the game's development, and we have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, web broadcasts, dev chats, and much, much more.\nWe need to raise $1.1 million to fund an experienced team to do this right. We are asking for more than a lot of the other Kickstarter projects and that\u2019s because we are not only making a game, we are creating a whole new world. That means a new RPG system, entirely new art, new characters and animation and whole lot of lore and dialogue. We\u2019ve also designed the game to have a flexible budget and scope, so if we reach our target budget goal, we have a list great stuff we can add into the mix through stretch goals. And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world which will add hours and hours to the adventure.\nBaldur's Gate and Athkatla are big cities. Spanning multiple large maps with a ton of interiors, characters and quests, big cities are a lot of fun. Like strongholds, they also take a lot of work to do well. We're going to have one big city in Project Eternity. Would you like two? If you take us on an exciting adventure to $3.5 Million, we will take you on an exciting adventure to another big city.\nOK! After much team deliberation we have one final ultimate stretch goal. At $4.0m we will be enhancing the whole game. We will use live instrumentation for the soundtrack, add developer in-game commentary, and use every dollar between $3.5m and $4m to enhance the game. Also at $4.0m Chris Avellone will be forced to play Arcanum.\n\nThe Endless Paths started with three subterranean levels, but it can grow larger with your help. For every 2,500 additional backers, the depths of Od Nua\u2019s castle become deeper, which means one additional level will be added to the vaults. Continue to spread the word about Project Eternity, and let's see how big we can make The Endless Paths!\nWe're also pleased to announce we're supporting the Kicking It Forward initiative.\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

Until one day, our hero Dove finds a strange boat, and everything changes.\nWhat we have here is an Adventure Game for Windows, Mac, and Linux!\nIt's about fishing a bunch of fish, meeting a bunch of folks, solving some tough puzzles, beating up some bosses, and a little dating if that's the kind of fisherman you are.\nSome of the inspirations I draw from in how I'm making this game include Earthbound, Homestuck, Cave Story, and a little Harvest Moon.\nThis is a two person indie project! \nI'm Clairvoire, and I will be writing, programming, and animating! If you want an example of my spriting beyond these screens here, take a gander through my tumblr art tag!  I have been programming and spriting for the past 6 years now, and am happy to have the chance at making this game I've planned the last 2 years a reality!\nMy good friend and talented musician Flashygoodness will be composing the musical score and designing all the sounds!   He is a one man band and scored loads of stuff before this, including Tower of Heaven!  Check out his page and find out what you're in store for! http://flashygoodness.com\nAnd click here if you'd like to download the track from the video!\nMy goals for this game are pretty straight forward!\nLots of fish to catch; lots of bosses to defeat!\nBig open world to explore!\nTell an involved, complex, story with a cast of eccentric characters.\nOver 16 characters to befriend, antagonize, or even court.\nThe friends and rivals you make will shape how your story unfolds.\nDon't let it take itself too seriously!\nIn addition to those goals, we\u2019re going to have item and equipment customization, a big library of fish types and classes, and alternate outfits for characters!  There\u2019s also a lot of experimental stuff I have in store should we hit our stretch goals, such as migratory patterns, weather, and seasons!\nThe development time, after factoring every goal I have in mind and the story's length, has brought us to 9 months, so we\u2019re aiming to have the game released by July 2013!\nShould you bring us to our goal and there's time left, by golly it doesn't stop there!  Every single dollar over the goal goes straight into the game, which will translate directly into bonus content!\nStretch goals!\n$8000 - Expanded content, such as extra characters, bosses, and the game will span across seasons, each area changing to match the time of year!\n$10000 - support for both Mac and Linux!\n$12000 - All physical copies of the game will come with an illustrated game manual, filled with art!  (This will unlock the $20 reward tier too, for a digital pdf of the manual!  Physical copies also get the pdf of course!)\n$15000 - I will ensure there be at least 151 fish to catch, and double the screen filling bosses in the main game, and with them, bonus areas and endgame challenges!\n$20000 - Indepth Weather and News!  It turns out TVs are still pretty popular!  Bonus news anchors and meteorologist characters, who attempt to predict what the fully simulated weather system (also included with this goal) has in store for different areas of the world!\n$20000 - For every $2000 raised beyond this goal, Dove can afford a new channel for her Television, using advanced pelican carrier technology!  Cooking, gameshows, sports, music, shark week, and who knows what else!\n$30000 and beyond - This game is stuffed with content at this point.  So stuffed that there's no way I could reasonably add more content beyond what we've reached so far!  So here's the plan!  I will begin work on an expansion to the full and complete game, aimed specifically at adding many more collectables, fish, bosses, and dialog.  How much more?  That will depend on where we end off!  But know this:  Every last penny raised is going into this game, No Matter What!\nWith your backing, I'll be able to devote every hour of my day to bringing this game to light!

NEIL GAIMAN IS OUR SPECIAL GUEST FOR A CAMEO IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF BENDITO MACHINE!\nUPDATE2: NEW LIMITED EDITION REWARD!!\nLimited Edition of 25 exclusive posters, hand screen printed, numbered and signed, featuring a delicious selection of Bendito Machine artifacts for your viewing pleasure. Printed in high quality archival paper, size is A2 format (42x59.4 cm - 16.5x 23.4 in)\n[NOTA: Para leer este texto en espa\u00f1ol, click aqu\u00ed]\nDear friends, this is a second round to fund our project on Kickstarter. We've got a lot of wonderful support in our first campaign, but things are unpredictable and we recognized that our goal was too high to succeed. Now we're back again with a lower goal and we firmly believe that, with your help, this time we can do it! Actually, we already did it!\nAnd this is the story: It begins six years ago when I, tired from all the global cretinism, decided to create a universal fable about human conflicts and enigmatic mystifying eyes that watch everything. After some months devoted to materializing this idea, the short film Bendito Machine premiered at festivals all over the world, receiving support that exceeded all my expectations. What I originally envisioned as a therapy to channel all that accumulated displeasure, turned out to be (thanks to the friendly welcome of the Internet world) the seed of an uncommon animation series which has occupied quite a sizeable part of my last six years.\nFor those unfamiliar to Bendito Machine, it is a show which reflects on the innocence of a small, naive and clumsy species that cannot live without their machines, and which is guided by small, enlightened greedy bastards, who believe they have the answers to everything. In fact, this project would not be possible without the brainlessness of this greedy 1%. Let\u2019s be thankful to them.\nBendito Machine is a show that covers many topics and contains situations recognizable in every corner of the world, displayed in a primitive way without dialogs. The ebb and flow of this clumsy species, which lives adrift in a vast and mysterious universe, might look pretty familiar to you.\nTake a look at this \"Carmenianan\" summary of the previous episodes:\nThe visual inspiration behind these stories originates from the magnificent films by Lotte Reiniger, Michel Ocelot, and especially from the ancient shadow theater of Indonesia (Wayang Kulit), a popular entertainment meant to guide and enlighten the audience through tales of great battles, mythology, religion and popular satire. Stories that try to chase away demons and reflect our habits, something that is perfectly suitable to our times, especially for chasing away demons.\nIn recent years, Bendito Machine has received 25 international awards and has been seen by more than half a million people through the Internet alone, as well as being screened in recognized festivals all over the world. The course of Bendito Machine has been very exciting, from a Norwegian school using the films to discuss conflict and resolution among children aged 11, until to be screened at the wonderful draw-bridges of Saint Petersburg (Russia), among other things.\nThe wonderful Multivision Film Festival in St. Petersburg (Rusia)\nIn the same spirit that characterizes the series, the next episodes will follow the trail of their predecessors, reflecting on trascendency, fear, death, enlightened cretinism and obviously, a lot of machines, as well as important issues such as sacred sex, drugs, dreams, music, bar codes or life on other planets.\nPlease visit our website at benditomachine.com to discover the full episodes.\nAlong with the release of this project in Kickstarter, we are also releasing the fourth episode of Bendito Machine, which you can see in glorious HD, and for free right here:\nToday, the series consists of four episodes, which together add up to 27 minutes, but the production of these four episodes hasn\u2019t been easy at all. Achieving the support needed to fund the project by conventional means turned out to be an impossible task, basically because Bendito Machine is a series inherent to the Internet.\nTaking advantage of my free time and my own resources, I\u2019ve been premiering each episode without the continuity I would have liked. Almost three years have passed between the third and the fourth chapter we just released these days, and in fact, this is something we now want to exorcise.\nSome years ago, I started reading about the concept of crowdfunding, until one day I was illuminated and shouted: Holy Kickstarter!\nThanks to that enlightening moment, the Bendito Machine project began to contemplate a realistic way for funding its production. The great advantage, in case of reaching our goal, is that we can count on the collaboration of a glorious team that would give, over one year, the continuity the series deserves. This team includes professionals in each of the areas necessary for the whole production.\nThe original plan of this Kickstarter campaign was, to achieve $ 30.000 to cover the full production of the next two episodes plus a third special episode, premiered exclusively for our Kickstarter supporters. That was an approximate total of 20 minutes of animation. In this second round we chose a much lower goal which - in case of succeeding - will enable us to produce one larger and greater episode plus all of our rewards with more new designs.\nWhat\u2019s more, we expect to develop the blueprint for an enigmatic and mind-blowing Bendito video game which is already floating in our heads!\nOur production team is located between Barcelona, Madrid, the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, and New York. In Spain we will develop the overall production, such as scripts, design, animation, sound and post-production, while in New York the genius of Sxip Shirey will be responsible for creating the original music. Here you can see a video of Sxip in action:\nPart of our production team: With Julie Reier, Pau Martinez, Sxip Shirey, Bea Bartolom\u00e9, Jose Luis Far\u00edas and Alfonso Fulgencio.\nThe production timeline per episode will be around two to three months and, if all goes as planned, production will begin in September 2012 and would last until June/July 2013. Through our blog and website you will be able to follow the production progress and receive all kinds of parallel audiovisual stimuli.\nWe also count with the incredible support of the International Market of Animation, Videogames and New Media, 3D Wire, responsible for the online magazine 3dwire.es, dedicated exclusively to the promotion of animation and video games.\nBendito Machine is licensed under Creative Commons.\nFor this occasion, we decided to create a line of rewards related to the design of the series and providing a variety of colours and styles suited to this blessed next summer season.\nOn the one hand you will find classical and indispensable articles, like a pack of colorful badges, stickers to delight your favorite machine, exclusive posters only for the Kickstarter disciples, a sleek rubber stamp to bless your documents with style, and fancy T-shirts to protect your torso from our beloved star, the sun.\nAnother of our rewards [BASIC KIT] gives you Associate Producer Credit at the end of the episode. All Associate Producers will have access to an exclusive online preview, before its official release. Moreover, the name of each Associate Producer will appear in the credits, one by one and in big letters on animated full screen. It could look something like this:\nWhat\u2019s more, you will have the opportunity to introduce yourself, literally, into the world of Bendito Machine. Send us a picture of your profile, like our friend John Dilworth did, and you will appear as a Bendito Extra in one of the upcoming episodes.\nAlso, if you like, you could choose a holy tattoo reward, designed and customized with all my love, or have exclusive access through a shared folder on Dropbox to experience all the different production stages of the upcoming episodes, with anticipated unreleased material, storyboards, animation tests, designs, music of the series and a selection of colorful and unique stuff that I will be pleased to share with the blessed backers of this almighty reward.\nFinally, if your wallet doesn\u2019t tremble, you will have the option of being a Co-Producer of Bendito Machine and receive, in addition to all of the above, an exclusive hand-drawn illustration with the subject of your preference. If you have the chance to be on spanish ground, I would be very pleased to meet with you in person at any time and spend some quality time talking about the cosmos, enjoying some good food and the Mediterranean Sea (accommodation included).\nThanks to stay on board, now let's go for the second round!\nFor more information, visit our websites at www.benditomachine.com and www.zumbakamera.com.\nYou can also contact us through Facebook or Twitter, Vimeo or Youtube.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Pioneers Final Countdown! 24 Hours left!", "update_content": "Dear benditos!\nThis is a brief reminder to let you know that our latest campaign \"The Pioneers - A Cinemagic Flip Book Collection\" is 24 hours away from ending.

The 19XX is a secret organization that is working to prevent WWII before it happens. They have seen the future and glimpsed the horrors of war, and now they travel the globe gathering machines, powerful allies, and ancient relics with the hope of stopping the coming war. In 1934, they travel to Mexico in their advanced airship, the Carpathian. They arrive to find a cult attempting to resurrect the Aztec ruler, Montezuma.  Montezuma wants to raise an army and claim a piece of the globe for himself. The 19XX is forced to enlist the help of the paranormal investigator, Doyle Flannigan, and a group of air pirates, called The Devil Wings. But the Cult of the Fifth Sun has powerful allies as well! It will take all of the ammunition and aircraft at The 19XX's disposal to defeat Montezuma and the Temple of the Sun Cult.\nMONTEZUMA 1934 is a 135 page, hardcover, stand-alone story that builds on The Adventures of the 19XX series. This is the second book in a planned 6 book series but serves as an excellent jumping on point for new readers. The completed book is at the printer and should arrive at the end of September and then be shipped out as soon as I have them in hand!  The book offers plenty of pulp, dieselpunk action appropriate for ages 12 and up. If you like steampunk, vintage aviation, or alternate history then you'll love this series! \nClick here to see some of the characters and machines from the series\nAbout Me: My name is Paul Roman Martinez and I did all of the artwork and the writing. I also designed all of the rewards. Making this comic is my full time job, I'm 100% self published! I've worked very hard on this book and I'm extremely proud of the result. If you have any questions for me, just ask in the comments section and I'll answer! Thanks in advance for your support; none of this would be possible without you! For the first book in the 19XX series I earned a nomination for the Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer award at the 2011 Eisner awards.\nAbout the Kickstarter: All of the money raised here will go toward the printing of the book. I'm completely self published, and I do all my own work, which means everything I sell I have to design myself and then pay to get printed! My kickstarter goal is the bare minimum I need to get the book printed, but the actual costs are about double.  If I reach my funding goal, I have some great bonus items and stretch goals planned! And remember, the way Kickstarter works is if I don't reach my funding goal then no one gets charged any money.  It's all or nothing!\nAbout the Rewards:\nRewards range from the hardcover copy of MONTEZUMA 1934 all the way to a hand finished, limited edition cigar box with vintage style labels that I designed for the brand Montezuma's Choice Cigars.\nTwo Page Spread From the Book", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Shipping complete!", "update_content": "The last book has shipped!\nBelow is a photo of the shipping aftermath.

It is also a means to explore and address some things that interest and scare me within the context of classic Italian cinema and Giallo look and feel accentuated by a blast of color drenched visuals both striking and shocking.\nModern isolation scares me. People cut themselves off from the outside world, hide in their homes, and live through a monitor. The faces they see, the people they love, sometimes even marry, all exist on a screen strapped to a box. We'd rather text then talk, and face the world through screens. What does this do to us? Does it cause a strange kind of social awkwardness when they are faced with the real world? Are social skills skills compromised? Is physical intimacy even desirable, or just flat our frightening and foreign?   When I decided to approach this topic in the context of a classic Giallo picture it was decided early on that the best representation of this broken off section of society be represented by a teenager, the generation that seems to be the most effected by the digital domain.\nSo Claire was born.\nDiseases scare me. I'll be honest and upfront. Parasites, diseases, anything that lives off the human body and makes us sick. Scares me. When you're sick no one wants to be around you, and anyone with a conscience is afraid to be near the people they love. Who wants to inflict that kind of thing on another? For the time you have that fever, you are alienated beyond your control from everyone you care about. Not being able to hold my daughter when I'm sick kills me, and hence this concept came into play.\nI had an insanely high temperature the last time I was sick, and the \"fever dreams\" were truly frightening and felt very very real. I felt as if my world had turned against me. This loss of control to my body's state of being really inspired the concept of Claire becoming sicker with her mind perhaps getting the best of her. It also allows us to twist the world she exists in, creating a visual landscape that will be a dark work of art unto itself.\n                                \"THE CLASSIC ITALIAN LOOK\"\n\"Giallo Girl\" is being shot in High Definition 24p digital in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. While the films themes are very modern, every effort is being put forth to guarantee the film is as exacting in it's duplication of classic and practical film techniques from the golden era of Italian Giallo films as possible. We love this genre and want to add something new to it, and also directly evoke a different time and place in film that is very special to many fans, including us.The look of the film is to be an \"art explosion\" of sorts with much effort being forward into every aspect of the stylized world Claire lives in.\nWe will be taking the following measures in order to make the film as authentic as possible in it's look and feel regarding a bygone era.\nThere are only four things digital in this film; The camera, the edit, the film elements pass and the technicolor conversion.\nThe film is being shot in 2.35:1 aspect ratio with all settings exactingly calibrated to match the look of a film shot in the late 1970's technicolor widescreen.\nAll make-up and creature effects will be shot ON SET. No composites, no digital effects, no CGI of ANY kind.\nAll lighting and lighting effects, of which there are many, will be shot live ON SET. No post production tampering.\nWhile the film is meant to look EXACTLY like an Italian film shot in the late 1970's, there will not be a \"grindhouse\" look applied to the film. Only ONE pass with mild film elements, such as stock specific grain, and reel changes will be added to the final print and only to ensure that the film looks as much like an older film that has been preserved and released properly.\nThe film will be processed through a digital version of classic Technicolor process, again to insure the look of the film is accurate.\n                             \"WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?\"\nOne of the most important questions is just that. What are we spending this money on? Below is simple list to ensure you that the money is going on screen and nowhere else. This is very much a film created with an eye on it's intricate visual design with most of the money being allotted to that aspect of the film.\nI'll start first by telling you where your money ISN'T going and what we've covered already as to keep the budget down and only ask for what we NEED.\nOur overhead is small due to the fact that our post production facility is already in place and being done by in house by myself. The post production facility represents thousands of dollars spent and has been responsible for all of the films in my filmography. Having the post production 100% covered from the edit and sound mix, to the final mastering and authoring of the film, allows us to put more money on the screen.\nBeing shot in a small town has it's advantages. We have the location for FREE. A large and isolated 200 year old home that screams horror and is located on 6 acres of land in Wooster, Ohio. The entire production will be housed here given the nature of the story. Less travel means less money spent.\nOur catering has been organized locally. All food for cast and crew is being taken care of by the wonderful donations of restaurants from around the town.\n Our wonderful cast and crew have agreed to work on the film at no up front cost in order to get the film made. They will be compensated on a percentage of the films profits. There are many talented people working to make this picture something special, and much bigger looking by making decisions out of their desire to make it happen by taking a leap of faith that the picture will make money, and we believe that it can.\nThe Camera: After much consideration and research based upon on the needs of the production we have decided upon the powerful, yet affordable, Canon Vixia G10. The camera is a consistently 5 star rated piece of hardware that features the same cmos chip as Canon's pro line. While the camera seems deceptively small it packs a major visual wallop in it's color reproduction, full set of manual controls and customization. The camera features a built in hard drive and two expansion slots. We will be purchasing 2 additional SD memory cards in order to maximize our recording time. Our previous efforts were shot on a similar Sony camera and the final product was every bit as professional as far pricier cameras when properly lit and treated as something shot on real celluloid. We have the utmost confidence that this model can fully realize the film well beyond it's low budget.\nLights and gels. With the film being so dependent on a stylized lighting scheme, one sequence requiring the stylized lighting of an entire overgrown driveway a quarter of a mile long, it's important for us to have the lights we need to create the fever dream look of the film with an array of lights and colors. In order to maximize our budget we will be using an assortment of affordable, but effective lights proven on our past productions, just in greater numbers. \nMake-Up and Creature Effects. In a Giallo film the deaths are spectacular, and our set piece death of Claire's doctor's death and another \"surprise character\" will certainly be no exception. There are also many assorted make-up gags within Claire's mind as well as part of her sickness, including a major set piece where Claire struggles to pry the visual manifestation of the parasite  from inside her body. Claire also endures varied and frequent torment and wounds from her battles with the Killer and the house that has revolted against her. The finale of the film also features a fearsome creature that may or may not be in Claire's head as well as an intricate set piece involving the killer.\nThe \"Bowels of the House\" set. This is the location of the finale of the film. We will be heavily modifying the existing houses dirt and stone basement into a living nightmare including a large pit and twisting, claustrophobic corridors.exploding mirrors, and other assorted mayhem. This set is planned to be a sensory overload of the final stages of Claire's mental and physical journey. \nThe costumes. While there are not many costumes we do require the Hazmat suit, the killer's outfit, and 3 costume changes for the lead actress that we will need to double up on in case they are damaged during a stunt our effect. Claire sees allot of bloody torment and action in this film and it's most certainly more safe than sorry.\nThe gas. I always promise my actors gas. They've been kind enough to not get paid until later, so we always cover their travel. Luckily on this film the cast and crew are VERY small and isolated to ONE location. Our cast and crew all live locally, the furthest travel time will be the lead actress who has 20 minutes to and from set each day.\n                                            \"THE UPDATES\"\nWe aim to make the pre-prodcution, shooting, post production, and release of the film as interactive and informative as possible for everyone. There will a day to day on-line journal kept by myself for the entire duration of the process that we may later release as a book on the making of a low budget film in Ohio. There will be a twitter account that will be updated from the set, guiding the audience through the process. Video journals will be kept and frequently uploaded by the cast and crew in the form of candid self shot photography to on set interviews. We will frequently encourage and answer questions posted about the film on it's online blog via video posts. On set photography will be posted regularly to give one more point of perspective on the film's making.\n                                             \"IN CLOSING\"\nThanks everyone for reading and taking the time to take an interest in our picture. We want to make a film that looks like it's much bigger than one could ever expect from it's budget, and I have the utmost faith in our crew that this is more than possible. The raw talent, planning and ingenuity pouring into this project is really something special, I believe that.  I hope here on kickstarter.com that we've earned your faith and belief as well.

Its glass rattled, and its lights\u2014softball-sized bulbs that bordered its tinted windows\u2014flickered. Ted Barber, who had been standing on the tenth floor, gazing into the lobby, didn\u2019t notice the elevator until it stopped on his floor. Then he raised his head and, like a man adjusting to the material world after disappearing inside a prayer, blinked his eyes rapidly. He recognized the elevator\u2019s sole passenger: it was his wife, Tavey Preston. She didn\u2019t look good. Then again, she was dead.\n(Excerpt from \u201cThe Ones You Want to Keep\u201d by Matthew Vollmer, published in Unstuck #1.)\nUnstuck is a nonprofit literary journal based in Austin, Texas. We emphasize short stories, poems, and even essays with elements of the fantastic, the futuristic, the surreal, or the strange.\nOur first issue -- featuring new fiction from Aimee Bender, J. Robert Lennon and Amelia Gray, among many others -- was released last December. Since then, we've been reviewed or discussed in/on the New York Times, Tor, io9, Poets & Writers, Review Review, Wired, the Austin American-Statesman, the Austin Chronicle, CultureMap, Galleycat, Beyond the Margins, HowStuffWorks, and a bunch of awesome blogs. (You can read more about our journal's history in this web interview, and hear about it in this radio interview.)\nWe're currently raising funds for our second issue, which we hope to release in November. Your donations will help us cover print and distribution expenses, and will also help us pay our contributors.\nEvery weekday during this fund drive, we'll be adding a new author interview to our website. Visit us to learn more about our contributors and read excerpts from their stories. \nWHY WE'RE DIFFERENT\nUnstuck is built around the goal of bringing together diverse groups of readers and writers. We find it frustrating that so many readers who enjoy the fantastic or futuristic work of adventurous \"literary\" authors like Bender, Lennon, and Jonathan Lethem haven't discovered the stories of brilliant \"genre\" authors like Rachel Swirsky, Leslie What and David J. Schwartz. And vice versa: we're sure that many fans of smart, ambitious genre writing are missing out on a number of authors who should be among their favorites.\nWe aren't really interested in labels -- in deciding whether a particular piece is \"science fiction\" or \"speculative fiction,\" \"fantasy\" or \"fabulism,\" \"magical realism\" or \"slipstream,\" etc., or even in deciding what those names might mean. Instead, we approach each story on its own terms -- letting the work speak for itself -- and encourage our readers to do the same.\nHOW WE PUBLISH\nUnstuck is available in a print edition and in several e-reader formats.\nOur print journal is a sturdy, perfect-bound, 6 x 9 book. The cover has a matte finish. Inside, we favor a clean, tasteful, reader-friendly approach to print design, with a lot of air on each page, and no distracting fonts or visual clutter.\nOur e-reader editions for Kindle and Nook are also prepared with care. They include tables of contents with navigation. We try, to the extent that the technology allows, to preserve the original formatting of poems (or come up with reasonable alternatives), and we make sure that every piece of visual art will look good on a variety of displays.\nBetween the stories and poems, we feature dozens of line drawings by our staff illustrator, Matthew Domiteaux. We'd go on about how beautiful and strange Matthew's artwork is -- but since all of the drawings on this page are his, we'll let you be the judge.\nOUR SECOND ISSUE\nUnstuck is already available worldwide through e-bookstores and our international print subscription options. With our second issue, we'll move closer to our goal of establishing a truly international forum for surreal and innovative writing by featuring several stories in new English translation (from French, Spanish, and Bulgarian) along with new English originals from emerging authors in places as far-flung as Nigeria and Finland.\nThe second issue will run to around 500 pages. Like the first, it will include a diverse and lively mix of established authors and newcomers. Some of the work we'll feature in the second issue is playful, some serious, and some dangerous, but all of it is fresh, unexpected, rich, and engaging.\nOUR VALUES\nUnstuckis a volunteer-edited 501(c)(3). It's also completely independent. While that means we have the freedom to publish the work that excites us, it also means that, unlike many thriving print journals, we lack the support of a college or university.\nOur journal is priced so that just about any reader can afford it, and we don't intend to change that. We also set aside a portion of each print run to donate to libraries and literacy programs. (Librarians: please contact us on Facebook to inquire about our free subscription program.)\nAt Unstuck, we want to discover, share, and encourage great new writing. For the writers whose work we accept, encouragement comes in the form of a close editing relationship, publication and promotion, and a monetary payment. But the many other writers who submit their work to us are also part of our community, and we owe them professionalism and respect. We've made a firm commitment never to charge submission fees, whether for ordinary submissions or for special contests. We also do our best to respond to unsolicited submissions as quickly as possible while giving each piece an attentive and open-minded reading.\nWe're delighted that you've found our Kickstarter page, and we hope that you'll join us and support our mission, whether as a donor or a subscriber. And if you enjoy the work we're doing, please spread the word about our Kickstarter campaign; every little bit of help makes a difference.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "The Unstuck Podcast: Preview Episode", "update_content": "Dear Kickstarter Backers and Passersby:\nBy now most of you should have received your print and e-reader copies of Unstuck #2.

Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA!

OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty).

WE HIT THE $10,000 GOAL. My jaw is still on the floor somewhere. THANK YOU ALL.\nBefore we bust out the champagne, I just wanted to pass out one more reminder. If you had in mind nabbing any of our special rewards like the Clockwork Phoenix pins or the Cherie Priest chapbook, there's only half an hour left. Get 'em while you can!\nWE DID IT! WE MADE OUR GOAL! CLOCKWORK PHOENIX WILL PAY PRO RATES. AND NOW OUR NEXT GOAL: A NEW WEBZINE FOR POETRY AND FICTION. TARGET: $10,000.\nThank you all so much! We're overwhelmed.\nThe next volume of Clockwork Phoenix will pay 5 cents a word for fiction. Again, thank you.\nSo, we're here. Earlier than expected. And I think there's time to try for something more. In the story below I mentioned that one of our stretch goals could be creating a new webzine for showcasing poetry and fiction. This is something we've wanted to do for years but completely lacked the resources.\nBut now, I think we could make it happen.\nIf this Kickstarter can reach $10,000, that should be enough to fund 12 issues of a new Internet magazine. Each issue will hold one story (word limit 4,000 at 2 cents a word) and two poems ($5 each.) In essence, it will be a continuation of the MYTHIC anthologies we used to produce.\nIf we hit that goal, we'll launch in 2013.\nI can't think of what else to say other than to repeat, again: Thank you!\nUPDATE 7/30: WE MADE OUR FIRST STRETCH GOAL AND WILL PAY 4 CENTS A WORD FOR FICTION!\nFolks, we've made our first stretch goal! We're past $6,500, and we'll be able to pay writers 4 cents a word when we open to submissions for the next volume of Clockwork Phoenix.\nOf course, as I've said before, our goal is to go pro. We're still shooting to get past $8,000 and offer 5 cents a word. It certainly seems possible. The response to our new rewards -- including the Cherie Priest limited edition chapbook, the tote bag full of books, and the short story critiques -- has been wonderful so far. But there's only nine days left. The countdown is on.\nThanks so much for everything you've done so far to help us make this happen.\nI should mention, I pledged that I would do something special if we hit $6,666. Well, that happened. And Something Special is now in the works. So watch this space.\nThe video below explains the last but not least of our four new rewards, the \"book case\" for your favorite e-reader. There's also an update on our pins and a hint when we'll open for submissions. Check it out.\nUPDATE 7/27: NEW REWARD LEVELS -- including a limited edition, signed, illustrated chapbook of a Cherie Priest short story\nIn pursuit of our goal of going pro, we've added some new reward levels. Anita and I are offering story critiques at $100 \u2014 fair warning, I'm known for brutal honesty when I do these \u2014 and we're also offering a \"bag full of books\" reward at $125.\nAnd we've got another one that's really special, that I'm really thrilled about. Please forgive me for being long-winded, because it requires a little back story.\nBefore I edited the Clockwork Phoenix anthologies, I edited another anthology series called MYTHIC. It only had a two-volume run, but wound up being the prototype for what we did with the Clockwork Phoenix books. I had the pleasure of including in the second MYTHIC book a delightfully whimsical little story called \"The Immigrant\" by a writer named Cherie Priest.\nIn 2006, when the \"The Immigrant\" came out, Cherie was in the middle of her Southern Gothic trilogy that begins with Four and Twenty Blackbirds. Three years later she came out with Boneshaker, the book that threw her career wide open, combining the Old West, steampunk and zombies. Cherie was nominated for a Hugo, won a Locus Award and Boneshaker was snatched up for a movie adaptation by Hammer Films.\n\"The Immigrant\" displays the same seamless blend of the historical and the fantastic that marks all Cherie's work. Here's how Strange Horizons described the tale's opening: \"An American GI finds a young dragon, injured and alone, in the cellar of a French church during the days following the Normandy invasion.\"\nI asked Cherie if she'd be willing to let me reprint this story in a special limited, numbered edition just for this Kickstarter and she said yes, and that she's willing to sign copies too. I then asked regular Mythic Delirium illustrator Paula Friedlander if she'd be willing to create the cover and illustrations, and she's also on board. Paula works exclusively with paper cutouts; no one's work in this field looks quite like hers.\nSo here's the deal: this special edition signed chapbook of Cherie Priest's \"The Immigrant\" brought to life with Paula's art will be made available only through this Kickstarter. We'll make as many as we need to fill the orders we receive here and no more. I've created a new $45 reward level that adds a pre-order of this book to the pre-order of the paperback edition of the fourth Clockwork Phoenix volume that you get at the $25 pledge level (along with all the accompanying e-books.)\nFurthermore, if someone has backed us or wants to back us at one of the reward levels ranging from $50 to $100 and also wants to add \"The Immigrant\" to their swag, increase your pledge by $20 and it will be yours \u2014 I'll track who does this (or you can e-mail me at mythicdelirium@gmail.com and let me know) and follow up once the Kickstarter closes. If you pledge at one of the levels that gets you listed as a supporter in all our future publications ($125 and up) this chapbook will automatically be included in your bounty.\nMy heartfelt thanks to Cherie and to Paula for their willingness to make this happen, and a hat tip to Rose Lemberg, who sparked this idea. And thanks again to all the rest of you who've backed the project so far, for presenting me with the wonderful problem of how to come with ways to make an already successful Kickstarter even more so.\nUPDATE 7/22: CLOCKWORK PHOENIX 4 is a GO!!!!! (and now it's time for stretch goals...)\nIf anyone had told me that I would wake up on the twelfth day of our Kickstarter campaign and discover that WE ARE ALREADY FULLY FUNDED I am not sure what I would have said to them. But I can tell you what I have said this morning: many, many iterations of, \"OH MY GOD WE DID IT!\"\nThank you, all of you, so much!\nReaching $5,000 means that this book will happen. We've reached the minimum Anita and I need to make it work. But I'd probably best repeat what I said yesterday: we hope to do better than the minimum. Both with this new book and with our future endeavors to come.\nOur first stretch goals are simple. At $6,500, I can guarantee paying 4 cents a word to the contributors to the fourth CLOCKWORK PHOENIX volume. At $8,000, we'll be able to pay 5 cents a word, which is considered professional rate. This is what our sights are set on next.\nTake a moment to bask in the glow. Then feel free to spread the news, and to let folks know about our next phase. A phase that all of you made possible. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much!\nUPDATE 7/21: Clockwork Phoenix pins sold out at $60 reward level, still some available at $125 reward level\nJust a quick update to state the above. As of this writing we're closing in on $4,000. This is wonderful.\nUPDATE 7/19: A preview of the Clockwork Phoenix jewelry pins\nSeveral people have pledged at a reward level that gets you one of our special Clockwork Phoenix pins, so we decided to have Anita provide a preview of what they'll look like.\nThe Clockwork Phoenix 4 Kickstarter\nHere's the quick version: we edited three ground-breaking, acclaimed science fiction and fantasy anthologies that showcased some amazing new work. We want to continue the series, but to do that, we'll have to publish it ourselves, and we can't afford those costs on our own, so we've turned to Kickstarter for help. For the full story, read on...\nWhat's a Clockwork Phoenix?\nHi, folks! Mike Allen here, writer and editor of science fiction, fantasy and horror stories. From 2008 to 2010, with help from my wife, artist Anita Allen, I edited a series of anthologies, called Clockwork Phoenix, that showcased offbeat, interstitial, groundbreaking short stories and novelettes. Our criteria were simply that a story must be strikingly original both in the tale itself and how it's told. (The name \"Clockwork Phoenix\" doesn't really mean anything; it's meant to evoke a startling juxtaposition of unrelated things. Plus it sounds kinda cool.)\nIt was a humble venture -- it paid only 2 cents a word -- but we gave new writers a chance to shine and experienced writers the opportunity to try their hand at stories that were really weird and different. The three books nestled contributions from stars like Tanith Lee, Catherynne M. Valente, Marie Brennan, Laird Barron, Saladin Ahmed and Mary Robinette Kowal alongside talented newcomers like Joanna Galbraith and Georgina Bruce.\nSee, we've been editing a little poetry journal with an sf and fantasy flavor, Mythic Delirium, since 1998. And that zine has done quite well for itself as the first home for several award-winning poems as well as publishing the likes of Ursula K. Le Guin and Neil Gaiman. We wanted to apply our sensibilities to fiction and see what would happen.\nSo what happened?\nIt went better than we could ever have dreamed. To give some examples, stories from the Clockwork Phoenix books were finalists for the Nebula Award, the Shirley Jackson Award and the Aurealis Award, and were reprinted in Year's Best SF 14, Year's Best Fantasy 10, Best Horror of the Year 2, The Year's Best Science Fiction & Fantasy 2010, Nebula Awards Showcase 2011, The Year's Best Science Fiction & Fantasy 2011, and even more places. Even more stories received honorable mentions from Year's Best anthology editors and landed on the Locus Magazine Recommended Reading Lists. We're also proud to have published a diverse, international range of contributors within our pages.\nBut our publisher fell on hard times, as many have in this economy. Once Clockwork Phoenix 3 came out in 2010, we thought the series might be done for. After an amicable parting of the ways with our publisher, we searched for another, but anthologies are expensive to produce, even small ones like ours -- so publishing companies coping with their own economic struggles weren't willing to take us on. Yet online and at conventions, people always ask me, \"When is the next Clockwork Phoenix coming out?\"\nWhy Kickstarter?\nAnita and I do want to make another Clockwork Phoenix. We think that the stories we find fill a gap that other anthologies and magazines don't cover. But the only way to do this is to publish the next book ourselves, and we can't afford that without help. That's where this Kickstarter comes in.\nWe've budgeted for $2,500 to pay writers 3 cents a word for a little over 80,000 words of new fiction. The remaining $2,500 includes set up fees with our printer, the actual cost of printing these trade paperbacks for readers and reviewers, shipping and mailing costs, cover art and design, and some contingency funds for those unexpected expenses that always crop up in these ventures, not to mention the portions that go to Kickstarter and Amazon. The rewards we're offering include an assortment of things we've made already and things that we know we can make. We're both creative people and we hope you find our wares entertaining.\nWhat next?\nShould we reach our goal, my next step will be to assemble the stories, both by soliciting established writers who we know can deliver what we look for, and by holding an open call for submissions, which we'd love to kick off in September. It's my goal to have the new anthology finished and for sale by June 2013.\nIn the wonderful event that we exceed our goal, there are a number of stretch goals that we could shoot for, including raising the pay rate for the anthology, securing funds to publish the next book in the series, revamping our ancient website to reflect our new role as a book publisher, upgrading the ancient software we use to make these books, and even -- though this is just a flight of fancy -- creating a new Internet magazine specifically to showcase the kind of fiction we promote in Clockwork Phoenix.\nMost importantly, it's our hope that we can bring another volume of Clockwork Phoenix into the world, and that it be at least as fun and challenging as the first three were.\nOur rewards\nThe main source of the rewards is the new anthology itself, whether we're talking about an acknowledgement within its pages, an electronic or physical copy, or swag with a related logo. But Anita and I are creative people with a long track record of writing, publishing, and crafting, and so we have a lot of other items to pitch into the mix.\nHere's some of the things we have available or will be able to make ahead of the publication of the new anthology.\nE-book editions (DRM free) of the CLOCKWORK PHOENIX anthologies and bonus short stories\nThe complete set of CLOCKWORK PHOENIX books to date in trade paperback\nA 1-year or 2-year subscription to MYTHIC DELIRIUM\nA one of a kind Clockwork Phoenix pin or brooch by Anita Allen\nA butterfly dragon from H.P.

This massive story, six thousand pages in total, has attained legendary status and widespread critical acclaim as one of the most artistically ambitious projects and dramatically powerful narratives in the history of the comic-book medium. Over a 26-year period From 1977 to 2004, Dave Sim (with background artist Gerhard) published 300 issues of Cerebus on a monthly basis, ultimately creating one of the longest works of fiction in the English language.\n\nThe story follows the title character, initially a Conan-parody barbarian, through the fictional world of Estarcion into the spheres of politics, high society and religion. Along the way, Cerebus earned numerous awards and accolades for its creator including Harvey, Eisner, Kirby, Ignatz, Defender of Liberty and Shuster awards. Cerebus was named the thirty-eighth greatest comic book character by EMPIRE magazine and has been cited as an influence by an entire generation of self-publishing and Indy comic -book creators.\n\nThe primary objective of this Kickstarter project is to introduce Cerebus to a new generation of comic book fans by turning the World's Longest Graphic Novel into the World's Longest Audio Book with (fingers crossed) the creation of digital versions of every page of each issue of Cerebus. Every digital issue will include front covers, editorials, essays, letters and back covers and be made available as a $0.99 digital download (If this project succeeds!) In addition to digital versions of the individual comic books, Dave Sim is also providing additional audio and video content, including:\n\n\u2022 Sim performing all of the hundreds of Cerebus characters' dialogue as well as text and captions from the storyline for every issue\n\n\u2022 Sim will also provide audio-visual commentary for every issue, looking back and providing his reflections and a look at all of the relevant documents in the chronological Cerebus Archive\n\n\u2022 In addition, Dave Sim will also be shooting and narrating footage of his rough sketches and drawings (and translating cryptic entries) from his notebooks, as well as providing a never-before-seen \"tour\" close-up of the original art still in the Cerebus Archive (190 pages of the 500 page HIGH SOCIETY as an example) issue-by-issue.\n\nWith the additional audio and video content, The Digital Cerebus will enable a new audience, and those already familiar with it, to take the \"closest look EVER\" at this monumental achievement. An established classic in the medium will be introduced to a whole new generation of comic book fans in an expanded modern format.\n\nBut, at OVER 6,000 PAGES in the Cerebus storyline itself and almost as many pages in \"back of the comic\" essays, letters and editorials, this project is a massive undertaking.\n\nTHAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!\n\nAll 300 issues of Cerebus have been collected in a series of graphic novels: Cerebus 500 pages, High Society 500 pages, Church & State 1200 pages, Jaka's Story 500 pages, Melmoth 250 pages, Mothers & Daughters 1,000 pages, Guys 400 pages, Rick's Story 240 pages, Going Home 640 pages, Latter Days 700 pages and The Last Day 240 pages. The goal of CEREBUS DIGITAL 6000 (CD6K) is that these graphic novels will, in a few years time, all be made available in universally compatible digital format.\n\nThe pages will be professionally scanned at high resolution from original artwork and film negatives.\n\nWork has already begun on High Society, which will be available no later than the fall of 2012. Please pledge your support today and help make CEREBUS DIGITAL 6000 a reality!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA MESSAGE FROM DAVE SIM:\n\nEVERYone keeps telling me: KICKSTARTER! KICKSTARTER! KICKSTARTER! So, um, here I am as part of a event/partnership -- Cerebus Digital -- registered by John Scrudder in his home state of North Carolina. You GO, TARHEELS! Okay, so John tells me I just have to sign my name and personalize CEREBUS esoterica a few thousand times and mail out a few hundred packages...\n\n(both of which I'm definitely up for since, fortunately, they don't require computer literacy -- I still use an electric typewriter, \"escargot mail\", a fax machine and landline telephone to communicate with the outside world, relying on outside help for anything Internet-based (my MacBook is only for typesetting and downloading photoreference: God Bless Google Images!!!) I have written instructions here from John telling me how to input this. I hope I'm doing this right)...\n\nSo: here's my pitch for the $6,000 that I'm trying to raise:\n\nSTEP ONE: CEREBUS DIGITAL HIGH SOCIETY\n\nContinue to convert HIGH SOCIETY into digital files by producing a HIGH SOCIETY combination e-book, audio book/ digital graphic novel/ oral history/weekly serialization at (so far) iVerse, Diamond Digital and Comixology and hope revenues can help things along by the time I'm getting paid early next year (The \"Hail Mary\" Pass Scenario)\n\nSTEP TWO: CEREBUS DIGITAL 6000\n\nIf more than $6,000 is raised (this is where I suspect John is pulling my leg: MORE than $6,000???) then the money would be put aside to do e-books/audio books/digital graphic novels/oral history/weekly serializations of ALL OF THE CEREBUS BOOKS, Beginning with CEREBUS (500 pages), CHURCH & STATE vol. 1 (600 pages). CHURCH $ STATE vol. 2 (600 pages), and JAKA'S STORY (500 pages).\n\nSo, okay, John (I finally agreed). But make the pledges FUNNY.\n\nFUNNY? he says (from which I gather than Kickstarter doesn't ordinarily, you know, DO \"funny\").\n\nYeah, you know -- our \"crazy Luddite technophobe senile dinosaur hermit routine\" we do on the phone.\n\nHe goes, Are you SURE?\n\nOh, definitely. If you want them to even READ all these pledge descriptions the LEAST you can is entertain them. Just think of it as $20 for writing stand-up if we pull in $6,080. (I knew exactly what would work on him).\n\nAnd now. Heeeere's Johnny! (he gets funnier in the Rewards section, trust me).\n\nThanks for reading all this (assuming I actually saved it all by hitting that green button down there)!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfor those of you not familiar with some of the more esoteric pledge items, here's a rundown:\nCEREBUS #0 (June, 1993) reprints the \"in between\" stories not reprinted in the 16 CEREBUS trade paperbacks: issue 51, \"Exodus\" -- Elrod (Foghorn Leghorn), Cerebus, Lord Julius (Groucho) and Duke Leonardi (Chico) locked in a closet, issue 112/113 \"Square One\" a 40-page silent sequence as Cerebus returns to the life he left behind and finds everyone gone, issue 137 - 138 \"Like-a-Looks\" Who is the real Lord Julius? cameo by John Lennon as a Groucho \"like-a-look\".\nCEREBUS WORLD TOUR BOOK 1995 features self-contained Cerebus \"jam\" stories from SWORDS OF CEREBUS.  Sim & Marshall Rogers, Sim & Joe Rubinstein, Sim & Gene Day, BONUS surreal jam story featuring Sim and Chester Brown on alternating panels -- Sim attempting to imitate Brown's distinctive brush inking -- can you guess who did which panel? (allocations may necessitate substituting \"NOT the CEREBUS WORLD TOUR BOOK\" reprint from the following year, same contents and cover, just the word \"NOT\" added to the logo).\nSWORDS OF CEREBUS (Fall, 1984) (volume 6) A good pretty-much-self-contained early reprinting of CEREBUS issues 21-24 which lead in to HIGH SOCIETY.  A good introduction to the character.\nCEREBUS GUYS PARTY PACK (September 1996) Emergency reprinting of the first four issues of the GUYS storyline (No.201 to 204) when everyone under-ordered.  Just to give you an idea of the extent of the 1996 emergency: Sim has 0 copies of 201, 203 and 204 and 2,000 copies of 202.  Pretty much the only place you can get the issue 203 classic parody appearances of Eddie Campell's BACCHUS and RARE BIT FIENDS' Rick Veitch (with Rick lettering his own dialogue) outside of the GUYS trade paperback.\nFOUR MORE YEARS POSTER - released to coincide with the publication of issue #252, 2000  -- with four years left to go to issue #300.

This will be the nicest version of Daisy Kutter on the shelf.\nAge Appropriate for Teen Readers.  Material is about as heavy as an Indiana Jones movie. PG/PG-13.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Story\nDaisy Kutter is a retired bank robber and legendary gunfighter who has decided to open a dry goods store in the small town of Middleton. The sheriff, her ex-boyfriend Tom McKay, tries to recruit her to join him on the other side of the law, but she isn't quite ready to move on.\nWhen Daisy loses everything she owns in a high-stakes poker tournament, she is offered a job from the stranger who cleans her out at the table.  He wants to hire her to rob his train.  What's the catch?  He believes his vaunted robotic security system will stop Daisy in her tracks, and he wants to prove it. If she succeeds in robbing the train, she can keep the gold and have her life back...\n\nWhere did Daisy go?\nDaisy Kutter: The Last Train was first published as a four-issue mini-series in 2004 and collected as a graphic novel in 2005.  It went through multiple printings, but we made very little money from the sales.  So, after the term of license expired with the original publisher, I decided to try and find a new home for the book.\nSadly, there was very little interest.\nPublishers were mostly interested in what I was going to do next, with very small deals for Daisy Kutter 2 being offered.  It appeared as though the only way the first book would find its way back on the shelf would be as a throw-in for a minor publishing deal on the sequel.  With my busy schedule on Amulet, I knew this meant that Daisy would have to remain on the back burner indefinitely.\n\nDuring this time, Daisy Kutter became a rare, out-of-print collectible.  When I see copies of the book selling for very high prices online, the little kid collector in me smiles a bit, but then the frustration of not having copies readily available for friends, family, and fans starts to set in.  My favorite copies are the ones that are beat-up, used, and well-worn because they have been read multiple times, or shared with friends.\nNoticing that I was holding onto my own remaining 6 copies of the book as if they were the last ones on earth, I realized we should at least print a few more copies for ourselves.  And as I was putting together the print order, I figured maybe some of you would like a copy, too.  If you do, and you want to order a copy online, this is your chance.\n\nOne chance to order the books online.\nDespite what a lot of readers and artists may believe, we have actually never published a book before.  We have only packaged books for other publishers, and that includes Amulet, Flight, Copper, and Explorer.  In fact, we don't want to publish books, because we need to focus on making them!\nSince we are not a publisher, the next 30 days during this Kickstarter drive will be the only open window for people to purchase a copy of Daisy Kutter online from us.\nWe will also be bringing copies of the book with us to events like San Diego Comic-Con, where I will be more than happy to sign them and include a small Daisy sketch, but after this drive, it is likely that the book will not be available online again for a long time.\nSo, if you would like a copy of Daisy Kutter: The Last Train, please join this drive and help spread the word!\nSee preview pages of Daisy Kutter: The Last Train here.\nRead some reviews of the book here.\nNew Cover, Extra Material, Better Printing, Bigger Book!\nThe final book will be 6 x 9 inches (bigger than the original), 192 pages, perfect sewn-bound for durability (it was previously printed perfect bound, which is less durable).  The main story is black and white but the interior pages will be printed in a 4-color process, and extra materials will be in full color.  Daisy has never before been printed with this level of production quality, so it will be like a special edition!  The extra materials will also feature a Daisy Kutter 22-page short story called \"Phantoms\" that was originally printed in Flight 6.  Other extras include Daisy's history, and a behind-the-scenes look at the way these comics are made.  The new cover features the original issue 1 cover artwork designed on a new blue background, and will be printed with a matte finish.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSIGNED COPY BACKER BONUS! (Details below)\nUPDATE: ADDED POSTCARD FOR SIGNED COPY BACKERS\nWe are now going to offer everyone who pledged for a signed/sketched copy of the book more cool bonuses!  Every signed copy backer will receive a Daisy Kutter bookmark, featured above, AND a Daisy Kutter postcard, shown below.\nSo, for the $25 pledge (+5 Canada, +10 International), you will receive the book with a small drawing of Daisy, sketched & signed by Kazu on the first interior page, a Daisy bookmark, and a chance to win one of 7 pieces of original art.  Plus, if the total pledged amount goes higher, more original art prizes will be thrown into the mix.  This is for signed copy backers only, so I encourage you to up your pledge and enter the fun if you haven't already!\nThanks again, everyone!  And please let people know that this reprint drive ends in a couple of days!\nCHARACTER DUOS Reward\nThis reward includes a 8.5 x 5.5 inch original drawing of two of my characters from any of my comics. Your choice, or I will choose two at random. This includes Amulet, Daisy Kutter, Copper, my Flight stories, and even Clive and Cabbage. The image above is a sample of what the final artwork looks like.  I don't do commissioned artwork, so this is one way to get a nice drawing from me.  The final artwork will be included inside of a signed/sketched copy of Daisy Kutter, and you receive both for a $150 pledge.  If you want it personalized, just let me know.\nTo add to the fun, I will be creating a new CHARACTER DUOS piece for every $5000 we raise to be randomly placed in signed copies of the book. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPREMIUM ORIGINAL ART Reward\n\nIt's been a while since I really sat down and did a drawing like this.  Most of my work these days is very loose and spare, with so much of the attention being focused on the digital stage of production.  So when I realized that the original artwork from the Daisy books didn't look very nice on a wall, and I still wanted to offer original artwork on this Kickstarter drive, I realized that I would have to do some nice new drawings of Daisy.  This was fun!  If you would like a piece like this, there is a reward tier at the bottom you can choose.  If you want something other than Daisy (but it must be of characters I have created) then please let me know.  Original artwork is 11 x 14 inches.  This reward also includes a CHARACTER DUOS drawing and signed/sketched copy of Daisy Kutter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Daisy Kutter & Antler Boy Show at Gallery Nucleus!", "update_content": "Happy New Year, everyone!\nI've heard from a lot of people who have received and are enjoying their books, and Kazu and I just wanted to thank each and every one of you for your patience and support.

Here >>\nGrab the HQ version Here >>\nJoin Operation Keep Hope Alive! >>\nVictor asks Top 10 questions: Watch Now >>\nBehind-the-scenes at mo-cap: Watch Now >>\nGarnett, Two Jeffs & Ryan chat: Listen Now >> \nAbout the game:\nYou receive a desperate phone call from Hope, a young woman trapped within a shadowy totalitarian state. Using a stolen phone, she calls and begs you to hack into the nation\u2019s surveillance system, assume control, and help her escape from the clutches of the omnipresent Overseer.\nDeveloped by industry veterans behind AAA games like Metal Gear Solid, Halo, F.E.A.R., Kinect,and cutting edge videos like the Skyrim television spot and the iconic iPod \u201csilhouette\u201d ads, R\u00e9publique represents a strategic alliance between Camouflaj and Logan to make an epic action game designed specifically for touch-based devices.\nOn October 31, Logan founder, Alexei Tylevich, and I wrestled with feedback we received from industry colleagues who told us that our ambitions were too big. They suggested we do something simple and small like so many other games on iOS... Alexei and I spent hours reviewing the production and financial risks. We discussed our belief that gamers will embrace iOS when more games are made for them. By sunset, we were even more committed to doing something different, big, and risky. \nHere are the goals we outlined with the teams:\nDesign a game and write a story for touch-based devices\nCreate an intense action game without a focus on killing\nFeature a believable, non-sexualized female lead\nExplore heavy topics, say something meaningful\nPush cutting-edge graphics on mobile\nOn Halloween night 2011, R\u00e9publique was born.\nWe immediately went to work on developing a gameplay system that drives the symbiotic relationship between Hope and the player. Our internal design pillar is \u201cHope is Alive,\u201d meaning Hope is not a marionette for the player to manipulate, but rather a smart, believable, and empathic hero.\nBooks like 1984 have served as key sources of inspiration not only for the narrative, but also the core gameplay. In R\u00e9publique, players become Big Brother: Hope\u2019s protector and growing threat to the Overseer\u2019s grip over his secret nation as players gain control of any network-enabled devices, introducing really cool puzzle scenarios. With the tap of a finger, players can power down lights, wiretap calls, summon elevators and \u2013 like a good big brother or big sister \u2013 protect Hope by slamming doors on her pursuers.\nHere are the specs Camouflaj and Logan are building to:\n4-6 hour campaign\n\"Stealth Survival\" hybrid genre\nMetroidvania exploration & 3D map mode\nBranching, gripping, pull-no-punches story\nFull voiceovers\nReal-time cinematics\nIn the event that we surpass our initial funding goal, every penny will go into building an even bigger game with features that you will help us define.\nThanks to the global proliferation of iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, hundreds of millions of people are now carrying a powerful gaming device with them every day. Finally, game makers can truly speak to a global audience, an audience that \u2013 thanks to touch controls \u2013 can easily jump into the interactive experience. \niOS is becoming a great gaming platform, but where are the games for people who love intense action and story-driven experiences? Where are the AAA games designed specifically for touch-based devices? As someone who loathes virtual joysticks, I have great respect for what Chair Entertainment did with Infinity Blade: they built an action game specifically for touch devices. We aim to do the same.\nWithout fail, every company we\u2019ve shown our game to has expressed sincere excitement about its creative ambitions. In unison they proclaim: \u201cYes! This is exactly the kind of game I want on my iPhone and iPad!\u201d But when it comes down to dollars and cents, the most consistent feedback we get is: \u201cYou have to prove that there\u2019s a market out there for this. And don\u2019t use Infinity Blade as an example unless you can guarantee your game will also be featured in an Apple national TV spot.\u201d\nIf you believe like I do that that there are millions out there who want more serious games on mobile, please support R\u00e9publique and send a message.\nOne of the best things about Kickstarter is that it allows us to have a a direct connection with the community and have a dialogue with them. Upon announcing R\u00e9publique for iOS, we received an incredible amount of buzz for the game. It also generated a lot of commentary on the chosen platform. We as a team are still committed to iOS, but now, thanks to the community's feedback, we are committed to delivering a unique version of R\u00e9publique specifically designed for PC and Mac with new features, gameplay and story elements that speak to the strengths of the platform. Look for a video update next week where the team at Camouflaj discusses the direction we will take the desktop version of R\u00e9publique!\nDigital platforms like Steam and the App Store are great, but there's something lacking with digital products. I miss the physical connection (and smell!) of game boxes, strategy guides, and maps. This is why I\u2019m excited to announce the R\u00c9PUBLIQUE JOURNAL, the physical half to the game experience. This high-quality book is a \u201creplica\u201d of the one Hope finds in the game: a musty-worn book passed between secret revolutionaries that features hand-drawn maps, writings from undercover dissenters, newspaper clippings from \u201cThe Outside,\u201d sketches of the Overseer\u2019s inner circle, and even a translation guide to the graffiti found in the world that may lead to hidden supply caches and audio tapes.\nThis pocket-sized book is the ultimate companion to the R\u00e9publique experience. While it's not required to finish the game and understand the story, we know players are going to love it.\nJust like the R\u00e9publique Journal, the Collector's Edition is being designed as a believable artifact from the game world. More specifically, the Collector's Edition features a hollowed-out copy of the Overseer's Manifesto that Hope uses to hide contraband items. Everything from the journal to the CD and DVD are designed to look exactly like they do in the world of R\u00e9publique.\nAnd continuing our theme of products hidden from a watchful eye, here is the concept we'll be using as we create our special iPhone case. Since phones and communications with The Outside are not only prohibited in the world of R\u00e9publique but can get you down right killed, some have chosen to take the risk and retrofitted the Overseer's Manifesto pocket edition into a case that snugly fits a contraband phone:\nThe design fits in with the fiction but also needs to be functional. I think we struck the perfect balance.\nWe estimate that R\u00e9publique will cost north of $1 million to complete. After months of meetings and due diligence, we believe that we can raise the necessary additional funds to complete R\u00e9publique from potential outside investors, but there is some risk that our efforts will be unsuccessful. Before we enter into any financial agreements, we want to prove through Kickstarter that there is a market for a serious AAA mobile game. While we may eventually have to share future profits from the game in order to finance development costs, we have no intention of sacrificing quality, creative control or IP ownership.\nIn the very happy event that we exceed our $500,000 Kickstarter goal, this will grant us more financial freedom and will allow us to build an even better game. We will also consider the idea of developing R\u00e9publique for other platforms, however this is not a decision we take lightly, as we firmly believe in developing our games to the strengths of each platform.\n-----------------\nI'm writing this just hours before this page goes live. The team is brimming with anticipation, as everyone is hopeful that there are thousands of others out there who want more AAA experiences on their iOS device. Are we right to assume that? We will all know very, very soon.\nThank you for coming along for the ride.\n-Ryan Payton\n@ryanpayton\nwww.facebook.com/camouflajLLC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "R\u00e9publique VR is Now on Steam!", "update_content": "Hello Loyal Backers!\nAs you may be aware, R\u00c9PUBLIQUE VR released on Oculus Go  back in 2018, and since then we\u2019ve brought our VR reiteration of the game to Oculus Quest & Oculus Rift.

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.

It's as Easy as Downloading an App.\nPebble is the first watch built for the 21st century. It's infinitely customizable, with beautiful downloadable watchfaces and useful internet-connected apps. Pebble connects to iPhone and Android smartphones using Bluetooth, alerting you with a silent vibration to incoming calls, emails and messages. While designing Pebble, we strove to create a minimalist yet fashionable product that seamlessly blends into everyday life. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH APPS\nApps bring Pebble to life. We're building some amazing apps for Pebble. Cyclists can use Pebble as a bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, distance and pace data. Runners get a similar set of data displayed on their wrist. Use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. Don't worry about the rain, Pebble is water-resistant! If you're a golfer, feel free to bring Pebble onto the course. We're working with Freecaddie to create a great golf rangefinder app for Pebble that works on over 25,000 courses world-wide. Instead of using your phone, view your current distance to the green right on your wrist. These apps will be the first, with more in the works!  \nCUSTOMIZE WITH WATCHFACES\nPebble can change instantly, thanks to its brilliant, outdoor-readable electronic-paper (e-paper) display. We've designed tons of watchfaces already, with more coming every day. Choose your favourite watchfaces using Pebble's iPhone or Android app. Then as the day progresses, effortlessly switch to the one that matches your mood, activity or outfit. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you need to stay on top of things, Pebble can help with vibrating notifications, messages and alerts. Dismiss a notification with a shake of your wrist. Don't worry, it's easy to disable all notifications.\nIncoming Caller ID\nEmail (Gmail or any IMAP email account)\nCalendar Alerts\nFacebook Messages\nTwitter\nWeather Alerts\nSilent vibrating alarm and timer\nAndroid users can also receive Text Messages (SMS) on their Pebble. Unfortunately iPhone does not expose this data. Have any suggestions for other notification types? Leave us a message in the comments! \nCUSTOMIZE BY CODING\nWant your watch to tell you when your next bus is leaving? Maybe you're jonesing to see your compile status or recent github commits.. Think push notifications, directly to your watch using the data connection on your phone. Want to check-in on your watch, or create an app that can monitor your sleep? Pebble can send data from the accelerometer and buttons back up to the internet. \nPebble can receive simple alerts and notifications from if this then that (ifttt.com) or our web-facing RESTful endpoint. More adventurous developers can use the Pebble SDK, with its Arduino-like abstractions and simple C structure, to gain full control of the watch. Multiple apps can run on Pebble, along side watchfaces and regular notifications.\nLoad apps using Bluetooth \n144 x 168 pixel display black and white e-paper\nBluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy)\n4 buttons\nVibrating motor\n3 axis accelerometer with gesture detection\nDistribute apps via Pebble watchapp store\nDetailed SDK specs are available on our Pebble Dev Blog.\nHow does it work?\nPebble connects by Bluetooth to your iPhone or Android device. Setting up Pebble is as easy as downloading the Pebble app onto your phone. All software updates are wirelessly transmitted to your Pebble.\nCompatibility\niPhone 3GS, 4, 4S running iOS 5 or any iPod Touch with iOS 5.\nAndroid devices running OS 2.3 and up. Works great with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)!\nUnfortunately Pebble does not work with Blackberry, Windows Phone 7, or Palm phones at this time.\nWhere we're at\nWe\u2019ve been working on smartwatches for over 3 years now.

Lower the Goal!\nAs we roll toward the last day of the Shotguns & Sorcery Kickstarter drive, it seems clear that I set the final goal too high again.\nI really want to write these books \u2014 all three of them. So I'm going to do what I did last time to help ensure that.\nI'm lowering the stretch goal for Book 3 \u2014 this time to $10k! \nNew Benefit!\nIf we reach $10k and unlock all three books, everyone who backs this drive for $50 or more gets a free set of the ebook editions from the Brave New World trilogy Kickstarter too! \n12 for '12\nThis is the second part of my 12 for '12 project, a year-long challenge in which I plan to write a novel every month in 2012. I've already used Kickstarter to fund the first trilogy, and now we're onto Wave Two!\nBy novel, I mean a work of fiction that\u2019s at least 50,000 words, a bit shorter than most of my novels, which tend toward 80,000 words. The Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Awards each define a novel as anything over 40,000 words, but I want to be a bit more ambitious. And 50,000 words is, not coincidentally, the number of words writers shoot for during National Novel Writing Month. \nI plan on breaking 12 for '12 up into four trilogies, and this Kickstarter project represents the second of them: the Shotguns & Sorcery Trilogy. The first one \u2014 the Brave New World Trilogy \u2014 raised over $13,000, more than four times the original goal. Here's hoping we can beat it. \nThe Shotguns & Sorcery Trilogy\nShotguns & Sorcery is a fantasy noir setting \u2014 think Lord of the Rings written by Raymond Chandler \u2014 I first developed as a roleplaying game setting back in 2001. It takes place in a massive city ruled over by a Dragon Emperor who protects the people from the ravenous hordes of undead monsters that mass against its walls. I'd originally licensed it to Mongoose Publishing and hoped to have it in stores in 2002. \nAnd then my wife got pregnant with quadruplets. \nThat kicked Shotguns & Sorcery past the back burner, out the window, and into the backyard. Cut to ten years later. The kids are fine and healthy, and I'm ready now to dive back into that setting again \u2014 but this time as fiction. \nI wrote the first Shotguns & Sorcery story last year for Robin D. Laws's upcoming anthology The New Hero 2, from Stone Skin Press. I fell back in love with the world right away, and I returned to it for another story for Marc Tassin's anthology Carnage & Consequences. Now I'm itching to write novels for it. \nTo give you a taste of the world, I've released that second story \u2014 \"Goblintown Justice\" \u2014 for free. Here's the teaser text: \n\"Ex-adventurer Max Gibson knows he's found trouble when he stumbles out of his favorite tavern and into a murder scene, but when he realizes that both the victim and the blood-spattered orc kneeling over her are old friends of his, it gets far worse. Arrested as an accomplice to the crime, Gibson must work fast to find out what really happened and clear his name before his still-living friend pays the ultimate price.\"\nPlease read it, enjoy it, and get excited for what's to come. \nUpdate: Smashwords went down for a day, so I put the story up for free on my site for direct and easy download too. \nThe Game Plan\nAs with the Brave New World Trilogy, I'd like to line up $12k worth of pledges, or $4k for each book. \nBecause I'm so eager to start the first book, though, I'm setting the goal for this Kickstarter project at only $3k. Once we reach that, I'll get ready to start writing the first book on April 2, 2012. After hitting the first goal, we have a couple additional goals to shoot for too:\n$8k: The second book in the trilogy is unlocked! This gets added to the ebook and print omnibus editions rewards for free!\n$10k: The third book in the trilogy is unlocked! This gets added to the ebook and print omnibus editions rewards for free! \nI want to thank you in advance for your support. Please pledge whatever you like or can, but also don't forget to spread the word far and wide about this project. Tell your friends, family, and neighbors and even strangers if they'll listen. It's going to be an amazing year, and I really can't wait to have everyone along for the ride!\nCredits\nVideo Editing: Darren Orange of Reactor 88 Studios\nShotguns & Sorcery Logo: Jim Pinto\n12 for '12 Logo: Jim Pinto", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 47, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/forbeck/12-for-12-20-shotguns-and-sorcery-novels", "project_name": "12 for '12 (2.0): Shotguns & Sorcery Novels"}}]
