Sidney conveyed his first visions as a boy through to his immediate concerns for the earth and humanity, ultimately revealing his motivation for agreeing to the project. \nEverything the man did exuded a deeply spiritual nature and an authentic indigenous life steeped in ancestral prayers, rituals, and ceremonies.\nThe filmmakers saw the chance to return as an opportunity they could not pass up.\nPoster Series - The Director Filming a Blacktail Hunt in the Sandhills\nhttp://bit.ly/PosterCameraSilhouetSlogans\nThe Lakota Ceremonies are critical for living a spiritual, meaningful life. They are discussed extensively in formal settings, around the kitchen table, or as they hunt and work to survive.\nHere he discuses many controversial aspects of his religion, including the use of peyote, and his rough yet honest personality is revealed.\nhttps://youtu.be/IyOIPWN4CDM\nSidney is a natural storyteller, the man can tell a joke and spin yarn. Interviews around the kitchen table often strayed from spiritual topics to humor or brutally honest accounts of suffering and intergenerational trauma.\nhttps://youtu.be/_OwZjpYZeNI\nPotential Tee Shirt Design or DVD Label:\nMany more designs are appearing on our website: http://sidneyhasnohorsesthemovie.com\nHunting Silhouette - Tee Pee Composite\nBut the candid interviews revealed a fantastic, yet troubled past. \nAnd he never spared the gory details about growing up in one of the poorest, most violent counties in the country. \nHe was brutally honest about his own past, revealing profound character flaws and bouts with alcohol and drug abuse.\nhttps://youtu.be/D9xvvOoF0nk\nIt was easy to wonder if he was an authentic shaman, from a lineage of famous Lakota, or just another troubled mystic; a reservation brawler with a history of substance abuse and anger issues. \nBut the filmmakers immediately began witnessing authentic, often grueling, rituals and ceremonies.\nhttps://youtu.be/qvbLxgFDa7E\nWithin days of arriving we were a dozen feet from warriors giving flesh. We never thought the opportunity to pay the Ancestors in such a traditional way would materialize.\nhttps://youtu.be/PmpFmpskFCk\nWe have since experienced spirit channeling and some of the most mystical ceremonies (Yuwipis) still performed in modern times.\nThe interviews are a fascinating archive of indigenous wisdom. The project has great potential for becoming a realistic, intense portrayal of indigenous spiritual identity.\nBut it may also reveal a profound understanding of mind and consciousness at the core of many earth-based religions. And the narrative we're constructing may provide access to that knowledge; informing, improving, and influencing even the most resilient of modern-minds.\nThe Experience: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Torment, and a Link to the Spirit World\nResearch into diverse topics aimed at vetting the most mystical stories, and seemingly outlandish personal accounts, ultimately included quantum field theory, biology, neuroscience, psychology, cultural identity, genocide, comparative religion, and consciousness. \nConsciousness & World-View Poster: Potential Tee Shirt Design\nThe following clip from an interview of University of Nebraska Professor of Religious Studies, Dale Stover, leads the filmmakers to further investigate indigenous religious identity. But it only scratches the surface of the research conducted between the interviews and ceremonies.\nhttps://youtu.be/yKCj2vnhkbo\nIn later passages of the interview, Professor Stover reveals he has first hand knowledge of one of Sidney's more unbelievable claims; that he survived a lightening strike during a Sundance Ceremony.  And we have often stumbled upon passages in books or anecdotal evidence backing up many of his most mystical stories and outlandish claims.\nFrom the Poster Series: \nThe filmmakers augmented the cultural lessons and mystical revelations with a variety of video and photographic studies. \nThe Website Gallery & Facebook Album contain images from fine photographer and printmaker David Tepper as well as the director-producer; Salvator Consalvi.\nThey will all be available at various donor levels; and at different quality levels.

Full descriptions can be found on the website.\nFine Prints on the Website Gallery Page:\nPrairie Landscape: Abandoned Church and Clouds\nhttp://www.sidneyhasnohorsesthemovie.com/photo-gallery.html\nTepper, ultimately attended two Wakpamni Lake Sundance Ceremonies as the still photographer. His work continues to expand the gallery of prairie landscape, portraits, and visual metaphors for use in the film.\nWhile tending the fire for a Sweat Lodge Ceremony, Sidney instructed Tepper to \"Go ahead, take pictures.\" The face in the flames developed as is, it was not created in photoshop.\nGallery - Poster Series on Facebook:\nThat Burned Form: Visions of Ancestors and more recent aparitions\nhttp://bit.ly/PosterFlameTagline\nThis quote from Crazy Horse, added to one of Tepper's prints, is directly related to Sidney's motivation for agreeing to the documentary.\nPoster: Flag in Barbed Wire - Crazy Horse's Seven Generation Vision\nAnd the director can't help attaching personal observations to the images in an attempt to present the most salient lessons learned.\nSundance Arbor in Spring Snow: Sacred Space\nHere is a directors \"Double Favorite\".

The interviews are being transcribed and organized into what the filmmakers call, \u201cA 7-direction walk around the Medicine Wheel\u201d.\nMuch like a sage rope that encircles the ceremony grounds, the full narrative of the journey (around the medicine-wheel) will entwine separate threads. \nSweat Lodges, Tee Pees, Firewood, Barbed Wire\n The first narrative arc will remain the character study; presenting the life of a modern-day Lakota healer; struggling to preserve an indigenous religious identity.\nIn a second narrative thread, lessons about and profound visions of legendary figures like Crazy Horse, spiritual mentors like Mark Big Road, Frank Fools Crow, and ancient spirits such as the Thunder Beings will be added to the cast of characters.\nThe audience will learn that, \"When the singing is loud and drumming strong, participants report seeing their own ancestors or hearing and feeling the presence of ancient Lakota.\"\nMedicine Man Drumming & Singing while tending the fire . . .\nIn a third narrative thread the mystical, at times terrifying, rituals are explored. Candid discussions weave the four main ceremonies into the lineage of Medicine Men.\nWarrior Pulling Buffalo Skulls: Original Painting by Sidney Hasnohorses\nIn this way, the documentary will become a visual representation of a natural religion, presented alongside a tenuous relationship with the dominant culture. \nOpen wounds from enculturation and life in the US Reservation system will be discussed, but the narrative will primarily follow the warriors around the Sacred Ceremony Grounds. \nAnd the journey around the Medicine Wheel will contrast the sacred with the profane by revealing incongruous qualities of worldly desires, pride, and psychological damage along with the deepest spiritual experiences.\nSo, for now just enjoy a short video compiled from years of production on the Pine Ridge.\nhttps://youtu.be/eDCbvkvg0XQ\nFilmmakers Gallery: Blacktail & Prairie Grass in the breeze\n Press Releases & Articles:\nMost Recent Article & Press Release - Sidney Hasnohorses: Authentic Lakota Medicine Man or Troubled Mystic?\nMost Recent Article & Press Release - Sidney Hasnohorses: Authentic Lakota Medicine Man or Troubled Mystic?\nPodCast - Indie-Outlook: Salvatore Consalvi on  \u201cSIDNEY HAS NO HORSES\u201d \nhttp://bit.ly/Interview-IndieOutlook\nWhy Contribute to this Campaign? : Or, what will my donation be used for?\nThree Editing Sessions: Developing a Riveting Narrative\nTwo to Three Months of writing, transcribing interviews, and compiling a rough video edit from a library of nearly 100 hours of footage.\nOne Month in the editing suite, converting that rough-cut into a compelling draft narrative. \nA month screening with the Experts, crew-members, and some of you. \nA Second Month in the editing suite, refining the narrative.\nWe've only begun to review the interviews and video studies of the landscape and culture.

We reached our goal of $20K a few days ago because of your unbelievable generosity! We can now support the rollout of our film and further our core mission, which is to help Peter share his story with as many people as possible. THANK YOU!\nSpeaking of sharing, and with ONLY ONE DAY LEFT in our campaign, we're excited to announce we're honing in on our $25K stretch goal, which means we'll be able to share Peter\u2019s art online by having enough money to curate a digital archive of his scrapbooks and autobiographical writings. This will allow people from all over the world to compare Peter's textured and unedited presentation of himself and his story with our more technically savvy, but equally obsessive, approach. We're so close to making this possible - please help us if you can!\nSpecial Scrapbooks of Peter Anton and His Life / photograph by Dan Rybicky & Aaron Wickenden\nAnd if we reach $30K or beyond, we plan to put those additional funds towards creating a personalized interactive storytelling experience where users will be able to navigate their way through rooms inside of Peter Anton's house and contextualize his art by seeing the environment in which it was created. The prototype we made with Chicago-based designers 11hundred is really cool, and we've been developing this transmedia aspect of our project - including at an amazing Tribeca <Data/Docs> Hackathon last summer - for almost as long as we've been making the film. The more money we can raise by August 8th, the more we'll be able to put towards making Peter's condemned home come back to virtual life. Your support as always means everything.\nThanks again everybody, and please read on for more about the project and our special rewards - including one brand new one!\nOUR STORY\n82-year-old Peter Anton has spent decades obsessively chronicling his life in a massive, illustrated autobiography titled \"Almost There,\" and nothing - not poverty, isolation or crippling disabilities - will keep him from sharing his story with the world. \nPeter\u2019s work, which can be best described as \"outsider\" art (art created outside the cultural mainstream) was made in \u2013 and, at times, physically on - his current/childhood home in Northwest Indiana. But with his immediate family now dead, his house has fallen into squalor and his health is failing. What happens when Peter befriends us and we try to help him tell his story and get his work shown publicly for the first time forms the dramatic center of the film. \nAlmost There delves into Peter\u2019s controversial art exhibit and documents the tumultuous transition he must make out of his childhood home. Along the way, the directors meet people in Peter's community who like them are compelled to help this charismatic yet curmudgeonly character survive, while asking: Why do they do it? What responsibilities do we have to those in need, and where should boundaries be drawn?\nWe've been working with Peter for eight years now, and our film is the result of this in-depth and life-altering experience. As Peter says in the video above, we are 90% done with the process, but now we need you to help us fund that last, crucial 10% to cover the distribution and impact producing-related costs that will ensure our feature is able to be seen.\nOUR AUDIENCE\nAlmost There - our directorial debut - is an innovative subject-maker collaboration appealing to various art and film communities, including those like us who embrace DIY aesthetics and are fascinated by people purely and passionately motivated to create work outside of the cultural and commercial mainstream. \nOur character-driven narrative will interest anyone confronting issues involving poverty, senior living, the disabled or those with mental illness. Peter's seemingly \"small\" story inspires larger questions, such as: How does society measure the quality of art? What makes a person an outsider, and how is this classification impacted by that person's economic position and living conditions?\nAlthough our project deals with illness and end-of-life issues, it is filled with humor \u2013 both the goofy humor of our subject and the humor that arises during times of unimaginable struggle. \nOUR PASSION\nBecause Almost There originated as a photo documentary, it utilizes a unique archive of 15,000 still images, as well as a treasure trove of Peter's art: paintings, photographs, scrapbooks, hand-drawn VHS covers and other ephemera - several of which were featured in the acclaimed exhibit at Chicago's Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art. Based on the strong and complex reactions people have had to the exhibit and early cuts of the film, we realize Peter's way of living and working is rarely seen by the public this closely - and even less so in an artistic context.\nWhile Peter's story may be extreme, it's ultimately universal: most everyone has a \"soft spot\" for an eccentric friend, relative or neighbor. Sooner or later, everyone copes with having to make difficult decisions about a parent or grandparent. And we all know how hard it is to let go and face the fear that comes with making any long-term change, even when that change may be for the better.\nOUR HOPE\nBecause of its rich mix of tones, provocations and POVs, Almost There can catalyze a deeper exploration \u2013 artistic, academic and otherwise \u2013 into the way stories are told, as well as motivate a closer consideration of the ethical complexities and potential conflicts inherent in every subject-filmmaker, artist-curator relationship. Our project can become a touchstone in the field of outsider art scholarship, but only with your help will we be able to reach and fully engage our intended audiences.\nWe really, truly are \"almost there,\" but we still need money to cover all of the costs associated with launching our film into the world, including:\nPost-production assistance for our final festival and theatrical cuts (color correction, sound mix, additional graphics, etc.)\nDuplication and shipping costs for prints, masters and screeners\nHiring a trailer-making wizard to make a top-notch trailer \nHiring a designer and printer to make a movie poster that brings us all joy\nHiring an assistant to help coordinate and publicize all of the screenings we plan to do: at film festivals, art galleries, museums, senior centers, colleges and universities - maybe even in your living room if we're lucky!\nWe chose our target goal because if we don't reach that minimum amount, we won't be able to do any of this. If we raise more (and we hope to), we also want to hire someone to curate a digital archive of Peter\u2019s scrapbooks and autobiography online as well, so viewers can compare the artist\u2019s textured and unedited presentation of himself and his story with our more technically savvy but equally obsessive approach.\nWe've already been incredibly lucky to receive financial and creative support along the way from many exceptional organizations, including the Independent Television Service (ITVS), the Wexner Center for the Arts Film/Video Studio Program, IFP's Spotlight on Documentaries, the IDFA Forum, the Indiana Arts Commission, the Illinois Arts Council, and Columbia College Chicago. But now we need you - our friends, families and future audiences, as well as those who love and support independent art and cinema - to fill in that last, beautiful piece of this epic, eight-year puzzle. Your donation at any level means the world to us. We've got some really sweet and substantial rewards to the right, so please check them out and please help Peter and us finally bring our labor of love into the world. We can't do it without you!\nOUR TEAM\nOur production company Kartemquin Films has been making documentaries for the past 48 years that examine and critique society, and Almost There continues Kartemquin\u2019s tradition of using film as a vehicle to deepen our understanding of society through everyday human drama. The organization is best known for 1995's seminal masterpiece Hoop Dreams, but it has also produced award-winning work on the visual arts, including A Good Man, a profile of choreographer Bill T. Jones for PBS\u2019 2011 American Masters series, and Golub, a profile of the late painter Leon Golub. In reviewing the latter film, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum writes: \u201cGolub conveys the exhilarating sense that art is inseparable from both the world that engenders it and the world that receives it.\" It is in this spirit that we bring you Almost There. \nDan Rybicky (Co-Director/Producer) is an artist and teacher whose photographs, installations, and plays have been seen in venues in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. After receiving his MFA at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, Dan began working with and consulting in various production capacities for filmmakers Martin Scorsese, John Sayles, and John Leguizamo. Dan is currently an Associate Professor in Cinema Art + Science at Columbia College Chicago where he designs and teaches both graduate and undergraduate courses.\nAaron Wickenden (Co-Director/Producer) is a filmmaker with extensive experience as an editor and cinematographer. His recent accomplishments include: Editing and Additional Cinematography for the 2014 hit Finding Vivian Maier, which premiered at the prestigious Toronto International Film Fest, won Best Doc at Miami International and is currently selling out movie theaters throughout the US. In 2013, Aaron received an Emmy Award nomination for co-editing The Interrupters. Aaron\u2019s editing credits include: The Trials of Muhammad Ali, Scrappers, and At The Death House Door.\nMore information about other members of our team can be found on Kartemquin's website.\nOUR REWARDS\nYou'll be thanked in quiet, gentle ways you'll probably never know about, and you'll be thanked in big, public ways - like on our website - that you might.\nAlso, because our production company Kartemquin Films is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, your donation is considered tax-free to the extent of the law (as your accountant will determine on your personal tax return).\nPhotograph by Environmental Cinematographer David Schalliol based on an image from the film\nAnd if you prefer to keep your contribution completely anonymous and off of all social media - or if you have any questions whatsoever - please feel free to email aaron@kartemquin.com and/or dan@kartemquin.com directly.\nBelow is a sampling of some of the rewards we're offering to the right.

Merv Griffin interviewed him, Lenny Bruce shared the bill, Phillippe Starck named a building after him, Elvis Costello brought him to London and fashion designers have created entire collections around his look.\nFor over 30 years, one of the most sought out, recognizable figures in New York City was Louis Hardin, Jr., a towering Midwesterner, who stood day and night on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 54th Street, dressed in the early years like a monk, later as a Viking, selling poetry and playing homemade instruments. Blind and handsome, he called himself MOONDOG. Thousands bought his records, he appeared on the big and small screen and his picture was taken by countless tourists and famous photographers alike. But few have known his extraordinary, wild and surprising life story - until now!\nMoondog's World | \u00a9 Dog Days Films\nTHE VIKING OF SIXTH AVENUE is a feature-length documentary about the colorful life, times and music of a true original whose life and art were one and the same. With a wealth of never before seen archival film, home movies and rare audio recordings, the film is told largely from Moondog\u2019s perspective and will feature unique interviews with Moondog\u2019s friends, family, collaborators and musicians who cite him as an influence including Jarvis Cocker, John Zorn, Chris Stein and Debbie Harry, Damon Albarn, Philip Glass and many more. \nBorn and raised in the American Midwest, Louis Hardin lost his eyesight at sixteen and studied music at the Iowa School for the Blind. Arriving alone in New York City in 1943, over the next three decades Hardin reinvented himself as Moondog and perfected the striking Viking persona and unique musical style that would make him famous. Moondog\u2019s remarkable life spans much of the 20th century and takes him from Black Foot ceremonies in Idaho to living homeless on the streets of New York to being honored by European royalty. His unique musical career has Moondog appearing with Salvador Dali, recording a children\u2019s album with Julie Andrews, conducting Johnny Carson\u2019s orchestra and performing across Europe with Goldfrapp's Will Gregory.\nOpening with Moondog\u2019s arrival in New York, THE VIKING OF 6TH AVENUE unravels with the drama of a fiction film. Visually rich, it weaves back and forth in time, mixing cinematic contemporary footage with a wealth of never-seen-before archival materials. With audio recordings from more than 20 hours of rare interviews, Moondog\u2019s voice is the personal narrative backbone of the film. His wide range of music provides the soundtrack, using both original and new versions of his works, from orchestral pieces to pop songs.\nWith Moondog\u2019s spellbinding story at its core, THE VIKING OF SIXTH AVENUE looks at what drew so many to Moondog, during his lifetime and to this day. It goes beyond the spectacle of Moondog as the Viking to uncover the motivations of a man determined not only to create original music but to live a truly original life.\n\u00a9 Peter Martens\nWe've been working on our feature length documentary THE VIKING OF 6TH AVENUE about Moondog and his amazing life and music for over two years, but now we need your help!\nJoin us and let's tell Moondog's incredible story for the first time on film!\nMoondog, the original crowd-funded artist, relied on the generosity of strangers, people who saw him on the street and recognized that he was something special. Now we hope to do the same \u2013 we\u2019re asking you to help make this film happen. \nWe\u2019ve found support from international film funds and traditional backers and of course used our own money but we believe Moondog\u2019s story deserves to be told in a way that does justice to his unique creativity and that means telling the story on a big scale. To do that we really need you! \nThe funding of this campaign is essential to enable us to finance the filming of important interviews with Moondog\u2019s friends, family and collaborators in the US, UK and Germany; to shoot in the locations where Moondog lived and worked, and to license the beautiful archival footage and photographs that we have unearthed. \nOur goal is the minimum we need to do this. If we surpass our target the extra funds will help us to complete the film to an even higher standard. Additional funding would allow us to go the extra-mile in post-production, with additional graphics and even more Moondog music, to make the finished film look and sound amazing. \nWe have found unpublished Moondog scores, still in their original Braille form and we would love to bring some of these to life. Help us bring this new music into the world! \nEvery little bit counts, so we really appreciate whatever you are able to pledge. \nStockholm 1986 | \u00a9 Harry Peronius\nHolly Elson Director/Producer Hark Pictures.

This can happen for a number of reasons, such as: high profile interviewees schedule\u2019s change, unforseen events require additional filming, we discover new archival material that needs to be restored or editing takes longer than anticipated.There is still a good amount of filming still to be done. It's possible that could take longer than we expect, delaying the completion of the film.\n\nHowever, there is an award-winning team behind this film with a long track record of delivering award-winning feature documentaries for international cinema and television and we won\u2019t rest until it\u2019s done ... and wins lots of awards.

Its origins were a small South Minneapolis bedroom, a four-track cassette recorder, turntables, shi**y electronics and pedals and an out-of-place shredder guitar. With his early work, Broder created a wholly unique blend of jagged turntablism and sad indie songwriting, drowning in tape hiss and seething with raw, pungent emotion.\nFog released 4 LPs and 2 EPs on the Ninja Tune and Lex Records labels between 2000 and 2007, wildly shifting gears from one release to the next, chewing up and spitting out styles and genres fearlessly. Experimental rock, ambient soundscapes, tender piano ballads, screeching noise, free jazz, folk, electronic pop\u2026 Broder embraced and encompassed it all, with results ranging from beautifully poignant to head-scratching and uncomfortable.\nAlong the way, Broder collaborated with some of this early century's most vital musical explorers, including the likes of cLOUDDEAD, Low, Dosh, Kid Koala, Justin Broadrick, Phil Elverum, Markus Acher of The Notwist and many, many others. The musicians who joined Fog in the studio and on the road have since been seen performing with the likes of Bon Iver and Andrew Bird. The tentacles of Andrew Broder's bedroom dream reached far into the modern musical landscape, while Fog itself has remained fairly obscure. But those who know still know and will always treasure Fog's music, like a secret spot in the woods known only to you and your friends, insulated from from the cold, calculated bullsh*t of the outside world.\nBroder set Fog aside in 2008, and has continued to create and survive in the relentless push and pull of a life in music. He has met both success and failure along the way, forging ahead, simultaneously building and destroying his own body of work in the name of creative evolution.\nSo what is the next?\nIt's time for Fog to make its return. Andrew has begun crafting a new set of songs under the Fog moniker, with the goal releasing a finished album no later than fall of 2015. With support from fans and lovers of fearless modern music, he plans to record with Grammy-winning producer Brian Joseph (Bon Iver) at April Base Studio in Eau Claire, WI, culminating in a batch of songs that will satisfy old Fog heads and intrigue the uninitiated. The tunes will be beautiful and haunting, augmented by pulsating electronics and churning turntables. Andrew has decided to fund this project via Kickstarter to help ensure that every step in the creation of this album \u2014 writing, recording, mixing, mastering \u2014 is of the highest quality. The writing and demoing process is already in full swing, and studio time is booked for September 2014.\nThose who pre-order the album by backing this project will not only receive a beautiful physical and sonic artifact, they can also get other exclusive rewards as well as the satisfaction of knowing they\u2019ve helped a singular and significant artist continue his journey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe process of writing, recording and releasing an album is risky and unpredictable by nature.

The Vatican\u2019s message is clear: feminism is simply incompatible with Catholicism, and if you want to remain a part of the Church, you must abandon your \u201cradical\u201d ideology. \nThese three sisters elected to hold on to their convictions, and stand up to the Vatican\u2019s narrow, conservative stance. From the halls of Congress to Saint Peter\u2019s Square, we follow the sisters as they shake up the Catholic Church and American politics.\nDonor Perks (All contributors will be showered with divine blessings, good karma and tax deductions!)\n*If you wish to contribute anonymously, email Kristen@RadicalGraceFilm.com.

The film examines the nature of faith, the universal struggle for gender equality and social justice, and the modern role of religion in society.

With a mother fueled by hallucinations of political conspiracy and family disfunction, Petersen is kidnapped at the age of 12 and taken on a cross-country adventure that will forever alter the family as they know it. \n    In those awkward teen years, from George Bush 1.0 to Bill Clinton to George Bush 2.0, it's a time of technological growth in American homes. Desktop computer and personal cell phone use is on the rise. Our culture transforms from a place where a person talking to themselves alone in public is labeled as \"crazy,\" to a time where you are an outcast if you don't have a mobile phone and it is perfectly acceptable to rant and rave in public to an invisible person. \n     There is a Gulf War that never ends.  A baby trapped in a well. The rise of Star Trek: TNG, the future we had all hoped for.

I stumbled into this story idea as part of a larger feature film idea and felt that it worked on its own as a short film, and here we are.  \nEddie plays a Sammy Davis, Jr. impersonator hired via Craigslist to perform for a boy's birthday party. He arrives at the boy's home, meets the boy's mother and finds her living in a hoarder house. Despite the bleak surroundings, the woman is full of life and excited to meet Sammy Davis, Jr. She's homeschooled her son and kept him in the dark about modern music, movies and the outside world. The boy is a huge Rat Pack fan and his birthday present is a personal performance from the Candy Man himself. \nUpon entering his bedroom, we discover that the boy is not a boy at all, but a bed-ridden and severely ill man (played by Steve Little) on the brink of death. Connected to hoses, tubes and IV's, the man has a hankering for Milky Way candy bars and a very specific short list of requests for Sammy Davis, Jr. \n  The Cast\nI conceived of this film with the actors Steve Little (Eastbound & Down, The Catechism Cataclysm, Wrong), Eddie Rouse (George Washington, Low & Behold, Undertow) and Margie Beegle (Harmony & Me, Computer Chess) in mind. Thankfully, all of them have agreed to star in the film.\nSteve Little\nEddie Rouse\n  The Crew\nClay Liford (Producer) - Clay serves as Producer and Director of Arts+Labor in Austin, TX.

He has written and directed three features to date, including the festival hits Wuss (SXSW 2011, AFI 2011 Audience Award Winner) and Earthling (SXSW 2010). His comedy short My Mom Smokes Weed has played over forty festivals, including the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. He is a Graduate of the University of Texas film program.\nZack Carlson (Producer) - Zack is a writer/producer living in Austin, TX. His previous production work includes The American Scream (named one of 2012's best documentaries by Roger Ebert), which he produced for director Michael Stephenson, as well as international horror anthology The ABCs of Death and independent comedy Zero Charisma. He was a lead film programmer for the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and Fantastic Fest for many years, and co-authored the book \u201cDestroy All Movies!!!\u201d He's currently at work on six features, including collaborations with Michael Stephenson (Best Worst Movie), Jason Eisener (Hobo with a Shotgun), novelist Sam McPheeters (author of \u201cThe Loom of Ruin\u201d), the Zellner Brothers (Kid-Thing) and Todd Rohal (The Catechism Cataclysm). He doesn't eat fruits or vegetables.\nMegan Griffiths (Producer) - Megan has been working as a director and producer in the independent film world for over a decade. Her latest directorial effort Lucky Them (starring Toni Collette, Thomas Haden Church and Oliver Platt) premiered at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival and will be distributed by IFC Films. Megan\u2019s previous film Eden (starring Jamie Chung, Matt O\u2019Leary and Beau Bridges) premiered at the 2012 South by Southwest Film Festival, winning the audience award and the Chicken & Egg Emergent Director Award, as well as a special jury recognition for Jamie Chung\u2019s outstanding performance.

I'd like to pay minimal fees to each of our actors and  to the key crew involved. We also need money for the actor's flights, some production design materials, meals, gas and some practical effects work. If there's anything that we can create or make ourselves, believe me, we're doing it. Favors are being asked of everyone we know and many services have been offered for free and equipment and time donated by production and post-production talent in Austin, TX. This short film feels like the right kind of project to be funded by a site like Kickstarter, as it is not a profit-making venture for anyone involved, but rather a personal project that wouldn't be possible without donated funding. For real, folks!\n  The Rewards\nThere are a number of rewards being offered for donations to the film, including links to the final movie, DVD copies of my previous films, hard labor in exchange for cash, on-screen credits and props from my previous movies.

We will begin with our audition process in late October, where students will read lines from the script to the artistic staff. After, we will select our cast of about 20 students and begin our rehearsals, while the technical team then begins creating the sets, costumes, props and all of the technical parts to bring the magic to our stage. Rehearsals will happen twice a week for about 8 weeks after school.

Rocketmen were intended to combat the threats of tomorrow.  If those threats never arrive, what purpose will they serve? Who do they save now? Rocketmen want to know: are you in peril?\nWPA Poster Featuring Rocketmen\nThe Rocketmen are a fraction of a splinter in the body of the Federal Budget. The contemporary remains of a WPA jobs program, the Department of Municipal Rocketry employs men (who are maybe not employable anywhere else) to wear hydrogen-fueled rocket packs and spend their days on city rooftops, awaiting any peril that might befall the city. There is a lot of waiting. In the old days, there was the threat of Russians to battle and 50-foot robots to contend with. Now, they rescue cats, detain illegal skywriters, and start the occasional roof fire. Some of these Rocketmen haven\u2019t flown since their training session. Mostly, they kill time waiting for the emergency phone to ring, which never happens. Until one day, when it rings.\nOne of these rockets could be yours.\nOur series adventure begins when an emergency actually transpires; one newbie rocketman doesn\u2019t follow protocol and ... things go badly. What follows are a series of adventures as the rocketmen attempt to stay one step ahead of the FAA while they fight to clear their name. A motley group rarely called upon to do much of anything, they must rise to the challenge and use all their resources to prevent their department from being maligned (and likely cut entirely). They rescue people from modern urban peril, uncover a vast underground government bureaucracy, face monsters from their past, and suffer prolonged hydrogen narcosis while standing alone against the surprise enemy they were actually created to defend us from. This time, when the city is threatened, will they be ready?\nBen Laurance as Trenton and Ray Tagavilla as Quinn\nAbout the Artists\nWebster Crowell (Writer/Director) is an animator and filmmaker with over 15 years professional experience in Seattle.

In the final hours of the campaign we're aiming to hit a new STRETCH goal of $50,000.\n$40,000 is the minimum we need to finish a rough cut of the film, but it's only a fraction of the overall budget needed.\nEvery extra dollar pledged between now and our funding deadline will go toward:\nSHOOTING: We have lots more to do. We're already planning a shoot with Syl in Chicago later this month and we're scheduling interviews with producers and DJs including Jazzy Jay, DJ Cool V (Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie) and Prince Paul. \nEDITING & ANIMATION: We need to work with experienced, talented people and that isn't cheap. We've already talked with several editors and animators and we'll be making decisions about our team very soon!\nMUSIC: Our film is ALL about music, so the soundtrack is incredibly important and we intend to make it awesome. In addition to licensing Syl's songs, we'll have to license tracks that sample him. We'll also need someone to compose original music for some parts of the film.\nARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: We already have great vintage clips like Syl's Soul Train performances, but an experienced archival researcher can help us find more hidden treasures like his lost American Bandstand appearance.\nPlease keep pledging and spreading the word!\nWatch A Teaser For The Film:\nIn the documentary Syl Johnson: Any Way The Wind Blows, we invite you into the world of a man who might be the best soul singer you\u2019ve never heard of. But you have heard his music already, even though you might not realize it.\nSyl Johnson\u2019s songs have been sampled so many times in the last 25 years that he\u2019s practically had more radio presence than Lil Wayne. When you hear artists like Run-DMC, Public Enemy, De La Soul, Boogie Down Productions, Kid Rock and Cypress Hill, you hear Syl. He\u2019s got so much money from licensing his samples that he calls his home \u201cThe House That Wu-Tang Built.\u201d \nAt almost 80 years old\u2013he\u2019s not telling!\u2013Syl Johnson has outlasted Jay-Z and Kanye West in the courtroom, gone up against Elvis and Paul McCartney at the Grammys, run a chain of seafood restaurants, started an organic urban garden on the South Side of Chicago, and played hundreds of concerts for fans all around the world.\nOur film follows Syl\u2019s life from 2009 through today, incorporating interviews, animation and archival material to illuminate his life and music. With a propulsive soundtrack spanning Syl\u2019s half-century career, Any Way The Wind Blows offers a window into the artistic rebirth of a nearly forgotten legend.\nHere's a little background...\nBorn Sylvester Thompson in rural Holly Springs, Mississippi, young Syl spent his days picking cotton alongside his brothers and sisters, and his nights on the front porch learning the blues from his father and his uncles. His family moved to Chicago in the second wave of the Great Migration and Syl quickly made a name for himself as a sideman for blues legends including Junior Wells and Magic Sam.\nBy the late 60s, Syl was local Chicago label Twinight Records\u2019 biggest star. When that small label shut its doors, he left town and tried to hit it even bigger. But after spending the 70s in Al Green\u2019s shadow at the legendary Memphis label Hi Records, Syl failed to break through to a wider audience.\nSyl went back to Chicago, retired from music and founded Solomon\u2019s Fisheries, a popular fried fish chain frequented by local politicians and celebrities like Oprah Winfrey. But that success didn\u2019t last any longer than his earlier career in music. By the early 90s Solomon\u2019s went out of business and Syl\u2019s second wife filed for divorce. For a brief time, Syl was homeless. \nAnd that\u2019s where a lot of people thought the story ended, but Syl was just getting his second wind. He started hearing some very familiar sounds on the radio and MTV. Sounds he hadn\u2019t heard since back when he was appearing on Soul Train and American Bandstand in the heyday of his career. He recruited kids from his neighborhood to help find Hip Hop artists who'd sampled him and the royalty checks started pouring in.\nToday many of Syl\u2019s peers are dead or just done with music. He\u2019s not. He can\u2019t stop. Syl can\u2019t stop fighting for what he\u2019s owed (a bunch of royalties from 40 years ago, if you ask him). He can\u2019t stop reminding the world that he\u2019s responsible for sounds in today\u2019s pop music that are directly taken from his pioneering recordings in the 60s and 70s. And he can\u2019t stop performing\u2013on the stage and off. \nThe reissue label Numero Group has been instrumental in relaunching Syl's career and keeping him active. They organized his first major headlining tour in decades and released the Syl Johnson: Complete Mythology box set, which earned him his first ever Grammy nomination. \nSyl Johnson rehearsing in Brooklyn, 2010 (photo by Jacob Blickenstaff).\nWhy tell Syl's story? And why now?\nWe're huge Syl Johnson fans, and we agree with the many music critics and historians who compare him with legendary artists like James Brown and Al Green. Learning about Syl\u2019s life through his songs and his stories creates a unique opportunity for people to consider the history of racial politics in America, the complexities of the music business, and issues of creative ownership and compensation.\nSyl Johnson: Any Way The Wind Blows is more than just the story of a forgotten musician finding success late in life. Syl is a deeply complex person and an ideal subject for a documentary. He is, in turns, charming and combative, playful and arrogant, paranoid and wise. More than once he's referred to himself as \"a multi-talented genius.\" We want to produce a film that explores Syl Johnson\u2019s story with depth and honesty, while also introducing his music to a wider audience. \nThe film is already taking shape. We\u2019ve followed Syl Johnson in cinema verit\u00e9 style and witnessed the astounding recent developments in his career. In addition to an unprecedented level of access to Syl himself, the film will include interviews with the people close to him including his family, musical peers, and fans. We\u2019ll also go back in time through archival footage and interviews to explain the larger cultural and political scene in America in the 60s and 70s, when Syl was at his artistic peak. He may still put on rocking live shows, but back then Syl was a force of nature! \nThe Rewards:\nWe've put together some truly amazing rewards that we're excited to share with you.\nFor $10 or more you'll get a download code for an exclusive one hour Syl Johnson-themed mix by one of New York City's greatest DJs, Duane Harriott (WFMU/Negroclash/Bim Marx/Desiree West).\nFor $20 or more, you'll get a digital download of Syl Johnson: Any Way The Wind Blows when it's commercially released!\nFor $25 or more you'll get a full color 18\"x24\" Syl Johnson poster designed by Richmond, VA artist Eliza Childress.\nEliza Childress Syl Johnson Poster\nNEW REWARD: For $40 you'll get an \"Afro Kitty\" tote bag by Project Runway Season 11 designer Joseph Aaron Segal, creator of the world famous Pretty Snake \"Cuckoo Kitty\" sweater.\nPretty Snake \"Afro Kitty\" Tote\nFor $50 or more you'll get to download a special version of the movie with bonus Syl Johnson live performance footage, available only through Kickstarter!\nFor $60 you'll get a Syl Johnson tote bag by Project Runway Season 11 designer Joseph Aaron Segal.\nPretty Snake Syl Johnson Tote\nFor $75 you'll get a Syl Johnson t-shirt by Rotter And Friends, produced exclusively for this Kickstarter campaign.\nRotter And Friends Syl Johnson T-Shirt\nFor $100 you'll get all of the above plus a reproduction of a vintage 8\"x10\" glossy promo photo of Syl.\nVintage 8\"x10\" Photo Reproduction\nFor $150 and up you'll get an invitation for you and a guest to attend a rough cut screening and reception with the filmmakers in either Chicago or New York City next year.

So far we've made it almost entirely out of our own pockets and with the help of dedicated volunteers. And now we need your help to raise the funding necessary to work with an experienced documentary editor, and hire an archival researcher and an animator to help us finish this film and share it with the world.\nWe also need to travel and shoot additional interviews. We plan to interview Hip Hop producers like RZA, Prince Paul and Pete Rock who've sampled Syl's music. And we plan to go to Memphis to film at Willie Mitchell's Royal Studios and interview members of the legendary Hi Rhythm Section, who played on Syl's classic albums.\nHistoric Marker At Willie Mitchell's Royal Studios In Memphis\n$40,000 is only a fraction of the overall budget for this film. But it's the bare minimum we need to finish a rough cut that we can use to raise finishing funds and apply to film festivals.\nOur goal is to finish the film in time for a festival premiere in late 2014 or early 2015. As a backer of the film you'll be continually updated on our progress. And you'll be among the first to know when and where the film will premiere.\nOur team:\nRob Hatch-Miller (Director) - Rob's short films Republican Dad and A Man Named Magick have screened at Rooftop Films, the Sebastopol Documentary Film Festival and New York\u2019s Anthology Film Archives and are available online from Snag Films.

Since 2010 Rob has worked with writer/director Tom Scharpling as a producer and editor on music videos for Aimee Mann, Wild Flag, Titus Andronicus, The New Pornographers and many others.\nPuloma Basu (Producer) - Puloma's first job in the film industry was on Mira Nair\u2019s film The Namesake. Since then she\u2019s worked on numerous TV shows including Bored To Death and Flight Of The Conchords and feature films such as Brooklyn\u2019s Finest, Arbitrage and Kill Your Darlings. She works with Rob as a producer on music videos by Tom Scharpling (host of The Best Show On WFMU).\nMichael Slaboch (Producer) - Michael's work at the Chicago reissue label The Numero Group has given him the tremendous opportunity to share rediscovered artists, music, films, and photographs with new audiences around the world. He's also a historical judge for the national chapter of the Grammys and an adjunct faculty member at Columbia College Chicago in their recording arts and documentary film programs.\nTo stay up to date, please \"like\" Syl Johnson: Any Way The Wind Blows on Facebook or follow us on Twitter: @SylJohnsonMovie\n#syljohnson", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen it comes to our remaining challenges, we are confident that this movie will be completed.

The story follows a Sherry, a paralegal working for a low-rent law office, whose world is thrown into disarray when her boss disappears and his ex-wife, the police and desperate clients come looking for him.  What follows is a potboiler comedy about one woman's crisis of identity.\nThe play premiered in January 2012 as part of the Artistic Home Theater's \"Cut to the Chase\" series.  Starring in the film are AH students Tracy Garrison, Laurie Lister, Janice Rumschlag and Tom MacGregor.  The film will begin production in summer 2013 with an anticipated release in December 2013.\nWe plan on screening the film at local venues in Chicago, as well as submitting A Very Busy Man to film festivals worldwide.\nFollow our progress on our Tumblr page and check back here for updates as well.

All funds will go directly to production costs.\nCampaign Goal - If we can raise $3,000 to make this project, we'll be in a pretty good place.  $3,000 covers most of production, but much will still be covered out-of-pocket by our dedicated filmmakers.

A famed documentarian will chronicle our trials over a 5-year period and release a blistering expos\u00e9 of the American penal system.\n7)  If our goal is met, Kickstarter keeps 5% of Gross funds pledged & Amazon keeps 3-5% of Gross funds pledged .  Net funds we raised go directly to an account for the film from Amazon.  Lots of high-fiving and hugs will happen.  The cast, crew, and producers will be able to do what they love, and do it well.

See right for details.\nFinders Keepers is an oftentimes hilarious, at turns tragic narrative that delves into the very real lives that created - and were forever changed by - the fantastical headlines.\n                                 Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for\n                                           exclusive content and giveaways!\nA few years back I agreed to help my former boss Ed Cunningham organize some documentary footage he'd shot - from a passion project he'd poured years of his life into - so that he could bury it into storage.\nWhile archiving his footage, first of some local North Carolina news reports, I learned about this guy, Shannon, who found a mummified human leg in a barbecue grill that he bought at an auction.\nThen there was the national news footage of how Shannon wanted to turn the leg into a tourist attraction ($3 a peek, $1 for kids).  And then the international news of how Shannon subsequently sued the leg's amputee owner, a guy named John, for possession of it.  Crazy, right?\nBut then I got to the footage that Ed had filmed with real-life John and Shannon and their families, and saw what didn't make the news.  Like how John had lost his leg in a tragic plane crash.  That killed his father.  On the day they had finally made amends.  My interest was piqued.\nThen I saw how Shannon had really just seen the leg as his ticket out of a life of hardship.  And how the insane media frenzy covering the leg custody battle had sent John into a spiral of addiction and very nearly killed him, until a whole mess of strangely improbable things happened that I don't have room to explain but are ridiculous and oddly spiritual and philosophical and inspiring...\nIt soon became obvious that this film that Ed had spent years and a small fortune pursuing was unlike anything I'd seen before.  And so it would be a long time before I would understand firsthand why he would ever desert it.\nHe paid me for the work and we parted ways, but for the next few years the story gnawed away at me.  I would laugh about it to myself in the car.  I would tell people about it at parties.  Finally, I ended up talking Ed into letting me take a crack at directing the project.\nIt was about that time I discovered why he'd set it aside in the first place: people don't like investing in documentaries - even those produced by Oscar-winning producers, he explained.  And not in a mean, philistine-y way, but it's just that statistically, most docs don't make money.  I smiled and nodded as I pried the footage from his hands.\nI've taken meetings with production companies.  I've sat down with potential investors.  They all loved the story and told me they'd get back to me.  In the meantime I got a great producer (Adam Gibbs), went to North Carolina, found an awesome crew (Adam Hobbs, Tim Grant and Jeremy Ball), and we shot some amazing interviews and beautiful visuals! \n...but we've yet to hear back from any investors.  And now all our money has been spent on equipment, motels and Red Bull.  A few years ago, our story would have ended here.\nEd tried his best and came up short, then I tried my best and it still wasn't enough, and now we're humbly asking you to carry the torch and produce a film that would otherwise never exist.\nIf you laughed during The King of Kong, or cried during Undefeated (just be honest - I sure did), now you can help keep alive a rare tradition of documentaries that are as much fun as they are inspiring.\nBe a part of our production, get play-by-play updates, give us tips, ask our subjects questions.

Like many independent filmmakers, Dutcher is a multihyphenate: writer, director, actor, producer, editor. In the process he\u2019s created eight feature films that span genres and styles, including romantic comedy (Girl Crazy), intense emotional drama (States of Grace), gritty gut-wrenching naturalism (Falling), supernatural horror (Evil Angel), elegant formalism (Tryptich), and even a passionate period piece with only one actress (Eliza and I). And since his 2000 film God\u2019s Army he\u2019s become something like the Robert Rodriguez of Utah: the most important filmmaker in a region with a fast-developing indie community. Although the state includes both Sundance and Slamdance in the north and John Ford country in the south, it wasn\u2019t until God\u2019s Army that a multitude of local filmmakers felt ownership for the local film scene and were galvanized to make films, found production companies, run new film festivals, and create a small but robust industry. Hence Dave Boyle, Jared and Jerusha Hess, Ryan Little, Christian Vuissa, Jared Cardon, and a host of others.\nSo it shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that with his newest project The Boys at the Bar Dutcher\u2019s added another job description to his resume: teacher. He had been informally mentoring filmmakers, enough that in 2011 it made sense to organize a more formal effort in the shape of a guerrilla film school that would produce a single feature film from concept to distribution. \u201cI just put the word out on Facebook,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I always said that if I could find 20 students that were willing to do it then I would do it. And I really didn\u2019t think I would. So I was surprised when, at the end, I had 23 people that wanted to do it. So we just organized and started the journey.\u201d\nDubbing themselves Project 23, the group started meeting at night in November 2011 in a law office in Salt Lake City. They began developing a new concept by Dutcher, a comedy that takes place in a single night in an Irish pub in St. Louis. Dutcher describes The Boys at the Bar as \u201can experimental, \u2018conflict-free\u2019 comedy. It\u2019s a kind of celebration of American humor.\u201d The students were put to work organizing preproduction and raising the $150,000 production budget. Actual shooting took place in May 2012, with cinematographer Bill Butler (Jaws, The Conversation, Grease; seen with Dutcher above). With a single location and semi-improvised script, production only lasted a week, and for the past year Dutcher has been guiding his students through the postproduction process.\nBecause of the ubiquity of crowdfunding, part of that process now includes running a Kickstarter campaign for finishing funds that\u2019s now in its final week. To show his dedication to the film, Dutcher launched a 12-day water fast on April 28 (culminating on \u201cthe worst birthday of [his] life\u201d); his daily YouTube updates have become as much a part of The Boys at the Bar\u2018s story as the film itself (never has an actor relished a slice of watermelon more than Dutcher does in his last post). Health concerns required him to eat before the Kickstarter campaign came to an end, but the Project 23 team is still pushing hard to reach their $30,000 goal.\nThe film is therefore not finished yet, but can Project 23 be seen as a successful new model for film education and mentorship? \u201cIt\u2019s an unqualified success in my mind,\u201d Dutcher says. \u201cThose that [stuck with it] learned how to make an independent film\u2013and did make an independent film.\u201d That underscores the greatest difficulty of the process for Dutcher as a mentor: \u201cThe hardest part was keeping some of them motivated. A few of them really didn\u2019t understand the work of a film producer. They thought it would be all glamour and excitement. So when they saw how much hard work, personal risk, and thankless effort they would have to put in\u2026 a few of them lost enthusiasm.\u201d Such a response among 23 participants is not unexpected, of course, and Dutcher says he would do it again if possible.\n\u201cWhat I would be incredibly pleased to see is if this story got out there, if someone like Paul Schrader started taking 20 new filmmakers through this process. Or Hal Hartley, or whoever some of the guys are from my generation who stopped making movies. That, to me, would be the icing on the cake. It\u2019s this wonderful, beautiful hybrid\u2013an economic and educational model\u2013and I would like to see it catch on.\u201d He adds the caveat, however, that it should only catch on as long as it remains viable, and with the speed of change in today\u2019s industry that window might not last long. \u201cIt might not work two years from now, but then you come up with something else.\u201d\nFor the time being, Dutcher\u2019s managed to create a feature film, nearly two dozen film producers who can now grow the indie film industry in Utah and elsewhere, and a model for others to follow in other regional centers. At a time when the unsustainability of filmmaking tops Ted Hope\u2019s list of film career hazards, this potential should not be discounted. If we can see similar mentoring arrangements spring up in San Francisco, New Orleans, Austin, Portland, Toronto, or Minneapolis, this new economic and educational model might just spark a small but important paradigm shift throughout indie film.\nRichard Dutcher: Sharing his Passion and Talents to Help Aspiring Filmmakers\nFilmmaker Richard Dutcher (right) with cinematographer Bill Butler and camera operator Sohrab Mirmontazeri (left) on the set of \"The Boys at the Bar.\"\nMay 2, 2013 - The Entertainment Journal\nFor almost two decades, Richard Dutcher has been the writer, producer and director of some of the most highly-acclaimed independent films in the industry. He\u2019s learned the ins and outs of what it takes to get a product completed and into the marketplace. Starting with \u201cGod\u2019s Army,\u201d and continuing with films like \u201cBrigham City,\u201d \u201cStates of Grace,\u201d \u201cFalling\u201d and \u201cEvil Angel,\u201d Dutcher has raised the bar and set the standard for independent films he\u2019s taken from start to finish.\nHis latest project is, in many ways, his most aggressive yet. It\u2019s also potentially a game-changer for him, and many of the crew members who worked on it as a labor of love last summer. With \u201cThe Boys at the Bar,\u201d he created an opportunity for 23 aspiring producers to learn every aspect of the filmmaking process. It was a dream and a goal of his for several years.\n\u201cI was just really examining the way that independent filmmaking has changed so rapidly over the past five years,\u201d Dutcher says. \u201cMy films were starting to get bigger and more expensive, but then the economics just dropped out of independent film.\u201d\nIt led him to thinking about making his next film on a shoestring budget, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a filmmaker and that\u2019s always been my attitude. Filmmakers make films; with whatever you\u2019ve got, you do whatever you can.\u201d\nDutcher wrote the screenplay for \u201cThe Boys at the Bar,\u201d set in St. Louis but filmed \u201cafter hours\u201d at the Poundcakes restaurant in Salt Lake City\u2019s Trolley Square. The film follows a group of friends as they joke, drink and celebrate the birthday of one of their own at their local Irish pub. Then he came up with how to make it\u2014he founded his own guerilla film school where aspiring producers could work completely hands-on through the whole process. He just needed to find those \u201cguerillas.\u201d\n\u201cSo I just put the word out on Facebook,\u201d Dutcher says. \u201cAnd I always said that if I could find 20 students that were willing to do it, then I would do it. I really didn't think I would. So I was surprised when, at the end, I had 23 people that wanted to do it. We just organized and started the journey.\u201d\nA few weeks later, in November 2011, they met for the first time in a law office in Salt Lake City. They called themselves Project 23. Their goal was to raise $150,000 for initial production costs, a goal they met in less than 90 days. Dutcher immersed them in every facet of the process\u2014key crew positions on set, creation of a plan for marketing and distribution, and particularly the fundraising.\n\u201cI told them that if you want to be a producer, you have to learn to raise money.\u201d\nHis reputation within the industry helped land legendary cinematographer Bill Butler to the digital production (Dutcher\u2019s first digital effort). Butler\u2019s credits include \u201cOne Flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d \u201cJaws,\u201d \u201cGrease\u201d and \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d Veteran actor Bo Hopkins came on board for one of the lead roles, as did actress Scarlett Keegan. Other veteran crew and cast members added their expertise and guided the student crew as the film began shooting right on schedule, in May of 2012. The film is set in one location, was shot in the course of a single week and includes a full 25 minutes of improvised material.\n\u201cBy the end of filming,\u201d Dutcher says with pride, \u201cthese students were no longer students\u2014they were film producers.\u201d\nThere remains one last challenge, however, before \u201cThe Boys at the Bar\u201d can go to market. And it\u2019s another example of Dutcher\u2019s passion for his craft in general, and this film in particular. He has begun a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign with a goal of raising $30,000 to complete the movie.\n\u201cIt needs color correcting, sound editing and mixing; a score, music rights to purchase, a key special effects shot to be created, and graphics work,\u201d he says. \u201cCandidly, we need more than $30,000, but that\u2019s the goal I\u2019ve set to raise to finish the film.\u201d He has to raise the money by May 19, or none of what has been pledged towards that goal will be realized.\nOn April 28, Dutcher started a 21-day fast (running through the Kickstarter deadline date), where he will consume water-only until the goal is met. He has no illusions that the heavens will open up and pour money down for the project due to his fast. \u201cMy only reasons for the fast are to draw attention to this project, and to help me focus completely on the fundraising efforts,\u201d he says.\u201d\nAs far as Project 23 is concerned, it's an unqualified success in his mind.\n\u201cThose that [stuck with the class] learned how to make an independent film and did make an independent film,\u201d he says. While Dutcher is proud of the film and proud of his students' educations, he also hopes that Project 23 won't stop here.\n\u201cWhat I would be incredibly pleased to see, if this story got out there, is someone like Paul Schrader taking 20 new filmmakers through this process. Or Hal Hartley, or whoever some of the guys are from my generation who stopped making movies. That, to me, would be the icing on the cake. It's this wonderful, beautiful hybrid--an economic and educational model, and I would like to see catch on.\u201d\nTo contribute to Dutcher\u2019s efforts, visit the Kickstarter website and make a pledge by May 19.

MEANS\nTHE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE\nPUBLISHED: MAY 9, 2013 \nCourtesy of Audrey Rock. Filmmaker Richard Dutcher, photographed relaxing in front of his Utah County home on May 4, Day 6 of a three-week water-only fast.\nRichard Dutcher is taking the whole \u201cstarving artist\u201d idea to a new level.\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry as hell,\u201d the Provo-based filmmaker said Wednesday, during the 10th day of a planned three-week \u201chunger strike\u201d he launched to focus on \u2014 and rally people behind \u2014 his campaign to raise finishing funds for his latest movie.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no fun,\u201d said Dutcher, 48. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend you ever do this.\u201d\nSince ceremonially eating two orange sections on April 28, Dutcher has consumed nothing but water. He has dropped 19 pounds and lost 2 inches off his belly. He has chronicled his fast in daily dispatches on YouTube.\nAfter 10 days without food, Dutcher said, \u201csometimes you feel surprisingly well and energetic. And other times you feel like lying down and dying.\u201d\nDutcher\u2019s girlfriend, Audrey Rock, was skeptical at first. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think he was going to do it,\u201d said the writer and former movie critic. \u201cBut I had no objections. I said, \u2018I\u2019m right behind you. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t get frightening to me until he started to get sick,\u201d she said.\nThat was on Day 8, Monday, when Dutcher started vomiting. Rock tended to Dutcher, putting wet cloths on his forehead and helping him rest.\n\u201cMy life right now is revolving around this fast,\u201d Rock said.\nDutcher went on a fast 13 years ago before filming his breakout film, the Mormon missionary drama \u201cGod\u2019s Army.\u201d He did it then, in part, because the character he played in the film, an older LDS missionary with a terminal illness, needed to be thinner.\nThe previous experience \u201cinspired me to think that if I can do it for eight days, maybe I can do it for longer,\u201d Dutcher said.\nThe current fast, he said, has a different goal: Get pledges for $30,000 on the Internet fundraising site Kickstarter by May 19. The money would go to finish post-production on Dutcher\u2019s film \u201cThe Boys at the Bar,\u201d a comedy about St. Louis friends gathering at their favorite Irish bar. As of Wednesday, 176 backers have signed on to give $13,373.\n\u201cI thought [the fast] would be a really interesting way to focus everything on this one effort,\u201d Dutcher said. \u201cAlso, if the rest of the producing team saw what I was doing, it would inspire them to work harder.\u201d\nThe producers are a group Dutcher formed called Project 23, which began as a class he taught for fledgling filmmakers. He turned the class into a hands-on experience, running the students through the process of financing and shooting his script.\nThe movie was shot last year at a bar in Trolley Square, after hours, and has been edited. It still requires finishing touches \u2014 including color correction, sound mixing, a musical score, one special-effects shot and marketing \u2014 on which the $30,000 from Kickstarter would be spent.\nMounting a Kickstarter campaign \u201creally is work,\u201d Dutcher said. \u201cPeople have this assumption that people come and just give money.\u201d\nInstead, Dutcher and Rock have worked their contacts, via social media and elsewhere, hitting people up to donate.\n\u201cYou have to personally appeal to each of those people,\u201d Dutcher said.\nKickstarter has generated controversy in recent weeks as some big Hollywood names \u2014 people who usually get funded through traditional channels \u2014 have used the site to drum up pledges and publicity.\nThe creators of the defunct TV series \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d last month raised $5.7 million toward a movie version of the show. And two weeks ago, actor and filmmaker Zach Braff, who starred on TV\u2019s \u201cScrubs\u201d and directed himself in 2004 Sundance Film Festival hit \u201cGarden State,\u201d launched a campaign for his next movie, \u201cWish I Was Here,\u201d which has raised $2.4 million so far.\nBraff\u2019s campaign, in particular, has drawn critics on the Internet, who have accused the actor of subverting Kickstarter\u2019s original purpose.\n\u201cKickstarter allows filmmakers who otherwise would have NO access to Hollywood and NO access to serious investors to scrounge up enough money to make their movies,\u201d TV writer Ken Levine (whose credits include episodes of \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d) wrote on his blog. \u201cZach Braff has contacts.

Means | The Salt Lake Tribune\n\nThe Provo filmmaker on Sunday called off his planned three-week fast, more than a week early. He began on April 28 to focus his energies on raising money to finish his latest movie.\nDutcher, in a post Sunday afternoon on Facebook, explained that he gave up the fast \"due to almost losing consciousness on a couple of occasions, vomiting 7 times a day, and starting to see blood in the vomit.\"\nWhat Dutcher called a \"hunger strike\" drew attention to a fund-raising campaign on the website Kickstarter, aimed at raising $30,000 in finishing funds for \"The Boys at the Bar.\" The movie, a bar comedy Dutcher wrote and directed, was shot last year at Trolley Square \u2013 but still requires a music score and other post-production touches.\nAs of Sunday, the Kickstarter campaign has raised $16,277 \u2013 with nearly $3,000 of that pledged since an article about Dutcher\u2019s fast appeared Thursday on The Salt Lake Tribune\u2019s website. The campaign ends May 19.\nDutcher said he started vomiting last Monday, Day 8. On Wednesday, Day 10, Dutcher told The Tribune that \"sometimes you feel surprisingly well and energetic.

Eventually incorporating as a nonprofit, the newly branded Austin Film Society raised enough money to fly in their first out-of-town invitee: Milwaukee native James Benning, visionary filmmaker, who was then based in New York.\nAccepting the invitation, Benning met Linklater and immediately the two began to develop a personal and intellectual bond, leading to future screenings and encounters. Starting in the late \u201960s, Benning had been creating structural non-narrative films largely on his own, while Linklater had just begun to craft his first 8 and 16mm shorts. The filmmakers have remained close even as their careers have wildly diverged. After the cult success of Slacker (1991), Linklater went on to make big budget narrative films with Hollywood support. Benning, meanwhile, has stayed close to his modest roots and is mainly an unknown figure in mainstream film culture.\nWorking with legendary producer Andre\u0301 S. Labarthe \u2014 who co-created the long-running French television series \u201cCin\u00e9ma, de notre temps\u201d (\u201cCinema of Our Time\u201d) \u2014 the critic, teacher, and curator Gabe Klinger set out to document the unique friendship of Benning and Linklater over the course of a few days in Austin and Bastrop, Texas, while the two filmmakers presented Benning\u2019s films at the Austin Film Society, played baseball at Linklater\u2019s home, visited old shooting locations, and talked about their respective filmmaking trajectories over long meals and hikes.\nWHY BENNING AND LINKLATER?\nBoth filmmakers embody historical and contemporary notions of America, its follies and its splendors. Beyond surface differences, Benning and Linklater are similar in that their films demonstrate formal and thematic preoccupations with duration, the reconstruction of time and memory, mathematical structures, cinematic traditions, and the representation of history past and present, especially those of marginalized and under-represented peoples. Using American landscapes, cultural artifacts (music, artworks, etc.), and human figures, they are often working towards analogous ends. This is a thesis our film explores.\nBIOGRAPHIES\nJames Benning: \"I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during World War II. I played baseball for the first 20 years of my life receiving a degree in mathematics while playing on a baseball scholarship. I dropped out of graduate school to deny my military deferment (my friends were dying in Viet Nam) and worked with migrant workers in Colorado teaching their children how to read and write. Later I helped start a commodities food program that fed the poor in the Missouri Ozarks. At the age of 33 I received an MFA from the University of Wisconsin. For the next four years I taught filmmaking at Northwestern University, University of Wisconsin, University of Oklahoma and the University of California San Diego. In 1980 I moved to lower Manhattan making films with the aid of grant and German Television money. After eight years in New York I moved to Val Verde, California, where I currently reside teaching film/video at California Institute of the Arts.\" - JB\nRichard Linklater: \"Born in Houston, Texas, he attended Huntsville High School and studied at Sam Houston State University, leaving midway through his stint in college to work on an off-shore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. While working on the rig he read a good many books, but on land he developed a love of film through repeated visits to a repertory theater in Houston. Linklater, using the money he had saved from the oil rig job, bought a Super-8 camera, a projector, and some editing equipment, and moved to Austin. It was there that the aspiring cineaste founded the Austin Film Society. From his commercial debut with Slacker, his diverse filmography includes the sci-fi noir A Scanner Darkly, the socially conscious Fast Food Nation, the kid-friendly School of Rock, the teen ensemble Dazed and Confused, the dark comedy Bernie, and the romance trilogy Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight, among many other films.\"\nWHAT IS \"CIN\u00c9MA, DE NOTRE TEMPS\"?\nIn 1964, film critic and filmmaker Andre\u0301 S. Labarthe, together with Janine Bazin, widow of influential film theorist Andre\u0301 Bazin, approached the French television channel ORTF about starting a program that would resemble the long, in-depth interviews with film directors that magazines such as Cahiers du cine\u0301ma and Positif regularly published. ORTF gave the green light, and \"Cine\u0301astes, de notre temps\" (\"Filmmakers of Our Time\") was born. Many of the programs were dedicated to older directors, who were then in retirement or in the final stages of their careers. Labarthe and Bazin would often ask well-known film directors, rather than television journalists, to make these programs: thus, Jacques Rivette on Jean Renoir, or Jacques Rozier on Jean Vigo. \n\"Cine\u0301astes, de notre temps\" lasted until 1971, when ORTF decided to terminate production. Over the following years, the series became almost legendary, as occasionally clips from the programs started to appear in other films. In 1988, ARTE, the French-German cultural channel, decided to reprise the series, now under the title \"Cine\u0301ma, de notre temps.\" The focus shifted to contemporary filmmakers, and generally speaking directors were now more free to choose their own approaches. The films made for both series together form an invaluable and intimate history of the medium, full of insights into the work of individual filmmakers as well as a sense of the shifts in taste and ideas about cinema.\nThough Janine Bazine has passed away, the series continues under Labarthe's leadership.\nCURRENT PROJECT STATUS\nWe wrapped production on April 10 and have begun post-production (editing, color correction, sound mixing, etc.)\nOUR FILM TEAM\nDirector: Gabe Klinger / Producers: Andr\u00e9 S.

But most of all, we need to look ahead to our post-production expenses, such as editing, sound mix and color correction. These are highly specialized services, and the labor fees add up. The eventual sale of the film to French TV will cover a portion of our production cost, but not all of it. This is why we've opted to start this campaign.\nRemember: Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising platform. There's no limit to the amount our project can receive, but if the \"goal\" amount is not met, our project receives ZERO funds.\nSOME GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS (feel free to disregard if you've contributed to a Kickstarter before!)\n1) Watch the above video;\n2) take a look at our pledge levels and choose the one that best matches your desire to contribute;\n3) follow the steps through Amazon to process your payment.\n(Cards will not be charged until the campaign ends and not at all if the project doesn't meet its goal.)\nWHEN WILL THE FINISHED FILM BE SHOWN?\nWe're optimistic that it will be ready to premiere at film festivals by late summer/early fall (2013).\nJames Benning's childhood baseball glove (photo courtesy of JB)\nFacebook / Twitter / Mubi / IMDb", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell, we're halfway there, since the film has already been shot, but anyone involved in film production knows that post-production can take a long time and present lots of problems.

Digital not as in DVD, but as in large drives with encrypted code and brilliant resolution. It\u2019s the new way people are watching motion pictures throughout the world, and its official name is Digital Cinema Package (usually known by its acronym, DCP).\n\nIt\u2019s a big change: the 35mm width was first used in 1892 by William Dickson and Thomas Edison using film stock made by George Eastman. Over more than 120 years, the format conquered the world; for a century Japanese, Indian, Australian, Russian and American films were all finished on 35mm. But times are changing; film distributors, studios and the makers of film stock are rapidly discontinuing exhibition on film. DCP has become the new standard by which films are shown. By 2014, DCP will be the all-but universal standard for films screened in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s the most momentous technological change since the advent of sound in 1928. Change is coming quickly, and the message from the industry is clear: \u201cSwitch now or be left behind.\u201d Within a year, 85% of the films we show must be screened on the DCP format.\n\nNorthwest Film Forum needs your help to make this change, keeping our screens bright and our doors open!\nWelcome to Northwest Film Forum!\n\nWho We Are\nNorthwest Film Forum is truly a forum, where films can find audiences and filmgoers can meet filmmakers. Our mission is to discover and champion the work of great filmmakers, and to engage the general public and artists alike in deeper exploration of the art of film.  We screen more than 200 independently made and classic films every year, offer dozens of filmmaking classes (including summer camps for young people), and support filmmakers at all stages of their careers.\nOur smart, passionate audience members come from all walks of life to connect with our cinema programs.\nOur cinemas are lively, dynamic spaces that welcome more than 24,000 filmgoers every year to watch new, strange and beautiful films from every corner of the world. We show the best in American and international independent films, cinema classics, live musical scores and new performances that intersect with film. We host dozens of filmmakers each year from around the country and around the world. Panels, guest lectures and discussions add to the unique experience of our theaters. We serve independent artists and other local arts organizations by offering space for auditions, rehearsals and events. We work, for example, with the Seattle Lesbian & Gay Film Festival and the Deaf Spotlight Film Festival. We are a place for connection and for conversation about why cinema matters.\nOur members attend exclusive parties and screenings with giants of indie cinema.\nVisiting artists and instructors teach aspiring filmmakers at the Film Forum.\nThe youngest filmgoers and filmmakers enjoy the art of movies at our venue on Capitol Hill in Seattle.\n\nWhat we need\nWe're preparing to purchase the technology to convert to Digital Cinema, the new projection system that is sweeping the world. That\u2019s $50,000 for one theater, and that buys us:\n   \n\u2022    A Barco Integrated DLP Cinema projector (aka DP2K-10Sx)\n\u2022    A Server for storage and playback, a high-grade cinema lens, a spare xenon lamp. This unit is specifically designed for art house theaters our size.\n\u2022    A Universal projector pedestal, with a modular system that will allow us, on occasion, to still project 35mm films.\n\u2022    Ventilation and lamphouse cooling system in the projection booth.\n\u2022    A new port window cut into our projection booth to match DCP specifications.\n\u2022    Shipping, installation, and new cables.\n \nYou have questions? We have answers.\nOur amazing volunteers are the backbone of the organization.\nWhy has the cinematic world converted to DCP?\nConversion to a \u2018new\u2019 format is fueled by shifts in technology \u2013 your phone is probably a decent video camera, right? \u2013 and because making and shipping the new digital prints saves millions. The cost of replacing projection machines in cinemas, on the other hand, falls on individual theaters and exhibitors.\n\nWhat will happen if we don\u2019t add Digital Cinema at the Film Forum?\nAfter 2013, 85% of the films we currently screen will need to be shown on DCP, because Digital Cinema will be the only available format film distributors will offer. (We know, it\u2019s weird, given that there are perfectly beautiful prints of Pather Panchali out there, but those are the rules.) If we don't have the new technology in place we won\u2019t be able to show films.\n\nWhat is the time frame? Can\u2019t we wait for a few more years and see what happens?\nPutting off this challenge isn\u2019t an option; we have until the end of this year to make the transition before our access to most films is cut off.\n\nDon't we already own digital projectors?\nYes, but ours aren\u2019t built to decode, or accept, DCP, which is \u201cproprietary\u201d and plays only on approved gear. Bonus: the new system will project brighter film images than we have previously shown digitally (and our digital images have been pretty sharp).\n\nHow does Digital Cinema look?\nThe picture on the big screen is crisp and bold. Digital Cinema is a step forward into the future of visual presentation for new films (mainstream and independent alike). Plus, many older classic films are gaining new life after being digitally restored. Film purists will grieve the fading of 35mm, but this new system will feel sharp, and the visual and aesthetic experience will be potent.\n\nCan we just lease the equipment?\nThe \u201cleasing\u201d option available is \u201cfinancing\u201d by another name. We have explored distributors' plans to \"help\" theaters with the transition financially, but that option comes with strings, including mandates about what we will and won't screen. We care about the independence of organizations like ours that screen a huge diversity of new work and classic films, and have rejected this option.\n\nWhat happens to our current 35mm projectors?\nThey aren\u2019t going anywhere. Each year, a few new film prints will be made. Those very few prints will not be a reliable source for the movies we need to show to survive; however, we will hold onto our excellent 35mm film projectors and use them for special revivals. We\u2019ll show archival prints and classic movies on 35mm film.\n\nWant to learn more about our long-term plans?\nWe hope you'll join our community of film lovers and filmmakers.\nConversion to a Digital Cinema Package in our cinemas is part of an over-arching three-year renovation plan to upgrade our venue and our capacity in Seattle. Already King County\u2019s 4Culture as well as the Seattle Mayor's Office of Arts & Cultural Affairs and over 100 individual supporters have seen the value of this project and made generous donations for physical renovations to our lobby and our theaters.\n\nThe upgrade of our cinemas and lobby will complete work that was begun in 2004, when we moved into the current theater. We want to provide filmgoers and filmmakers alike with an inviting, state-of-the-art experience. Along with installing DCP, over the next three years we plan to:\n\n\u2022    Replace our street-level canopy with a marquee; install screens in our street-facing windows to showcase coming attractions and films we helped bring into the world.\n\u2022    Renovate our lobby: finish out our concessions stand, introduce a point-of-sale ticketing system, add seating, re-paint the walls.\n\u2022    Upgrade our four classrooms into state-of-the-art places to learn; they will be out-rigged with new wiring, screens and projectors, seminar tables, screens, carpets, white boards.\nHuge thanks to our team of volunteers and supporters who've helped make this Kickstarter campaign possible, including Amy Billharz, Bmann Photography, Elisa Huerta-Enochian, Charles Mudede, Pat Paquette, Nandan Rao, Jennifer Roth, Margaret Schuler, Lynn Shelton, Marcy Stone, Jessie Wilson and many more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks and challenges surrounding the digital transition are minimal, as we have done extensive research on equipment manufacturers and integrators, and what will work best for our space.

This would create a fun, inviting experience, connecting children and adults alike to the productivity potent in themselves, in agriculture, and in loom-craft.\nI dedicated myself to birthing this vision.\nI went ahead and built the tractorloom, engaging the participation of local metal workers, machinists, and farmers, and in doing so deepened my appreciation for the nature of natural materials, as well as the alchemical pro-creative power of human ingenuity and craftmanship. The character name, Womb-Furie, which came to me for personal reasons on that fated day 11 years ago, became ever more poignant to the project. The very fabrication of the tractorloom has awakened people's connection with 'common' materials as we transformed rickety metal parts into vibrant, safe, fascinating, and empowering interactive learning tools.\nOnce the tractorloom was built with the grant money I gratefully received from the Arts Council of the Southern Finger Lakes, I was itching to take this to the people!\nFriends of the Peaceweavers, www.peaceweavers.com, and members of their Organic Farm and CSA, learning how to weave on the tractorloom!\nThroughout 2012, I transported the tractorloom to farmer's markets and festivals around Upstate New York, teaching people how to weave. It has been all too fun and enriching to watch dozens of people come up and engage with the tractorloom! People grow smiles, grow trust in their creative capacities, and grow deeper connections to the agricultural events and markets that they came out to that day.\nKids really get into the dynamics of weaving! It requires some coordination!\nMy dream is to take the tractorloom beyond the Finger Lakes and share this conceptual vehicle with as many people as possible! I plan to visit elementary and secondary schools, universitites with fiber programs, farmer's markets and other public spaces around the U.S. and Canada during a two month tour on the road - and I need your support to make this a reality!\nI will offer a whirl on the tractorloom as a tool to invite dialogue about the history of fabric, the importance of nutrition, and our connection to the land, as well as the need to embrace alternative energies in order to learn how to sustainably power our lives through wind, solar, and grease. Through the money raised via Kickstarter, I will be able to integrate these alternative energy systems into the tractorloom's mechanics and transportability. Help me demonstrate as many healthy tools, techniques, and systems within this tour as possible!\nIt is vital that the tractorloom reaches students now! Youth need to be actively involved and engaged in their own education. The need for more hands-on learning experiences, like the kind the tractorloom can provide, is imperative for creating a healthy life and connection to source materials and ideas. When the tractorloom visits, students will learn to weave, see how the loom works, and, most importantly, gain a sense of the link between their own clothes and the ancient art of weaving. We will also discuss the history behind weaving as well as farming and how the two are connected! Ultimately, I believe that it is extremely important for students to be exposed to all that the tractorloom demonstrates because it makes history and culture alive and active for students.\nWith a loom, you can make blankets, scarves, and fabric for garments.\nIt is truly awesome to witness the young and shy kids who hop onto the tractorloom transform. I see their initial hesitancy to participate, but after they hop up on the shiny red tractor, and have woven enough fabric to see the pattern they have created, their faces light up! Afterwards, they jump down smiling and appear more sure of themselves. Watching people willing to get out of their comfort zones and learn something new is helpful for all the spectators that happen to be at the events, myself included.\nAs of right now, this is the list of what I have and what I will need in order to make this tractorloom tour a great success!\nWhat I have:\na tractorloom\nknowledge about how to set up a loom and teach weaving to all ages\nWhat I need:\na diesel truck\na trailer that is bigger than 6' X 7' X 9'\nveggie diesel conversion kit\ndiesel fuel\nyarn\nliving expenses for a two month tour\nsolar panel to charge tractorloom's battery\nvehicle insurance\nperformance insurance\nDonations are also greatly appreciated! If you have extra yarn and would like to have it become part of the tractorloom project, It would be an excellent addition to the fabrics that will be woven!\nThe History:\nWhen the idea of the tractorloom came to me, I knew I needed to make an animated prototype. I decided to make a puppet animated version and have my womb-furie girl weaving on the tractorloom. This is the image that you will see on one of the many rewards you'll receive upon supporting this endeavor!\n16mm puppet animated prototype of the womb-furie girl weaving on the tractorloom!\nWhen I moved to rural Upstate New York, numerous tractor sitings rekindled my dreams of bringing the tractorloom into existence. I decided to apply for a grant from the Arts Council of the Southern Finger Lakes and was awarded funding to build the tractorloom!\nSerendipitously, I met a metal sculptor named Benji Carr, check out his website! www.isfmetal.com, who had the mechanical and artistic knowledge to build the tractorloom!\nBenji Carr fabricating a bearing for a tractorloom wheel on his lathe.\nBenji weaving on the tractorloom in its neonate stage.\nA local business preparing metal pieces of tractorloom to be powder coated.\nRear view of tractorloom after powder coating.\nThanks to all who have watched the video and read about the project! I hope to see you in the fall!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThese are my goals for the tractorloom tour of 2013:\n\n To purchase a used diesel truck and have a local business install a veggie diesel conversion kit. However, If I am unable to find a diesel truck that is compatible with the conversion kits they have available, I will purchase a gas truck and continue the tour fueling the vehicle with the money I allocated for the conversion kit.\n\n I am determined to reach as many students and people around the U.S.and Canada as possible within the two months of touring. I want to inspire people to experience the value of the hand crafted while learning how to weave on the loom.\n\n I also hope that people may feel a sense of attachment to the land while sitting on top of the tractorloom since it will be outside and signifies a tractor which is usually used to prepare soil for growing vegetables. \n\n By choosing to use alternative energy sources, I can also talk about the importance of being independent from gas and oiI. I can show people how easy it is to harness the sun and used grease to make the tractorloom and truck move.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "kylie baker\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nKylie Baker lives on a mountain in the Southern Finger Lakes District of Upstate New York where the waterfalls roam and the frogs peep.

Vans were everywhere back then. They became affordable rolling rooms filled with shag carpet, bubble windows, moon roofs, wet bars, and full size beds. The customized van was representative of a parent's worst nightmare and a young person's dream. But, just as fast as they rose in popularity, they faded; leaving a pronounced echo on American culture. So what was and is vannin\u2019 all about? In July of 2012, we set out to answer that question. \nOur film is comprised of footage taken over the course of 6 days at the country\u2019s largest van show and party, the 40th National Truck-In (known as the Van Nationals). We lived out of our own vans and filmed the many colorful characters that inhabit the world of Vannin'. In the process, we learned about the history, the parties, the vans and, ultimately, the family that vanning has become. www.vanninmovie.com www.facebook.com/vanninmovie\nWhy Kickstarter?

Just as we think our society is becoming more tolerant and inclusive, our hopes are dashed as we hear about another young gay person, drowning in shame and despair, taking their own life. Nowhere is this shame and despair more acute than among LGBT youth raised in religious homes. Repeatedly told directly and subliminally that God hates them, that they can change the very person that they are, that they are sinners, many see no escape other than death.\nFacing East tells the story of a family dealing with this exact tragedy, and through their journey of discovery we see hope for ourselves, our families, our community, our world. \nFacing East began as a stage play, by Carol Lynn Pearson, which premiered in Salt Lake City, later travelled to New York and San Francisco, and has since been performed at theater companies across the country. Facing East was honored by the Association for Mormon Letters as the best Mormon-themed play of 2007 \u201cfor its compassion, its even-handed wisdom and its tragic power.\u201d\n\"Some theater is good drama. Some drama is important theater. Facing East is both.\" -- nytheater.com\n\"This compact, emotional epic doesn't bear even the slightest trace of exploitation: only truth, simply and beautifully told.\" -- talkingbroadway.com\nWe are all so close to this issue. We've all been tormented as we've watched good people struggle and families torn apart. We've all seen how gay children (or husbands, wives, fathers, mothers) from religious families struggle along a trail that has few reliable markers. The unique thing about the story of Facing East, is that it provides those markers, without condemning or degrading. Though about religious people, it is not a religious film, and has found support from both the LDS as well as LGBT community. Facing East has the potential to be a bridge between two very different communities.\nFacing East is directed by Tony nominated Broadway actor (Hair, Priscilla: Queen of the Desert), and independent film director (Sons of Provo) Will Swenson. Will's personal biography as a Utah raised former Mormon and effective gay rights activist make him the perfect voice for this delicate subject. Will and his wife, Audra McDonald, were recently honored by PFLAG for their efforts to promote marriage equality with the 2012 Straight for Equality in Entertainment Award.\nGuinevere Turner (Go Fish, American Psycho, The Notorious Bettie Page), one of the most prominent voices in LGBT cinema, has adapted Carol Lynn's stage play into a wonderful screenplay.\nWith this extraordinary team in place, we are now prepared to shoot Facing East in late 2013. While most of our funding is in place through equity investment, it will not be available until our preproduction period in Fall 2013. We need a bit extra to bring us to that point, so we are turning to you. The amount we are raising now is to fund some script rewrites, continue casting, pay for some legal and accounting necessities, and prep for production.\nAre you excited by character driven, independent cinema? Do you long for a day when no one will feel that suicide is their only escape? Please support this amazing, important project.\nFor a more lengthy story synopsis please see Frequently Asked Questions, at the bottom of the page.\nKickstarter is an online fundraising platform that allows creators like us to make cool projects through direct support from everyday people like you. However, Kickstarter is an all or nothing proposition. If we don't hit the fundraising goal by our deadline, your credit card will not be charged, and we will not get any money at all. Please don't let that happen!\nJoin us in making Facing East a reality by contributing before it's too late!

In fact, we do have some \"Name\" actors unofficially attached and are working our schedules around theirs. Sadly, we can't post publicly who they are, but ask us in private and we'll tell you more. The one thing we CAN tell you about is that Broadway superstar Audra McDonald will appear in a supporting role.\nYou show us so much love by supporting us, we can't help but return the favor. We've worked hard to find truly unique and satisfying rewards for your generosity. Here are a few example, but be sure to check the side bar for the full list.\nRewards are delivered at different times. Most rewards will be sent in early 2013, but copies of the finished film or poster, for example, will not be available until 2014.\nWill Swenson (director): As a Tony nominated actor, award winning independent film director, former Mormon pop culture icon and dedicated equal rights activist, Will is uniquely qualified to bring this powerful story to the screen. He understands both worlds represented in the film, and the diverse audience that will benefit from its production. \nWill grew up in a Utah Mormon theater family and his first brush with stardom came as the lead in the surprisingly popular Mormon themed film The Singles Ward which grossed $1.25 million from a very limited audience. In 2005, Will wrote, directed and starred in the award-winning feature satire Sons of Provo. After achieving stardom in the bizarre world of Mormon film he left for Broadway, leaving his affiliation with the LDS faith behind. He is best known on stage for his Tony nominated role of Burger in the revival of Hair, and as Tick/Mitzy in the recent Pricilla Queen of the Desert. Other Broadway and off-Broadway credits include Rock of Ages (originating the role of Stacee Jaxx), Camelot, Slugbearersof Kayrol Island, 110 in the Shade, Lestat, Brooklyn, Miss Saigon, Adrift in Macao, Two Gentlemen of Verona, Kept, and Once Upon a Time in New Jersey. Television and film acting credits include the forthcoming Gods Behaving Badly, The Good Wife, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Six Degrees, All My Children, Guiding Light and As the World Turns.\nFor the past several years Will has been active in the fight for marriage equality and gay rights. He and his wife, Audra McDonald, were recently honored by PFLAG with their annual Straight for Equality in Entertainment award.\nGuinevere Turner (screenwriter): Guinevere is a writer, director and actor who has worked in film and TV since her 1994 debut film and Sundance Film Festival hit Go Fish.  Go Fish was among the first films to treat a lesbian romance in a positive light, and one of the first films about lesbians to have a high profile sale at Sundance and to receive a significant theatrical release. She went on to act in several films, including The Watermelon Woman, Chasing Amy, and Treasure Island.  Eventually she teamed up with Mary Harron to write the cult classic American Psycho starring Christian Bale in the role that launched his career. Turner and Harron later reteamed to make The Notorious Bettie Page, a biopic about the celebrated pinup girl and the world that surrounded her, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.  She was a staff writer and story editor on Showtime\u2019s award winning lesbian themed seriesThe L Word, and she played a recurring character on that show.   She has written and directed five short films, two of which showed at Sundance. She is the head mentor at LA\u2019s long-running gay and lesbian film festival Outfest\u2019s Screenwriting Fellowship.\nCarol Lynn Pearson (playwright/screenwriter): A professional writer for decades, Pearson\u2019s autobiography, Goodbye, I Love You, tells the story of her marriage to a homosexual man, their divorce, ongoing friendship, and her caring for him as he died of AIDS. Featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning, America and in People Magazine, she has become an icon to many thousands of gay people and their families for her powerful work to end the tragic collision between religion and homosexuality - causing Rabbi Harold Kushner (author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People) to say,\u201cThank you, Carol Lynn Pearson, for reminding us that the task of any religion is to teach us whom we\u2019re required to love, not whom we\u2019re entitled to hate.\u201d Pearson\u2019s one woman play Mother Wove the Morning earned an award from \u201cBooklist\u201d as \u201cone of the top 25 videos of the year\u201d and two of her children\u2019s plays were commissioned by Robert Redford\u2019s Sundance Summer Theatre. Her many award-winning books have had a combined sale of over 800,000 and many of her poems have been widely reprinted in such places as the Ann Landers column, Chicken Soup for the Soul, as well as several college literary textbooks.\nJason Kennedy (casting director): Jason currently casts, alongside Susan Bluestein, the popular CBS series NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles.  For more than 10 years, Jason has worked on a wide variety of projects, ranging from drama and comedy series and pilots to features and miniseries.  Some previous projects include BBC & HBO's Emmy winning House of Saddam, SyFy's drama The Dresden Files, CW & WB's Reba, Dawson\u2019s Creek, Living With Fran and Run of the House, plus feature films that include Cursed, PU-239, A Little Thing Called Murder and Elizabethtown.\nDuane Andersen (producer): Duane produced Dave Boyle\u2019s award winning films Daylight Savings and Surrogate Valentine, which premiered at SXSW Film Festival in 2011 and 2012. He and Boyle previously collaborated on festival favorites White on Rice and Big Dreams Little Tokyo.

You helped us pass our goal. We are extremely excited and grateful. For this last week, everything you contribute just enables us to do even more - more music, more videos, more shows. We've already started working to fulfill your rewards, and we made this video so you can get a sneak peak of a song from the album. THANK YOU. Thank you for contributing and sharing this project. We'll do our best to make you proud. \nWelcome! We\u2019re glad you are here.\nWe are Mideau (\"Mid-oh\"), we make music. There are two of us \u2013 Libbie Linton and Spencer Harrison. We have done separate projects in the past, but have been working together on our debut full-length album for a while, and we couldn\u2019t be any more excited about it how it sounds so far.\nWe invite you to get involved and be a part of this process with us. And, to thank you for your support, we have a set of rewards to suit all levels. You can get a copy of the album before anyone else, go to lunch with us, get a haircut with Spencer (see video), pick a cover song for us to record, get on our guest list for life, or have us play a show for you. We\u2019ll even help you write that song you've been meaning to finish. \nWe are making the album that we\u2019ve always wanted to make. As a result, we aren\u2019t cutting any corners and it's turning out better than we could have expected. It's certainly not done yet, but we just know you'll love it. We have been lucky to work on this project with ridiculously talented people. To get to where we are, we have happily invested thousands of our own dollars. The money that we raise will be used only to finish and promote the album, including mixing and mastering of the songs, production of the physical albums, creating music videos to accompany the songs, and marketing. Your support means everything. \nFor those of you who aren't familiar, Kickstarter is an ALL-OR-NOTHING system. Our goal is to raise at least $10,000 in 45 days. If we get $9,999.99, we get nothing and you keep your money. \nWe can\u2019t do this without you. So please, dear listener, don\u2019t keep this project a secret. Shout it from the rooftops!\nAnd, lastly, know that we love you back.\nHere is another tiny sneak of a song to tide you over til we finish the songs.

We decided from the very start that we wouldn\u2019t take shortcuts, which means that when it comes down to it - we will always choose to take more time to get things right than to take the easier route. \n\nWith any project, there are things that can come up to derail progress for a time. Mastering may be slower than expected, the packaging may be delayed - but these are things that can be handled. One strength we have is that we recognized going into this project the importance of getting the right people on board to help. We trust the talent of the people that are working with us. Many of you have already dedicated your time and talent to this project, and we are extremely grateful for it. \n\nFor any band, one of the biggest challenges is to reach your audience. Music is everywhere - it\u2019s a daunting task just to get heard. We recognize that it\u2019s going to require a lot of creativity, time, money, and your support. And we absolutely cannot succeed without you. Our hope is that you know how integral you are to this project, and that goes well beyond Kickstarter. It is our pleasure and responsibility to give you art that means something to you, enough that you are inspired to spread it.\n\nWe hope you have enjoyed the little bits songs that you\u2019ve heard thus far. They certainly aren\u2019t done, but we can say that we are extremely excited to soon share a truly completed song with you. And we hope that you can sense our dedication to this project through what we've shared with you so far. We love what we are doing - even when it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a lot of work, frustrating things occur, and it's a big risk. Rest assured, it\u2019s worth it for us.

This is how our film differs from the conventions of the rock music documentary genre. We want you, the film audience, to become our guide along the way and participate on a much more personal level.

We are confident that the material we have gathered so far and the footage we have yet to gather from the road will allow us to create a compelling story about a band on the rise and their adventure across America. We also handle the entire postproduction phase in El Jinete FIlms: DIY is our main principle. By May 2013, we will have a finished product which we will then submit to film festivals. \n\nHowever, although one version of the film will be completed, we also aspire to join the band on a potential international tour during the summer of 2013. With that said, The Last Kamikazis of Heavy Metal, as any other documentary in which the characters' lives unfold before our eyes, is a film which could inspire a much longer-term production process for which we will seek funding in the future. It may even acquire a different title down the road, only time will tell. Nevertheless, an epic rock doc will be completed by May 2013 and the backers who have been promised a copy of the DVD will receive it after the festival run.\n\nA short-term challenge is not being able to make it to every single place recommendation we receive from our backers. As we have a limited time in each city on this tour, as specified, we will have to make a difficult choice when selecting which unique spot to visit.

SOLDIER\nMost of all, thanks in advance for sharing this link to our Kickstarter page with your friends and family, on all of your social networks -- we can't do this without you!\nABOUT THE FILM\nBefore Oprah, before Arsenio, there was Mr. SOUL! \nFrom 1968 to 1973, America got SOUL! -- the first \"black Tonight Show\" -- a groundbreaking PBS television series called SOUL! produced and hosted by Ellis Haizlip. The show was both entertaining and revolutionary, while launching the careers of many of the African American icons of the 20th century, and marking the beginning of diversity in television.\nFor much of America, SOUL! offered the first glimpse of black culture, music, politics and community, as well as first-ever televised performances and appearances by Earth, Wind & Fire, Arsenio Hall, James Baldwin, Nikki Giovanni, Maya Angelou, Al Green, Ashford & Simpson, and more.\nWNET/Channel 13 in New York City - celebrating it's 50th anniversary this year - was the original presenting station of SOUL!, making it a real New York story, one about the arts, culture, and a black, gay, broadcast pioneer who changed the media landscape at the onset of public television. In 1972 and 1973, at the height of the show\u2019s success, Lincoln Center invited Haizlip to produce Soul At The Center, a critically acclaimed, two-year, twelve-day black arts festival at Lincoln Center, which became the first collaborative venture between Lincoln Center and the black community.\nThe film offers a behind-the-scenes look at this revolutionary program, from its initial conception to its final broadcast, including the very public battle to keep it on the air despite a shifting political landscape. The documentary interweaves Ellis Haizlip\u2019s biography into the narrative following the five seasons of SOUL!, interspersing contemporary interviews, archival material, excerpts from the show, and narration by Keith David.\nWHO WAS ELLIS HAIZLIP?\nEllis Haizlip (right) backstage with Stevie Wonder\nBehind-the-scenes at SOUL! with Ellis Haizlip and the MANDRILL Band. Photo courtesy Alex Harsley. Used by permission. All rights reserved.\nWidely recognized as the impresario of black arts and culture, Ellis B. Haizlip (1929-1991) devoted a lifetime of artistic excellence to the communication of black perspectives through stage and television productions. Born in Washington, D.C., Haizlip went to Howard University, and soon after became a theatrical producer who would break boundaries in television, creating opportunity that hadn't existed before for all people of color and women. Haizlip became affectionately known by friends and artists alike as                   \u201cMr. SOUL,\u201d as he continued to promote the world of African American culture and art throughout his lifetime.  \nPAYING IT FORWARD\nThis is the remarkable story of how despite many challenges, one man and one show changed the face of television and paid it forward for all of us. There never would have been a Soul Train without Ellis Haizlip and SOUL!\nWHY DO WE NEED SOUL! NOW?\nSOUL! has been sitting in the vaults for over 40 years.  It's time to bridge the history gap, especially for our youth. The film is an incredible opportunity to revisit and reintroduce this critical moment in broadcast television that's still relevant today, because it created a ripple effect that's still evident in the entertainment world. We're also telling the story of the advent of 20th century black pop music -- pre-Soul Train, pre-Michael, and pre-MTV! It's American history. It's our history. Help us tell this story!\nSNEAK PEEKS OF OUR WORK IN PROGRESS:\nHarry Belafonte on Ellis Haizlip and SOUL!\nASHFORD & SIMPSON ON ELLIS HAIZLIP AND SOUL!\nNickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson share a rare and touching moment, reminiscing about Ellis Haizlip and SOUL! Haizlip was the one who encouraged them to become a duo and sing their own compositions, devoting  several entire \"Club SOUL!\" episodes to their music, thus helping to launch their act. We were very lucky to have been able to sit down with them that night at the Sugar Bar. Sadly, Nickolas Ashford passed away on August 22, 2011 just 4 months after this interview was taped. We were honored by his generosity and kindness.\nWHY ARE WE FUNDRAISING, AND WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\nWe've been researching and working on the film since 2009, and will complete the entire project by the end of next year. We've shot enough interviews to make the fundraising trailer above. The money we raise will allow us to continue shooting our interviews. The funds will go directly toward all the expenses of film production, including paying for camera equipment, travel, and of course our fantastic crew. Since the original SOUL! show was all about community, we want to give everyone the opportunity to be a part of Mr. SOUL!\nWHAT IS KICKSTARTER, AND HOW DOES IT WORK?\nIT'S EASY: YOU MAKE A DONATION AND YOU RECEIVE A REWARD! Kickstarter is the world's largest online funding platform for creative projects, with an \"all-or-nothing\" approach to supporting independently crafted projects in return for rewards.   \nCheck out the column on the right to find a level of giving that works for you and some swag you'd like to receive. We're offering some great rewards, each named after an episode of SOUL! Once the funding window is completed, we will thank you on our website, Facebook and Twitter, and ship all the other goodies by mail.\nHERE'S THE THING: IF WE DON'T MEET OUR GOAL, WE DON'T GET A DIME. (Nope, not even a penny.) That means we won't make any money at all even if we're short by $5.00, and none of the backers' credit cards will be charged. That's why we need your support!\nTHE GOOD NEWS IS, IF WE DO MEET OR EVEN SURPASS OUR GOAL BEFORE THE DEADLINE, WE GET TO KEEP THE WHOLE AMOUNT. Even though our $75,000 goal is only part of our entire budget, it will allow us to launch principal photography and finish shooting our interviews. If we raise more than $75,000 it will go directly toward post production costs and expenses such as editing, color correction, music clearances and licensing.\nPREFER A TAX-DEDUCTIBLE DONATION?

Each year, we are awed by the talent and dedication of our filmmakers and humbled by the dedication of the volunteers who work tirelessly to create a unique film experience for our attendees. For 2012, we are again the recipients of a JEM (Joint Effort Marketing) Grant from the Wisconsin Department of Tourism, which will allow Flyway to continue to expand our marketing to a broader audience.\nUnfortunately, there are still many shortfalls within our overall operating budget, which is why we are appealing to you for additional help. As can happen in times of economic uncertainty, and especially in a small community with limited resources, some of our valued sponsors are not able to meet (or exceed) their prior year contributions and we now are faced with a serious financial challenge in making our 2012 Festival happen.\nIn order to ensure that we can continue to provide our audience and filmmakers with the intimate, outstanding independent film programming and events that they have enjoyed for the last four years, we are launching a 21-day Kickstarter Campaign to raise the $10K Flyway vitally needs.\nI\u2019ll be frank:  we need your assistance, support, and energy to help Save Flyway 2012.\nA few things to know about Flyway:\nFlyway is completely volunteer-run.\nEvery penny of the Kickstarter $10K will be used to bring in filmmakers and other industry personnel to Pepin and Stockholm. Any funds raised that exceed our goal will be used for other Festival enhancements, such as technical equipment upgrades, and making sure we can continue our free community programming throughout 2013.\nOur projected 2012 Festival attendance will contribute over $115K in economic stimulus to our greater community.\nFlyway wants to continue building its reputation as a festival that matters in an intimate, accessible, and unpretentious way that fosters participation and personal ownership. \nSo, what do you say?

SOLE SURVIVOR offers the first glimpse into the lives of four sole survivors as they embark on a journey to understand their perplexing fate. \nSynopsis: When Galaxy Flight 203 was in its final seconds, George Lamson pulled his legs above his head, an arbitrary decision that helped save his life as he was thrown through the fuselage on impact. Immediately after the crash, George\u2019s sole survival was considered miraculous and newsworthy, making him a fixture in the media for a year. Twenty-six years later, George lives a few blocks from the accident site and still struggles with the emotional weight of his survival. He doesn't know if he was spared for a reason and if he was, what is that reason? In an effort to heal, he seeks to connect with the other 13 sole survivors of commercial aviation disasters, including Cecelia Cichan, Bahia Bakari and  Jim Polehinke \u2013 none of whom have ever spoken publicly. \nCecelia Cichan, the lone survivor of Northwest 255 (which memorializes its 25th anniversary this month), shares her story for the first time in SOLE SURVIVOR.  Jim Polehinke was the co-pilot of Comair Flight 5191 that crashed in Lexington on August 27th, 2006. Since the accident, Jim has never spoken publicly.  In SOLE SURVIVOR, Jim\u2019s emotional struggle with his survivorship is underscored by the NTSB's findings that the plane crashed due to pilot error.   French teenager Bahia Bakari has yet to share her story with America.  Through their varying experiences yet similar reflections, SOLE SURVIVOR puts a face on survivorship, underscoring the fact that survivors should not be treated as lucky; survivors are victims too.\nSTATUS: With the generous support from our last Kickstarter campaign, we accomplished our goal of finishing the rough cut of the film. However, the film is not completed; finishing funds are essential to wrap the project and with the help of this Kickstarter campaign, we will wrap the film and get it out the door by mid-September 2012. Your contributions will help us share these brave, inspiring, never-told stories with the world.    \nRATIONALE: Survivors of airplane crashes embody the experience of all types of survivors because their experience is acute, public and dramatic. However, there are many types of survivors that are not in the news. Survivors of natural disaster, war, genocide, pandemic disease and other types of tragedy often have difficulty assimilating back into their families and communities. There is a misconception that if somebody survives a tragedy, they should feel lucky. Pressure is placed on survivors to move on with their lives or to feel grateful for being spared a dire fate without acknowledging the extreme psychological, social, emotional, spiritual and physical ramifications of survival. Families, communities and institutions around the world have neglected the struggles of survivors due to a lack of understanding. We hope this film will educate about survivorship so that survivors no longer have to live on the margins of society or on the brink of their own personhood without the resources that they need to heal.\nVIEW THE OFFICIAL TRAILER HERE: ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Introducing our new film, Zero Weeks.

Thank you all! \nWe're 100% funded but there's still time to support Plenty and take advantage of the rewards. There are still a few seats left for dinner, and plenty of Sonnenzimmer prints, bags, and food subscriptions available.    \nAny donations beyond the $15,000 will go towards covering Kickstarter's fee and the credit card processing fees, allowing us to put more funds towards the store!\nAgain, thank you all so, so much. \n*New Reward: Fruit to the Rescue! - Print by Sonnenzimmer\nPrint + 2 Produce Bags -  $30 for current backers / $40 for new backers *includes US shipping\nThe magnificent Sonnenzimmer (Nick Butcher and Nadine Nakanishi) ARE PRINTING A POSTER JUST FOR OUR BACKERS!!! Get yourself a helping before they're gone. Current backers can get one by increasing your pledge by $30 or more. \n--\nHELP US OPEN! \nMy partner Gwen and I saw the need for a grocery store in our neighborhood. One that sold healthy food and supported the local food system. So we decided to open Plenty!\nWe've been working hard trying to come up with the funding we need to make Plenty successful. Unfortunately, so far, we've come up short. But you can help! We're asking you, our neighbors and future customers, to give us a hand in making a store we can all use and love.\nThe money we raise on Kickstarter will be used for plumbing work, licenses, permits, start-up inventory, utility deposits, bulk-food bins, and wages for our employees. \nIn addition to the rewards you select, every backer will be able to let us know about products you'd like to see on the shelves, dietary restrictions you might have (how many vegans & celiac sufferers do we have out there?), and how we can make a better shopping experience for everyone.\nWe can't do it without you and we wouldn't want to. We will only be successful with the support of our community. Kickstarter is all or nothing. If we don't reach our funding goal your credit card will not be charged, you won't receive any rewards, and we will have to delay our opening until we can secure enough funding.  \nTHE REWARDS\n*Notes: 1) In order to reserve your seat you must select this reward even if you're getting multiple rewards. 2) If you want to reserve more than one seat just multiply your pledge by the number of seats you want and select the dinner as your reward. We will adjust the availability as needed. Thanks! \nFood Subscriptions\nPay ahead and save! Help us in the short run and we'll give you a little extra in return. Each month you'll receive an item or items of your choice valued at the monthly portion of the subscription cost + bonus amount:\n6 Month Subscription = item(s) valued at $11.67 each month for 6 months. \n10 Month Subscription = item(s) valued at $12 each month for 10 months.\nThere's no limit to the number of subscriptions you can have. Say you want an item every week for 6 months or 10 months just pledge 4 times the subscription cost and you got it!\nLocal subscribers can collect their reward at any time during the month and can choose from a wide variety of staple foods and basic goods including produce, bulk-goods, breads, dairy, meats, beverages and more. \nSubscribers who choose to have their items shipped will have fewer choices but they will be no less delicious. It also costs more to ship, sorry. Each month we'll send you an email with the items you can choose from. You can expect to find Chicago made coffee, tea, honey, jams, and other nonperishable items.\nBuying Club Membership\nIf you already know you're going be doing a lot of shopping at PLENTY (yay!) this reward is for you. Get all the cost savings you expect from a buyers club without order minimums or even ordering ahead of time. Membership is for one year. \nSelecting Multiple Rewards\nIf you want multiple rewards simply add up the cost of each reward that you want and pledge that amount. Once the fundraiser has ended we will contact you to confirm your selections. Check out our package rewards for even more value! \n*NOTE: If you are doing multiple rewards and want a seat at the supporters dinner you must select the dinner as your reward in order to reserve your seat. As mentioned above, we will contact you at the end to clarify which other rewards you want. \nAbout Kickstarter\nFor those of you who are new to Kickstarter let me first say thank you, I hope this will not be the last project you support.

Traveling to India, Lousiana, California, and New Mexico, Dinesh pieces together the story of his mother's schizophrenia and how his family dealt with it in an age and culture where mental illness was often misunderstood, scorned and taboo.\nDwarka and Susheela Sabu lived complicated lives bridging two countries and cultures. Unbroken Glass is more than a story about immigrants or mental illness, it is a nuanced story of one family and their struggles.\nMore than a linear narrative of their lives, Unbroken Glass is an impressionistic portrait of who Dinesh's parents were-- as immigrants, family members, as complex people subject to social forces. It weaves together his journey of discovery with cinema-verite scenes of his family dealing with still raw emotions and consequences of his parents lives and deaths.\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 1% of the US population is affected by schizophrenia, and there is a proven genetic component to the illness. Some research has pointed to a link between \"acculturative stress,\" the kind of stress immigrants experience adjusting to a new life, and the onset of mental illness. Dinesh hopes that telling this story will raise awareness about schizophrenia and empower families of the mentally ill to share their stories.\nKickstarter Support\nThe project has almost completed shooting, including in such locations as India, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Los Angeles, California. However, what is perhaps the story's most important chapter has yet to be shot, to Dinesh's return to his parent's home in Louisiana.\nKickstarter funds will be used to finance this shoot. Dinesh will reconnect with and interview old family friends of his parents, to try to figure out who they were before his mother became ill, as well as how they understood her increasingly aberrant behavior in an age and culture with radically different attitudes towards mental illness.\nThis segment is crucial for the film, as Indian immigrants, Dinesh's lived their formative years in the United States in Louisiana. Moreover, during this time, Dinesh's mother Susheela first started showing signs of mental illness, what would ultimately be the schizophrenia that in part led her to take her life.\nKickstarter funds will fully fund the completion of shooting this documentary.

Its been a labor of love over the last year and a half, and I'm almost finished. The big snag is our sound design, which is rather extensive and really needs someone working on it for at least a week straight.\nThe film asks the question, what the city would look like if only one person was in it. It takes place in a single evening as the character wanders the streets noticing all he ignored because of the hustle and bustle of the city. It's an apocalyptic film with no apocalypse, a dystopic vision of man's physical imprint on space, an architecture film as seen from a night on earth, where our character aches for attention and longs to be alone. \nAbout our crew\nA number of highly talented artists have already lent their abilities to the project either for free or for marginal cost including Sean Ryan, Ben Niles, Ben Kasulke, Daniel White, Rylan Morris, Sarah Crowe and Jens Larsen.\nWhat we need\nWe need to raise $5000 in order to finish this project. The sound design is critical to the project as we need to create an empty city sound scape. We don't want to rely on music and will use sounds to generate the feeling of the characters isolation in the grandeur of the city. Our focus is on isolating those sounds that populate city life that get drowned out in unison. We will pull them out of the background and focus the viewers attention on what humans will leave behind them. This is the final step as we  prepare the film for festivals, and generally kick it out into the world.\nCan We Raise More Than Our Goal?\nYES, we can.  There is no limit to the amount of funds we can raise and additional funds raised will be put to good use.  In today's new distribution environment for independent films, filmmakers can take an active role in distributing their films, which is incredibly empowering.
