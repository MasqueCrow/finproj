But nothing she ever imagined could have prepared her for their \"great news\"... Miharu is getting married! Not long after, she is confronted by another guy claiming HE is her fiance. What's a girl to do? In a world of obligations and high expectations Miharu is met by strange twists of fate in her journey through adolescence. Can she find the courage to stay true to herself without sacrificing her own dreams and desires for the sake of conformity! With her family, friends (and enemies!) to cope with, will Miharu even have the time to discover her own true love, the one boy connected to her by the red string of destiny?\"\nGina has been working on the Red String series for ten years, putting her heart and soul into the characters and the pages.

I could post photos of her from soon after the attack, but I'm afraid they might actually drive you away. The skin on her face basically melted and then re-coagulated.\nThe acid attack on Marina was not the first such case, but it was one of the worst, and it has become the best known in her homeland. There have been hundreds of others since.\nEarly in my journalistic career, I spent almost four years living in Cambodia where I wrote about human rights for local, regional and international publications. I recognized that Marina's story brought together a wide array of troubling elements about life in her homeland. One of them is about how girls and young women are vulnerable to the untouchable Cambodian elite -- what I call the beauty curse. Another is how those powerful people are immune to any consequences for their own actions, no matter how horrible. Most of all this is  a powerful personal story about a girl who nearly anyone might relate to.\nI began to tell Marina's story after meeting with her and her brother in 2000, for an article that later appeared in Open City magazine.\nSince then, I've often thought about whether there might be a better way to tell her story. I concluded that a sophisticated comic book, or graphic novel, was the answer. Drawings can make this kind of story accessible to a wider audience. During a John S. Knight journalism fellowship at Stanford University, I took part in a test run \u2014 a group of students, two professors and I used my article about Marina as the inspiration for the graphic novel Shake Girl, a fictionalized account of the episode.\nThe Beauty Curse won't be fictionalized. Working with talented artists (including Vrej Kassouny, who produced the draft drawings in the video above), we'll produce a rigorously journalistic graphic book that will tell Marina's remarkable story of survival and overcoming, much of it in her own words.\nWe're aiming at a broad audience, from graphic novel fans in the US, Europe, Japan and Korea, to very different readers in countries where these attacks are most common, whether in Southeast Asia, Central Asia or the Middle East. We've initiated discussions with various individuals and organizations about how to translate the book into different languages, especially Khmer, the main language in Cambodia. We will add to calls for justice in these cases, and join efforts to change attitudes toward women. The book will also include an addendum with suggestions to readers about practical actions that they can take to end the violence. But first, we have to complete the book.\nPledging your support is just as quick and easy as buying something on Amazon. Just click right here!\nQuick updates:\n\u2022 The signed copy of the book ($25 and up) can be shipped outside the US.\n\u2022 We now have a Facebook page \u2014 please visit and Like it! Then check Get Notifications, under the Liked button, to stay up to date.\nUSE OF FUNDING\nThere are some significant expenses involved, and that's where we need your help. Besides scripting and editing, we need to pay skilled artists to storyboard, draw and color the art itself, and pay for technical help with design and layout. Because this is a true story (with Human Rights Watch's name attached to it) we'll need substantial fact-checking, and because it's a global story there may be some travel costs. We'll try to keep all these costs to a minimum, but we may have to pay for photo reprint rights, and probably for Khmer-language translation. And finally there will be distribution costs such as postage, promotion and web hosting.\nOnce we cross the funding threshold that allows this project to go forward, we will spend the following six months on additional researching, final interviewing, scripting, editing and drawing. After some final edits and corrections, the book will ship off to the printer by the fall.\nShould support for The Beauty Curse surpass the threshold necessary to trigger the project, overage will go toward further improving this book, and then toward funding the early stages of production of an interactive digital version.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere will be many challenges in making this book. The main one is to make it as creative as possible while hewing to reality with as much rigor as the best journalism. We aim to make high quality long-form journalism in graphic book form. \n\nThere will be other challenges. Production of this book is, in some ways, like making a magazine. It is a broad collaboration by its nature. And yet we want to retain the intimacy of a great comic book with a strong, compelling singular voice at its center. \n\nAfter that, there are the deadlines, and the give and take on the art, to make sure that it represents the real world. We intend to portray Marina's broader world, and Cambodia, without merely reducing her homeland down to the nightmare that she survived. That is crucial because this is a story of survival in a complex universe where there are joys and horrors, and many moments in between.\n\nBut to take on those challenges, we first need to meet our Kickstarter goal.

It is the brainchild of the Freakshow's terminally ill owner, Reginald Black.  As the country's favor begins to shift away from such acts as can be found in his traveling salon of oddities, Black has a vision of a new type of theme park, where Freaks aren't the main attraction, yet the so-called Freaks currently under his employ would continue to be taken care of by the profits such a park would produce, after he is gone.\nUnfortunately for Black, he has decided to set up shop just outside of Wichita, right next to the sleepy little town of Leslie.  The town is presumably run by a self-proclaimed \"Messenger of God\", known to his parishioners as Reverend William Bell.  His self-righteousness is surpassed only by his greed, and he's not interested in seeing any new enterprise built so close by, where he's not getting a cut.\nBell, however, is the least of Black's worries.  The true ruling body of Leslie is a cult-like group, led by a mysterious young man bent on having complete control over everything and everyone around him.  The youthful cult leader orchestrates a plan, wherein a member of Black's entourage is murdered, setting into motion a series of accusations, attacks and even more death, setting the inhabitants of both Leslie and the nearby theme park against each other.\nBefore things progress any further, a legendary lawman is called in from the nearby city of Wichita, to sort things out (based loosely on a REAL lawman from the time period who was a true visionary in the field of law enforcement, establishing practices such as regular police patrols and mobile police labs).  He is a keen and careful man, and it does not take him, and his brilliant Pawnee inspector, long to realize that there is a lot more going on in Leslie than meets the eye.\nI don't want to ruin the ending, so I won't say much more, except to state that FREAKESTATE clearly shows us that the real monsters among us don't come from any mysterious traveling Freakshow, but instead from right next door.  More importantly, however, it shines a light on our society's ability to create such a monster...and asks the question, who ultimately should be held responsible for their existence?\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nWHY NO COLOR?\nThe story itself is set in 1933, and the style in which it is told is that of an old black and white film.  Therefore, the artist felt that my story worked best presented visually in black and white, with gray tones.  Thus, no color.\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nFREAKESTATE is one of those stories that carries with it a handful of difficult messages (not to mention the black and white angle being a very difficult sell these days), and thus is tough to place with a publisher.  After conversations with several publishers, editors and other professionals in the field, I have come to the conclusion that the only way this book will be made the way WE want to make it, is if we do it on our own.  That, of course, is where YOU come in!  It is only with YOUR help and support that this book will ever see the light of day.  The money we are asking for will of course pay for design, professional editing, printing, shipping and distribution of FREAKESTATE #1, funds to pay for creation of the variant covers and serigraph prints, and of course payment for the artist and myself.  With the successful funding of this Kickstarter Project, we will be able to afford the time and energy it will take to finally finish AND produce the first issue of this awesome and powerful story!\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nREWARDS\nIncluded among our rewards are some very special VARIANT SKETCH COVERS by some incredible artists!\nDAN FRAGA\nDAN FRAGA sample artwork (THIS IS NOT THE COVER)\nDan started as a comic book artist for Image, Marvel and DC Comics.  He\u2019s worked on many of the industry\u2019s top titles including The X-Men, Spider-Man, Superman, and Wolverine.  He has also worked as a storyboard artist and director.  He is a person I have admired for many years, and it's incredible to have him involved with this project!\nANDY SMITH\nANDY SMITH sample artwork (THIS IS NOT THE COVER)\nAndy has worked for Marvel, DC, Image, Acclaim and Cross Gen.  Andy is also the best selling author of \u201cDrawing Dynamic Comics\u201d published by Watson-Guptill in 2000. The book is currently in it\u2019s seventh printing. Andy\u2019s second book \u201cDrawing American Manga Super-heroes\u201d was published by Watson-Gutptill in 2007.

He is a very gifted artist, and it's amazing to have him involved with this project!\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nABOUT US\nDrew Ford has been writing comics for many years.  He started out making underground comics in 1993, and never looked back.  Since then he has worked for a plethora of publishers, including most recently DC Comics.  He is best known for his creator-owned comic entitled RIB, published in the 90's by Cailber Comics.  Currently, he is wrapping up his first original graphic novel for Dark Horse Comics.\nGerald Forton has Ford beat by a mile!  He has been drawing and creating comics for over 60 years, starting back in 1950!  He worked for several key French and Belgium comic magazine publishers during the 50's, 60's and 70's.  In the 80's, he emigrated to the US, and began working for companies such as DC Comics and First, illustrating stories for Detective Comics, Jonah Hex and Nexus.  Forton has also worked as a storyboard artist for film and television.  He worked with Stan Lee as a storyboard artist on the 'Prince Valiant' TV series and was a character and background designer on classic 80's cartoon series like 'He-Man and the Masters of the Universe', 'Bravestar', 'Captain Planet and the Planeteers', 'The Real Ghost Busters', 'James Bond Jr.', 'G.I. Joe: Operation Dragonfire', 'C.O.P.S.' and 'She-Ra: Princess of Power'.  Currently Forton is working on a number of projects, both in the United States and Europe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoth Gerald and myself have worked professionally as comic book creators for many years, and therefore have established solid work practices and have developed solutions for almost any type of problem we might encounter.

A little boy, one among many, is taken into Dr. Hans Schmidt's laboratory to be tortured and experimented on as part of the Nazis' search for a new breed of human, a new breed of warrior. Dr. Hans Schmidt is the top scientist for the Nazi party and is in charge of leading the project. Through vigorous trials and errors, the project is a success and The Craver is born. As the scientists are evaluating The Craver, bombs are dropped from U.S. Army planes onto the laboratory. During the chaos, The Craver, along with Dr. Hans Schmidt escape and go their separate ways. Our journey begins...\nArtwork by Steven E. Gordon\nFrom Update #3\nFollow this horrific and suspenseful tale of The Craver. Learn about the secret society of post war Nazi slayers: The Sons of Aaron. Uncover the truth of The Craver's only living relative, and pray that The Craver isn't coming for you! WWII may have ended but Dr. Hans Schmidt's plans are just getting started.\nThe story of The Craver was born in the mind of actor, comics enthusiast, and monster fanatic, Blake Clark. He owes the inspiration for this comic book and film to his dreams and to the Universal Monsters. Blake's heart's desire is to make a new monster for this generation in tribute to the Universal Monsters, to share how they captivated his imagination and illustrated the struggles between good and evil.\nThe Craver is a brave new look at history, monsters, good vs. evil and how comic books are used to present untold horror stories. The Craver is intended to be a film trilogy, with its origins deeply rooted in comic book culture.\nArtwork by Steven E. Gordon\nIn order to see our dream realized, we need your help!\nWe have an amazingly talented team lined up for the comic book, including Writer: Erik Warfield; Artist: Steven E. Gordon; Co Creator: Anthony Lipe-Ladenheim; and Creator: Blake Clark. Producer: Caleb Pearson. And yes, you heard right! Doug Jones has signed on to play The Craver in the film trilogy.They are waiting for you, the fans, to make this comic book a reality. So, please join us in bringing The Craver to life and stay tuned for our updates from story plots to conceptual art.\nA little bit about our team:\nPicture of Steven Gordon from update #2\nArtist Steven E. Gordon: I know... you wish you had an uber cool signature like Steven, but we are only human unfortunately. He is an Annie Awards nominee, director, story board artist, character designer, illustrator, animator, most well known for his work as Character Designer on X-Men: Evolution and The Swan Princess. Steven is a top veteran in the industry and The Craver team is very honored to have him on board. Steven's resume is extensive but to just name a few credits: He has done storyboard art for such films as Terminator: Salvation, Shrek 2, and Over the Hedge. He has been a director on X-Men: Evolution, Wolverine and the X-Men, Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, and is currently a director on the NickToons show, NFL Rush Zone: Rise of The Guardians, as well as working on graphic novels for Sequential Pulp Comics/Dark Horse Comics. Visit Steven's blog to find out everything that he is up to! http://stevenegordon.blogspot.com/\nWriter Erik Warfield: Yes he is quite calm, but even a green certain someone knows not to make him angry. Erik writes the following comic book series: All Crime Comics and Five Color Comics. He also runs The House of Secrets comic book and toy store located in Burbank, California. Erik is known for his knowledge of comics as well as for carrying a variety of comics, which brings Hollywood's top heavyweights to shop there too!\nCreator Blake Clark: Not just the father of The Craver, but Blake is a well known commercial actor residing in Los Angeles and is an ultra mega fan of the Universal Monsters as well as comic books! Blake's vivid imagination has brought The Craver and this team together! Be careful when discussing The Wolfman, King Kong, and Spider-Man around him. ;-)\nCo Creator Anthony Lipe-Ladenheim: Not only known for having the most spell checked last name in the world, but is a commercial actor as well. He met Blake through mutual friends in the commercial acting world and they hit it off with their love for movies and monsters! Anthony has helped develop the story with Blake. If you live in Los Angeles, then you probably have seen him on a tennis court somewhere. He's good!\nProducer Caleb Pearson: Known for growing an epic beard on special occasions, Caleb has been friends with Blake and Anthony for years. Caleb is a producer in the film/tv industry and is vital to the creation of the comic book. He directed the Kickstarter video and budgeted the comic book.\nWhere is the money going???\nThe $9,500 goal is for the completion of a 36 page comic book.\n$5,400 - Artwork (Steven E. Gordon)\n$1,100 - Writing the comic book (Erik Warfield)\n$1,000-$1,800 - lettering and coloring ($30-$50 per page)\n$1,200 - Printing copies for Kickstarter supporters as well as sample copies for meetings with publishers and film studios.\nAny amount past our goal will go towards printing more copies for Kickstarter supporters and will go towards advertising the comic.  \nThank you for being a part of bringing The Craver to life!

Commissioned by the Baskerville Newspaper Group as their answer to the Evening Standard\u2019s MODESTY BLAISE.\nTelecommunication is everything...\nLet's get the party started...\n Working with Shaeffer, a writer entrenched in the world of crime and sci-fi pulp magazines, Barreti produced the first serial as a complete work with story outlines and sketches for a further six adventures. Unfortunately the strip was deemed too sensational and the idea was shelved. This coincided with a mental breakdown for the artist and four years mental rehabilitation in a Turin clinic. Not one to let insanity hold him back, Barreti continued to produce GOLDTIGER strips through this period, with Shaeffer posting the artist his scripts. The main issue for the editor at the Baskerville Newspaper Group was certainly the sexuality of its main characters. In an intentionally subversive twist, both Lily Gold and Jack Tiger were openly homosexual, a step too far even for the so-called \u2018swinging sixties\u2019. \nThe infamous \"Let's go diving\" strip from 1966, that caused quite a stir!\nThat aside the content was also a tad too bizarre for middle England to digest over it\u2019s morning tea and toast. Storylines such as THE GLORY AFFAIR (in which our heroes attempt to find who has paralysed the prime minister using a Hand of Glory sourced from the grave of Ruth Ellis); THE SHUTTLECOCK PRINCIPLE (the British Space Exploration program is sabotaged by what appears to be an ancient troop of Knights Templar) and particularly THE LUCIFER CONTRACT (where the devil himself asks for their help in finding an oil baron who has escaped from Hell) all proved too strong for them to consider. Though, showing a typical shift in cultural taste, the latter idea was the basis for a proposed Italian feature film La bellezza va all'inferno that was to star Edwige Fenech and Terence Stamp. \nExtremely rare promotional poster from 1966.\nOutside these close brushes with success, Barreti and Shaeffer\u2019s creation has languished in obscurity, discussed only by the cognoscenti of the artform. Louis Shaeffer is believed to have died off the coast of Corfu in 1972 and, after his release from care, Barreti vanished altogether. At least the majority of their work remains, perhaps in time to gain a whole new audience. \nUsing extensive restoration techniques and after many years of scouring the archives, GOLDTIGER is ready to be presented again, complete from the very beginning, starting with their debut adventure THE POSEIDON COMPLEX.\nRemastered strip, with the newly created \"Barreti\" lettering font and enhanced artwork.\nCover to Shaeffer's novelisation of the first Goldtiger story.\nREALLY? HOW STRANGE... I KNOW A LOT ABOUT COMICS BUT I\u2019VE NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE.\nOh.\nIT\u2019S ALMOST AS IF YOU INVENTED THE WHOLE THING AND EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID WAS A PACK OF LIES. \nOh. \nGOLDTIGER NEVER REALLY EXISTED AT ALL DID IT?\nWell. If it didn\u2019t before, it certainly does now. This first volume of collected strips is a lavish affair, combining the full debut adventure with \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 material: letters, scripts, interviews, sketches... all documenting the creation of the strip and the outlandish lives of its creators.\nA sample spread from the history of the strip that made history...\nITS FICTIONAL CREATORS. \nShush. The book is as much the story of Antonio Barreti, an artist who escaped into the world he had created as it is the fantastical adventures of fashonistas and guns for hire Lily Tiger and Jack Gold. The story flips from the mad, psychedelic action of the GOLDTIGER strip, a gun-toting, sexy saga of crazy villains and nail-baiting action, to the unhinged mind of the man who created it. Until, eventually, it\u2019s hard to tell the difference between the two. \nBarreti self portrait for the famous cartoonist series of buttons...mysteriously never used.\n WHO ARE THE REAL CREATORS? \nOops, a slight glitch in the KICKSTARTER matrix there...what have we done?\nThe *ahem* production assistants who have supervised this mammoth task of unearthing the original strips and restoring them for print are writer, Guy Adams and artist Jimmy Broxton. \nNEVER HEARD OF THEM, BET THEY\u2019RE FICTIONAL TOO. \nHow dare you. Guy Adams is the author of over twenty books, from THE WORLD HOUSE and its sequel RESTORATION, to the weird western series THE HEAVEN\u2019S GATE CHRONICLES. He has written original novels featuring Sherlock Holmes for Titan Books, adapted classic horror titles for Hammer Books and is currently working on a new horror/espionage series forthcoming from Del Rey UK, THE CLOWN SERVICE. Jimmy Broxton is a UK based graphic artist, illustrator and designer, who recently started working in the American comics market. DC Comics, Vertigo, Dark Horse and Madefire have all published his work. Teamed with Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti he recently contributed to the successful Kickstarter project: Sex and Violence.\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397702842/sex-and-violence-volume-1?ref=live\nMystery surrounds the true identity of the artist, as mounting evidence suggests he is simply a figment of long time comic\u2019s creator James Hodgkins' imagination. \nFINE. \nAT LEAST ONE OF YOU APPEARS TO BE REAL. SO WHAT DO I GET FOR MY MONEY? \nWe\u2019re producing two different versions of THE POSEIDON COMPLEX. In both cases, the book itself will be a handsomely designed hardback, 230mm x 285mm, printed on heavy art stock, full colour throughout. Though the original strips were black and white you will see from the examples here that they are reproduced in \u2018archival\u2019 format tinted with the age of decades! The rest of the material\u2014as can also see from the examples here\u2014is as bright and beautiful as a butterfly on acid. This accounts for 128 pages of strip and text goodness, lolling under a gold-blocked cover, with archival quality Smyth Sewn binding ensuring years of reading pleasure. This is a one-off run, never to appear again. If these strips ever get a mass-market release then it\u2019s extremely unlikely it will be in such an attractive format. Adams and Broxton think books should be beautiful things. You can rest assured that if you bumped into this book at a a bar you would most certainly being trying to dance with it, get its phone number and hoping it would touch you in intimate places.\nA thing of beauty...\nFor those with deeper pockets and the sensible desire of making themselves impossibly attractive by owning such a lavish item, we have a strictly-limited Treasury edition. There will only be one hundred of these produced. The Treasury Edition contains the book as described above but packaged in a traycase alongside the following additional treats: A separate booklet on the development of GOLDTIGER, by Adams and Broxton. Four full-colour art prints exclusive to the Treasury Edition. \nThe GOLDTIGER single an exclusive CD from composer Clive Pearsal featuring the full length version of the main title theme along with B Side \u2018Love Theme from GOLDTIGER\u2019 and more. Put it on repeat and make sweet rhythms inside the flesh of your choice! For more info on the work of the incredible Mr Pearsall please visit: http://www.clivepearsall.co.uk\nDeluxe, limited edition CD of the Goldtiger theme tune, composed, arranged, performed and produced by Clive Pearsall especially for this Kickstarter edition.\nThe piece de resistance... an original, dedicated, pencil sketch from the legendary Barreti himself! Obviously this is an extremely rare item... \nA thing of rare beauty...\nBECAUSE HE DOESN\u2019T EXIST? ...\nbecause Barreti has been missing for years and is likely dead. Think of the surge of joy you will feel, holding this original sketch in your hands as you contemplate how we had to hunt him down, dig him up and then reanimate him with judicious quantities of electricity and drugs. Art that will reek of the grave and sinful science. \nOR THE SWEET AFTERGLOW OF JIMMY BROXTON\u2019S IMPORTED LAGER STASH BECAUSE IT\u2019S BEEN HIM ALL ALONG. \nYou have no soul. Stop spoiling things... The treasury Edition will also come with a certificate, hand numbered and signed... \nWHO BY? YOU DIGGING UP SHAEFFER TOO? \nWhy not? That\u2019s an excellent idea, I suppose Adams and Broxton can scribble in it too. This being Kickstarter, a host of other options are available with extra fun treats and collectable items. Browse away to the right and see how wonderful life could be if only you had a few less pounds in your pocket and a viable internet connection. \nAND WHEN WILL ALL THIS BE DELIVERED? ARE YOU QUITE SURE YOU\u2019RE NOT JUST GOING TO RUN OFF WITH MY MONEY AND BE FOUND DEAD IN A MOTEL ROOM A FEW MONTHS DOWN THE LINE? \nYour money\u2019s safe, noble reader. You only pay once the project is successfully funded and we\u2019ve been careful only to launch this once a good chunk of the work was completed. The last thing a creative individual needs is the Internet breathing down his neck with a view to hunting him down and killing him. All concerned are professionals and would never work again if they didn\u2019t deliver what they promised. GOLDTIGER will be in your hands late Summer 2013 with, we hope, more volumes to follow.  \nOK. WE'LL TRUST YOU. ONE LAST QUESTION THOUGH: ARE YOU GOING TO USE OUR MONEY TO FUND YOUR EXOTIC LIFESTYLES?\n\nOur lifestyles are actually frustratingly mundane. Only the other day, Broxton got so excited after finding a fifty pence piece in the street that his long-suffering partner had to send him to bed for a lie down, he had nearly given himself a coronary with all the running up and down and crying with joy. \n\nWe're putting this project on Kickstarter for one defining reason: control. We've both worked with many wonderful publishers over the years but sometimes you have an idea that you really want to cover every aspect of. By releasing the book in this manner we can do it exactly the way we want. Everything is down to us from the contents to the design, layout and binding. Ultimately it will be the definitive version of what we both see in our stupid heads. All of which costs money that we don't have, not being publishers ourselves (that said, we both do have publishing experience and enough contacts in the print business to ensure we're not incapable of doing the job and offering the impossible). \n\nYou know you want one...or three.\n\nThe nutty stuff...\nThere's also the fun side: coming up with the nutty trinkets, badges T-Shirts etc. and running a project that everyone involved has fun with. GOLDTIGER is a wild, crazy idea and it seemed only right that we went about in a wild, crazy way.\n\nHOW GRATEFUL WILL YOU BE?\nSo grateful it hurts. All backers will be listed in the book as a small sign of our soppy gratitude. This can only happen with your support and we will be singing love songs in your names for the rest of our days.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo be serious for a moment, we're asking you to pledge us your hard-earned money so we want everyone to know how that's going to work. While Kickstarter has provided a great business model for creators, allowing them to produce work outside the mainstream, there are many who are uncertain about the financial side of it. Yes, if this project is successfully funded, we're asking you to pay money upfront, that's how the site works. It's also the only way to ensure we can do this and not lose our shirts. \n\nThere has been a\u2014small\u2014amount of concern on internet forums along the lines of \"I don't just want to fund a creator's lifestyle\". Outside the fact that we are both full-time in our chosen profession and therefore need to see money from it in order to pay the bills, we have tried to approach this in as simple a manner as possible. We have set the funding goal at a figure that we know is high enough to guarantee we can provide the quality books we're promising. The production costs are a sliding scale, if only a few people want these books they will cost a lot more to produce than if a lot of people want one. Therefore we have to plan for the worst and hope for the best. We have also set the delivery schedule to work around our current workload, on the understanding that neither of us might see anything approaching an industry-standard wage for our work on the book. That's fine, we WANT to do this. If more money is made then, yes, we will see more profit from it. That will mean that we have a solid idea that we can make more of these books (our ultimate goal) and that it will be practical for us to do so.\n\nI will be posting regular updates so you know what's going on. We're not hucksters, we're two professionals with our reputations on the line. In this industry, reputation is everything. The only way for us to succeed here is to produce something brilliant that everybody loves. That is our primary goal.\n\nWe hope this is only the start for the adventures of Lily Gold, Jack Tiger, Antonio Barreti and Louis Schaeffer.

Now I\u2019m ready to print the second volume!\nAbout the Comic:\nPang, The Wandering Shaolin Monk is a comic about a Buddhist monk in 17th century China named Shi Long Pang, whose temple has been destroyed by the ruling Qing dynasty. Thinking that a couple of his brothers escaped the destruction as well, Pang sets out to find them. There\u2019s kung fu action, drama, comedy, and lots of Chinese history packed into the story. I\u2019ve done my best to give the comic an authentic feel of 17th century China. But the meat of the story focuses on Pang\u2019s struggle as a naive monk trying to cope with life outside of the temple. Along the way he runs into corrupt officials, thugs, bounty hunters, and--perhaps most intimidating of all--a cute girl. Meanwhile, and unbeknownst to Pang, a mysterious group of Qing soldiers searches for one of the books of his temple. \nPang Vol. 1 won a Xeric Award and a 2011 Stumptown Comic Arts Award, and was named a Top Ten Comic of 2010 by Vulture Magazine.

And they're the GOOD guys.\"\nHi there! I'm Sean Wang and I'm a comic book writer and illustrator. Over the years, I've worked on books like the Tick and Arthur for New England Comics and Meltdown for Image Comics. But I'm most well known for my self-published sci-fi series Runners...\nWhat is Runners?\nRunners is a fun sci-fi action comedy about a crew of alien smugglers led by reluctant captain Roka Nostaco and his acerbic co-pilot Ril Mar. They're joined by two pirates, six-eyed sharpshooter and wisecracker Cember Koji and former mob enforcer Bennesaud. There's also a humanoid named Bocce, who has a weird, shape-shifting arm, and a blue-skinned alien girl named Sky, who has some mysterious abilities of her own. The series follows their exploits as they struggle to complete hazardous intergalactic runs while constantly hounded by pirates, bounty hunters, police, and the occasional conscience.\n\"Runners is the best science fiction adventure I have read in years. It has wonderfully fleshed out characters, a terrific story, and great action sequences.\" --Stan Sakai; Usagi Yojimbo\nThe first graphic novel, Runners: Bad Goods, came out in 2005 to much critical acclaim, including being on several reviewers' Best of 2005 lists. It focused on the crew's struggle to complete a particularly dangerous run for the mob, taking them from shootouts with pirates to ship-to-ship dogfights with ruthless bounty hunters, and culminating in an all-out, three-way ship, cycle, and foot chase through the streets of an alien space station.\nAfter a short hiatus to work on other comic projects, I have now completed the second story arc, Runners: The Big Snow Job, in which hard times have fallen on Roka and his smuggling crew. The desperate crew takes on a seemingly trivial job that turns out to be more than they bargained for as they deal with an inhospitable climate, a hostile native population, a band of mercenaries, a mob power play, and a series of treacherous double-crosses. And that's if they don't all kill each other first!\nWhere Do You Come In?\nThrough Kickstarter, I'm hoping to fund the printing of the Runners: The Big Snow Job paperback graphic novel. From 2009-2011, I published the story online as a weekly webcomic, and I am now looking to collect the completed story into printed form. Unlike the first book, Runners: Bad Goods, which was black-and-white, the new story is in full color, and color printing can be a tad expensive for the self-publisher. But with your help, we can make it happen!\nFor your pledge, you will receive a copy of the new book, along with a number of other additional Runners items, including:\nA set of 8 full-color character cards\nChoice of 3 different color prints\nOriginal art for the 6 cover images\n3 levels of inked character illustrations\nA 64-page expanded sketchbook of concept and character designs\nAnd as I mentioned, all the story content had already been finished, so there is no risk of the project not being completed. In fact, all that remains to be done is layout work on my end.\nBook Specs\nRunners: The Big Snow Job will be a 168-page full color paperback and will collect the entire 5-issue story that originally posted online at runnersuniverse.com. It will also include an all-new 6-page epilogue, 10 pages of sketchbook concepts, and guest pinups from comic artists including David Petersen (Mouseguard), Khoi Pham (Avengers), Shawn McManus (Fables: Cinderella), Tim Seeley (Hack/Slash), and others.\nHow Will the Money Be Spent?\nThe cheapest I have found to print the book is overseas for about $6000, so that is my initial goal. Ideally, I'd love to reach at least $8500, which would allow me to print here in the U.S. Printing here would also cut down tremendously on turnaround time, since I could receive the books in under a month, as opposed to the 3-month wait time for overseas. And the sooner I get the books, the sooner you get them!\nIn addition to the first Stretch Goal of $8500, I will also announce more Stretch Goals that will unlock additional cool rewards for project backers. So stay tuned!\nInternational Shipping\nCanadian orders please add $15 to any reward tier. All other international orders please add $20.\nReward Tiers\nThere are a few reward tiers that include the first book, Runners: Bad Goods. In order to keep things simple, most of the other reward tiers are for just the new book, Runners: The Big Snow Job, along with various bonus reward items. For those tiers, just add $15 to your pledge to include a copy of the Bad Goods graphic novel or $7 for a set of the 5 original issues that make up the entire Bad Goods story. The new book is a stand-alone story and can be read completely on its own, but you'll definitely get a little more out of the character and universe with the addition of the first book.\nClick these links for images of the various Reward items:\nPrints / Character Cards / Sketchbook / Inked Illustrations / Original Art\n     ________________________________________________________\n     ________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Print images     ________________________________________________________\n     ________________________________________________________\n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out David Petersen print images\n________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Character Card images\n________________________________________________________\n ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Sketchbook images\n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Inked Illustration sample images     ________________________________________________________\n     ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Inked Illustration sample images \n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Inked Illustration sample images\n     ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Original Art images\n     ________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\nNeed Convincing?\nIf you're still on the fence, please check out www.runnersuniverse.com, where you can see as much of the story and artwork as you like. In the meantime, here are a few quotes from comic professionals and reviewers:\n\"Runners was one of the best indie books I\u2019d ever read... It is space opera comics the way you wish they were done all the time... Sean Wang has wowed me again and if you give Runners a chance I\u2019m sure it will impress you too.\"  -- Kristian Horn; www.aintitcool.com\n\n\"Sean Wang's impressive art demonstrates the glorious imagination and colorful detail you want in a science fiction adventure. His exotic aliens make for a visual feast. If the Star Wars cantina customers took on Firefly-like mercenary jobs, you'd have Runners.\"  --Johanna Draper Carlson; www.comicsworthreading.com\n\"One of the best comic book universes doesn\u2019t belong to DC, Marvel or even Archie\u2026 it belongs to Sean Wang\u2019s incredible series, \u2018Runners\u2019!\" Since I first read the original, I have championed 'Runners' as the best independent comic ever produced. It's beautifully drawn and written with so much passion and charm. 'The Big Snow Job' reminds me of 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Hard to top the original, but somehow does!

As we near the final push to victory, I wanted to share this video with you.  \nWELCOME.  My name is Brian Iglesias and I am a combat decorated Marine infantry officer.

To date I have produced 5 feature films, 2 graphic novels, and I co-produced the NYC Veterans Day Parade live broadcast.\nWHAT IS CHOSIN?\nArt from \"Chosin- Hold the Line\" by Thomas Jung\nChosin is an epic battle that took place during the Korean War. In the winter of 1950, deep within the frozen mountains of North Korea, 15,000 U.S. Soldiers and Marines were surrounded and trapped by 120,000 Chinese soldiers. Despite the odds, the Marines refused to surrender and fought their way 78 miles to the sea and rescued 98,000 refugees. 17 Medals of Honor, 73 Navy Crosses, and 23 Distinguished Service Crosses were awarded, making Chosin one of the most decorated battles in American History.   \nVisit us on Facebook for more info, exclusive video, and pictures!\nWHAT\u2019S THE PLAN?\nNobody has ever successfully produced a feature-length animated war film-- this is literally film history in the making and we want you to be a part of it!\nOur ultimate objective is to use this short film to help us secure funding to complete a 90 minute, 3D animated film. A successful campaign would mean that we would be able to complete a 2 minute scene from the movie. Each additional $15,000 would allow us to add one minute. The more animation we produce on our own, the more of this amazing story we can tell, and the easier it will be to find investors or a studio to help us finish the film.\nScript/Character Design/3D Modeling/Storyboards/Animation\nOver the past year, we have spent over $20,000 and hundreds of man hours in developing the story, building the 3D models, creating storyboards and layouts, and conducting animation tests. The real life heroes of this story have already been immortalized as 3D models - Now they're waiting for you and your contribution to bring them to life.\nThe $25,000 would get us two minutes of animation which breaks down roughly to: Texturing 10%, Rigging 10%, Environment modeling 10%, Animation 40%, Effects 10%, Compositing 10%, Final Render 10%.\nArt from \"Chosin- To The Sea\" by Otis Frampton\nARE YOU NUTS? WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE A 2-MINUTE ANIMATED WAR FILM FOR ONLY $25,000?!?!\nMy co-director Richard C. Meyer is a 3D animator and cartoonist. While we developed the graphic novel and especially after seeing the anime-style character designs by artist Tom Jung, we started to realize that this could be done as a 3D animated film for a fraction of the cost of your normal studio film. \nOne of the major costs of an animated film is assets, that means 3D models of characters, vehicles, props, and environments. In your typical 3D film, you have to create the mom, the dad, the 3 kids, the talking dog, his enemy the talking cat and the granny. That is 8 completely different character models and you haven't even left the house. Every person or animal they encounter in the story requires a completely new character model. Every house, streetlight, and car they walk by costs hundreds of man-hours and thousands of dollars to produce.\nA single basic body model can be modified to make 4 different characters\nBut this is a military story which means uniformity. So we only have to build one basic body model for Marines and one for the enemy soldiers. Then we make them bigger, taller, wider, whatever, but it's the same basic model. This is an incredible savings and we have things like this throughout the story. Both armies use about 5 different weapons and just a few vehicles. Almost the entire movie takes place in the mountains, which are a lot easier to build than an entire city.\nWhen you add in the fact that most of it takes place in the snow at night, we have a lot of mitigating factors that help us make a dramatic and stylish piece of animation while also being able to \"hide\" things that would cost money to perfect and polish if this story was set in the middle of a city on a sunny day.\n\nAnd to make sure we weren't crazy, we've consulted with several major animation production houses and they have confirmed that our plan is feasible. \n\n\nPROJECT HISTORY\nThe Chosin project began in 2010, when Brian Iglesias and Anton Sattler produced and released an award winning documentary film titled \"Chosin which has screened across the US and South Korea \u2013 and is now available on EPIX, Netflix, Amazon Video, DVD, and iTunes. The material was optioned as the basis for a 100 million dollar 3D Korean War action film that was written by Academy Award winner and WWII Army veteran Frank Pierson. Check out the trailer:  \n*** Click here watch an EPIX exclusive behind the scenes interview with the filmmakers and Chosin veterans.  \nWhen Richard C. Meyer (a 3D animator and former machinegun squad leader in Brian's unit) heard about about the project, he contacted Brian and they decided to produce a graphic novel that focused on the embattled Marines defending Fox Hill.  One look at the anime-style character designs by Tom Jung and we realized that this story would be a natural fit for animation.\nFemale refugee and her brother by Richard C.

Meyer- Co-Director, Writer, Executive Producer, Animator\nAnton Sattler- Producer, Executive Producer\nStephanie Hogue- Animator, Rigger\nHOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK?\nKickstarter is all-or-nothing. We receive funds only if we meet or exceed our goal of $25,000. Your credit card will not be billed until the campaign ends, and only if it is successful. 10% of the total is given to Kickstarter and Amazon Payments as fees for usage of the site and then about 2 weeks later we will receive the rest of the funds.\nThe animated short will be completed and distributed to you by June 2013, but the graphic novels rewards will be distributed as they are completed. Which will be January for \"Chosin- Guts and Hope,\" February for \"Chosin- To The Sea\" and March for \"Chosin- Hold The Line.\"\nAND FINALLY, THANK YOU...\nThe Korean War is known as the forgotten war \u2013 and the primary mission of the Chosin project is to make sure that the sacrifices of these heroes are not lost forever. We are not just asking you to fund an animated film, we are asking you to stand with us, and ensure that their amazing story, their sacrifice, their victory - is not lost. We sincerely appreciate your consideration. Thank you and Semper Fi!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking an independent 3D animated film, even a short, is quite expensive. We have already invested more than $20,000 into this project and the greatest risk is that we will not able to finish the short.\n\nAs for the challenges that we might experience after funding, the greatest challenge is dealing with the inevitable set-backs of production, especially in the digital realm (corrupted files, lost files, wonky rigs, etc). Fortunately, the animation test we have already conducted has been a good \"shake-down cruise\" to help us learn what works in our plan and what needs to be adjusted.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Backer Premiere!", "update_content": "Hope this finds you all well.  It has been a while and I wanted to give you a snapshot of where we are with things.  \nProject:  We have been working tirelessly and are now awaiting animation studio production.  Our biggest delay has been finding a studio to partner with.  Yes, there are a a few handfuls of animation studios for us to talk to - but we had two critical issues: A) They had to be a technical and creative fit, and B)  They would have to really squeeze their staff and budgets to help us out.  The bad news, which we did not anticipate - was that it took a lot of time for us to find the few studios that fit the bill.  The is that we found a great fit.  We are planning on making this information public soon - stay tuned for that.   We have to wait until the fall to start production.  Why the fall?  The studio is going out of their way to work on this - but at the same time, they have to be smart about costs.  They best way to do this is to work on our project while the have other work and additional staff already on hand.  If that is not clear, I am happy to discuss with any of you on the phone, Skype, or Google Hangout.  We will be making some announcements soon and should begin production in about 4 to 6 weeks.

Waking in that disaster, he chose to use his powers to help rebuild his country. Over time he learned that he no longer aged like everyone else.\n     In 2013, he meets the love of his life, Ashley. They get married, but 20 years after the day they met, she passes away from a brain aneurysm. When the story opens, it's Christmas Eve of the year 2099, the anniversary of the day he met Ashley. \n     After over 150 years of life, Solestar knows that today will be his last day alive. He's sensed this day coming for a while. He accepts it, knowing he's lived a long, good life. Still, his compassion for mankind won't allow him to leave the world the way it is. \n      Being the last superhero on Earth, and knowing that some of his villains still exist, waiting for him to die so that they can take over the world, Solestar embarks on his most difficult journey yet- to turn the bad guys good. From villains that control the elements (Boom & Cloud), to giant Godzilla-like monsters, irradiated men (Hotoke), and ending with his greatest enemy of all (Yuu Hasashi), Solestar aims to find the good in all of us, one last time. \n       \"Give more to this world than what you take from it. Endure the bad. Embrace the good. All life is connected, all life is worth saving.\"\n     The story is told in 5 chapters. Chapters 1-4 are 11 pages each and chapter 5 is 20 pages. The rest of the 96 page book features unused art, designs, information on brain aneurysms, and more. Solestar's origin isn't told in this book. The story focuses heavily on his last day on Earth. If this is a success, we'd like to create two more Solestar books, going backwards in his life, creating a reverse trilogy. We start at his death, and end at his rebirth. We'd also like each book to help with a different cause. Help us reach our goal so that can happen.\nPinup Art for the Interiors by Mohamad Lubis\n     We are solely raising money for two things: printing the book and covering the cost of our Kickstarter prizes, such as shirts, prints, wristbands, etc, with more being announced throughout our campaign.\n     Cross Blue Overseas Printing in Chino, CA gave us a great deal on these books. We can now print around 4,000 copies of Solestar, at very high quality. We aim to get this book into as many hands as possible through Diamond Comics Distributors, Inc, and Cross Blue is now allowing us to ship more with their incredible prices. \n     The remaining money after printing the books will help cover the cost of our Kickstarter Prizes so that we are also delivering the best quality in shirts, prints, wristbands, and properly shipping the books as well as the original art we're offering.\n     The reasons printing the most books we can afford is important, is NOT because I want to build a fort with all the boxes in my small apartment, but it serves our end goal. As long as it doesn't conflict with the agreement we made with Kickstarter, I'd like to use the money I make from selling the final books later this year for something selfless- to help other aneurysm victims like myself, and those who have it worse. \n     $11,000 is a very humble and realistic goal for what we want to do. Please help us reach it and allow us to start 2013 off with something positive, and potentially save a few lives.\nArt by Mark Poulton & Dexter Weeks\n     Indy artists, big names, and legends unite in a single comic to tell one of the most personal journeys a superhero has ever gone through. Only on this book can you see a page drawn in pencil by an Indy artist, then inked by a comic book superstar, followed up with colors and letters from two extremely talented people that you may not have heard of. \n     Solestar is a one-of-a-kind comic book experience that will not only deliver beautiful artwork from over 60 different artists, but will hopefully present something new on an emotional level for the reader. With even bigger plans for it after it's distributed, (if granted a successful Kickstarter) Solestar could very well become the first of its kind, using artwork for a cause it's never been used for.\nT-Shirt Design by Ryan Liebowitz of Golden Apple Comics\n     Add your name next to the many talented people coming together on this project. Whether you pencil, ink, color, or letter... we still need help wrapping up the final 4 pages of this book. \n     Get involved with this, potentially, once in a lifetime opportunity.

I'm happy to say that since launching this Kickstarter, we are only searching for around 4 more artists.\n\nI will say that doing these 4 pages, while still getting in the other ones that were due this week, and getting it all print ready by the time our Kickstarter ends may seem impossible, but I've been so pleased and grateful on the talents that have come together this far to keep us on schedule.\n\nWe still email around 10-15 artists a day, discussing and sharing their pages so that other artists have stuff to work off of, and with my horrible memory, it has been hard keeping it all together. Luckily I have two great editors in Gene Hoyle and Richard Caldwell that are limiting how stressful these risks and challenges can be.\n\nWe have Chapters 1-4 nearly completed, and are currently wrapping up Chapter 5, our final chapter in the graphic novel. This leaves our last obstacle of reaching our goal and using that money to print, which hopefully is as easy at it sounds. We want the book print ready by mid January so that it will be ready for its release in Orlando, FL in March for MegaCon 2013.

We are flattered and grateful that you like our show.\nAll that remains is to point you in the direction of a couple of rewards that you, as fans, will appreciate.\nThe CONCERT FILM DVD which is being offered here is an EXCLUSIVE, SPECIAL EDITION version and will only be available via Kickstarter. The DVD will include as many bonus features as we can pack in, such as behind-the-scenes featurettes, podcasts, even original content made possible by this very Kickstarter campaign, the web-series, and MORE. \nThe show itself is scheduled for Fall 2013.

The show itself is a celebration of our Kickstarter campaign and our amazing backers, so attendees will enjoy a full evening of entertainment, an onslaught of TAH swag, free raffles for swag bags from cast members and friends, the works.

Nearly eight years later, we\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to watch TAH grow and evolve into something we never expected. Filling every seat every month at the famous Largo at the Coronet Theater in LA. Sharing our show with the world as a podcast on Chris Hardwick\u2019s Nerdist network. Even producing an entire line of merchandise inspired by the worlds we created. And all for our fans, the most supportive and enthusiastic crowd on Earth. \nCreated by us (TV writers Ben Acker and Ben Blacker), each live performance has featured three genre stories brought to life by The WorkJuice Players, a regular cast of multi-talented actors and comedians such as Paul F. Tompkins (Best Week Ever), Paget Brewster (Criminal Minds), Busy Philipps (Freaks & Geeks), James Urbaniak (Venture Bros), John DiMaggio (Futurama), and a parade of A-list guest stars such as Nathan Fillion, Patton Oswalt, Alison Brie, Jason Ritter, Neil Patrick Harris, Danny Pudi, Ed Helms, Zachary Levi, Chris Hardwick, Andy Richter, Patrick Warburton, Colin Hanks, Dave Foley, Adam Baldwin, Joshua Malina, Joe Mantegna, JK Simmons, and more!\nThis multi-faceted troupe brings to life all manner of characters from an ever-evolving array of recurring worlds and genre backdrops including: \nSparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars: A space western in which a human Marshal protects Mars from robots, aliens and galactic threats with the help of his faithful Martian companion.\nBeyond Belief: Frank and Sadie Doyle are fast-talking married mediums. Although this pair of high-society types would rather enjoy martinis and each other, they usually end up solving paranormal mysteries.\nCaptain Laserbeam: Silly superheroics abound in Apex City, where our high-flying scion of science saves lives from neurotic supervillains.\nJefferson Reid, Ace American: The American Victory Commission's finest agent, his gal, and their kid sidekick stand against the Axis powers in WWII. \nDown in Moonshine Holler: A hobo fairy tale in which a millionaire, after falling in love with the Hobo Princess, renounced his money, became a hobo, and took to the rails to find her. \nAmelia Earhart, Fearless Flyer: Amelia Earhart faked her death to become America's top-secret one-woman airforce. \nTales From the Black Lagoon: Hollywood noir from the Golden age of Tinseltown proves that the facts of the city are much stranger than fiction in the movies it manufactures. \nThe Cross-Time Adventures of Colonel Tick-Tock: A British soldier mends damage to the timeline for her Majesty the Queen. Armed with his trick clock and his sense of duty, Colonel Tick-Tock stands sentry over every century. \nThe USSA Captains' Journals:  The starcrafts of The United Solar System Alliance protect the Solar System from itself and others. Beyond the rim of star-light, wandering in star-flight, their humanity fills the empty void of space. A Sparks Nevada spin-off!\nCactoid Jim, King of the Martian Frontier: Say \"howdy\" to the most earnest do-gooder on the fourth planet! A Sparks Nevada spin-off!\nPlus, in the spirit of old-time radio, each \u201cepisode\u201d features a number of commercials and catchy jingles from fictional show sponsors such as Patriot Brand Cigarettes (\"They're good for your constitution!\") and WorkJuice Coffee (\"Guaranteed to fill you to the brim with vim!\"). \nTHRILLING ADVENTURE HOUR: THE GRAPHIC NOVEL!!! \nThroughout the years, TAH has become the largest and most rewarding part of our creative lives. So as we approach our eight year anniversary, we want to bring TAH to a whole new level. After eight years of listening to THRILLING ADVENTURE HOUR, we want to finally give everyone a chance to see and experience these worlds for themselves in an original graphic novel and (if we hit our target) a series of stretch goals ushering TAH into other media as well!\nWe\u2019re hosting this Kickstarter campaign to finance the production of a really fun graphic novel anthology that recreates the TAH experience in print. The same worlds. The same characters. The same product placement. The anthology will contain a series of short tales set within the various worlds covered throughout the run of the show. We\u2019re writing the script ourselves, and each story will receive a different artist chosen to match the unique tone and personality of each segment.  \nTo give you an idea of the look and feel of the book, take a gander at some TAH-inspired artwork from comic creators around the globe, including Dustin Weaver, Tom Fowler, Dennis Culver, Evan Larson, Andy Hirsch, Natalie Nourigat, Joel Priddy... and one not-as-professional (but just as passionate) illustration from Mark Gagliardi, one of the stars of our show. We're inviting these friends and more from the comics community -- everyone from industry legends Ben Edlund (Creator of The Tick) and Jackson Publick (Creator of The Venture Bros.) to rising stars such as Randy Bishop, Michael DiMotta, Chris Moreno, Doc Shaner, and Jeff Stokely -- into what's sure to become another versatile, all-star team of creative minds bringing our worlds to vivid life!\nBest of all, should we raise enough funds to produce the anthology, Archaia Entertainment, the 2012 and 2011 Eisner Winner for Best Graphic Album New and 2011 Eisner Winner for Best Anthology, has officially committed to print and distribute our anthology nationwide. \nLike most \u201ccreator-owned\u201d graphic novels, the financial responsibility to produce the book itself falls to us. That\u2019s one of the major reasons why Kickstarter has become such an influence on comics and the arts as a whole: we get to retain the rights to our creations. But without a major distributor, the odds are against our book reaching anyone outside of our Kickstarter community. That\u2019s why our anthology's editor and longtime TAH fan Joe LeFavi (contributing writer/editor on Archaia\u2019s hit graphic novel anthology series for FRAGGLE ROCK) facilitated our new publishing partnership with Archaia, a company whose products we love. If we can generate enough support to compensate our creative team and produce the book, every Kickstarter backer will receive a hand-numbered and signed copy from our first print run. If we fall one cent short of our goal, our book will never exist. Yet if we can mobilize our fans and prove that you want to see TAH in print, Archaia has agreed to finance the printing and distribution of our second print run nationwide. So with your support today, we can hopefully entrust our book with an award-winning publisher capable of bringing TAH to fans everywhere.\nBeing completely objective and reasonable here, we intend to produce the best and most beautiful graphic novel in the history of publishing. \nBEYOND THE BOOK: OUR STRETCH GOALS \nIf we are lucky enough to reach our initial funding goal, we want everyone to know that we\u2019re planning to immediately funnel 100% of any additional earnings toward more awesome extensions of TAH in multiple forms of media. Teaming up with Quixotic Transmedia, we\u2019ve lined up a series of exciting stretch goals that expand our horizons in ways we\u2019ve only dreamed. \nFor every stretch goal we reach, we will share a wealth of new and never-before-seen TAH content exclusively with our backers as a special thanks for your support. These include \u201clost\u201d episodes that we\u2019ve never publicly shared, alternate takes of our songs, thanks, and exclusive videos from the cast, guest stars, crew, and fans and friends of the show... tons of really fun and exclusive TAH awesomeness that you won\u2019t be able to find anywhere else! For a taste of what's to come, check out the promo Kickstarter video that we produced starring TV star Jason Ritter and rock god John Roderick... not to mention our alternative (and spontaneous) musical ending!\nIf you're unfamiliar with TAH, check out the following links to learn more: \nA great article on the show in the LA Weekly, \nThe featured podcast on Chris Hardwick\u2019s Nerdist Network,  \nThe Thrilling Adventure Hour website,  \nA comprehensive list of shows on their iTunes podcast page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter eight incredible years sharing Thrilling Adventure Hour with everyone, we're so excited to finally venture into other forms of media and bring you these worlds and characters in ways never before possible.

After nearly ten years of development, the completed production will premiere in Fall 2013 and will be the most incredible Rogue project yet! Note - All donations are tax deductible!\nAfter Walt Disney released the now-famous animated film Pinocchio in 1940, copies of the original book were pulled from shelves and dumbed down versions were released instead, rehashing the simple saccharine story that Disney made. This first major example of revisionism made it nearly impossible to find an unedited version in America for nearly 50 years. Gone were the meat and potatoes of the original story and in its place was a near consequence-less story; a pet fish, a whale, a completely virtuous Blue Fairy and a wisdom-spouting cricket. The Rogues\u2019 PINOCCHIO project will finally shed light on the real story and create an adult-minded retelling of this tale of lust, desire, death, birth, madness and ultimately hope. This is our true passion project. The show will represent a return to form for the ensemble in creating a large-scale work of epic Hyper-theater reminiscent of our past projects like Mr. Punch and Gogol Project.\nSince our inception in 2001 Rogue Artists Ensemble\u2019s work has been seen by nearly 30,000 audience members in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, Seattle and Atlanta. We are at that critical junction where we either go big or go home. We don\u2019t want to go home and need your help to ensure that the Rogues stay around in the years to come! Please read on, find out more and click on the \u201cBACK THIS PROJECT\u201d button to offer your support.\nBetween 1881 and 1883, Italian writer Carlo Collodi penned The Adventures of Pinocchio as a serial for children, but with a knowing wink to adults. Its simple surface lessons urging young boys to behave and go to school belie deeper issues of a free spirit and its place in society. The Adventures of Pinocchio was written when Italy was a newly unified nation and dealing with great economic and social disparities, similar to the America of today. The parallels between the Pinocchio text and our own world are uncanny. Our PINOCCHIO project will be a dark, brooding tale, set in a collapsed Wall Street punk world, creating a modern take on the Great Depression and Dust Bowl mythology. Rogue Artists Ensemble plans to tackle this tale with a keen eye towards the modern relevance of its central message: The great struggle between free spirit and morality, duty and more selfish pursuits.\nRogue Artists Ensemble\u2019s PINOCCHIO will be a visual feast, combining masked and unmasked actors, highly expressive physical performance, dance, interactive sets, multiple puppetry traditions, projected media, sophisticated special effects and illusions. Original music and songs are being composed byRogue Ensemble member Ego Plum who is well known for his award-winning score to Rogue Artists Ensemble\u2019s 2009 original production Gogol Project. Video and Puppet design is being supervised by Brian White who created the incredible puppet designs for Gogol Project. Joining the puppet design team are Greg Ballora, Cristina Bercovitz and Christine Papalexis. Scenic Design will be created by Joel Daavid who last collaborated with the Rogues on the Mr. Punch project. Costume design by Kerry Hennessy, Mask Design by Katie Polebaum, Lighting Design by Haylee Freeman, and Sound Design by John Nobori. Special guest artist Erin Keller is tackling Prop Design. The production will be directed by Rogue Artistic Director Sean Cawelti with a script written by Megan Owings with contributions from many.\nIn preparation for our world-premiere in Fall 2013, we will stage a workshop production this December 8th and 9th in Downtown Los Angeles at LA Mart, culminating in two public sharings in an old ballroom. The workshop will combine puppet, mask and video elements, allowing the ensemble and guest artists to engage in collaboration critical to the success of a project of this nature. The completed production will begin rehearsing in August 2013 with an opening scheduled for the following October. PINOCCHIO is a highly sophisticated adult piece of theater. Never has there been a better match of company to material. We hope you will take a moment to join in supporting the development of PINOCCHIO.\nOur Mission:\nRogue Artists Ensemble is a collective of multi-disciplinary artists who create Hyper-theater, an innovative hybrid of theater traditions, puppetry, mask work, dance, music, and modern technology. Through a collaborative development process, with an emphasis on design and storytelling, the Rogues create original, thought-provoking performances. We cultivate unique audience experiences that appeal to multiple generations of theatergoers in order to expand the boundaries of contemporary American theater.\nHistory:\nSince 2001, Rogue Artists Ensemble has created groundbreaking and genre bending works of live theater driven by collaboration and innovation. Founded by theater designers and artists at UC Irvine, our productions have received numerous awards, critical praise, including the esteemed UNIMA Citation of Excellence from the International Marionette Association, the highest honor in the puppetry community.\nRAE has a strong commitment to community outreach and education led by our all-ages shows, The Story of Frog Belly Rat Bone and Zen Shorts. These shows have toured Southern California including The Geffen Playhouse, Inner City Arts, Skirball Cultural Center, schools throughout California and a three-week run at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. We have also conducted residencies at University of California Irvine Trevor School of the Arts, California State University Northridge, Hawthorne Elementary, and Jordon High School in Long Beach.\nOur 2012 season began in February with our world premiere production of Zen Shorts at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts. A residency and performances of a new commission from the Getty Villa Theater Lab: Songs of Bilitis at the Getty Villa occurred in March. We presented an encore presentation of D is for Dog as part of Hollywood Fringe Festival at the Hudson Main Stage Theater in June. In August, Rogue presented an encore presentation of Zen Shorts for free to the public at the Ivy Substation and partnered with Watts Village Theater for Meet Me @ Metro III.\nMake a tax deductible donation to help create the PINOCCHIO project and support the work of the ensemble.

A little boy, one among many, is taken into Dr. Hans Schmidt's laboratory to be tortured and experimented on as part of the Nazis' search for a new breed of human, a new breed of warrior. What they create they could never have imagined and to their everlasting terror, they will never escape. \nFollow this horrific and suspenseful tale of The Craver - find the truth about the Sons of Aaron - and pray that The Craver isn't coming for you. \nThe story of The Craver was born in the mind of actor, comics enthusiast, and monster fanatic, Blake Clark. He owes the inspiration for this film and comic book to his dreams and to the Universal Monsters. Blake's heart's desire is to make a new monster for this generation in tribute to the Universal Monsters, to share how they captivated his imagination and illustrated the struggles between good and evil. \nThe Craver is a brave new look at history, monsters, good vs evil and how graphic novels are used to present untold horror stories. The Craver is intended to be a film trilogy, but we wanted to create the origin story in the comics and graphic novels, then continue the unique story line in the movies! \nIn order to see our dream realized, we need your help! \nWe have an amazingly talented team lined up for the graphic novel, including Writer: Erik Warfield; Artist: Marc Sandroni ; Producer: Anthony Lipe-Ladenheim and Creator: Blake Clark.

BUT WE'RE NOT DONE!\nWow.\nWe are in complete awe of what just transpired. We knew Caroll's story transcended age, gender, nationality and just about every barrier out there, but to see people rally around this film has been amazing. We're going to make I AM BIG BIRD... and it's all thanks to you.\nWe didn't pick the $100,000 number lightly--as a matter of fact, this film will cost a lot more than that. But we knew that with a minimum $100,000, we could make this film. And now we'll be able to. Thank you.\nSo what next? We know Caroll's story has staying power and it seems like our Kickstarter momentum has just gotten started. Now, we're aiming to break the record number of documentary backers. As we write this, we're at 1426 backers. The record is 6508. It's in our sights. Remember, every pledge--even a dollar--counts towards that goal. We've achieved one milestone--a crucial one--now let's take on the next one.\nWe have 6 days left to reach that hurdle and every pledge past $100,000 means we can make the film that we've envisioned, the film that we've been sharing with you for the last 24 days. Don't stop now, folks. Spread the word. Let's make history together.\nMuch love,\nThe I AM BIG BIRD CREW\nUPDATE 5\nHey folks,\nWell here we are. One week to go. Crunch time. With only 7 days remaining, we are $20,000 from our goal. How are we going to close that gap and surpass our goal with a fury? Why, with your help of course!\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged, awesome. You\u2019re the best. We love you. But we\u2019d also love it if you found it in your heart to do more! You can call a friend and tell them about the film. You can Tweet about it. You can blog about it. Get the story out there!\nAlso, we\u2019ve heard from tons of you that HAVE already pledged that you wanted a t-shirt, which we weren\u2019t offering, or the alternate film poster designed by Caroll himself, which we only offered as part of the $500 package. In our ongoing effort to meet your demands, we\u2019re now offering the official I AM BIG BIRD crew t-shirt for $30 and an unsigned poster designed by Caroll for $60. These are both KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVES. You\u2019ll never get them anywhere else.\nWe know you also wanted the signed 2-disc Blu-Ray special edition, but those packages keep selling out. So, in a last ditch effort to make sure everyone that wants one gets one, we\u2019re now offering a $150 package that has both the signed 2-disc Blu-Ray and the unsigned poster designed by Caroll. It\u2019s a great deal for two Kickstarter Exclusives. This really is the last chance to get the 2-disc Blu-Ray!\nFinally, in an effort to make it more accessible, we\u2019ve SLASHED the cost of tickets to the New York premiere from $5000 to $1100. Again, we\u2019ll never make these available to the public, so if you want to participate in what is sure to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, get your tickets now! Don\u2019t have $1100 but still want a chance to get to the premiere? Head over to YouTube and make a video response telling us what Caroll means to you and you\u2019ll be entered to win two tickets to the premiere\u2014for free!\nIf you haven\u2019t pledged yet, here\u2019s a friendly reminder: you\u2019re running out of time. If we don\u2019t hit our goal, all pledges are forfeited, no one is charged and I AM BIG BIRD won\u2019t get made. And that would mean that all the content we\u2019ve been sharing, like this great clip of Caroll talking about how he met his wife, is going to go back into the Spinney archive, never again to see the light of day. Help us keep bringing this amazing content to the world! Happy pledging!\nMuch love,\nThe I Am Big Bird Crew\nUPDATE 3\nHey everyone!\n\nWe're about to start week 3 of our Kickstarter campaign and things are looking good!  We want you to know we appreciate what you guys have done for us.  We also want you to know that we have heard you!  We know people are really interested in getting the 2-disc Blu-Ray special edition signed by Caroll, but couldn't afford the $350 package it came in.\n\nTo that end, we've made limited quantities (50) of just the 2-disc Blu-Ray available for $99.  This Blu-Ray is going to be chock full of all the archival footage we couldn't get in the film and is a must-have for any Sesame Street or Muppet fan!  We can't stress enough that this is a KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE.  This special edition will never be available anywhere else.  Ever.  Get it?  If you've already pledged, you can simply increase your pledge and opt for this special edition.\n\nFinally, in this week's clip, OK Go, rock band extraordinaire, tell you why they support our Kickstarter campaign!\n\nMuch love,\n\nThe I AM BIG BIRD Crew\nUPDATE 2\nHi everyone!\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep this update short, but we just wanted to thank you. A quarter of the way through our campaign, we\u2019re almost at 37% of our goal\u2014that makes us feel pretty great!\n\nThe response from Caroll's fans has been incredible. This outpouring of support is why we turned to Kickstarter in the first place.  It lets us interact with fans on a whole new level.  With Kickstarter, we're not tied to making the movie that an investor demands of us, rather we are free to make a film that honors Caroll's work and is true to who he is.  In essence, Kickstarter lets us make the movie the fans want to see--and as fans ourselves, that is crucial to us.\n\nYou\u2019ve already done so much by pledging and we can\u2019t thank you enough.  But since you\u2019ve pledged, you obviously want to see this movie get made.  How can you help us do that? Tell your friends and family about the project.   Blog about it.  Tweet about it. Post flyers in the subway about it (not really, that might be illegal).\n\nThis campaign is only going to succeed if people know about I AM BIG BIRD so anything you can do to spread the word about the film is crucial.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll do our part too.   Do you have a blog and want to do a piece on the film?  Contact us and we\u2019ll either do an interview or provide you with content to use there (we\u2019ll also then share that blog and hopefully get you more traffic).  No outlet is too big or too small!  We\u2019ll help however we can!\n\nFinally, to celebrate our one week Kickstarter anniversary, here\u2019s another clip from the film in which Caroll rehearses for a Christmas special with Michael Bubl\u00e9.  We think you'll agree that it\u2019s pretty charming. Enjoy!\n\nMuch love,\n\nThe I AM BIG BIRD Crew\nUPDATE 1\nHi everyone!\n\nWhen we first started this Kickstarter campaign, we thought we might post an update a day; however, since we started releasing photos and videos from Caroll's archive, we have been bombarded by emails from people telling us how Caroll impacted their lives.  Responding to each one personally takes time and is very important to us because your support and kind words mean the world to us.\n\nIt's simply amazing.  Many people have told us that they didn't know who Caroll was.  It's not that they were indifferent.  They, like us, had just always thought of Big Bird and Oscar not as puppets, but as beings. They just existed.  It seems like as people have gotten to know Caroll, even in the brief clips we've released, they've realized that the man behind the Bird is the man that makes the Bird.  In other words, Caroll is a remarkable person who deserves to be recognized for shaping generations of people.\n\nWe've had some early success in this campaign--and it's too early to say whether or not that will continue--and we believe that's all due to who Caroll is.  As we've said to countless people, he's exactly what you'd want the man inside Big Bird to be.  We hope that you take the time to get to know Caroll through the photos and videos we'll be releasing here and on Twitter over the next few weeks.  We also encourage you to visit our production journal to catch up on any photos or videos you might have missed.  We think you'll be glad you did, and we hope it moves you to pledge to help us tell Caroll's story to the world.\n\nFinally, we've updated this page with a wonderful video of Caroll talking about how he met Jim Henson. The video features some touching moments from Jim, which came during the celebration of the 15 year anniversary of Sesame Street, which Jim chose to hold in honor of Caroll.  It's the sort of rare video that Caroll has tucked away in his archive that he's chosen to share with us so the world can get to know him a little bit better.  We hope you enjoy it as much as we have.\n\nThanks for reading, and please keep spreading the word.\n\nMuch Love,\nThe I AM BIG BIRD Crew\nAbout I AM BIG BIRD\nI AM BIG BIRD is a feature-length documentary about Caroll Spinney, who has been Sesame Street\u2019s Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch since 1969\u2026 and at 78 years old, he has no intention of stopping. \nThink you know everything there is to know about Sesame Street?  You don\u2019t.  You might know that Frank Oz turned down an offer to play Big Bird, but you probably don\u2019t know that until a last minute change of heart by NASA, Big Bird was supposed to go to space aboard the Challenger.  Or you may know that Oscar the Grouch got his voice from a cantankerous cabbie, but you\u2019d be surprised to learn that a fire in his trash can almost led to Caroll\u2019s untimely demise. \nCaroll\u2019s stories are the stuff of legend.  He has been a constant presence in our lives for over 40 years, his path weaving through American history like that of Forrest Gump.  His time inside the Bird has taught him about the world and about himself.  I AM BIG BIRD will peel away the instances in his life that inspired his creation of characters that have influenced generations of children. And, as the yellow feathers give way to grey hair, it is the man, not the Muppet, who will steal your heart. \nWhat You'll See\nIn addition to compelling interviews with Caroll and his luminary cronies, I AM BIG BIRD will feature fascinating material from Caroll\u2019s personal archives.  Among the treasures in the Spinney vault, we\u2019ve found\u2026\n\u2026never-before-seen footage capturing unscripted moments of Caroll with giants like Jim Henson, Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson. \n\u2026Caroll\u2019s short films, in which he showcases his skill in animation, a talent which led to a job offer at Disney\u2026 which Caroll turned down.\n\u2026Thousands of snapshots and hundreds of hours of videos that capture his undying love for his wife.\n\u2026Art displaying his hidden passion for illustration.\n\u2026Puppets that were lovingly crafted by Caroll\u2019s mother over 70 years ago and that he still uses today. \nWe\u2019re using these amazing artifacts to create a dynamic portrait of an unknown man whose characters have had unrivaled influence in American pop culture. \nWhy You'll Love It\nYou haven\u2019t outgrown Sesame Street.  Maybe it won\u2019t be the opening strains of the theme song that brings memories rushing in, but at some point during I AM BIG BIRD, a skit, a line or a character will bring you back. I AM BIG BIRD won\u2019t just give you a chance to relive these moments, it will let you see them through Caroll\u2019s eyes.  And when it finally becomes clear that Caroll doesn\u2019t just operate Big Bird and Oscar, he gives him their souls, you\u2019ll realize just how much impact the faceless puppeteer has had on your life. \nYou know his characters. Isn\u2019t it time to get to know Caroll? \nWhy We Need the Dough\nWe made it through pre-production and now we\u2019re facing the two costliest parts of making a film: production and post-production.  The money we are aiming to raise on Kickstarter is targeted for three very specific areas: \n-Production Travel\u2014Caroll has spent his career criss-crossing the globe; in order to truly feel his impact, we\u2019ll need to retrace some of those steps\u2014and that doesn\u2019t come cheap! \n-Rights/Licensing/Clearances\u2014The costs associated with licensing Big Bird, Oscar or Caroll\u2019s appearances on programs outside of Sesame Street can be astronomical.  Unfortunately, many of these sorts of cameos are integral to the film. \n-Production Crew\u2014in order to assure that we give Caroll\u2019s story the treatment it deserves, we need to make sure we have the best people at each position.  We have a solid network of freelancers, but those freelancers need to get paid!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "That's All, Folks!", "update_content": "Hi out there in Kickstarter Land!\nHere's hoping you're recovering from Thanksgiving and are fully into your Cyber Monday shopping spree!\nAt this point, you should have either received your Kickstarter rewards from us OR received an email from us saying that we don't have your mailing address on file."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Rewards Update: DVD & Blu-Ray", "update_content": "Hey out there in Kickstarter Land! \nThe moment is here: we are THRILLED to announce that I AM BIG BIRD is going to be released beginning this May.

Meyer, who served in the same unit as Martinez and who was present during the battle, this is the first comic book produced by Iraq War veterans about the war itself.\nWHY ARE WE DOING THIS?\nShortly after the battle, when my friends who had been in the thick of the fight told me of the heroics of Martinez, Tardif and the others, I was shocked, astounded and deeply proud to be in the company of these Marines. When I returned to the States after finishing my deployment to Iraq, I was equally shocked and astounded that no one had heard of the incredible bravery exhibited that day. To the rest of the world, it was as if that battle simply never happened.\nBut bravery matters. Loyalty matters. Tales like this should not be forgotten. So I am determined that as many people as possible know this story. To that end, we will attempt to get these book placed in schools, libraries, and museums (a copy of the original black-and-white version of NEBP is archived at the Marine Corps Museum). Additionally, we will sell them online and in bookstores.\nThe plan for this Kickstarter campaign is to fund a digitally-colored and expanded version of this story to publish in time for the tenth anniversary of the battle which occured on April 12, 2003.\nOriginally released in black-and-white in 2008, No Enemy, But Peace received rave reviews which can be seen here:\nhttp://www.marinecorpstimes.com/entertainment/books/lifelines_comic_book_010509OD/\nhttp://www.aintitcool.com/node/39569\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19467\nhttp://www.newsarama.com/comics/120829-Best-Shots.html\nhttp://www.comicon.com/new/ubb/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=535529\nThis new version of NEBP will include 6 new pages of art by original artist Martin Montiel Luna. 3 of those pages will replace the 3 pages that were drawn by me so that now the entire book will be drawn by the same artist. Below is an example of one of my pages that Martin will be re-drawing.\nHere is an excerpt from the official citation for Martinez' heroics:\nFor extraordinary heroism while serving as 1st Fire Team Leader, 2nd Squad, 1st Platoon, Company G, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM on 12 April 2003. Responding to a call to reinforce his Platoon that was ambushed, Corporal Martinez effectively deployed his team under fire in supporting positions for a squad assault. After his squad leader was wounded, he took control and led the assault through a tree line where the ambush originated. As his squad advanced to secure successive enemy positions, it received sustained small arms fire from a nearby building. Enduring intense enemy fire and without regard for his own personal safety, Corporal Martinez launched a captured enemy rocket propelled grenade into the building temporarily silencing the enemy and allowing a wounded Marine to be evacuated and receive medical treatment. After receiving additional fire, he single-handedly assaulted the building and killed four enemy soldiers with a grenade and his rifle. By his outstanding display of decisive leadership, unlimited courage in the face of heavy enemy fire, and utmost devotion to duty, Corporal Martinez reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\nThank you for taking the time to peruse this Kickstarter page. If you are interested in donating to this worthy project, I thank you. \nThe original pages have already been paid for, so we are using this Kickstarter campaign to fund an additional 6 pages of art as well as digitally coloring the entire book. The financial breakdown is as follows:\n$900 for 6 pages of original art\n$120 for 6 pages of lettering\n$2100 for a colorist to digitally color 26 interior pages plus the cover\n$280 for pre-press costs\nThis comes to $3400. We added another $200 to cover the fees related to using this site and processing payments.\nIf we receive funds in excess of our goal, they would be used in the following order:\n1. Commission an artist to digitally paint a brand-new cover\n2. Pay for printing\n3.

While I admit that I was dissociated, I cannot in good faith refer to the condition I was in as simply 'dissociated' as it was much more than that. I've received opinions on the matter from several psychologists who specialize in both areas. I'm also noting the opinions of literary agents and marketing professionals. If 'blackout' is not decided as the appropriate term for my book (even if that was technically the condition), then there is a possibility that the term 'blackout' will be substituted with 'dissociation' or a more detailed description of 'dissociation subsequent to a prolonged blackout' to make the book more suitable for a public release. Same title, same content, different term. In my opinion, 'blackout' is the more accurate and compatible term. However, I do acknowledge that 'blackout' may not be the most appropriate term to use in my book. Clinically speaking, dissociation may be the more appropriate term for a book release. Either way, neither terms will be used much in my book (story). \nWhen I was 15-years-old, a tremendous level of fear and extreme personal conflict led me to blackout for almost 10 years. Blackout is a type of defense mechanism, such as denial or dissociation, to block out, cope with, or deflect fear, trauma, injury, or conflict. When I came out of it, I was a 25-year-old kid.\n\u25a0 I went six years without having a conversation (in person or on the phone).\n\u25a0 At 25-years-old, I had never driven a car or had a driver's license (I was 26 the first time I drove a car).\n\u25a0 I've never been with a woman (I've never had sex). I'm now celibate.\n\u25a0 During the 10-year blackout, I had become so lost in the dark that I had to speak in different voice pitches as a way of finding which voice was my real voice. I had lost my identity to the blackout \u2014 really lost it.\n\u25a0 I was so far from reality that my mind and body was unable to continue maturing into adulthood. Consequently, I was not able to grow hair on my face until I was 25-years-old.\n\u25a0 The main muscles in my body began to regularly spasm (twitch) from the lack of normal amounts of exercise and possibly from the stress/fear caused by isolation.\n\u25a0 I went seven years without working a job. I was broke, hurt, and in need of money but too afraid to work. Getting a job meant that I would have to be around people and talk to others. At the time, my self-image was distorted and my self-esteem had reached such a low point that I would cover my face in public. In the summer, I would wear 3 to 4 shirts and pants in 98 degree weather to hide my bones. I was afraid to smile or speak. More than anything, I was blacked out and could not consciously recognize that I was unemployed. The thought of a job crossed my mind, from what I can remember, only a few times during those 7 of the 10 years (I was employed until age 17). If I would have came out of the blackout sooner, then I imagine that I would have been able to consciously recognize that I was unemployed, hurt, and needed to rehabilitate from my injuries.\n\u25a0 I went eight years without being in a relationship, and six years without speaking to someone of the opposite sex.\n\u25a0 I was in complete isolation from the world, people, and even myself for more than seven of the almost 10 years.\n\u25a0 The isolation caused anxiety, fear, and insecurity that added to the constant disconnect, mental block, denial, and blackout (isolation can cause fears and insecurities to manifest and intensify).\n\n\u25a0 Most of what happened will not be listed or written as you see above.\nLuckily, I blocked out and denied most of what could hurt me.\nI fought, and I won!!!!!!\nWhen I finally came out of the blackout, I used my eyes for the first time, breathed for the first time, and lived for the first time. The experience was amazing. \n\nThe book\n\u25a0 Mainstream compatible (I used to code and design computer software from age 13 to almost 15 with the goal of my creative ideas one day going 'mainstream'). Comedy, the tragedy, and the drama are all included in my book. I have the childhood that led into the blackout, the psychological susceptibility to blackout (I was still a kid at the time - children are much more likely to block out negative experiences than adults), the spark and flare, and the somewhat happy ending with all of the Hollywood special effects.\n\u25a0 The writing process for What Happened? Who Am I? is planned for three months at a log cabin. It's not one of the cabins that are customized for writers (\"Writers cabin\") but would be fine for this project.\n\nThe first\n\u25a0 A blackout can last hours, weeks, months, and sometimes years. Some people blackout their whole childhood. Not many people go too deep to come out of it, though. With most people, I imagine that something or someone is always there to bring them out of it over time. Work, family, friends, events, wife, children, a relationship, or other elements are/were probably there to snap them out of it or slowly bring them back.\n\u25a0 I remained isolated in a room with none of the things listed above, so I stayed in a constant state of blackout, dissociation, denial, and mental block.\n\nDetails\n\u25a0 Due to my blackout, I was one of the few American born 25-year-old US citizens who had never driven a car in my generation \u2014 in the whole country. I never had a license either. That's of course not counting those who are/were in jail, handicapped, mentally unstable, live near subways, or suffering from a disease or disorder. The majority of (not all) American born citizens in my generation have driven a car before the age of 25.\nI was too far gone to be able to consciously recognize that I needed to get a car. Years after I turned 16, I was too deep into the blackout to notice that I was 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 years old and had never driven a car. I never thought about it.\n\nIf I had never been so far gone, I would have re-entered life much sooner. There would have been that moment of realization where I consciously thought to myself \"......wait a minute......I'm 23-years-old and have never driven a car!!! What am I doing? What Happened? WHO AM I???\"\n\n\u25a0 I stopped maturing for almost 10 years. After age 15 I was unable to continue maturing into adulthood. The condition I was in had mentally and physically delayed my growth into an adult male.\n* The cause of my late growth and development was not inherited or drug induced, a nutrition issue, or fluke. I was not suffering from a disease or disorder, low testosterone levels, or genetic problems.\nWhat Happened? Who Am I?\nTitle subject to change. I chose this title because \"What happened?\" and \"Who am I? were two of the first thoughts that circled in my mind when I came out of the blackout.\n* The cover graphic may be edited later.\nWhat Happened? Who Am I? will be artistically written with the time and care of a true masterpiece. The book will contain the unimaginable and moving account of blackout, denial, mental block, and the true loss of identity during years of isolation. The opening content explains my character and nature that leads into the main content of what happened before, during, and after the blackout. There won't be much dialogue in the book, because there was no conversation during most of What Happened. There will, however, be a vast ocean of emotion and depth. Some vulgar language.\n\nWhy the cabin?\nThere are plenty of places with monthly residency specifically for authors to rent for writing, but it's cheaper if I just rent a small cabin like many other authors out there.\nThis book is my work of art, my masterpiece. There is personal meaning attached to this project that goes beyond the purpose of sharing my story.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this book needs to be written professionally with the proper workspace and adequate time. The story needs to be told in a way that allows me to apply myself without limitation. To do that, I need the cabin. \nIf this project funds, then I'll have the necessary tools for the proper writing process that the book deserves. For me, for the readers, and for the world!\n\u25a0 The cabin will enable me to put everything that I have into the writing process. Having the ability to apply constant focus and have full concentration on my work will unquestionably result in a better final product.\n\n\u25a0 The book won't come out the same without being able to work 9, 10, 11, 12 hours each day on the writing. I'm sure you can imagine the difference between writing two hours each day in a noisy environment with constant interruptions Vs. writing 9 to 10 hours each day in a quiet environment with a clear head that is constantly focused on the project \u2014 better writing, better content, deeper focus, higher quality work, more time, more details, the list goes on.\n\n\u25a0 Being tucked away in the woods can bring out powerful emotions. The environment of the cabin will make it possible to connect with my emotions on a deeper level and then apply those emotions in the book.\n\u25a0 Writing in the cabin will allow me to express What Happened in a way that is much different from what is possible under my current conditions.\n\n\u25a0 Being surrounded by nature in the forest is vital to the writing process of my book because of the content. This is a book about blackout, loss of identity, and isolation. Also, as a young boy I lived next to a large forest area that I would often play at for hours. See the connection there?\n\u25a0 To create a work environment that is fit for the project (and to simulate past experiences). I can't work under my current conditions.\n\u25a0 I don't have the luxury of time. In the cabin I can do in three months what would normally take a year.\n\u25a0 Many others.\n\n\n\nThe cabin kills a hundred birds with one log.\nThe cabin\nI'm planning to stay at one of the cheapest cabins available. 1 bedroom, small, and located in a wooded area miles from the city. The stay is planned for three months, which is a sufficient amount of time to complete the rough draft. I'll then break for a month to prepare for revisions and final copy.\n\nThe money\nThe money will be used to help pay the cost of the cabin, supplies, and food.\nAdvertising and promotion will be paid out of the book sales, if any, and my pocket.\nI have to pay for a skilled editor, web work, better cover work, publishing, and a bunch of other stuff too.\n\nAny amount raised past the goal will go towards a professional editing service to edit the rough draft and final copy, upgrades for the project (better supplies), upgrades for the book and book site, extra time to write if needed, printed copies for business and hot chicks, and promotion.\n\nThe Work\n250-275 pages in 90 days. No picnic. I'll be writing around the clock and only working the rough draft (except for chapter 1). The final copy will be worked on when I return from the cabin.\nWriting this book is going to be a difficult but passionate venture. There is no room for error. The content has to remain relevant for decades. This is my heart and soul. My blood, sweat, and tears will be put into writing this book.\nNothing too extreme, of course. I stay in my lane.\n\n\nThe goal\nI'm writing this book to share my story, relate to those who faced a similar struggle, handle business, and for many personal reasons. What Happened? Who Am I? will be listed on some well-known sites. Amazon, for example.\nThe Impact\nWhat Happened? Who Am I? will give hope to the lost. This is a story of struggle and self-discovery that is the first of its kind, yet relates to so many people out there. Above all, this book should entertain, interest, inspire, and touch the hearts of thousands of readers.\nBlackout\nThe cause of the blackout and what blackout is can be found on Updates at the top.\nThis is a photo of me before the blackout at 15-years-old.

As it\u2019s grown, it\u2019s gone from mostly short one-liners to longer strips to full-blown stories. As a result, I\u2019ve had a lot of people request that I write a book.\n\nSince I was about 12, it\u2019s been a dream of mine to write an adventure game like the old Lone Wolf books by Joe Dever. Thanks to some encouragement from my publishers at Breadpig, I finally did it. \u201cTrial of the Clone\u201d is a comedy science fiction story set in the future. Think Douglas Adams, but meaner. It\u2019s taken a lot of time to build many different tracks for players to take, and I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\nThe book will also have over 20 illustrations by the amazing Chris Jones, some of which we\u2019ll be showing off here.\n\nOur initial goal ($15,000) is listed in the upper right. That\u2019s enough to cover a lot of the printing costs and shipping. If we don\u2019t reach that goal, you don\u2019t pay anything. If we exceed that goal, you may get other things beyond the stuff you've been promised!\n\nWhat Stuff?!\n\nWe have a number of levels at which you can contribute, all of which are commensurate with what it costs to make the product. In addition to the regular paperback, we\u2019re also working on an eBook version and a limited run of a hardcover version as well. This book is destined to change history, so having a hardcover is really a good investment.\n\nWe\u2019ll also have signed postcards and posters at various levels. The poster will be a complete flowchart of the entire story!\n\nIf you\u2019re a distributor or just have a lot of friends who are dorks, we also have levels at which you can get a discount for buying a whole bunch of books.\n\nBonus Levels\n\nIf we somehow reach $50,000, we will find some geek celebrity badass to do an audiobook, which will be sent for free as a bonus to anyone who gave $75 or more.\nIf we go way beyond our goal, there will be some additional offerings! If we reach $100,000, I will immediately start work on a sequel to be released in another Kickstarter this time next year. This book has been a lot of work, but if you geeks are that interested in my dirty jokes and stories, I\u2019d be honored to do another.\n\nAlso, as a de facto bonus, if we sell more than a few thousand signed copies, my hand will shrivel up and fall off. If that happens, I\u2019ll take pictures as the source of everything good in my life slowly melts away.\n\nIf I\u2019ve Never Heard of Zach Weiner or SMBC, Why Should I Be Interested?\n\nBecause you like jokes and adventure stories, and being able to choose your own path in those adventure stories!\n\nThis book is the tale of a clone who finds out he\u2019s chosen for greatness. In a path-of-the-hero adventure, he conquers over and over in the service of his country, only to meet... a twist ending.\n\nSo, if you like high fantasy and low humor, you\u2019ll like this book. \nIf you don\u2019t know my comics, you can check them out at http://www.smbc-comics.com/\n\nHere are some of reddit\u2019s favorites: http://www.reddit.com/domain/smbc-comics.com/top/\n\nI also teach Calculus, Physics, and a little Discrete Math for free on my blog here: http://www.theweinerworks.com/.\n\nMy wife and I do a podcast on science at http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/\n\nI wrote jokes for a kids\u2019 comic called Snowflakes here: http://www.snowflakescomic.com/\n\nI write and occasionally act in skits here: http://www.smbc-theater.com/\n\nIf my name sounds vaguely familiar, but you can\u2019t place it, and you\u2019re not thinking of Anthony Weiner, you might have heard of this little exploit I once had: http://www.theweinerworks.com/?p=344\n\nSo, as you can see, I\u2019ve been doing stupid things on the Internet for a long time, and most of it has been given away for free! By buying this book and other products like it, you help buy me the time to keep doing fun geeky projects, and you help me to build this new world.\n\nPS: If you happen to be Czech, nearly all the proper names in the book are dirty words in Czech. So, you should definitely buy it. \nOn a Personal Note\n\nA lot of people have helped me realize my dream of being a cartoonist over the years. I\u2019ve been one of the lucky few able to live that life, and I\u2019ve tried my best to give back to the people who support me.\n\nMany of my readers have asked me to get into prose writing over the years, and this is my first stab at it. I\u2019d like to do a lot more of it, but it\u2019s only possible with the help of all you gals and guys out there. So, please help me embark on a new phase in my career, and get some cool stuff in return!

Awesome equation.\" - Greg Rucka (Queen & Country)\nClick here to get your FREE 40-PAGE PREVIEW of the book\nHey, everybody, Micah Wright here, creator of the popular Wildstorm Comics series Stormwatch: Team Achilles.  A few years ago I had an idea for an original graphic novel set in World War II on the American homefront--a story devoid of mutant powers, spandex bodysuits, all-powerful religious artifacts, or talking gorillas.  My writing partner, Jay Lender (writer and director of animated hits SpongeBob SquarePants and Phineas and Ferb), and I crafted a thrilling action story with a heart and soul... because Duster isn\u2019t only about planes and Nazis, but also about forging the post-war American woman who can have a job, raise a family and make her own way in the world without any man\u2019s permission.  It\u2019s the story of a fundamental change in American life, illustrated through blood-and-guts action!\nOnce we had a script, we began looking for artists who could help us envision this world in a way that\u2019s appropriate to the time period--not an idealized or stylized 1940s, but a well-researched, lived-in world.  What we needed were artists who could draw realistic flesh and blood characters--women who were interesting not because of the size of their bustline, but because of who they are inside. Everyday men you can identify with, not superheroes. Villains who are complex and nuanced, even if they are Nazis. We found a perfect match in Jok Coglitore (rough layouts) and Cristian Mallea (pencils & inks). \nThese incredible talents have carried us halfway through the 215 page length of the book with amazing results, as you can see in the pictures scattered around this page and at the Duster Graphic Novel Facebook Page. Jay is obsessive about how much he hates computer-drawn speech balloons, so he\u2019s drawn every speech balloon in this book by hand before lettering them. Similarly, he\u2019s also hand-drawn all of our sound effects.\nThe results have been fantastic!  We love it.  We've shown what we've completed to some of our friends in the comics industry and they love it, too.  We were thrilled recently when Howard Chaykin illustrated a cover for us.  We've also secured cover commitments from John McCrea (Hitman, The Boys), and Charlie Adlard, award-winning artist of THE WALKING DEAD!\nWe're currently on page 131. Our goal is to use Kickstarter to complete Duster and to produce a beautiful 215 page full-color book. We need the money to pay our artists, the colorists, and the printer who's going to print and bind your personal copy of this book. Your support will keep our artists on the job for victory!\nWhat's In It For You?\nWell, for starters... there's the book! At 215 pages, it's hardbound and twice as long as the average paperback graphic novel (which typically costs $20). The book will feature excellent quality paper to show off the artwork, and will run 240 pages with all of the bonus materials we're stuffing into the appendix; extra short stories, concept art, and anything else we think of. This edition is exclusively for our Kickstarter supporters! After that, we don't know what our publication future will be. Supporters, this may be the ONLY way you can EVER get a physical copy of the book!\nUPDATE: The Shirt!\nHere's a rough design of what your Duster T-Shirt is going to look like:\nDuster T-Shirt Mockup (Not Final)\nSO HOW CAN YOU HELP DUSTER COME TO LIFE?\n1. PLEDGE\nOur initial fundraising goal represents the cost of producing all the artwork and coloring.  Money beyond that will go toward printing, handling and shipping.  Once that\u2019s paid for, Jay and I may--truth be told--treat ourselves to a nice dinner.\nAs thanks for your generosity, we are offering a variety of exciting PLEDGE REWARDS, just like we\u2019re PBS or something. They include signed copies of the graphic novel, digital copies of the book, t-shirts, amazing prints, options for contributors to be drawn into the book (and receive an original sketch of their character)... and ONE lucky random Kickstarter contributor will win a page of original art! If you've ever been to Comic-Con, you'll appreciate what an amazing reward this is, and EVERY contributor will be entered in the drawing, regardless of the amount they pledge.\n2. SHARE\nWe need more than just your dollars; we need your voice.  Help us get the word out.  We beg you.  Post a link to this Kickstarter project on Facebook. Go and \"Like\" the Duster Facebook page. Tweet about the project using hashtag #DusterOGN.  Then tweet about Duster again.  Make your mom tweet about Duster.  Google+ Duster!  People use Google+, right?  Start an annoying email chain letter about Duster.  Walk around downtown with a sandwich board sign promoting Duster.  Scream about Duster from the clock tower of your local college, then mention Duster to the news reporters as you do the perp walk to the paddywagon.  Help us make this happen.\nKickstarter is providing us with an amazing opportunity, and we thank you, the Kickstarter community, for your time and consideration. We truly believe in the entire concept of Kickstarter, so we'd like to commit to something extra by participating in the KICKING IT FORWARD project.  We pledge to spend 5% of all the money we raise above our initial funding request for this book on helping other artists\u2019 dream projects come true here on Kickstarter.\nSo there you have it, that\u2019s our pitch. Drop us a line--we\u2019d love to hear from you.  We\u2019ll be sure to post updates as the project moves forward!\nThank you very much,\nMicah, Jay, Jok, and Cristian\nIn case you missed it above, CLICK HERE to get your FREE PREVIEW! \nView the PDF right in your browser or download to the device of your choice!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "For Those Who Missed Out", "update_content": "Hello!

Pledge $500 or more to be involved in the process and get a book credit, plus your own dedication!**\nWhere does poop come from and what happens to it when we flush it down the pipes? Most kids don't know the answers to these questions, and yet the topic fascinates them. It's a perfect teachable moment, an opportunity to get kids excited about science, and most parents miss out on it because, well, there aren't many good resources to teach kids about this stuff.\nThat's why we are so excited about All About Poop! (Here is a sneak peek of the whole book!)\nYes, it's a book about poop, but it's NOT your typical book about the fact that we all poop, nor is it a book about going to the potty. All About Poop is a fun, yet educational children's book (grades K-3) that teaches kids about the digestive system and what happens to poop when we flush it down the pipes.\nWhat's even better: we have partnered with Jason Lindsey, a.k.a \"Mr. Science,\" and the founder of Hooked on Science, to design a teacher and parent guide that will expand upon the concepts discussed in All About Poop and will include really cool experiments about the digestive system and poop!\nSo Why do we need your help?\nPinwheel Books is a small, independent and very passionate publishing house for children's books. We've been around a little bit over a year and have published two books on a relatively small scale (local bookstores, some online outlets and Amazon). But for our next project, we want to go BIG. It won\u2019t be easy, since we have to compete with big publishing houses with deep marketing pockets.\nAs you probably know, publishing costs a lot of money--it's thousands of dollars in printing and distribution costs. Pinwheel Books is not some big, powerful publisher: it's a tiny publishing house working tirelessly with a very tight budget to make books come to life. \nWe want to make sure that parents and teachers all over the country hear about this fantastic book that turns the science of digestion and poop into a fun learning experience. But with our current budget, it's a big stretch for us to do the kind of marketing campaign we think this book deserves. We are working with a publicity firm in NY which will be helping us with our media outreach--they'll help us pitch the big newspapers and magazines, and hopefully they'll get us some pretty awesome radio interviews, so we can spread the word about this magical book. But all of this is going to be very costly for Pinwheel Books: over $14,000!\nWe are coming to you in hopes that we can raise half of that money--$7000--via Kickstarter. If we are able to raise this amount, it will make a huge difference to Pinwheel. First, we'll be able to allocate more of our current budget to our upcoming projects, which are equally deserving (visit our web site to learn about our next book, Dylan's Day). With your help, we won't have to put all of our eggs in one basket! And if we raise more than our goal, it will help us cover some of the costs of printing the book and hopefully help us finance a book tour.\nWho Are We? (Or, How Do I Know You're Serious About This?)\nPinwheel Books was founded by Sylvia Pag\u00e1n Westphal, an award-winning journalist and mom of five kids who realized how rewarding, yet difficult, it was to get a book published. Sylvia\u2019s right hand (and illustrator extraordinaire, queen animatrix, blog maven, and so much more) is Nicole Gsell, a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design. Together, Sylvia and Nicole work hard to further Pinwheel\u2019s MISSION: to find undiscovered, talented authors and illustrators and give them a chance to get their first book out.\nThe book was written by mom blogger Kate Hayes, and it was masterfully illustrated by artist Brenna Vaughan. This is their first children's book. \nHere are some snapshots:\nAnd we are already hard at work developing the All About Poop animated app, which we can't wait to share with our supporters when the book launches in September.

Purchasing quality products - or even knowing where those products come from - is a time consuming task. So we've married technology and convenience with the old fashioned (and best) way to purchase your goods: straight from the farmers or producers themselves. \nThink of REAL FORK as a hybrid of a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture ) and a specialty market, except better. You get to choose all of the products you want to receive. There\u2019s nothing you won\u2019t like, or too much of one thing. Better yet, you won\u2019t fight crowds or wait in long lines. \nSimply order online and your groceries are waiting with your name on them at a convenient pick up refrigerator located in your neighborhood. \nIn addition to selling groceries, we also want to tell the story of the farmers and producers we source from and how we choose the products we sell through a series of stories and videos that explain why they are better.\nSee, we have arrived at a real fork in the road with regards to our entire food system. One road will allow us to build a resilient local food economy that supports farmers, ranchers and fishermen who bring amazing products to market and are true stewards of the land. The other road leads to our continued dependence on centralized, massively polluting industrial farming operations.\nWe want to make it easy to choose the right path!\nLet\u2019s start with some screen shots of the first project we're working on, \u201cThe State of the Egg\u201d\nWe all love eggs. And there's good reason to: eggs contain the highest quality food protein known, and are the standard by which all other proteins are judged. In fact, eggs are second only to mother's milk for human nutrition.    \nBut in an attempt to efficiently supply us with all those eggs we love, farmers have resorted to all sorts of inhumane and ill advised farming practices - namely battery cages. 90% of US eggs come from hens raised in these terrible conditions. In a battery cage, a hen has less space available to it than the size of an A4 sheet of paper! \nUnfortunately, chickens that are raised in unhealthy and unsafe conditions lay eggs that are unhealthy and unsafe in nutrition. Not only do these eggs contain far less nutrients than their healthy counterparts, they can also contain harmful chemicals like antibiotics, hormones, and arsenic!\nLuckily, consumers have caught on to these practices, and have demanded a response. That's why there are so many types of eggs out there: from ''vegetarian fed\", to 'cage free', to \u02bbnatural\u02bc, to \u02bborganic\u02bc. The problem is that it seems like every month there is a new 'type' of egg out there, and it's impossible to keep up with what these names actually mean. So what's a person to do?\nWell, that's where REAL FORK comes in. REAL FORK works tirelessly to find the healthiest and tastiest food (like pasture raised eggs) on the market, and ships it directly to you. You can think of them as curators, but instead of hand-picking artwork for a museum, we're hand-picking food for your home!\nAt REAL FORK, we are making the road to delicious local products an easy one by building a vibrant online marketplace to showcase the 'best of the best' in local, sustainable and artisan food. Living in the Bay Area, we are blessed with an abundance of amazing farmers, ranchers and chefs. We're gathering our favorite products and recipes directly from the people that produce them and have created a platform that makes them easy to purchase.  \nWe launched Realfork.com two months ago to a select group of friends, family & neighbors. The response has been overwhelmingly positive! \nNow we\u2019re ready to provide all of you wonderful people convenient access to our marketplace of farmer\u2019s market fresh items and artisan producers like these:\nWith these funds, REAL FORK will have 3-5 pick up spots available by the end of June. Our goal is to have a dozen convenient locations in every neighborhood by the end of the summer. We\u2019d love nothing more than to offer our service in the East Bay and Peninsula by the end of the year!\nWe want to deliver all of the delicious goodness to you all over the Bay Area and beyond! These funds will make it happen!

This adorable piece brings imagination and entertainment to the table!\nUncommon Goods\nEver wonder what would happen if you closed your eyes for a moment only to open them and find yourself in another world? A place of magic where the adventure of dining begins with dishware that stands on its own. Have fun!  \nBeautiful Life\nDylan Kendall, philanthropist behind Hollywood Arts, just launched her first collection of ceramics called Efeet. Isn\u2019t it adorable?\nDesign Milk\nThe Efeet collection by social entrepreneur Dylan Kendall is the first of several new lines designed to make our homes happy places. Bowls, coffee sets and vases are whimsically perched on human feet, coming alive on our tables.ICON-EYE\nIn my mid-30s I thought of a way to reach the over 18 homeless and foster care youth. I used arts and music. I fought against naysayers but I knew if I didn't speak to them all hope of ending homelessness would be futile. And it worked. Hollywood Arts grew reaching hundreds of kids living on the streets, helping them master basic skills while serving the most fundamental purpose possible--giving them something to believe in--themselves--and their dreams. (see photos at the bottom of page)\nNow I'm returning to clay! I launched the Efeet Collection in October of 2011 on the blogoshpere and the line sold out immediately which was both surprising and thrilling! A few weeks ago, I decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to help me make more bowls...and it worked!\nI decided to run a second Kickstarter campaign so I can add new items to the line. This new campaign helps me introduce salt & pepper shakers, coffee mugs and candle holders and allows you to still add the bowls to your orders! \nAlso I've decided to upload candids of the items in use in the UPDATES section...taken at my home in Silverlake, Los Angeles. This is how we use our bowls! \nNEW ITEMS to the EFEET COLLECTION! *(photographs are of the samples)\nMEDIUM-SIZED BOWL!\nI think this is the perfect bowl! Perfect for pasta, soup (ah...soup), stir-fry and of course cereal! Perfect for a meal on the couch or for a family of four! Pair it up with the coffee mugs for a joyful start to the day! 6.5\" diameter\n\nCOFFEE MUGS!* available in orange and white\nA fantastic way to wake up with a little laughter and play! Turn grumpy mornings into happy ones! Good company for the morning paper! \n\nSALT & PEPPER SHAKERS!* \nLet your condiments shake it up! Salt and Pepper have never had more fun!\n\nCANDLE HOLDERS! Bring a little joyful warmth to your rooms! *Holds standard 3\" pillar candle \n\nDESSERT BOWL! \nPerfect for snacks, fruit, granola and ice cream (and who knew? its become our go-to salsa bowl)! Its happiness in a happy bowl! Pair it up with the coffee mug for a romantic evening of warm apple pie and Irish Coffee! ! 4\" in diameter \n\nREWARDS T-SHIRT!\nA ceramist by trade, I grew up playing dirty and what fun it was! I hope the Efeet Collection encourages us all to find the kid inside, play a little dirty and live joyfully!  The tees are produced on super soft cotton--100% American made -- good for the soul and for the body! (women's t- available in XS, S, M, L and mens t- available in S, M, L, and XL....please let me know!) \nWHO AM I?\n\nI'm a ceramist, a foster mother, an animal rescuer, a social entrepreneur. I was a ceramist in my 20s and had three galleries working with me. But I gave it all up in my late 20s after a pretty intense brush with poverty right outside my studio door in Oakland, CA. I literally said: Enough! and packed up the studio to transfer to UCLA. I earned my Bachelors degree at 30 and my Masters at 32. Not long after I founded Hollywood Arts,  the only educational facility in the country to use arts, music and performance-based education to mainstream homeless youth over the age of 18. Hollywood Arts grew successfully and after five years I was able to return to ceramics....I spent 10 years in public service working towards change. Hollywood Arts, and every young person who came to the agency, is important to me and will always benefit from whatever else I do in my life. \n\nEARLY EFEET INSPIRATION!  \n\nTHANK YOUs\nKiino Villand for his amazing photography, Adam Egypt Mortimer for the rockin' kitten video, Ron Moon for the rockin' pasta video, Jeffery Hepker for the kitten soundtrack and Wes Hambright for the second joyful score!:) Talent I'm happy to vouch for!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Bed, Bath and Beyond...all because of YOU!", "update_content": "With excitement I want to share with you that Bed, Bath and Beyond has become a retailer of the footed bowls, and its all because of you!

Sometimes that heart is bursting with love for the craft, while other times it's punctured and bleeding all over the place... 24 frames per second.\nMAD GOD is a mature film made with technology that spans the history of cinema.\nTHE MOVIE\nPhil Tippett was raised on the fantasy films of Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien; films that fueled his and other youngsters' imaginations with creatures brought to life using stop-frame animation.  As a young man, he was further influenced by European experimental filmmakers Karel Zeman, Jan Svankmajer and Vladislav Starevich, who used similar techniques in surreal and experimental ways. \nWith his work on the \"Star Wars\" movies, Tippett carved his own niche as a modern master of stop motion.  In 1984 he created his own studio where he continued to explore and innovate using stop motion. \nMAD GOD began with several minutes of stop motion animation in 1990, before the explosion of Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) for movies.  But as his studio blossomed into a powerhouse of computer-assisted visual effects and animation, the MAD GOD project fell on the back burner. \nUNTIL LAST YEAR\nAfter sitting on the shelf for 20 years, artists at Tippett Studio implored Phil to revive MAD GOD. \nIncorporating footage shot before the surge of CGI with new puppets, scenes, environments, and in-camera effects, Phil is directing while mentoring an entire new generation in traditional stop motion animation and creature fabrication.\nThe crew is entirely made up entirely of volunteers, including artists from Tippett Studio, students from local art schools, and industry veterans who remember the \"good ol' days\" when effects were made by people on sets photographing puppets one frame at a time.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nEven independent films cost money, and MAD GOD is no exception. \nThe money raised through Kickstarter will be used to finance an abundance of the hard costs associated with making the first chapter of this film, including materials for making molds, armatures, rear and front-screen projections, lab services, hard drive storage, and studio rental space among other costs...  \nIn short, your money will finance the supplies needed to bring the film to life.  Your contributions will ensure that the first chapter gets completed, and you will have a front row seat to the making of this spectacle.\nWe've been emboldened by a number of incredible Kickstarter success stories to believe that independent animation fans and consumers can make a project as unlikely and non-commercial as MAD GOD a reality.  Your financing will facilitate this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision like few have ever attempted. \nABOUT THE PROJECT\nOver an 18 month period, a small team, under Phil Tippett's direction, will complete an approximately 12-minute chapter of the stop-motion/live-action/mixed-media creation called MAD GOD, using hands, tools, molds, clay, toys, garbage, blood, and whatever else we can get our hands on.  \nOnce this chapter is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice (determined by which rewards level is chosen). \nREWARDS\nA flat backer contribution of $10 gets you into the \"MAD GOD CLUB,\" with access to view the process on a password-protected section of the www.madgodmovie.com website as it unfolds and a copy of the first chapter of the film when it is finished as a digital download. \nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond that, we have a list of fun, premium, rewards ranging from postcards with art of the film to DVDs, signed by creator Phil Tippett, to custom-created sculptures. \nFor More Information, please visit www.madgodmovie.com or email kickstarter@madgodmovie.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Exciting MAD GOD News", "update_content": "Dear Team MAD GOD,\n\nWe have exciting news to share with you...\n\nAfter more than 30 years in production, and thanks in EVERY WAY to you, the backers of this project over the past decade, Phil has completed the feature length film version of MAD GOD!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Phil Tippett's MAD GOD Instagram is now a thing!", "update_content": "Hi Team MAD GOD!   \nLet's make this short & sweet - Phil Tippett now has an Instagram!  \nHis feed chronicles adventures in imagining, fabricating & animating all the parts & pieces that go into the glorious world of MAD GOD.  \nFollow him @madphilg on Instagram, won't you?  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/madphilg/  "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "VIP Pre-Tip: MAD GOD Kickstarter 3 is Now Live", "update_content": "Greetings Team Mad God!\nWe are inside of 24 hours for our latest project - the Augmented Reality Hologrid: Monster Battle game, featuring Phil's creatures, brought to life for you to play with!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Final Push for \"Hologrid: Monster Battle\"", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Collector's Edition for Hologrid Game", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "HoloGrid: Monster Battle // Live on Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "HoloGrid: Monster Battle // News from Phil Tippett", "update_content": "Good morning beloved backers of Phil Tippett's Mad God Pt1!\nLast week, we shipped out replacement DVD-Blu-Ray sets to all backers who reported having not received a DVD, whose DVDs arrived creased or damaged, or whose DVDs were reported having been seized by customs or lost in the post.\nThese were mailed to those of you who emailed us privately or responded to our Doodle Poll to report your DVD missing.
