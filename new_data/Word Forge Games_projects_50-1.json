[{"backer": "Word Forge Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Dragon Dice\u00ae is a collectable dice game for 2 or more players. Originally made famous in 1995 by TSR, Dragon Dice\u00ae has continued to expand and evolve under the reign of SFR Inc. and currently offers a large range of truly exceptional dice to be used with its innovative tactical game system.\n\nThe Frostwings are one of Dragon Dice\u00ae's most sought-after species. Out of print for some time, the player community chanted for their return and the gods of Esfah\u2122 have answered. Pledge your service to the denizens of the frozen tundra to witness the Frostwings take to the skies once more!\nFurthermore, due to years of player feedback, if we reach funded status, not only will Frostwings be available once more, but one of the biggest missteps taken by TSR will be corrected.  That's right, once the project is funded, we will be remaking the Large unit mold, thereby making the Magi, one of the most useful units from this species, more readily available!\nDragon Dice\u00ae has a huge range of available dice, each offering different abilities and tactics, allowing you to compose your perfect army. Due to the large number of options, new players should always start with our 'Starter Rules', which give players an insight to the core mechanics of the game focused on the 2-player experience.\nThe following video is designed to make learning Dragon Dice\u00ae a breeze:\n Our 2-player starter set contains everything you could need to get started on your Dragon Dice\u00ae adventure: A total of 40 stunning quality dice, 2 paper playmats and a copy of the 2-player starter rules (also downloadable below).\nV4.0 RULES DOWNLOADS\n(click to view and download):\n Treefolk vs Firewalkers V4.0 Starter Rules(current retail starter set)\nFor those of you already experienced with Dragon Dice\u00ae, the full rules have recently undergone an update focusing on streamlining the gaming experience and are now presented in full graphical format along with a range of species reference sheets. The new Dragon Dice\u00ae V4.01 full rules set can be downloaded here:\nV4.01 Full Rules\n V4.0 Summary Document (to explain the changes between V3.0.4 and V4.0)\n V4.01 Summary Document(to explain the changes between V4.0 and V4.01)\nHigh res versions of these files (for printing) as well as additional documents in support of our rules, including an FAQ and our awesome new online rules wiki can be found on the SFR website by clicking here!\nWant to know a little more about each of the species in Dragon Dice\u00ae? You can check them all out by clicking here!\nWhat is a 'kicker'?\nYou will notice that the pledge tiers (as well as the campaign add-ons) include large numbers of 'kickers'. A kicker is the standard pack size for Dragon Dice\u00ae. Kickers for the various species all contain the following four small six-sided units, two medium six-sided units, one large six-sided unit and one Monster (10-sided) (any kickers that contain different assortments of dice are detailed in the add-ons section)...\nThe tiers:\nAny of the following items may be added to your pledge. Simply increase your pledge amount by the value shown below. All add-ons will be confirmed post-campaign in the pledge manager.\n Find us on Facebook, and be sure to follow us for special offers and promotions\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DragonDice/\nAlso on Facebook, you can find the community-led, 'Dragon Dice Players' Community' by clicking HERE.\n Shipping will be charged after the campaign, via the pledge manager. We have decided to do this so we can ensure the most accurate and cost effective shipping for each order, based on the package weight, size and destination.  Shipping will be calculated via the pledge manager to offer each backer the cheapest possible option for their pledge.\nAs shipping costs can vary greatly it is impossible to state all the possible shipping costs here, however the following prices are an approximate representation of our fulfillment partners current rates:\nUS: $10-20\nUK: $10-20 (approx \u00a37-15)\nMainland Europe $15-30 (approx \u20ac10-25)\nAustralia: $15-20 (approx AU$20-25)\nCanada: $25-50 (approx CA$35-65)\nAll prices are charged in US Dollars. Please remember that shipping prices can fluctuate based on the quantity of dice you order.\nUS, UK and AU-friendly shipping!\nWe will be shipping all rewards from one of 3 hubs around the world - US, UK and Australia.  As such, if you reside in the US, UK or AU areas your rewards will be shipped locally and there will be no customs duties or fees applicable. unfortunately, our UK distributor is no longer able to ship EU orders without Custom/Duty fees, so all EU orders will be shipped via the US, and custom fees may be applied.\n\nPlease note that pledges delivered to other areas of the world may attract customs charges. SFR is not responsible for any fees incurred in this way.\n\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter\nRisks and challenges\n                                       SFR has many years of manufacturing and fulfillment experience, as such those typical aspects which trip up many Kickstarter campaigns are well covered.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Finally, a military game that strikes a great balance between beefy simulation and fast-paced, narrative-oriented play. If I had to summarize it quickly, I'd say it's a great amalgamation. It mixes some of the better concepts from various systems to create a unique engine that's well-suited to its task. In essence, you might say it's the love child of the Cypher system (Numenera), FATE (FUDGE, more specifically), and a game I played a while back called In Harm's Way: Wild Blue. It's got a nice, sleek system, plenty of source material to get you rolling, and more in supplementary content\u201d.\n Customer Reviews\nSince publication in 2017 Ghost Ops has been Ennie nominated and has become a Gold Bestseller on DriveThru RPG. Over the last couple of years, I have also been hard at work gathering the likes and dislikes about the game, talking to the fans about what they would like to see and what should change and finally I am ready to bring Ghost Ops back with a Second Strike!\nSince Ghost Ops launched it has had massive success with a thriving Facebook community, players from all over the world ranging from active military, veterans, and civilians who all love to test their skills against the worse the world can offer. \nThe core rules will have a facelift based on feedback from the fans of the game, but the foundations of both versions will stay the same meaning that all the sourcebooks and missions that have been already released will still be usable with Second Strike.\nSo what will change?\nThe first big change will be the characters, in the original characters were members of the I.C.O. but I learnt that some players ignored that so this time the game will allow you to play as:\nI.C.O. Operators (A fictional Special Forces unit similar to Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6)\nSwat Teams\nSpecial Agents\nPrivate Military Contractors\nSpecial Forces\nNot only does this widen the scope of backgrounds and character skills but also the types of missions that you will encounter.\nActual Artwork from the book\nThe 2nd Change will be to Backgrounds.\nBackgrounds in the core game were a huge hit with fans so in Second Strike I will be doubling the number of countries available to choose from, and along with the changes in character types as shown above the backgrounds linked to each country will grow also, offering a whopping 200 background choices.\nThe Game will also offer five different world settings\nThe original game was set in modern-day, but many people asked about cold war settings or World War Two, so both the Operators section and Handlers section will be expanded to cover various timelines allowing you to experience Special Operations from World War Two, Vietnam and beyond. The Handlers Section will contain everything you need to run Ghost Ops along with the Modern Day setting. I will then include all the settings unlocked during this campaign to the Handlers section expanding it with up to 5 more settings from the Second World War to Near Future.\nThere will also be some significant changes to the original rules, these have been designed to make combat faster with new weapons and armour rules, and to make the character creation more open for you to make the Operator you want with new skills, abilities, and talents.\nThe Core book will continue to use the popular FeralEngine with some tweaks but there will also be an optional rules section allowing you to play the game using 2d6 or a D100 percentile ruleset.\nArt from the Core Book\n Savage Ghost Ops will also be upgraded and expanded into a whole new game using the SWADE rules which will be created by me with consultation from Thomas Clegg.\n There will also be a 5th edition Ghost Ops bring Special Forces to the World's oldest RPG. So if you love 5e and would experience in a way never experienced before grab the 5th edition Bundle.\nThe Hardback will be just available for the standard rules (FeralEngine plus optional 2d6, D100). This will be a 300+ size book in a standard format (8.5x11). The hardbacks will be offset printed, so stitched. With a ribbon for saving your place.\nThe Savage Ghost Ops bundle will come with a link to buy the softcover from DTRPG for the cost of Print and Postage.\nThis is a mock up and is subject to change\nThe book will have all new artwork and layout and be much bigger than the original. I am hoping to add missions that will fit each of the character types, so whether your players want to be SWAT or Special Agents etc there will be a mission for them to get started.\nIf you would like to be involved in our social media we have a number of places you can join us for a chat.\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/GhostOpsRPG\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/p9skxB8\nOr you can join our Patreon and gain special discounts, free missions and other stuff for just $3 per month - https://www.patreon.com/Ghostops\nThe Ghost Ops Patreon has a few members and it would be nice to see it grow as being a member gains you discount, free and exclusive content, previews and first refusal on games that I will run over Discord and all for just $3 per month.\nI want to offer something to our members so the following are exclusive to Patreon and will unlock as more people join.\nAt 25 members you will each receive an exclusive mission\nAt 50 members you will each receive a unique NPC Terrorist Cell\nAt 75 members you will each receive a second exclusive mission\nAt 100 members you will each a unique setting for the game.\nAddons will be added here as we unlock them but if you would like to purchase other RPGs created by FeralGamersInc then there is a list below with the special Kickstarter price.\nBlack Iron Grimdark Fantasy PDF - \u00a310\nBlack Iron Hardback - \u00a330\nBlack Iron Grimdark Fantasy 5th ed PDF - \u00a310\nBlack Iron 5th edition Hardback - \u00a330\nThe Ruin Post Apocalyptic RPG D100 PDF - \u00a310\nThe Ruin D100 Hardback - \u00a330\nThe Ruin Post Apocalyptic RPG 5th ed PDF - \u00a310\nThe Ruin 5th ed Hardback - \u00a330\nStranded - Science Fiction RPG PDF - \u00a310\nGhost Ops Dice Tray - \u00a312\nMock up of finished product\nGhost Ops Second Strike PDF - \u00a315\nGhost Ops Second Strike Hardback - \u00a335\nSavage Ghost Ops Second Strike PoD Voucher - \u00a310\nThere are Four kinds of Stretch Goals available:\nInternal - These will be added to the books and will be mainly character types and setting guides.\nPDF - These will be separate PDFs and will be missions and city guides.\nPhysical - These will be physical rewards such as GM Screens, Dice, Collected Mission Books etc.\nAddons - These will open up new addons that can be added to your pledge, such as special editions, custom dice etc.\nThe Shadow War setting written by Bradley Clark will be added to the Handlers Section, with the character choices and gear of that era added to Operators Section.

With the advent of official community-created content programs for both Torg Eternity and Savage Worlds on DriveThruRPG, I took the leap into the publishing side of things with a supplement entitled Legion Of Grace for Torg Eternity as well as three supplements for the Savage Worlds Adventurer's Guild; Calensville Caverns (a post-apocalyptic setting location), Into The Depths (an adventure intended for use with the Calensville Caverns supplement), and Gunsmithing 101: A Guide to Modern Firearms (a supplement providing more in-depth options for firearms in Savage Worlds)\nShipping\nAll PDFs will be sent via DriveThruRPG\nWe can not ship to Brazil, Russia, Afganistan, Singapore.

This has taken some of the burdens off my shoulders freeing me up to work on the game full time. For someone that is used to doing everything themselves, this is a big part sorted.\nYears of feedback and chatting with the community has led to me creating a tighter, faster and more complete rule system and cover other systems which have been asked for without those becoming to cumbersome, which means Ghost Ops now has something for everyone.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Ghost Ops Second Strike PDF", "descp": "You will receive the 300+ Pg PDF\nAll unlocked Internal Stretch Goals\nAll unlocked PDF Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["49 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Savage Ghost Ops Bundle", "descp": "In this bundle, you will receive\nSavage Ghost Ops - Second Strike PDF\nAn at-cost code to buy the Print on Demand from DTRPG\nAll Internal Stretch Goals\nGM Screen and Print and Play Bennies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["21 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Ghost Ops 5th edition Bundle", "descp": "You will receive a PDF of Ghost Ops 5th edition\nPoD code to buy the softback for cost and Postage\nPrint and Play GM screen\nPlus all unlocked PDF Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2022"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a335 or more", "title": "Just the Hardback", "descp": "You will receive the Hardback of Ghost Ops Second Strike\nAll unlocked Internal Stretch Goals\nPostage collected after the campaign has ended.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["14 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "Operator Level", "descp": "You will receive the Hardback of Ghost Ops Second Strike\nThe Ghost Ops Second Strike PDF\nAll Internal and External Stretch Goals\nPostage Collected after the campaign has ended.\nPlease do not add postage to your pledge.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["8 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a365 or more", "title": "PDF Bundle", "descp": "You will receive:\nGhost Ops Second Strike PDF\nSavage Ghost Ops Second Strike PDF\nAll unlocked Internal Stretch Goals\nAll unlocked PDF Stretch Goals\nAlso\nEvery single Ghost Ops 1st ed PDF Published up to now, this amounts to over $150 worth of content.

Small pockets of humanity survived this horrific conflict, eventually forming the eleven metropolises. Initially, these incredible urban constructs were able to grow and prosper through advancements in atmospheric processing and technological innovation, but now cut off from each other, the eleven metropolises must each face their own difficulties and hardships. The Gaia Complex focuses on the largest of these locations; New Europe, a single sprawling city that covers much of what we currently know as mainland Europe. New Europe is a world of street violence, corporate espionage, vampiric uprisings and an overzealous A.I., known as Gaia, which functions as the city\u2019s governor and the protector of its citizens.\nThis is a game of conspiracy and brutality, where players take on the roles of Mercs; former police officers, hackers and street-savvy dealers who are hired to fight back against the system and ultimately unravel the secrets of The Gaia Complex.\nWhat makes The Gaia Complex different from other cyberpunk RPG's out there? Here are a few points to steer you in the right direction...\n Fiction - The Gaia Complex tells an episodic story. Each chapter of the book is fronted with a piece of short fiction, introducing important characters and plot details. We use short fiction to consistently flesh out the world through the eyes of people living in the metropolis, building up more detailed pictures of life as a Merc in 2119.\n Vampirism - Vampires feature heavily in The Gaia Complex. Since the bloody uprising of 2111, vampires have gone from being mankind's bitter enemy, to untrusted allies and pioneers of modern corporate life. Despite their attempts to 'fit in' with human life, a large number of 'Outsider' vampires still roam the subway tunnels, refusing to accept Gaia's rule and preying on New Europe's civilians. Though vampires are not playable characters, they feature heavily within the game setting as both NPCs and key figures within New Europe.\n Violent content - Unlike many cyberpunk games, The Gaia Complex does not sugar-coat the violence and hardship of the world. While combat-ready cybernetics and a large list of guns may be common-place within the genre, The Gaia Complex shows violence in all of its brutal nature and uses mature language and themes throughout. This is cyberpunk as it should be - brutal and unforgiving.\n Ferals - A true ally of man, the ferals unveiled themselves alongside the vampiric uprisings of 2111. These strange nomadic loners have become valued information-brokers and are able to enter the minds of the metropolis' animals, utilising rats and street mongrels as espionage agents. Feral characters can be created in place of human's and provide an interesting new dynamic to roleplaying - after all, a rat can be pretty sneaky, but is going to struggle to communicate its human comrades. \n Artificial intelligence - While A.I. may not be rare within the genre, New Europe is exclusively governed by Gaia: a single sentient construct that controls air filtration, food production and the now-entirely robotic police force. Players must learn to operate in the shadow of this all-seeing A.I. and live in a word where the man at the top is not a man at all.\nOf course we'd love you to back this campaign and be a part of making The Gaia Complex a reality, but before you do, maybe you want to give it a whirl for yourself? Good news - you can do this right now.\nWhile this campaign and the updates throughout will talk about the game setting and rules, our free (well, 'pay what you want', but please, enter \u00a30 and just grab a copy!) 48-page Quick Start for The Gaia Complex is out right now and will allow you to read and play for yourselves. This PDF contains a huge amount of lore surrounding the game, offering an in-depth insight to the world of The Gaia Complex and what it means to be a Merc in 2119. In addition, the booklet is jammed full of gorgeous artwork and gives you a good idea of what to expect from the full core book.\nGo and grab your copy of the Quick Start by clicking this link (or the image below).\nThe cast of playable characters from The Gaia Complex Quick Start.\nThe Gaia Complex core book will be 'at least' 256 pages of full-colour hardback beauty, printed in US Letter size format - take a look at the Quick Start for a general idea about how it will look. We say 'at least' as we have a whole host of extra content that we might just squeeze in, either through stretch goals, or becuase we end up deciding certain things just need to be there.\nUpdate: thanks to stretch goals, this book now stands at 288 pages!\nStandard and Limited Edition Core Books\nAt the time of launch, the core book writing is roughly 95% complete and layout for final proof-reading has already been completed for most chapters - this is a significant strength for this project, having completed so much of the writing ahead of launch. Artwork at this point is around 45% complete and new art is in the pipeline to be finished (and shown off) during the campaign. The art direction for this book is very important and great care is being taken to ensure the visuals support the writing as closely as possible.\nThe structure of the book is split over 12 chapters, plus an NPC (non-player character) library at the end. We'll go into more detail about the chapters over the coming weeks via the campaign updates, sharing some key information as we go. Alongside the rules, background and resources for playing the game, the book also includes multiple pieces of short fiction that slowly unfold the real story behind The Gaia Complex. These stories, and the characters they describe, lay the foundation for the world in which the game is set and allow us to explore New Europe in 2119 in much more cinematic detail.\nThe Brandenburg Gate at the border to Old Berlin - the capital of New Europe\nThe engine behind The Gaia Complex is called 12.3 and can be taken for a test drive in our Quick Start by clicking HERE.\nThe basis of the system uses 2d12 (that's two twelve sided dice - but you're all roleplayers, so I'm sure you knew that!) to make the majority of tests on a 'roll under' basis. Whenever a test is required, the GM determines a potential difficulty for the test, ranging from 1 (easy for a child to accomplish) to 11 (impossibly hard). A character will compare the difficulty to their relevant statistic and if the stat is equal to or greater than the difficulty, the test is a success - There is an emphasis in the game on keeping the action flowing and not making tests unless they are really needed.\nIf the character's stat is less than the difficulty, a test is required: the player rolls 2d12, requiring a result that is equal to or less than their relevant stat. An 11 fails (without cybernetic enhancement or other bonuses) and a 12 is a Critical Failure. To pass, a character requires one or both d12s to succeed depending on whether they are skilled or unskilled - The Gaia Complex does not consider 'ranks' in various skills like the majority of RPGs, instead a character either possesses a skill or does not (though becoming a specialist in certain skills is possible).\nDuring combat, d3s are also used to determine damage - you can use funky d3s like the ones available on this campaign, or simply use common d6. The engine for the game uses d3s to enable a more consistant result when rolling multiple dice together and to remove the chance of whiffing a result of a 1 in situations that should always achieve a minium degree of success (thus 3d3+3 damage represents a weapon with more consistent output than one that does 1d12 damage) .\nOf course, the game includes many other rules - some core, some optional - covering a huge array of options, but at its root, the game falls back on 12.3 to keep it rolling (pun intended).\nDuring the course of the campaign we'll dedicate a couple of updates to specific areas of the rules and give you a deep dive into them beyond what you can get your hands on in the Quick Start.\nCharacters in The Gaia Complex are known as Mercs. At their core, Mercs are citizens of New Europe who have chosen to rebel against the system and take up arms by making themselves available on the freelance market. The seedy clubs and bars of NeoMunich are the most common place to find Mercs and while their work is entirely illegal, there is enough anonymity that it isn't worth the expenditure of resources for Gaia or its police force to worry about shutting down the network.\nMost Mercs are hired to run jobs against one of the many corporations in the metropolis. From hacking R&D servers to kidnapping, assassinating or Bio Hacking company execs; there are few limits when it comes to taking a job. Ironically, the primary employers are the corporations themselves, all looking to get a leg up over their rivals, employing Mercs to do the dirty work in order to maintain complete deniability. Of course, it's not just the heaving corporations that are the enemy; outsider vampires that lurk in the subway tunnels and outer fringes of the metropolis, the cybernetic police force controlled by the LE1 A.I. subsystem, or even Gaia itself - the all seeing ruler of the metropolis - everyone is a potential mark if the score looks big enough!\nPolice Officer - Bio Hacker - CyberDoc - The Legendary Eddy Tense\nThe core rulebook contains a detailed character creation process, allowing players to play either human or feral (a mysterious group of people who can enter the minds of the metropolis' animals) characters from one of ten varied roles, each with their own unique rules, benefits and style. Characters can choose from:\n Operator - Former law enforcement, corporate security and guns-for-hire that pack the hottest weapon tech that the black market has to offer.\n Core Hacker - Hackers and coders who live their lives in the digital pathways of The Core.\n Bio Hacker - A new wave of hacker, dedicated to hacking the cybernetic brains of their targets and inducing 'forced servitude'.\n ParaMed - Former TactaMed paramedics who have realised they can earn more money patching up Mercs by being one of them!\n CyberDoc - Back-alley hackjob specialists and cybernetic installers. An often riskier, but cheaper approach, to main stream cybernetics clinics.\n MilTech - Weapons techs, tinkerers and specialist drone pilots. MilTechs keep the team's gear working and provide invaluable technical support.\n Mech - Drivers, pilots and expert mechanics. Mechs keep the metropolis rolling and give Merc teams much needed access to reliable transportation.\n Tech Trader - Black market dealers, handling everything from illegal weapons and stolen cybernetics, to narcotics and false credentials.\n Data Dealer - Information traffickers and dealers of stolen secrets.

We will not be adding stretch goals that include other physical items, with the aim of keeping the manufacturing and fulfilment of this project as swift and simple as possible.\nUPDATE: This campaign is now fully stretched, bringing the final page count to 288, with loads more additional art through which to explore the world of The Gaia Complex - THANK YOU all so much for making this happen!\nWe have deliberately gone with a minimal number of add-ons for this campaign. The focus of this Kickstarter is the core book and getting carried away with a whole host of extras is not the way we wanted to go. The following few items can be added to any pledge by simply increasing your pledge amount by the required amount. After the campaign, you will be able to confirm which add-ons you want for your money in the pledge manager.\nPlease come and follow us for extra content and conversation - You can find us in the following places by clicking the links below:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nOfficial Website\nEvery social like, follow, post and share provides more momentum, more eyes on the campaign and potentially more backers. Our greatest assest in promoting the campaign, unlocking stretch goals and ultimately making a success of The Gaia Complex, is you - our backers. Please help to get the word out, we appreciate the support more than we can possibly express.\nHInt_Plays live-play of The Gaia Complex Quick Start.\nQ&A with Randomworlds, discussing the game, setting, rules and background (transcript from live Q&A on 18/02/20).\nInterview with Mildra The Monk, discussing how the game has developed, my thoughts on the genre and a look into the origins of the design:\nOur original interview with Mildra The Monk, discussing the Quick Start, the background and my approach to game design (recorded in 2020, prior to us heading to Kickstarter):\nTestimonials\n \"I love the art and feel of The Gaia Complex and the rules are great, dice rolling that means something, without taking over or pulling the players out of the moment.\" - Mark Rapson, Nightfall Games/Word Forge Games\n \"Excellent mechanics, in-depth and well thoughtout world building and looks gorgeous. Also, Shep is a very handsome man! Insta-back!\" - Robb Butler, Dice Sports\nShipping... oh, my old nemesis! The state of global shipping at the time of this campaign going live is very much 'problematic'. While most national postal services are getting close to resuming 'normal' operation, international shipments to many places are currently attracting very high tariffs and long delays.\nAs we won't be shipping this book until later in the year, we are very hopeful that international shipping will have stabilised somewhat, both in terms of cost and reliability. In order to address this as best we can, we will not be charging shipping during the campaign and will not open the campaign's pledge manager to collect shipping until we are closing in on shipping your rewards.\nBy handling shipping in this manner it ensures you are not over charged backers by needing to pay the current high tariffs and allows us to better adjust our shipping strategy based on the state of the fulfilment industry at the time.\nDO NOT ADD MONEY FOR SHIPPING NOW. SHIPPING WILL BE CALCULATED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN ONCE THE PLEDGE MANAGER HAS OPENED AND WILL BE CHARGED WHEN WE ARE CLOSE TO SHIPPING.\nDue to this fact, it is very hard to provide accurate postage costs for your pledges, but the following values should serve as a benchmark, based on our fulfilment partner's (GMS) projections for the months ahead. These prices are based on shipping a single copy of the core book (plus a set of dice and art prints if you feel so inclined), but backing for multiples copies of the book may incur higher costs...\n UK: \u00a37\n EU: \u00a310\n US: \u00a315\n AU/CA: \u00a325\n Rest of the world: \u00a330\nIMPORTANT: these values may differ when we come to charge for shipping. Rest assured, as we close on on fulfilment we will ensure everyone is updated with accurate pricing. Some areas, such as the US, are currently enforcing very high tariffs on incoming international shipments which is effecting the prices to ship parcels there. We hope that by the time we come to ship your rewards, tariffs such as these may have been reduced.\nThough we are able to ship to most places (there are a few exceptions below), we are currently positioned to be able to ship UK, EU and US 'friendly' packages, meaning that backers in those territories will have their packages shipped from within those territories, in order to avoid incurring additional import fees beyond the shipping costs that we charge. While we are investigating offering this service for other territories, we are unable to make any promises at the moment. All other destinations will have their packages shipped from the UK.\nIMPORTANT: we are currently unable to ship to the following countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan and Brazil - we apologise to potential backers in these locations. \nAll PDF/digital rewards will be fulfilled via DriveThruRPG...\n (You read all the way to the end of the campaign page! you rock!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough all Kickstarters come with some element of unseen risk, the team behind this project are well positioned to deliver on-time and as promised. At the time of launch, the book is over 95% written, with a complete and heavily tested rules system, putting it well ahead of where one would consider a typical RPG book to be at the time of launching a kickstarter campaign. \n\nWhile there is a still a large amount of art to be completed, once again, the amount already finished is ahead of our initial expectations and puts us in a great place to complete on time. The funds raised will go towards completing the art in a timely manner to the expected quality, as well as the manufacturing of the physical rewards. \n\nBoth manufacturing and fulfilment are already lined up and are being done with companies where we have an existing relationship, having printed and delivered books and games around the world previously. Given that The Gaia Complex is a new IP, we made the decision to run a 'simple' campaign, free from a long list of add-ons and physical rewards to allow us to move through the manufacturing and fulfilment process with relative ease and with minimal chance for complication.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nHigh quality printing with the best possible binding.

Below are our best estimates on shipping rates based on the most recent information we have from our fulfillment partners.\n\nWorldwide Shipping Estimates \u2013 See below for more info\nBacker Priority Guarantee\nNo copies of the retail or Kickstarter edition of the game, its expansions or extras to be made available for sale by Inside the Box online or offline until all pledges are in transit from regional depot to backer, not including retailer backers.\n\nRetailer Guarantee\nNo distribution sales or retail sales outside of the campaign until at least 1 month after all pledges are in transit from regional depot to backer. Preorders or presales will not be shipped until after the 1 month period is up.\n  50% Deposit for verified Retailers, 50% due on fulfillment.\n\nRefund Policy\nNo questions asked. If you want a refund, for whatever reason, just ask us via Kickstarter message. Unfortunately we can't recover Kickstarter fees, but we're happy to refund the whole amount up until we ship your pledge.\n\nFriendly Shipping [UK, EU, US, Aus, Can]\nAll pledges will be shipped 'customs friendly' to at least the United Kingdom, Canada, the EU, the United States, Australia. This means no importation fees or additional taxes to pay. They're all handled by us!\nWe will work to include as many countries and territories as customs friendly as is possible with our fulfillment partners.\n\nProject Timeline\nWe've planned ou the campaign as follows! January-February will be this campaign! In Late February, after the project has (hopefully!) funded, we will send out the PledgeManager survey to all backers. In March we will distribute the eBooks and the Digital Fan Packs. During April and May we will be finalising all of the additional files and any additional artwork as well as performing a final check on all assets. June we will work with the factory to complete all the file preparation for printing. July and August will be occupied by manufacturing the books, extras and recharge pack components. September and October will be when everything is packaged up by the factory, freighted to regional fulfillment centres around the world and organised at the warehouses for sending out. November, will be when we start fulfilling pledges, providing things go broadly to plan. We've factored in plenty of wiggle room at every stage of the process, and have planned it all out well in advance to get Alba to you as quickly as we can.\nIf you're a hobby store, toy store, book store or anyone else that would like to stock Alba, let us know! During the campaign we'll be offering additional discounts to our regular retailer rates. Retailer backers will receive their pledges at the same time as any other backer, meaning you'll get your copies at least 30 days before any other stores. Once we've got you a quote sorted, you'll back through this campaign like any other backer - we'll explain exactly what to do. We provide commercial invoices for all trade orders. Send us a message on Kickstarter!\nAbout the team\nInside the Box and our plucky team of contributors have been working on Alba for a long while, and we're excited for this to be our first release in our Open World Adventure Book series.

Truslove discuss the process of creating Alba!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has substantially affected the entire games industry throughout the whole pipeline from designer to manufacturer, and we're no exception. After nearly and entire year of lockdown and working from home, our team has adjusted to this new paradigm and has got a solid plan for how to deliver this project in that context.\n\nAlthough we don't expect any delays, manufacturer errors, delays to freighting, at import or during the fulfillment process can throw off our expectations for getting you Alba. We've done our due diligence and planned out the who what where and how of the manufacturing process, the lead times, the freight and the fulfillment already, so that we're only accounting for unexpected delays. The layouts of the book, stickers, envelope, extras and all the other bits and bobs are complete. All ready to go.\n\nEverything offered as an add-on is either ready to print, or is already in the process of proofing with the manufacturer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe've worked hard with our manufacturing partners to ensure that all our products live on your bookshelf as long as you want them to, a long time! We don't cut corners on quality, and always push for the best possible materials to make our games and books from so that even a well worn and loved copy of our game will be playable again and again. Additionally we push everything we make to be made to play again, whether that's a game that has lots of variations or something that has a narrative flair with ways of recharging or redoing a campaign. We don't want any of our games to become redundant once they've been played once.\nReusability and recyclability\nEverything that looks like it can be recycled, can be. Everything else is either biodegradable, recycleable or marked clearly. Principally, our games are made to last, both in terms of wear as well as the motivation to keep them, being good!\nSustainable materials\nWe're leading the way in the games industry on attaining FSC certification on all our games where any paper products are used, as well as innovating with our manufacturers to eventually achieve 100% plant-based materials in our entire pipeline, including shrink wrap, plastic miniatures, pallet binding and more. We're also performing an entire pipeline audit of materials used in our products or materials used in their production to ensure the entire process from ink to bookstore is sustainable, environmentally and socially friendly.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe only work with the best teams, and the teams willing to innovate hard. We continue to find new ways to improve how we make our stuff, and we'll only ever work with those with the same vision of a way to make games without harming people or planet.\nSustainable Distribution\nPackaging is a necessary evil in getting you those things, but we now excusively use biodegradable or recycleable packaging and filler materials at the fulfilment stage for all our projects across the world, and have pushed hard to ensure our manufacturer does the same with freight packing.\n\nWe will use the freight method to get the bulk of the stuff to the local regions where they will be fulfilled directly to backers that minimises overal footprint. This is likely to be a choice between sea and rail freight. Given the impact sea freight has on ocean biomes, we will opt for railfreight where economically feasible.\nSomething else\nWe're in the process of working towards climate zero accreditation for the entire company, with the help of Climate Zero, another Kickstarter funded org!", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a34 or more", "title": "Vola's Satchel", "descp": "Get Alba as a generic format ebook for your favourite e-reader or desktop ebook app!

The book is printed in Europe and ships, at least initially, from the Black Country,UK,  which means North American backers take roughly one month longer (the slow boat across the Atlantic).  As an example, we estimate shipping charges for the 320-page Land of the Rising Sun book (estimated weight 1.30kg) to be as follows:   \nUnited Kingdom                   \u00a3 5.00\nEuropean Union                   \u00a3 8.00\nUSA                                         \u00a3 8.00\nCanada                                 \u00a3 12.00\nAustralia & New Zealand  \u00a3 15.00\nRest of World                      \u00a3 20.00", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks, but we are well on the way to completion and layout has is almost completed.

Headed up by General P.K.

You are a member of one of these teams.\nFrom the perspective of the Stargate SG-1 TV series, our story with the Phoenix Site picks-up after the episode titled \"Allegiance\" in season 6, episode 9.

However, we have been inspired by many other RPG systems beyond 5th edition, and we believe we have brought together the best of what is out there.

If you enjoy any of those games, or franchises such as The Last of Us, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Walking Dead or Fallout, we think SINS might just be the roleplaying game for you.\n If you're relatively new to RPGs or haven't played many other systems beyond Dungeons and Dragons, SINS uses a quick and simple D6-based engine that's beginner-friendly and easy to learn, whilst retaining a mechanical depth that keeps your game active and engaging, moment to moment.\nSINS: Manifest Destiny is the long-awaited follow-up to the first book; it is a huge expansion on the material, mechanics and lore of the corebook, and this Kickstarter intends to fulfil a physical print-run and distribution.\nIf you've missed out on SINS up to now but think it might be for you, don't worry! You can pick up a copy on our website here, add a copy to your pledge in the add-ons, or find us on DriveThruRPG.  If you backed the hugely popular Itch Bundle for Racial Justice, you'll also find a .PDF copy of the Core Rulebook included in there! \nTo learn more about SINS, check out the original Kickstarter page, our website, follow us on Twitter, or check out our community discord!\nSINS: Manifest Destiny is an expansion which sets out to expand upon SINS' Core Book in a number of ways. Taking place around twenty years after the general timeline of the Core Rulebook, this expansion focuses on the myriad factions and organisations that are beginning to establish themselves upon the Post-Fall East Coast of America. \nAs each Faction turns their sights to the horizon, their interests and machinations begin to clash, and the human evils of  expansionism and the wrongs of Old America are beginning to resurface. As Eldritch powers expand their domains and long-forgotten horrors stir in the ashes of the Fall, it falls to the Nemissaries, and the new generations of the continent, to forge a better future.  A new era is beginning, and despite the struggles of the Fall, the sins of the past must not be allowed to repeat themselves again.  \nThe book's central focus is on the United States, though much of the content in this book can be adapted and used for other regions in the world. The core content covers;\n\nThe Great Wastes: You\u2019ll find in this book an overview of the central regions of North America, along with extra information regarding areas of the East Coast. This information also includes a look at the history and the downfall of the American centre, lays out why the area has remained largely unexplored until now, and how you can utilise the area in your campaigns.\n\n Factions New and Old: Along with the expanded information on the central states, the biggest focus of this book is on providing a wealth of new mechanical options for players and Games Masters in regards to the original factions, along with the introduction of two new Major Factions; the Stormland Empire and the Park Rangers.\n This book also includes additional information on the existing Minor Factions, along with a new Minor Faction, the Bone Dragon\u2019s Realm. Further, you will also find some extra useful information on independent settlements and how to integrate them into your games.\n\nNew Equipment and Vehicle Rules: A lot of fans have asked for vehicle rules for SINS since its release, and we\u2019re glad to say we can finally deliver on that. As such, you\u2019ll find a full system for using vehicles both in and out of combat, along with a variety of both universal and faction-specific vehicles.\nDie Historic on the Post-Fall Roads.\n\nThe book also introduces a wealth of new equipment, with particular focus on Pre-Fall military hardware that allows human characters to give errant Nemissaries a run for their money, or stand side-by-side as powerful allies.\n\nSecrets and Nightmares: SINS' Core Rulebook raised as many mysterious questions as it answered in regards to the setting\u2019s lore, and this supplement \u2013 whilst not answering everything \u2013 pulls back the veil on a number of issues and gives a clearer insight into the Black Rain, the Reapers, and The Mother.\n In the same vein, Manifest Destiny expands upon the Harbingers and the Lost Children, providing new lore and mechanics for both antagonist factions, along with new rules for the Hivespawn and the nightmarish Reaper known as Blacklight.\n\nRadiation and the Blightspawn: No exploration of the Post-Fall American Interior and its horrors would be complete without a proper look at radiation and its effects. This includes mechanics for dealing with the physical effects of radiation in general, and the more abstract consequences for those beings capable of wielding Anima.\nManifest Destiny also includes the introduction of a new form of Broodspawn known as the Blightspawn, which thrive in radioactive areas. These new enemies have new mechanics and have a distinctly different horror theme and narrative feel to standard Broodspawn, making for an exciting new addition to any campaign.\n\nNever Underestimate Humanity: Nemissaries, in the Core Book of SINS, had things their own way. Human opponents were simply no match for them, but all that changes with Manifest Destiny's in-depth look at the Artificers and their arsenals of powered armour and advanced post-fall weaponry.\n\nThis Kickstarter aims to fulfil the printing and distribution of physical copies of SINS: Manifest Destiny. It's a book we've worked hard on over the past two years since SINS' launch, and the expansion has grown considerably in size and content since we initially spoke of its development as something we'd be able to realise as stretch-goal in our original campaign. Now, it's finished and ready for print. We want to get it in your hands in the best possible way; a high-quality hardback print to use beside your corebook. \nRest assured, if you backed the Kickstarter for SINS: The Roleplaying Game at any level, you are already due to receive a PDF copy of SINS: Manifest Destiny. That's what we promised back in 2018, and it's what we'll deliver.\n\nAs this Kickstarter serves as a way to fulfil a project we announced some time ago, should we hit goal, we'll be keeping any stretch goals simple and maximising the immediate benefit to our fans and supporters. More money will equal more art and more content. The book currently stands at approximately 210 pages and we're looking to raise \u00a35000 to fulfil a reasonable order of prints. That said, the more the merrier, so should we exceed our goal we've drawn up a list of some awesome additional features and accessories we'll be able to offer.\n\n\n\nMORE ART/ART BOOSTER: Exactly what it sounds like! With each of these goals hit, we'll be able to bump up the already respectable amount of art in SINS: Manifest Destiny, with more stunning illustrations from Will, further bringing the world of SINS to life.\n\nAdditional Bestiary: SINS: Manifest Destiny is already packed-out with a collection of fearsome foes and cunning adversaries, but this is a collection of miscellaneous enemy & NPC profiles we couldn't fit into the book - a handy resource for any GM, available as a free .PDF to all backers! \n\nPOST-FALL ROAD MAP:  A replica road map of the East Coast of America, as if it were printed in the post-fall world, complete with territory borders and significant settlement locations. An invaluable play-aid, prop and tool for any SINS GM, as well as a high-quality display piece.\n\nDOMINION PIN: a stylishly subtle Black Metal & Crimson Enamel pin with a white spot finish, of the Hierarch Dominion flag, so you can represent everyone's favourite outcast peacekeepers.\n\nSEW-ON PATCH:A fabric military-style patch, ready to be attached to your favourite jacket. We're still working on which Faction flag(s) will work best for the highest quality finish in the threadwork, so check back in if we hit this goal!\n\nVOIDGLASS DICE:The Bone-white and Blood Red die from our last KS were a runaway success, and we'd love to look into more realisations of SINS' textures for your dice. We've plans for smoky black die with matt finishes, the production of which we can realise with higher funding.\n\nMore to Follow! - Kickstarters are always exciting times, with each day (hopefully) bringing new developments and opportunities to projects - should we hit goal, be sure to check back regularly for any updates and news on the potential stretch goal additions and opportunities we can undertake for the future of SINS, and what goalposts we'll need to hit to achieve them.\n\nWe understand the global situation of trade and shipping has been ever-changing recently, but we want to ensure we can get this physical book in as many hands as we can, as affordably as possible. Wherever you might be pledging and supporting from, be sure to check out this handy chart for approximate costs before pledging.\nWe know it's been a difficult year for small businesses, and we want to do what we can to support our local brick & mortar shops and FLGS' in a time of online shopping. As such, we've brought back the Retailer pledges we offered in our last Kickstarter, with these three Retail Pledge Tiers reserved for stores to order copies of SINS: Manifest Destiny, along with copies of SINS: The Core Rulebook. Please don't pledge for these tiers as an individual, as we do reach out to the pledgers of these tiers individually to validate their business and organise  wholesale transactions and store shipments, but be sure to recommend our Kickstarter to your FLGS if SINS is something you like the look of - having a local stockist of the core rulebook is a sure-fire way to get campaigns going in your area!\nOur books are Nice. Like, AAA Nice. Being the same development team and using the same printers, we can assure you the physical print, layout and presentations of Manifest Destiny will be equally high quality.\nSINS: The Corebook, and the special edition of DEAD CITY, the prequel adventure.\nSINS: Manifest Destiny retains the same polished interior layout of the Core Rulebook.\n\nBlack & White Special Editions: As some long-time followers may be aware, SINS: The Corebook launched with some Kickstarter-exclusive and later Convention-exclusive covers. Some of you may even be lucky enough to possess the all-black Voidglass or all-white Arietta gloss finish covers for the corebook. For those avid collectors or people who want to add that extra flourish to their collection, we've instituted higher pledges for Manifest Destiny with covers in the all-black and all-white varieties to match their corebook counterparts. The contents of these special edition books are exactly the same, with only different covers and reverses. As before, the white covers will be finished with a gloss spot varnish, and the black covers with a muted silver varnish.\n\n\n  In addition to the black and white gloss covers for Manifest Destiny, we are also proud to offer a new, boutique rendition of SINS for collectors, exclusively available through this Kickstarter. \n\nMade possible through a collaboration with Chris Jones, an independent bookbinder and artist, the Shard Keeper's Collection is a hand-bound SINS compendium set, including copies of both SINS: Manifest Destiny, and SINS: The Core Rulebook. \nWith distressed leather coverings, stitched case bindings and ribbon markers, these books are adorned with trinkets and minutiae befitting a citizen of the esoteric 22nd Century. SINS: The Core Rulebook is fashioned as an mysterious tome, marked with the SINS' mythos symbols and distressed to your liking, whilst SINS: Manifest Destiny is fashioned after a turn-of-the-century outdoor survival guide. \nThe two books will be packaged together in a high-quality, waxed leather backpack, branded with a subtle symbol of the Hierarch Dominion - so they're all ready to be taken on the road (or to your bookshelf, for safe-keeping!)  \nThe interiors of these books will be hand-bound, though their contents will be the same as retail copies of the respective books.\na sneak preview of a prototype we're working on...\n\nEach Handbook bundle will be hand-made, and due to their artisan craftsmanship, this pledge is strictly limited to 7 Copies - each one is a unique creation, made with skill, craftsmanship and care. \n\n\nSINS is a labour of love, made by a small independent team based in Sheffield. We are;\n\nSam Sleney: Creative Director, editor, and captain of our apocalyptic ship. Once this campaign launches, Sam will be living in the comments section like a SINS sage, answering any questions on what this book does and what you can do with it. You can find him on twitter as @samsleney.\n\nMiquel Tankard & Russell Meader: Wordsmith power-couple and cat-keepers.  Miquel and Rusti have a hand in every part of SINS' production, from the writing to the graphic design. SINS is Miquel's brainchild, and though we all foster it with care in the hopes it will not grow up and consume us, we fear it may now be too late. \n\nBen Warren: our London-based contributor, Ben was the creative force behind the new Park Rangers and the Stormland Empire. When he isn't writing or self-publishing his own games, Ben obsesses over dinosaurs, drinks too much coffee and tinkers with innumerable RPG campaign ideas. He can be found on twitter as @BenMaxWarren.\n\nGavin Jones: Layout extraordinaire, Gavin turns our words into your pages. A champion for readability and accessibility, Gavin ensures our madness can be read on as many devices as possible, in as comfortable way as possible.\n\nWill Kirkby: Our illustrator, Will brings the world of SINS to life with his unique, signature style of bold artwork. Will is an artist who has worked for Dark Horse, Image, Oni Press and other companies in comics, as well as illustrating the SINS core book. He also works as a self published comics-creator and sometimes artist for Critical Role. You can see more of his work on Twitter, as @chamonkee.\n\nPaul Moore: Business and Distributions, Paul manages our shipping, deliveries and print production, and it's in his name we run our Kickstarters. He didn't write anything here though, nor does he handle anything creatively. Please do not @ him about Nemissaries, ghouls, souls or other such fluff, but do @ him about deliveries, shipping and fulfilment. \nFor those of you looking to add more to your pledge, we have a few options available at a lower price than their usual RRP - at the moment, these are, but not limited to;\n\n SINS: The Core Rulebook:  For anyone who missed out, the 360-page, full-colour standalone rulebook can be added to a Manifest Destiny Pledge to complete your collection. Add-on Price: \u00a335/$45 \n\n SINS GM Screen: A Four-Panel, high-quality GM Screen, illustrated with the SINS Creed symbol, a Destroyer-form Nemissary, and a hiding assailant. The reverse includes everything you could possibly need whilst running SINS, from weapons tables and basic rule recaps, to random encounter inspirations and prompt tables. Add-on Price: \u00a312/$15 \n\n SINS: Dead City: A 36-page, softback prequel adventure that acts as a Quickstart guide to SINS as players play through the beginning of The Fall. A physical copy is the perfect way to kick off any SINS campaign. Add-on Price: \u00a36/$8 \n\n Bone White D6: These beautiful D6 dice, cast in bone-white with Crimson Inlays have proven insanely popular since we unveiled them as part of the original launch Kickstarter - the Creed symbol upon the 6 clearly holds power. Add some to your pledge to get rolling in style. Add-on Price: \u00a32/$2.50 or \u00a315/$20 for 10. \n\n Dice Tray: Ensure your dice don't tumble away with this crimson, skull-print neoprene All-Rolled Up\u2122 Dice Tray. Add-on Price: \u00a38/$10 \n\n Dice Bag: A perfect accompaniment to our dice, this white pouch is marked with a single, stark red skull. Add-on Price: \u00a35/$6.50 \n\n Messenger Bag: A black shoulder-strap messenger bag, marked with the SINS skull. This is not the Park Rangers messenger bag that comes included with the Voidglass Tier pledge.  Add-On Price: \u00a325/$33 \n\n Face Mask: Keep stragglers away with this face mask, printed with the snarling maw of a Broodspawn. Add-on Price: \u00a315/$20 \n\n All Rolled-Up: Keep your stuff together in the Post-Apocalypse, with this pocketed, crimson red All-Rolled Up carrying sleeve.

Towards the end of the 21st century, the third world war, which became known as the Resource War, pushed mankind to the brink of destruction and brought ruin to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Small pockets of humanity survived this horrific conflict, eventually forming the eleven metropolises. These incredible mega-cities have since grown and prospered, largely due to developments in atmospheric processing and significant technological advancements. Now cut off from each other, these heaving urban landscapes must each face their own difficulties and hardships. The Gaia Complex focuses on the largest of these metropolises; New Europe, a single sprawling city that covers much of what we currently know as mainland Europe. New Europe is a world of street violence, corporate espionage, vampiric uprisings and an overzealous A.I., known as Gaia, which functions as the city\u2019s governor and the protector of its citizens.\nThe Gaia Complex is a dystopian world of urban violence, exploring the age of cybernetic enhancement through a vision of Earth that is somehow \u2018changed\u2019. This vision of the future injects both vampires and a strange species of people known as ferals, who are able to enter the minds of animals. This is a game of conspiracy and brutality, where players take on the roles of Mercs; former police officers, hackers and street-savvy dealers who are hired to fight back against the system and ultimately unravel the secrets of The Gaia Complex.\nOf course we'd love you to back this campaign and be a part of making The Gaia Complex a reality, but before you do, maybe you want to give it a whirl for yourself? Good news - you can do this right now.\nWhile this campaign and the updates throughout will talk about the game setting and rules, our free (well, 'pay what you want', but please, enter \u00a30 and just grab a copy!) 48-page Quick Start for The Gaia Complex is out right now and will allow you to read and play for yourselves. This PDF contains a huge amount of lore surrounding the game, offering an in-depth insight to the world of The Gaia Complex and what it means to be a Merc in 2119. In addition, the booklet is jammed full of gorgeous artwork and gives you a good idea of what to expect from the full core book.\nGo and grab your copy of the Quick Start by clicking this link (or the image below). \nThe cast of playable characters from the Quick Start\nThe Gaia Complex core book will be 'at least' 256 pages of full-colour hardback beauty - take a look at the Quick Start for a general idea about how it will look. We say 'at least' as we have a whole host of extra content that we might just squeeze in, either through stretch goals, or becuase we end up deciding certain things just need to be there. \nAt the time of launch, the core book writing is roughly 90% complete and layout for final proof-reading has already been completed for some chapters - this is a significant strength for this project, having completed so much of the writing ahead of launch. Artwork at this point is around 40% complete and new art is in the pipeline to be finished (and shown off) during the campaign. The art direction for this book is very important and great care is being taken to ensure the visuals support the writing as closely as possible.\nThe structure of the book is split over 12 chapters, plus an NPC (non-player character) library at the end. We'll go into more detail about the chapters over the coming weeks via the campaign updates, sharing some key information as we go. Alongside the rules, background and resources for playing the game, the book also includes multiple pieces of short fiction that slowly unfold the real story behind The Gaia Complex. These stories, and the characters they describe, lay the foundation for the world in which the game is set and allow us to explore New Europe in 2119 in much more cinematic detail. \nThe engine behind The Gaia Complex is called 12.3 and can be taken for a test drive in our Quick Start by clicking HERE.\nThe basis of the system uses 2d12 (that's two twelve sided dice - but you're all roleplayers, so I'm sure you knew that!) to make the majority of tests on a 'roll under' basis. Whenever a test is required, the GM determines a potential difficulty for the test, ranging from 1 (easy for a child to accomplish) to 11 (impossibly hard). A character will compare the difficulty to their relevant statistic and if the stat is equal to or greater than the difficulty, the test is a success - There is an emphasis in the game on keeping the action flowing and not making tests unless they are really needed. \nIf the character's stat is less than the difficulty, a test is required: the player rolls 2d12, requiring a result that is equal to or less than their relevant stat. An 11 fails (without cybernetic enhancement) and a 12 is a Critical Failure. To pass, a character requires one or both d12s to succeed depending on whether they are skilled or unskilled - The Gaia Complex does not consider 'ranks' in various skills like the majority of RPGs, instead a character either possesses a skill or does not (though becoming a specialist in certain skills is possible).\nDuring combat, d3s are also used to determine damage - you can use funky d3s like the ones available on this campaign, or simply use common d6. The engine for the game uses d3s to enable a more consistant result when rolling multiple dice together and to remove the chance of whiffing a result of a 1 in situations that should always achieve a minium degree of success (thus 3d3+3 damage represents a weapon with more consistent output than one that does 1d12 damage) .\nOf course, the game includes many other rules - some core, some optional - covering a huge array of options, but at its root, the game falls back on 12.3 to keep it rolling (pun intended).\nDuring the course of the campaign we'll dedicate a couple of updates to specific areas of the rules and give you a deep dive into them beyond what you can get your hands on in the Quick Start.  \nCharacters in The Gaia Complex are known as Mercs. At their core, Mercs are citizens of New Europe who have chosen to rebel against the system and take up arms by making themselves available on the freelance market. The seedy clubs and bars of NeoMunich are the most common place to find Mercs and while their work is entirely illegal, there is enough anonymity that it isn't worth the expenditure of resources for Gaia or its police force to worry about shutting down the network.\nMost Mercs are hired to run jobs against one of the many corporations in the metropolis. From hacking R&D servers to kidnapping, assassinating or Bio Hacking company execs; there are few limits when it comes to taking a job. Ironically, the primary employers are the corporations themselves, all looking to get a leg up over their rivals, employing Mercs to do the dirty work in order to maintain complete deniability. Of course, it's not just the heaving corporations that are the enemy; outsider vampires that lurk in the subway tunnels and outer fringes of the metropolis, the cybernetic police force controlled by the LE1 A.I. subsystem, or even Gaia itself - the all seeing ruler of the metropolis - everyone is a potential mark if the score looks big enough!\nThe core rules contains a detailed character creation process, allowing players to play either human or feral (a mysterious group of people who can enter the minds of the metropolis' animals) characters from one of ten varied roles, each with their own unique rules, benefits and style. Characters can choose from:\n Operator - Former law enforcement, corporate security and guns-for-hire that pack the hottest weapon tech that the black market has to offer.\n Core Hacker - Hackers and coders who live their lives in the digital pathways of The Core. \n Bio Hacker - A new wave of hacker, dedicated to hacking the cybernetic brains of their targets and inducing 'forced servitude'.\n ParaMed - Former TactaMed paramedics who have realised they can earn more money patching up Mercs by being one of them!\n CyberDoc - Back-alley hackjob specialists and cybernetic installers. An often riskier, but cheaper approach, to main stream cybernetics clinics.\n MilTech - Weapons techs, tinkerers and specialist drone pilots. MilTechs keep the team's gear working and provide invaluable technical support.\n Mech - Drivers, pilots and expert mechanics. Mechs keep the metropolis rolling and give Merc teams much needed access to reliable transportation.\n Tech Trader - Black market dealers, handling everything from illegal weapons and stolen cybernetics, to narcotics and false credentials.\n Data Dealer - Information traffickers and dealers of stolen secrets. If there is something worth knowing, you can probably buy it... for a price.\n Handler - Exclusive to ferals. Handlers have dedicated themselves to honing the feral's ability to step into the mind of an animal. This is the feral in their purest form.\nWe'll be taking a more in-depth look into each of these roles as the campaign unfolds.\nData Dealer - Mech - Tech Trader - Core Hacker\n\nWe have deliberately gone with a minimal number of add-ons for this campaign. The focus of this Kickstarter is the core book and getting carried away with a whole host of extras is not the way we wanted to go. The following few items can be added to any pledge by simply increasing your pledge amount by the required amount. After the campaign, you will be able to confirm which add-ons you want for your money in the pledge manager.\nOnce the campaign has funded, we will be revealing a number of stretch goals. All of the stretch goals associated with this project will be related to additional book content - namely art and additional writing - plus the possibility of a few luxury upgrades to the physical print. We will not be adding stretch goals that include other physical items, with the aim of keeping the manufacturing and fulfilment of this project as swift and simple as possible. \nPlease come and follow us for extra content and conversation - You can find us in the following places by clicking the links below:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nOfficial Website\nEvery social like, follow, post and share provides more momentum, more eyes on the campaign and potentially more backers. Our greatest assest in promoting the campaign, unlocking stretch goals and ultimately making a success of The Gaia Complex, is you - our backers. Please help to get the word out, we appreciate the support more than we can possibly express.\nInterview with Mildred The Monk, discussing the Quick Start, the background and Shep's approach to game design:\n Testimonials\n \"I love the art and feel of The Gaia Complex and the rules are great, dice rolling that means something, without taking over or pulling the players out of the moment.\" - Mark Rapson, Nightfall Games/Word Forge Games\n \"Excellent mechanics, in-depth and well thoughtout world building and looks gorgeous. Also, Shep is a very handsome man! Insta-back!\" - Robb Butler, Dice Sports\nShipping... oh, my old nemesis! The state of global shipping at the time of this campaign going live is very much 'up in the air'. While most national postal services are getting close to resuming 'normal' operation following the initial COVID crisis, international shipments to many places are currently attracting very high tarrifs and long delays.\nAs we won't be shipping this book until next year, we are very hopeful that international shipping will have stabilised somewhat, both in terms of cost and reliability. In order to address this as best we can, we will not be charging shipping during the campaign and will not open the campaign's pledge manager to collect shipping until we are closing in on shipping your rewards.\nDO NOT ADD MONEY FOR SHIPPING NOW. SHIPPING WILL BE CALCULATED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN BY THE PLEDGE MANAGER AND WILL BE CHARGED WHEN WE ARE CLOSE TO SHIPPING.\nBy handling shipping in this manner it ensures you are not over charged by needing to pay the current high tarrifs and allows us to better adjust our shipping strategy based on the state of the fulfilment industry at the time.\nDue to this fact, it is very hard to provide accurate postage costs for your pledges, but the following values should serve as a benchmark, based on our fulfilment partner's (GMS) projections for the months ahead. These prices are based on shipping a single copy of the core book (plus a set of dice and art prints if you feel so inclined), but backing for multiples copies of the book may incur higher costs...\n UK: \u00a37\n EU: \u00a310\n US: \u00a315\n AU/CA: \u00a325\n Rest of the world: \u00a330\nIMPORTANT: these values may differ when we come to charge for shipping. Rest assured, as we close on on fulfilment we will ensure everyone is updated with accurate pricing. Some areas, such as the US, are currently enforcing very large tariffs on shipping which is effecting the prices to ship parcels there. We hope that by the time we come to ship your rewards, tariffs such as these may have been reduced.\nThough we are able to ship to most places (there are a few exceptions below), we are currently positioned to be able to ship UK, EU and US 'friendly' packages, meaning that backers in those territories will have thier packages shipped from within those territories, in order to avoid incurring additional fees beyond the shipping we charge. While we are investigating offering this service for other territories, we are unable to make any promises at the moment. All other destinations will have their packages shipped from the UK.\nIMPORTANT: we are currently unable to ship to the following countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan and Brazil - we apologise to potential backers in these locations.\nParcels to these locations will not incur additional fees, such as import duty.\nAll PDF/digital rewards will be fulfilled via DriveThruRPG... \nAll PDF/digital rewards will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough all Kickstarters come with some element of unseen risk, the team behind this project are well positioned to deliver on-time and as promised.\n\nAt the time of launch, the book is roughly 90% written, with a complete and heavily tested rules system, putting it well ahead of where one would consider a typical RPG book to be at the time of launching a kickstarter campaign. While there is a still a large amount of art to be completed, once again, the amount already finished is ahead of our initial expectations and puts us in a great place to complete on time. The funds raised will go towards completing the art in a timely manner to the expected quality, as well as the manufacturing of the physical rewards.\n\nBoth manufacturing and fulfilment are lined up and are being done with companies where we have an existing relationship, having printed and delivered books and games around the world previously. Given that The Gaia Complex is a new IP, we made the decision to run a 'simple' campaign, free from a long list of add-ons and physical rewards to allow us to move through the manufacturing and fulfilment process with relative ease and with minimal chance for complication.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nHigh quality printing with the best possible binding.

The equipment chapter offers a wide range of tools to aid an agent\u2019s investigation. There is also a unique requisition and inventory system to make your gear selection run smooth and simply.\nCan't make it to your RPG session? Don't worry, with the Backup Agents system you can still be involved with the game. Just like the board game, Backup Agents can be called in when things are getting tough to help the team. \nAs well as a new agent, fresh to the B.P.R.D. there is also the option to play as legendary characters, like Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Johann Kraus and, of course, Hellboy himself! These are all pre-generated characters and are a great place for newcomers to start, especially if they\u2019ve never experienced an RPG but want the thrill of punching a frog monster with the Right Hand of Doom.\nAs the GM, you\u2019ll be able to create smaller case files or an entire chronicle, packed with twists and turns. Tell your own adventures set within the inspirational Mignola-verse and use your favourite Hellboy: The Boardgame miniatures of iconic villains to represent the monstrous challenges you must face, like the insidious frog monsters or Rasputin himself. \nDuring play, the GM and players will be able to add to the narrative through the innovative Doom and Ingenuity system. Doom is generated when players fail certain tests and gives the GM a pool of resources they can spend to advance the Grand Conspiracy or provide a narrative twist. Meanwhile, Ingenuity shines when agents pass a test with a stroke of brilliance. Ingenuity has a range of uses to help players solve the mission.\nJust like the boardgame, you\u2019ll have all you need to begin your adventures in the world of Hellboy and the B.P.R.D. The 240-page book contains all the rules you\u2019ll need for learning 5th Edition, along with detailed instructions on creating your character and an epic Case File to play through. Check out the chapter breakdown below to see what\u2019s inside. \nGet a taste for the game with the quick start, which includes an example scenario and pre-generated characters ready to hit the tabletop. The quickstart is a great taste of the full Hellboy: The Roleplaying Game experience and, although it doesn't contain all the unique and special rules that make the RPG so engaging, it provides a fantastic starting point.\n Here you can find what will be inside the full version of the game.\n Join Mantic, Needy Cat Games and Red Scar in our play through of the scenario from the quickstart.

With this project, the writing is almost finished but will need final sign off from Dark Horse Comics and Mike Mignola. Once signed off, it will them be laid out and that will also need to be signed off. We have worked with Dark Horse and Mike Mignola on Hellboy: The Board Game, so don't anticipate this being an issue. The dice need to be tooled and then manufactured, the miniatures are already tooled and will just need to be manufactured. \n\nWe predict that we will begin shipping in May 2021 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes. \n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 18 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War, DreadBall Second Edition, Star Saga: The Eiras Contract, Warpath, TerrainCrate, Kings of War: Vanguard, Hellboy: The Board Game and TerrainCrate 2.

Tackle the twists and turns of a rally course, racing against the clock to get the best time and take the trophy!\nRoll your dice to navigate the track as fast as you can, but beware of getting too many warnings or you\u2019ll spin out!\nRallyman: Dirt is an addictively simple rally game with a lot of strategic depth. Drift around sharp turns, take jumps, cross water hazards and cut corners to shave as many seconds from your time as you can, but don\u2019t push your luck too far...\n Here is a rundown of the different pledge levels available in the campaign. \nThe DRIVER PLEDGE includes a copy of the base game of Rallyman: DIRT, along with a free expansion: 110% ! The \"Co-Pilot Pack\" refers to all of the extra Kickstarter content that will be made available through the Daily Unlocks, and is automatically included in the pledge. \n The SPONSOR PLEDGE includes a copy of the base game of Rallyman: DIRT, along with all of the expansions! The \"Co-Pilot Pack\" refers to all of the extra Kickstarter content that will be made available through the Daily Unlocks, and is automoatically included in the pledge. \nThe GEARHEAD PLEDGE is our all in mega pledge for serious drivers! It includes a copy of the base game of Rallyman: DIRT, along with all of the games expansions. It also includes the base game of Rallyman: GT and all of its expansions ! The \"Co-Pilot Pack\" refers to all of the extra Kickstarter content that will be made available through the Daily Unlocks, and is automoatically included in the pledge. \nThe \"Adrenaline Pack\" included in the Rallyman: GT content refers to all of the Kickstarter content from the Rallyman: GT campaign.  \n\nYou'll find more information on the Rallyman: GT content at the bottom of the page.\nFor more information in how to include add-ons in your pledge, see the Add-ons section at the bottom of the page.\n A long-awaited new edition of the classic 2009 game combining the original Rallyman with its Dirt expansion into one action-packed game!\nA fast, exciting racing game with simple mechanics and rules.\nStunning design and high quality components.\nHexagonal tiles allow players to create their own rally courses.\nA 1-6 player game lasting around 45 minutes.\n  Rallyman: Dirt tracks are made of hexagonal tiles that you may set up however you wish! You can either use one of the tracks included in the rulebook or invent your own in a flash. With 31 double-sided tiles to choose from, the possibilities are endless!\n Once track setup is complete, the rally begins on the starting line. Players will set off one by one, staggering their departures.\n Rallyman: Dirt is a roll and move rally game. So, to move, you\u2019ll be rolling dice!\nThe base mechanic of the game is very simple: 1 die = 1 space of movement.\nEach of the 6-sided dice you\u2019ll be using to move has one or more Warning signs /!\\. Rolling a Warning sign still allows you to move, but if you accumulate too many in one turn you\u2019ll spin out, losing precious time and potentially taking damage to your car\u2026\nAt the start of their turn, the active player plans out their trajectory by placing their dice on the track, following the route they plan to take.\nThere are three types of dice to choose from.\nThe Black Gear dice represent your car\u2019s gears, and are numbered from 1 to 6. Each one lets you move one space along the track. These dice must be rolled in ascending and/or descending order, and each die can only be rolled once per turn.\nThe White Coast dice allow you to maintain the same speed for one extra space per die. There are only two, so use them wisely\u2026\nThe Red Brake die drastically reduces your speed in one move when used along with a Gear die. Instead of dropping gears one space at a time you can use the Break die to \"skip\" a gear, for example taking you down from gear 5 to gear 3 in one space. As it must be rolled at the same time as the speed you wish to brake down to though, it does increase your risk of spinning out\u2026\nThere\u2019s also a fourth type: the Leader dice. You can\u2019t choose to use these, rather they replace the Coast dice of the first player each round. They function identically to Coast dice but include an additional Warning sign /!\\. This represents the difficulty of being the first driver to hit a rally stage! The leader will be clearing loose dirt and debris that make the course trickier to navigate, therefore making it easier for the drivers that come after.\nHowever, the first player gets to impose other penalties onto the drivers following them during the Stage... \nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your trajectory by laying your dice out on the track, you\u2019ll have a choice to make. You can choose to either roll your dice one by one, which allows you to end your turn whenever you choose if you\u2019re getting too many Warning signs /!\\ .\nOr, if you\u2019re feeling lucky, you can choose to go Flat Out, and roll all of your dice at once! Flat Out manoeuvres allow you to gain the same number of Second tokens as the number of Gear and Coast/Leader dice you rolled.\nSecond tokens are a precious resource and can be used in two ways. You can spend Second tokens during the game to secure your dice rolls - automatically passing them without the risk of getting a Warning sign /!\\. However, any Second tokens you don\u2019t use can be spent at the end of the Stage to reduce your overall time, which can make a big difference!\n If you get three or more Warning signs /!\\ in your roll, then you spin out! The consequences of a Loss of Control are determined by the gear you were in at the time, and the Danger level of the tile you were driving on.\n These Damage tokens are drawn at random from a bag and have different effects, from changing the weather conditions to giving you less dice to roll. Damage tokens are cumulative, and while some stages of a rally allow you to repair your car before moving on, others don\u2019t, so don\u2019t let them add up too much!\n The base mechanics of Rallyman: Dirt are simple, but the game has a lot of strategic depth to it that will make you want to get it to the table again and again.\nThe tracks contain some interesting challenges, from sharp turns to full-blown obstacles like bumps and even water! These tricky elements are represented by special spaces, which have speed limitations and specific conditions that drivers must adhere to in order to cross them safely.\nFor example, corners may only be taken at a certain speed. Considering that you may only roll each available die once per turn, these speed limitations mean you have to plan your moves around them.\n Corners in DIRT can either be taken sharply or by drifting around them. You can even start and end your corners early or late by sliding into them, giving you more options to control your speed and distance.\nSome corners can be cut through completely but you run the risk of blowing a tire or messing up the track for the drivers that follow (wouldn\u2019t that be a shame?). \n Jumps can potentially gain you some extra distance by allowing you to jump over one or more spaces if you take them at the right speed! Don\u2019t go too fast though!\n Water hazards must be crossed while maintaining the same speed: if you attempt to change speed while crossing, your car might stall.\n In Rallyman: Dirt, the aim is to tackle the track as quickly as possible! The Gear in which you end your turn is very important, as it determines how many seconds you add to your time.\nAt the end of your turn, you will take a Time card of the number that corresponds to the Gear you ended your movement in. Each of these cards sports a value in seconds that will be added together to calculate your track time at the end of the Stage.\n Ending your turn in 5th Gear will add fewer seconds to your time than ending your turn in 2nd Gear, but of course, hitting high speeds on tricky parts of the course may not always be possible... or a good idea...\n At the end of the game, each player adds up the combined value of their Time cards to get their overall time. They can then subtract the value of any Second tokens they have left to reduce their time.\nThe player with the fastest time wins!\nBut, it doesn't end there...\nA game of Rallyman: DIRT doesn\u2019t have to stop after a single track however. You can count it as just one of the Stages in your own rally event!\nA rally is normally composed of multiple stages. Playing out not just a single stage but a full competition will push your Rallyman: DIRT experience to the limit as, over the course of multiple stages, every choice and move you make can have a big effect on your drive for the podium!\nA bad score on one Stage can be compensated for with a particularly good time on the next one. Risks that you would normally take without hesitation in the context of a one-off race become much more debatable when you know you won\u2019t be able to repair after the stage so any damage to your car will be sticking around for a while!\nThe number of stages and the tracks you use is completely up to you and your imagination! But, of course, the rulebook will provide you with more than enough to get you started!\nAlso you don\u2019t have to play your rally in one sitting! DIRT is perfectly structured so that you can play it over multiple sessions and even have more than one on the go at once!\nIf you\u2019re ready to roll, then strap in because there\u2019s more than a few Drivers ready to meet you on the track!\nRallyman has had an active and passionate community since its original release in 2009, something we\u2019ve been very careful to respect and foster since we took the game on.\nWith the release of GT, you\u2019ll find a bustling community online, whether it\u2019s on the BoardGameGeek Forums or different social media groups, Gearheads have been coming together from all around the world to talk all things Rallyman!\nThe community has produced some superb content, from custom rules modules to 3D printed scenery, car paint jobs and more! Not to mention that if you\u2019re looking for people to play with, look no further than one of the many online races and time trial events being hosted in multiple languages all year round!\nPart of Rallyman\u2019s success stems from the passion of it fans and we can\u2019t thank them enough for the support they\u2019ve shown us. If the idea of taking an exciting board game and sharing you experiences with players around the world intrigues you, you\u2019ll find yourself right at home with the Rallyman community.\nWe intend to keep increasing our publisher support, growing it along with the community!\nFlat Out! is a monthly newsletter that we created in order to give a voice to the community and communicate directly with Rallyman fans everywhere.\nIn it we feature everything from Player created content, insights and articles from the author, track design competitions and more! We also use it to inform people of any FAQ and Errata changes which we\u2019re sure to keep up to date with.\nFlat Out! is currently on its 3rd issue and if you\u2019d like to check them out, they\u2019re accessible here!\n Some of you may not be coming to this campaign as fresh faced as others. Some of you may already know the joys of passing a big flat out roll and the sorrow of wiping out just before the finish line!\nFor those of you coming from the original Rallyman\n Two in one: This new edition combines the original Rallyman from 2009 with its Dirt expansion into one lean, mean rally game.\n   The same...but not entirely: The rules feature some \u201cquality of life\u201d improvements that stem from both the author and feedback from Rallyman:GT. That aside though, most of you won\u2019t even need to read half the rulebook.\n   New horizons: Whilst a lot of you will be familiar with the experience this new edition provides, what will catch you off guard is its scope. Its tile system, car categories and other expansion content give you access to a game whose possibilities extend FAR beyond that of the original.\n   The scale: Everything in this new version is 1:144 scale so, for those of you that purchased the original metal cars, they won\u2019t be wasted here!\n  For those of you coming from Rallyman: GT\nWhile its core mechanics remain the same, Dirt offers a very different gaming experience!\n You VS The Road : In Rallyman: Dirt players are up against the clock, not one another. The game features less interaction as your focus should be on the track, not the other cars... until one of them catches up to you.\n   The way of the rally: Dirt Stages simulate the unique challenges of rally driving, with water hazards, bumpy roads and muddy corners that are sure to keep you on your toes! You\u2019ll soon find that the difficulty of these elements doesn\u2019t come from their individual rules but from how they influence the possibilities of the tiles around them.\n   A whole new driving style : Rallyman: Dirt gives you a wide array of new manoeuvres to use from skidding to jumping and cutting corners. You\u2019ll need to use every single one of them as with access to less brake dice and the emphasis on maintaining a high speed, you\u2019ll find DIRT to be a very strategic experience that you won\u2019t master overnight!\n   Compatibility: More will be revealed as the project goes on but DIRT was designed to be fully compatible with GT. So, if you own both, you\u2019ll be able to experience some new and unique race types!\nYou can find the BETA version of the rulebook here! Even though we've had a lot of feedback already, we welcome any constructive suggestions that can help us make it even better!\nCurrently only the Engish version of the rules is available. We are working on getting other languages translated.\nYou can also try out the game on Tabletopia!\n Want a closer look under the hood of Rallyman: Dirt? We'll be posting plenty of video content over the course of the campaign from both ourselves and reviewers around the world!\nHere's a link to our first live chat about Rallyman: DIRT, which includes a full playthrough of the game :\nIf you speak Spanish, you can also check out this brilliant preview by Juegos de Mesa 221b :\nYou can also check out this playlist of playthroughs and reviews of DIRT's predecessor: GT!\nUp until now, our campaigns have followed the standard practice of including Stretch Goals (finance based unlocks) and Kickstarter Exclusives (content not available outside of the campaign). This will be our first campaign where neither of these are present.\nInstead, we'll be revealing free content every day (don't want to spoil the surprise all at once!) which will be part of either the 110% Expansion or the Co-Pilot pack. 110% is an expansion that will be available in stores and the Co-Pilot pack will be avilable directly from HGG's webstore after the campaign has been fulfilled. However, backers of this campaign will be recieving both of these for FREE (Savings of around \u20ac35 compared to MSRP).\nAll other content available during this campaign will also be released into retail after the campaign has been fulfilled but at a normal retail price (20-30% more expensive).\nWe've done this as we have always wanted our games to have a life after their KS campaigns and, after feedback from players who purchased the retail version, we found that our prior practices were effectively \"locking out\" a significant part of our player base from the full experience.\nWith this new system we've tried to make sure that no player is left out whilst still providing a strong incentive for those of you that want to support that campaign and help us make this game!\nWe have a variety of additional content for DIRT that we'll be revealing over the course of the campaign! New content will be released on Wednesdays and Fridays (see the daily unlocks schedule) so keep an eye on the updates then! \n\nYou can also purchase content for Rallyman: GT during this campaign! We'll be applying the same new concept for exclusive content (as explained above) to everything from the Rallyman:GT campaign. You can get everything from the previous campaign, including all of the Kickstarter exclusive content. \nThe \"Adrenaline Pack\" featured below refers to all of the Kickstarter exclusive content from the Rallyman: GT campaign. If you have already purchased Rallyman: GT in retail or were planning on doing so, this pack can be purchased separately during the Pledge Manager of this campaign. \nPlease note that Rallyman: GT is already available in stores in most English and French speaking countries. Please consider supporting your FLGS by purchasing the game from them. The price is comparable and you'll be getting it a lot quicker!\n\n\nWe're also making a small Errata pack for Rallyman: GT avilable for this campaign. It contains:\nThe tiles that were missing their Danger levels.\nThe corrected GT6 (Team Challenge) and GT5 BOP soft tire Dashboards\nThe corrected blue Soft tire token.\nThe 3 GT5 models with the correct colours\nWe wanted to make this available to previous backers in as fair a manner as possible so please note that this Errata pack is sold at cost. HGG makes no money from it.\nThis corrected content ONLY concerns Kickstarter content from the previous campaign. You do not need to purchase this if you are buying the \"Adrenaline pack\" during this campaign. If you are buying this errata pack along with other content then it should not cost any extra in shipping. Purchasing it on it's own will incur a small shipping cost depending on your region.\nHow do I include Add-ons in my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page.\n2. On the next screen, click on the blue \u201cChange your pledge\u201d button.\n3.

A new window will appear, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button.\n5. It\u2019s done!\n6. After the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us exactly what you\u2019d like to purchase.\nYou can also get EVERYTHING for both GT and DIRT in the GEARHEAD pledge \n The rules for Rallyman: Dirt are those of the original Rallyman with some small tweaks and \u201cquality of life\u201d improvements from GT . So, between both of these past games we had a very good base on which to build the rules for DIRT. The rules document (that you can see above) is basically complete with only minor corrections and graphical elements needed to complete it.\nWe\u2019re still working on a few elements in terms of illustration but You can get a complete idea of the game\u2019s style and the look of each of its component here on this page.\nDIRT, as a product, will be very comparable to GT. Therefore, we'll be going through a familiar process when it comes to pre-production and manufacturing so we don't expect any issues whatsoever. \n Jean-Christophe Bouvier is an iconic figure in the French boardgaming scene. As a Rally driver himself, he wanted to make a game that represented his passion for motorsports.\nJo\u00eblle Drans is a budding artist who hasn't been working in the board game industry for long, but she's already leaving her mark! An extremely talented illustrator and graphic designer, she has already worked on a number of Holy Grail Games creations, including her beautiful Art Deco work on Museum: Pictura. She also fully illustrated the Polish edition of Roads to Rome. \nLo\u00efc Muzy is an Illustrator and character-design specialist who has worked on multiple HGG games (including Rallyman: GT) as well as projects within the Videogame, Wargame and Role Playing game industry. He's especially known for his work on the Call of Cthulhu series.\nMindwork Games is a small Italian company born in 2015 by the creative brain of Matteo Di Diomede. Combining a taste for the bizarre with an unquestionable love for art, Mindwork Games started off creating unique series of modeling kits in high quality resin. Its \"Signature Series\", launched in 2020, features collaborations with some of the finest fantasy artists in the world - to give a three-dimensional shape to their artworks. Today, Mindwork Games has become a creative team that cooperates with other companies to create exclusive concepts, drawings and sculptures.\n Here at Holy Grail Games, our motto  is to always offer something you haven\u2019t seen before! Whether it\u2019s  Museum\u2019s incredible quantity of beautiful artwork, Titan\u2019s 3D design or  Dominations\u2019 unique take on Civ games, we aim to bring something fresh  and exciting to everything we make.\nHoly Grail Games is a small team, and we\u2019re lucky to be able to work  on projects we\u2019re passionate about in a professional environment that\u2019s  relaxed and friendly. As well as collaborating with incredibly talented  game designers and illustrators from all over the world for our  projects, we also work closely with local playtesters and fans to make  our games the best they can be.\nHoly Grail Games is based in the small city of Nancy, France. Our  team is a mixture of people from different backgrounds and professions,  but one thing we all have in common is a passion for what we do!\n\n\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done  our best to keep the costs as low as possible. After the campaign has  concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nThe chart above shows the estimated cost of shipping the game to your  region for each of the pledge levels. Please note that ordering  multiple copies will increase these costs. For regions 1, 2 and 3 the  shipping cost of each additional copy should be about 50% of the first.\nFor RoW orders with multiple copies or particularly large orders: we will have to use particular courier services that  will be more expensive than usual. If this concerns you and you would  like a more accurate quote of your shipping you can message us and we  will endeavor to provide you with one ASAP.\nNote that these costs are barring any unforeseen circumstances outside of our control.\nExact costs will be indicated during the pledge manager phase but we are confident that the numbers shown here are a very good estimation of the final price.\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by July 2021. This may seem like a  long time given the advanced state of the game, however, knowing the  intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd  rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to  avoid disappointment.\n\"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada. Please note that you may be liable for import duties for other destinations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first Kickstarter. This is HGG's 9th project so we are very familiar with the running and fulfilment of a KS project as well as where to look for any potential pitfalls. We currently have three other ongoing Kickstarter projects: Titan, Museum Deluxe Version and Museum: Pictura. Each one is currently in pre-production. We are active on each page, providing regular updates, answering questions and generally keeping our backers informed at each stage of the project.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating a July 2021 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to deliver before this date and/or ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Stripe fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR\n\nWe always welcome feedback and constructive criticism of our projects and games and strive to run a fun and welcoming campaign.

We want each new addition to stand on its own, but be compatible with one another so as to give you guys as many different racing experiences as we can!\n\nWith this in mind, we went back to the original GT rulebook, not just to integrate the feedback we\u2019ve received since the game\u2019s release last year, but also to create a good foundation for what would be following in its wake. This includes making sure that the structure, terminology and general spirit of the rulebook could be used in any racing setting. The goal of this is that whatever Rallyman you pick up in the future feels and plays like a Rallyman game should.\n\nBefore we get into what has changed, rest assured that a lot of these changes have already been integrated into the RM:DIRT rulebook you folks currently have access to and we hope to present you with a more advanced version very soon.\n\n\nOne of the core mechanics of Rallyman is how the turn order is decided each round. For GT that\u2019s Speed > Distance > Position. Distance refers to how far along the track a player is, and to the existing text we\u2019ve added the following line:\n\n\n\nThis is a very minor change in terms of determining the turn order and in that respect isn\u2019t even needed. However, by referring to the front edge of the car\u2019s space we can easily clarify some other situations, such as Fast Lanes.\n\n\nWhilst the original rule did have the advantage of being simple, there are some rare situations where it becomes too much of a hindrance for those in no way involved or near to the Loss of Control that caused it.\n\nSo, at the cost of slightly complicating the rule, we\u2019ve made it much more thematic and less impactful on players not in the vicinity of the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re big believers in gaming aids as tools to help speed up gameplay. However, the ones in Rallyman didn\u2019t really have enough space to contain a pertinent amount of information on each element. It was still passable in English but in other language versions the font had to be reduced a lot in order to make things fit.\n\nTherefore, we\u2019re removing the gaming aid cards from future print runs and replacing the illustration on the back of the rulebook with a full page gaming aid that players can pass between them. It includes much more information as well as page numbers for quick-referencing more detailed rules.\n\nThese are the three biggest changes present in this new version but you\u2019ll find all the corrections and clarifications from the FAQ/errata document in the rulebook as well as other things such as the Redline rule.\n\nAlso, this document is not final. We\u2019d love to hear what you have to say about these changes and if you think there\u2019s anything we could make better!\n\n\nThe DIRT campaign included a \u20ac2 errata pack that replaces the handful of errors in the original campaign. Please note that we will not be able to include a printed version of the new booklet in this pack. As you may know, we priced the errata pack at cost. The downside to that is there\u2019s no wiggle room to add anything else to it. We will of course make both a low res and print quality version available for you to download. If we have the possibility of making this updated rule available in a future campaign, we will endeavor to do so.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now folks, see you soon for the DIRT rulebook!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Rallyman: DIRT Production update #3", "update_content": "Greetings drivers,\n\n This month\u2019s update comes in the form of the Flat Out!

Explore a mythic migration-era Europe and beyond, solve mysteries, and do battle with dreadful monsters!\n\n      With writing and rules design from hand-picked 5e and folklore geniuses, and with art from Jon Hodgson and friends, BEOWULF will be a thing of epic wonder. \n\nThe Hermit\u2019s Sanctuary is a free, full-length, introductory adventure for Beowulf: Age of Heroes. We highly recommend you grab a copy and check it out. It's a really good introduction to what we're doing, and you'll get to see a whole bunch of our new rules, our art, maps and graphics.\n Update! We were delighted to learn that The Hermit's Sanctuary is nominated for two ENnies in this year's awards!  \n\nComplete with pre-generated characters, maps, printable accessories, and more, The Hermit\u2019s Sanctuary is entirely free, and shows you the kind of thing we're producing.

This is a reward for being part of our kickstarter, and it will be a selection of useful and beautiful digital content that will expand should we unlock some stretch goals. It'll include things like content generators like \"Hall for a Hero\", battle maps, VTT tokens, pre-generated characters. We've grown it several times through stretch goals, and this will now be delivered in monthly chunks as we finish off the book!\nBEOWULF:Age of Heroes is slightly unusual when it comes to add-ons and accessories. As well as designing, writing, making art, and testing the material for the rulebook, we\u2019ve spent a year working on some beautiful accessories that make play even more enjoyable.     \nWe didn\u2019t want our Kickstarter campaign get caught up in all the fiddly bits that can cause delays. So all of our accessories are ready to go! The pre-production is all done, we just need to know how many we\u2019re making. We\u2019ve taken on that risk so you don\u2019t have to.\nLots of stuff is available right away as an add-on. And we\u2019re aiming to ship all of them at the same time as the core rulebook. For your convenience, we've prepared a PDF catalogue that details the accessories. Download it here.    \nNB: Nothing we\u2019ve made as an accessory is necessary to enjoy BEOWULF: Age of Heroes.

Keep your battle maps pinned down, and North at the top with this absolutely STUNNING, unique Compass Rose.  \nDesigned by Paul Bourne, and made by the geniuses at Campaign Coins, this is something to truly treasure, and is a worthy souvenir of the campaign. Measuring 50mm in diameter, and weighing in at 40g, this is a beautiful chunk of metal. I can safely guarantee this will be the one reward that we will hear about for years to come, especially from people who didn\u2019t get one.\nThe design and tooling work is all done for this amazing piece of treasure.

A set of 5 weighty metal coins, in an antique gold finish featuring beautiful BEOWULF designs by Paul Bourne inset with gems. Ok the gems aren\u2019t real gems. But they look amazing!\nThese tokens can of course be used for any 5e game, or indeed any game at all that requires meaty, gorgeous, knot-whorled coins worthy of HEROES!\nYou can play BEOWULF: Age of Heroes without any kind of special token. Just use coins, beads, or paper chits. But for the special BEOWULF game nights we\u2019ve played? It was worth going the extra mile.   \nThe tokens are 39mm across, and 4mm deep. They each weigh 25 grams. They come in a set of 5. Which gives you 4 for the Inspiration Pool and 1 spare, in case your character wins inspiration separately.\n\n The work on these is complete, we have the first coins on hand. All that remains is to find out how many we\u2019re making.\nIf you\u2019d like a set of 5 BEOWULF inspiration tokens, then simply add the price of the pack to your pledge, or choose a pledge level that includes the pack. You can add as many as you like.\n BEOWULF: Age of Heroes Inspiration Pool Mat Add-on \u00a310/$12.50/\u20ac11\nAs part of the BEOWULF: Age of Heroes ruleset, each Hero has access to a pool of Inspiration. These are divided into tokens they can use for their Followers, Tokens they can use anyway they like, and there is also a deadly pool of dread Monster tokens. How the pool is divided up is determined by the Portent at the outset of the adventure.\nTo track the Pool you can use chits of any kind - coins, beads, ancient Dirrams from old Baghdad you found buried in an Anglo-Saxon pot in your garden\u2026 and three bowls, or three spaces drawn on a piece of paper.\n\n  OR, since you\u2019ll be able to run the same scenario for everyone you know, one on one, and since you can club together with your players, you can indulge yourselves and get this Inspiration Pool Mat. With graphics by Paul Bourne, expertly printed by Patriot Games in the UK on 3mm neoprene, with whip stitched edges, this is the perfect setting for your Inspiration Tokens. It's 21cm/8.25 inches square. Trust us, it\u2019s worth it!\n\n        The work on the Inspiration Pool Mat is all done. We just need to know how many we\u2019re making! If you\u2019d like an Inspiration Mat, then simply add the price of one to your pledge, or choose a pledge level that includes one. You can add as many as you like, but you only need one for a game of BEOWULF: Age of Heroes.\n BEOWULF: Age of Heroes Dice Tray Add-on \u00a312/$15/\u20ac13.5\nOne of the very first products we made at Handiwork Games was dice trays! Partnering with our friends at All Rolled Up, we\u2019ve brought a wide range of different dice trays to market.\n\nAll Rolled Up make fantastic trays that simply clip together at the corners. When unclipped you can fold or roll them very easily for transportation.\n\nFor this Kickstarter we\u2019re offering an exclusive new design! If you\u2019d like a dice tray, simple add the amount shown to your pledge, or choose a pledge that includes one. You can add as many as you would like.\nBEOWULF All Rolled Up Add-on \u00a330/$37/\u20ac34\nTo keep your game-gear safe you need an All Rolled Up! These unique and wonderful dice bag/card holder/pen holder, dice tray holders were designed by Fil of All Rolled Up, and once you\u2019ve used one it\u2019s hard to imagine not owning one. When Fil saw our BEOWULF art, she immediately suggested making All Rolled Ups with some really attractive matching fabric.\nWe're making a special design for the campaign, and the image above is an example of one of our existing ARUs, available on our web store, but it should give you an idea of what to expect.\nThe BEOWULF All Rolled Up is ready to\u2026 roll. All the work is done, we just need to know how many to make. If you\u2019d like one, simply add the price to your pledge, or pick a pledge level that includes one. We'll collect your choice after the campaign in the pledge manager.\nBEOWULF Art Cards Add-on \u00a33/$3.75/\u20ac3.5\nA set of 5 beautiful, heavyweight, glossy art cards, featuring the Beowulf graphics of Paul Bourne. \nThe BEOWULF Art Cards are already printed. If you\u2019d like a set, simply add the price to your pledge, or pick a pledge level that includes one. We'll collect your choice after the campaign in the pledge manager.\nExtra Book - Add-on \u00a336/ $45/ \u20ac40\nThis one is self-explanatory! To get a another copy of the rulebook add on \u00a336/ $45/ \u20ac40.\n HOW DO ADD ONS WORK? \nTo pledge for any of the accessories, pick your pledge, and then check the price of any accessory you'd like to add-on, and simply up your pledge accordingly. Shipping will be calculated in the pledge manager, but will be charged at cost. There's a visual guide here.\nExample:\nWiglaf is browsing the Kickstarter. She definitely wants the rulebook, so she pledges for that, plus the PDF.\n\nBut she also wants a few accessories too. She likes miniatures, so she definitely wants those. She also wants a set of inspiration tokens and mat to use them on.\nSo having pledged for the rulebook, she hits \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d. Wiglaf adds up the total for the extra things she wants, and adds that to her pledge total.\nMiniatures: +\u00a330\nInspiration tokens: + \u00a312\nInspiration pool mat: +\u00a310\nThat\u2019s another \u00a352, which she adds to her pledge amount.\nShe\u2019ll be able to \u201cspend\u201d this extra credit in the pledge manager once the campaign is over, and the additional funds she\u2019s pledged will go towards unlocking cool stuff in stretch goals.\nWhile the campaign is running, if she wants to add some more things she can do this again, helping to unlock even more cool stuff.\nAfter the campaign, she\u2019ll also be able to pledge for more stuff in the pledge manager, if her funds don\u2019t quite stretch right now. But she keeps in mind that later pledges made after the campaign won\u2019t add to unlocking stretch goals. She wants those digital adventures, so she makes her choices wisely! Good ole Wiglaf. \nAt the heart of the game is duet play. One GM, one player. A lone hero exploring the world, uncovering mysteries and battling monsters.\nDuet play means a few things for your game, as our playtesters have discovered to their delight:\n1: It's really easy to set up a game. You only need to sync schedules with one person!\n2: It's really easy to play with two online.\n3: You can focus on the motivations of just one character, and that central character drives the story, and sets the tone. It's easy to make it very much about them, and to explore that one character. \n4: It's very easy to choose how your Hero approaches the world, and create a consistent feel. We're writing our scenarios so that they can be explored without combat, as investigations, and riddles to explore, or as straight-up \"whack the monster\" combat fests.\n5: Given the breadth of playable characters, as the GM you can re-run a scenario many times - even once for each of a larger group. Each time you get better at it, and each time you can explore more of the scenario's possibilities.\n6: BEOWULF provides between-session activity not just for the GM with their prep work, but for the player - their group of followers is developed by the player's downtime creativity!\nBEOWULF: Age of Heroes is certainly not meant as a replacement for group play. We love our group games! But duet games done right are a surprisingly easy way to get an engaging, in-depth, single-character-driven game going. And keep it going. Whether you find it easier to get two people together once a week, you want to introduce a younger friend or family member to rpgs, or if you just use it as a fill-in for when you can't get the whole gang together, there's a lot of advantages to duet play!\nAnd, if everyone ends up loving BEOWULF as much as we do, there are some suggestions in the rules for how to add additional players to the game.  \nThe world of BEOWULF and the Whale Road is a mythic one. It's \"history-adjacent\" but it's not meant to be an accurate reflection of historical Europe. Your adventures take place in a half-remembered land of Anglo-Saxon ancestral stories, just like Beowulf the poem. Many of the place names are familiar, which gives it a certain magic. But the Northern Seas are filled with many, many small kingdoms in need of a hero's help, where almost anything can happen! \nYou'll be able to discover and create it as your story unfolds, with a host of tools to help the GM get the right feel, without being constrained by a need for a degree in Early Medieval studies, and allowing each campaign to be very different.\nIn the original Beowulf poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, travels to Denmark and fights the terrible monster Grendel in King Hrothgar\u2019s hall, tearing off its arm. He must then hunt its mother after she attacks the hall in retribution for Beowulf\u2019s mortal wounding of her son. The poem then tells of Beowulf\u2019s successful turn as a king before he is forced to fight a dragon at the end of his life.\nThe poem is one of the finest epic poems of its kind, the northern equivalent to the Iliad or The Odyssey, and a tale told around fire-sides for centuries.\nBeowulf himself is an epic hero, larger than life, with the strength of thirty men and the ability to fight monsters on land and sea with scant weapons or even his bare hands. He sails his ship to wherever there is trouble, leads his band of followers in pursuit of what is right, and busies himself fighting monsters.\nThrough the poem, we learn of the customs of the Anglo-Saxons, of hospitality and honour, of wide-gabled mead halls and heirloom swords, pattern-welded, bearing ancient names. We learn of the wisdom of kings as gift-givers, and queens as peace-weavers, and how loyalty and bravery are highly prized. It's amazingly atmospheric stuff, and a genuine glimpse into another world.\nThis is the perfect material for a highly evocative, one-GM, one-Player RPG, exploring the myths of migration-era Europe, and beyond!\nWe've adapted the 5th edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game to promote exciting choices and a strongly thematic feel. Created by a big chunk of the team who created the award-winning adaptation of The One Ring Roleplaying Game to 5e, you know you're in safe hands. We've taken everything we learned there, and built on it for BEOWULF. \nWe've published a series of articles about BEOWULF: Age of Heroes on the Handiwork Games website. If you head here, and click on the tabs you can get a more in-depth run down of how it all works.\nWe've added a layer of new material onto the basic 5e rules to enable duet play, and to make the game feel like you're the hero in a \"dark ages\" epic.\nFirst and foremost there's the new Hero class, and six unique subclasses based around attribute scores.\nWe also have a bunch of setting-specific backgrounds. We've rolled the options that usually come with so-called \"race\" into backgrounds - all Heroes are humans, and their characteristics don't vary by where they're born.\nWe have migration era equipment, weapons and armour, which draws on the nature of duet play to introduce some awesome rules features that would be less cool in a multiplayer game. No one wants to spend three quarters of their game watching other players decide whether to break a shield with their beaked axe, or hook a shield with their winged spear. But with one player? Those kinds of extra tactical choices make for exciting and thematic play!\nAnother huge innovation we've spent a long time developing (a really long time. It was really hard!) is Followers. Each hero has a band of companions. Each has a selection of gifts and burdens, which they can use before becoming spent. Like Beowulf's band in the poem, they only come into the spotlight when they have something to do, and then retreat again into the background when they've done their part. Followers are a little bit like spells, and you have to choose carefully when to deploy them, and when to hold them back.  \n We've expanded on inspiration, providing a pool of tokens, tied to a portent created at the outset of any adventure. This system allots tokens to different pools, making them available to the Hero, their followers, or even to the GM to use. Just like basic 5e, you can still only have inspiration or not - you can't stack the tokens. But there's a reserve there to draw from in times of need! It's this fickle hand of fate that marks out a hero!\nAnother key element of the BEOWULF is the \"defeated\" condition. This allows scenarios to set the parameters on when a monster or adversary will no longer fight. Being immune to the condition is what powers most large adversaries, and the hero must find out how to remove that immunity in order to defeat the monster.\nThis also means not every foe needs to be robbed of all their hit points - some lesser foes will be defeated if their shields are smashed, or their leader is wounded. And inflicting the defeated condition on a giant monster might not involve killing it - a wily Hero might be able to inflict the defeated condition with a riddle, or by using the scenery in a location. Although there's always room for just whacking the heck out of the baddies like Beowulf himself does.\nThere's also the concept of player journaling. While the DM is busy creating the next adventure, the player can optionally journal the adventures of their followers, and thereby develop their abilities for good and ill! \nBEOWULF: Age of Heroes is both a setting for adventures and a set of additional rules for 5th Edition. It has been created using the Open Game License. To play, you\u2019ll need at minimum the basic rules, which are available free here. We highly recommend ownership of the core rule books for 5th Edition.\nBEOWULF is firmly embedded in 5th Edition, and so we can't claim compatibility with \"Old School Roleplaying\" (OSR) systems. You will of course find a ton of ideas and insights in BEOWULF, but conversion to OSR will take work. \n The Deluxe version of the rulebook has a faux-leather effect cover, embossed with a beautiful piece of iconography. The image above is one of several designs we're working on. It's going to be absolutely gorgeous, and something utterly envy-inducing! We'll only make enough to fulfill the kickstarter, plus a handful of copies for ourselves. We won't make any more after that, so it's guaranteed to be limited in number. \nWe\u2019ve kept our pledge levels as simple as possible. And they have very straight forward names to help you identify what you\u2019d like.\n\n\u2022 Follow along: for a minimal pledge you get to join in, get backer-only updates, and pledge for add-ons.

Jon will digitally paint your character for you and Jacob will run you through a four-game online game session of BEOWULF. (We'll work with you on specific timing for rewards delivery.) PLUS, you'll get a copy of the Deluxe Everything, as above. \nHandiwork Games was founded in 2019. Owned by Jon Hodgson, former creative director at Cubicle 7. He's joined on the team by Paul Bourne, the super-talented  layout and graphics genius behind The One Ring Roleplaying Game 1st edition. Also on the Handiwork games team is Scott Purdy, who is our in-house artist. Scott has worked for almost every company in the industry!\nOn the writing and rules development side we have Jacob Rodgers, a veteran of 5e design. David Rea, another 5e expert, has helped out tremendously with the conception of the game and a number of rules sections. \nWe are hoping to be joined by further friends should we unlock some stretch goals - we have a selection of diverse names you will doubtless recognise, and some new names we're wanting to help to bring to a wider audience.\nAll the various rules additions are designed and well tested, which we regard as the majority of the work. The draft of the rulebook itself is currently at 75% written. We have a lot of art already made, and the graphic design/layout template is done.\nAt this point we're looking for your support to help us concentrate on the final round of writing and art creation.\nOur art team and layout team are in-house and full time, and our writers are closely-connected freelancers, with whom we have long-established relationships.\nHopefully the Hermit's Sanctuary adventure (available free here) gives you a good idea of how far progressed we are with BEOWULF: Age of Heroes. \nWe will be using a pledge manager after the campaign ends, and we'll collect your funds for shipping there. We undertake to provide shipping at cost, but want to be sure we're not stung by any sudden fluctuations in shipping costs. That protects us, but more importantly you.\nWe've given ourselves plenty of time to finish the project, and as my other kickstarters hopefully demonstrate, I'm committed to transparent communication, on a regular basis.\nShipping will be EU and US friendly. Most rewards will be shipped in bulk to our partners in the EU (if necessary) and the US, to be sent on to you from there. Some rewards, like the art cards are easier for us to deliver via international mail, and some items will be fulfilled by our suppliers. So we'll do that - but all of that is for us to worry about - we aim to keep it as simple as possible for you.\nThe era on which this setting focuses is sadly one that has been sporadically co-opted by some deeply unpleasant and unimaginative extremist groups.\nAnd so we have taken some pains to avoid certain symbols that we do feel are now lost to reasonable people.\nFor example, we have reworked fonts to remove the lightning S. It is simply too distasteful to us. And while migration-era peoples made use of the swastika as a decorative symbol, we certainly will not.\nHowever, we are not content to let this fascinating and engaging period of history and myth be entirely taken over by, and abandoned to, racists.\nWhere we use the term \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d it refers to the varied, historical group of migrants who came to the British Isles in the migration era. It is not intended to refer to, nor is relevant to, any later, outmoded notion of \u201crace\u201d.\n(Isn\u2019t it curious how a group of economic/climate migrants, establishing a middle-eastern religion in the British Isles are so beloved by racists?)\nWe\u2019re also keenly aware that the more we read of history, the more we learn that modern concepts of \u201crace\u201d are heavily informed by historical financial interests that relied on transatlantic slavery.\nIt is wrong to assume that these views were shared by people in the distant past, and we resoundingly encourage others to read and learn as much as possible about these issues.  Recent works like \u201cOrigins of the Anglo-Saxons\u201d by Jean Manco, shine a light on the sheer ridiculousness of modern-day racism.\nWe intend that a portion of each sale of BEOWULF:Age of Heroes once launched, will be donated to anti-racist causes. That way should a racist buy our work, they aid their own undoing.\n(We have to be clear that we are not raising funds for charities or causes with this Kickstarter - simply because that is against Kickstarter\u2019s rules. Once the game is launched, a portion of profits will be shared with anti-racism causes.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAside from all the usual \"if our project lead gets hit by a meteorite\", recent experience has shown our biggest potential delays are from the instability of international shipping. We're doing everything we can in advance to prevent that being an issue.\n\nOur team has several fall-back positions if we lose key staff, but on the whole, we've done so much of the work before reaching out to you for help, we're confident we can overcome most obstacles.\n\nThis is the fifth kickstarter I have run. To date, I have delivered all in good time, with many happy backers. I'd be very happy for you to check those out, and see how we did.\n\nCovid 19 has of course impacted our previous campaign, but I have done everything possible to make sure delivery occurs on time, and I believe my backers are happy with how that's been resolved.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nRoleplaying games are super-efficient in terms of providing hours of fun for a small material cost!\nSustainable Distribution\nWe're committed to sustainable packaging, and we minimize shipping from abroad for manufacture.

Before they vanquish you! \nVortex Chess is language independent; chess look-alike game. Quick to learn (about 10 mins), but just like chess, will take a life time to master. It is a 2 players competitive game with 1-4 players expansion. With time of play about 25 miniutes\n\n\n\n\n We can offer 50% off from RRP with minimum buy of 5 copies of a game.\n EMAIL US: office@elfenixgames.com\n\n\n\n\n Vortex Chess is a game you can learn in as few as 10 minutes, but like its namesake, will take a lifetime to master.\nGAMING RULES! LIVE STREAM 5th of FEB 5pm UTC\n\n How to play Vortex Chess with English lector (Demonstration using old prototype)\n Polish version with subtitles (Demonstration using old prototype)\n The Objective of the game is to defeat your opponent's mage.\nPower Hexes\n                                        Every hex on a board has a set element to it. An Element Card that lies on a Stone Cirlce or on Camelot (That hexes we called: Power Hexes) gives their element to all surrounding hexes as shown in the picture. There are only two hexes on a board can have two different elements at the same time (Middle row - sides of Camelot - check picture below). Camelot (Two hexes) has only one Element Card on it. When Element on a Card is changing then all surrounding hexes change element as well. \nGame Setup\n Players set up their minions on the board, with the Wizards going into Stone Circles. On the left of the mage go the following: Dragon, Cavalry, and Catapult. On the right side go the following: Stolem, Archer, and Castle. In the front line, you will set up Pawn Minions (Knights or Barbarians). Every player draws 3 Action Cards. You are now ready to play. Player with Initiative may choose with which Element the game starts. For example he takes cards with Fire element and put them into all Stone Cirlcles and Camelot.\nMinion Card\nEach Minion Card is represented by a few characteristics needed for the game. \nAction Card\nYou must choose how to use an Action Card. It can be used in 4 different ways:  1) as a Movement Card 2) as an Attack Boost 3) as a Defence Boost  4) as an Element Boost\nTURN\nEach player\u2019s turn is divided into 3 phases. When 1 player finishes all 3 phases, the next player\u2019s turn begins, and so on until the objective of the game has been met.\nPhase 1 - Draw Cards\nPhase 2 - Roll the Die\nPhase 3 - Action Phase\nDRAW CARDS\nPlayer drawing 2 Action Cards for a Mage plus a Card for controlling Power Hex (Stone Circle or Camelot). To control a Power on a hex you need to have your minion on the appropriate hex on the board. \nMaximum hand size is 10 Cards. You cannot have more than 10. If you need to draw to have more - simply stop when your hand size reach 10. \nROLL THE DIE\nRoll the die. If the result is 1 of 4 elements, you must pick a card with that element and change 1 on the board. (You cannot change the card to the same element. For example, you can not change Water to Water.) If the result will be an image of a mage, the player controlling that mage can choose 1 element and put that card wherever he or she wants to.\nACTION PHASE\nIn phase 3, you are spending Action Cards. The only limit on the actions you can take with your minions will depend on the number of cards you have. (Remember: It is always good to keep a few cards for defence.) One minion cannot move more than 4 hexes in phase 3. After an attack, the minion is treated as though it has moved 4 hexes. In other words, it can do nothing more. You can move any number of minions in phase 3. The only limit is the cards in your hand. \nMOVEMENT\nThere are a few rules for moving your minions. There can be only one minion on each hex. A minion can enter a hex occupied by an opponent minion - that causes a fight.  A minion cannot move through other minions - except for Dragon, which has the ability to fly.  One minion cannot move more than 4 hexes in phase 3. When a minion fights, it is treated as though it has moved 4 hexes. - It cannot do anything else in that phase.\nCavalry cannot make this move because it would cause a move through its own minion. Dragon spent 2 Action Cards. Its Movement Value is 6 but the maximum it can travel is 4 hexes. Knight spent 2 Action Cards and moved to the Outer Stone Circle.\nFIGHT\nWhen the minion of one player enters the hex with the minion of another player, there is a fight. To determine the winner, the Attacker must calculate the Total Attack Score and the Defender must calculate the Total Defence Score. Whoever has the higher score is the winner and stays on the hex. If there is a tie, both minions go off the board.\nTotal Attack Score - Is equal to Minion Attack Skill + Element Modifier (if applicable) + Support (from a maximum of 3 friendly minions) + Action Card Attack Boost (if played).\nWhen calculated: the Defender may or may not play the Action Card with Defence Boost and then calculate:\nTotal Defence Score - is equal to Minion Defence Skill + Element Modifier (if applicable) + Support (from a maximum of 3 friendly minions) + Action Card Defence Boost (if played).\nExample: Merlin Ambrosius attacked Medraut ap Lot. Total Attack Score of Merlin is: 6 [2 from Minion Card plus 4 from Action Card Attack Boost). Medraut Total Defence Score is 6 ( 7 from Minion Card and minus 1 from Element). The reasult is a Tie. Both mages dies and the game is Tied.\nSUPPORT\nEach fighting minion can take advantage of support given from friendly minions. The maximum support is from 3 minions being no further than 1 hex away. The hexes must touch each other. If there are more friendly minions, the Player can choose which minions he takes Support from. \nSupport can be given to friendly Attacking minion or Friendly Defending minion. Simply add the value in brackets to Attack Skill of minion or Defence Skill. \nADVANCED RULES\nIn the Advanced Game, all the basic rules stay the same. There are a few more rules in the phases, which you can find in a rulebook, as well as extra rules for Spells and each minion, making the game more complex. Before you start using these rules, we recommend that you play 1 or 2 games using the basic rules. Below we show you an advanced minion rules:\n It is not a final version of a rulebook.

The sets are designed, painted, proofed and ready to print. All that\u2019s needed is your pledge! Let\u2019s do this!\nBattle maps are awesome!\nEveryone knows that having a wonderful resin scenery set-up, or a fancy neoprene battle map for those set-piece battles is great.\nBut what about random encounters or locations you haven\u2019t planned for? Or what if (like me) you simply don\u2019t have the budget for loads of scenery? And how do you even transport all that stuff to the game anyway? And even then, how do you keep things sufficiently varied?\nWhen I started using maps and miniatures for my own RPG games these were questions I had to find answers to. And that\u2019s where my map tiles come in. \n\n            Supplied in sets of 30, my double-sided, card-stock map tile sets will fit in a coat pocket and won\u2019t break the bank.\nDesigned to be extremely flexible in usage they cover a series of locations. There are nine new sets for this Kickstarter:\nBackstreets\nEvil Forest\nScifi Utopian\nScifi Dystopian \nWater\nMoorland Ruin\nDesert\nHillfort\nLinking Tiles 2\nEach is detailed below. All are now unlocked!\nThe Map Tiles from Wave 1 are also available! Here's a list of those:\nDungeon\nCavern\nMountain Pass\nForest\nHeathland\nLinking Tiles\nExtra Detail Tiles\nMost of the art is all hand-made. I use digital painting programs rather than 3d renders, so everything has a nice handmade feel that blends right in with painted miniatures. This time around I\u2019m joined by guest artist Paul Bourne who does use computer renders, which are perfectly suited to Sci fi! He's guesting with two sets.\nThe tiles are six inches square - a size I have come to really love in my home games. It\u2019s a great balance of flexibility, allowing you to build very different encounter maps from a few tiles, with extreme portability. 120 tiles will fit in your bag with ease and allow endless set-ups on the fly.\nHere are the bullet points:\n30 tiles per set\n9 Different Sets available, having broken through all stretch goals (on day one?!)\nFull colour\nDouble-sided\nPrinted on 270gsm card-stock\nHighly connectable within each set\n6 inches square\nGridded and Grid-free options available\nDigital versions available for virtual table tops\nShipping is included in your pledge, with a small supplement for the places a bit further away from the UK/US.\nEach set has at least twenty-two unique faces out of 60 - I've added more of any given tile where it seemed useful to have spares.\nThe tiles are full colour, 6 inches square and printed on card-stock, in the USA. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s a key feature of the design that these tiles are NOT board - they're not made from the stuff boardgame tokens are made from.\nThey're printed on 270gsm card-stock, and with good reason: 30 board tiles just wouldn\u2019t fit in your jacket pocket, and would cost a lot more!\nThis is an important point. With many years in games production under my belt I could have these made on board, or indeed other, fancier materials. And maybe another time I'll make something more demanding and expensive. But for this nice straightforward Kickstarter I want the tiles to be both affordable and transportable.\nPlease note that my tiles are not designed to be suitable for dry erase pens. Users have had some success with dry erase, but some brands stain the tiles, so I don't offer this as a feature, and don't recommend that you mark your tiles with pens. \nThey are professionally printed, in the USA, with a nice satin finish. Let's take a look at some of my samples. These are the real thing:\nBackstreets \nWhether it\u2019s a fantasy city, or a victorian city, this tile set gives you loads of options to create seedy backstreets for adventurers and investigators to explore. With plenty of twists, turns, dog-legs, and alcoves, and strewn with rubbish, crates and barrels this set is great for a whole range of settings! Available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign. \nEvil Forest \n In Wave One we did the bright shades of the greenwood. With this set we venture into the heart of the darkwood! Twisted branches, thickets of thorns and tangles of brambles; this is the perfect counterpoint to the fairer set. With a wide variety of paths and junctions, as well as tiles to create larger clearings. Available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nScifi Utopian \nFeaturing the amazing art of Paul Bourne, this scifi set is suitable for high adventure beyond the stars. Whether it\u2019s a scientific exploration ship, an alien base or the corridors of a rebel base, these tiles are perfect for your science fantasy adventures! These tiles have a grid built in as part of the art.\nScifi Dystopian\n  Again featuring the incredible work of Paul Bourne, this scifi set is suitable for the grotty underbelly of scifi dystopia! The worn belly of a freighter, a reclaimed imperial base that\u2019s seen better days, or an automated factory in the dead zone, these tiles are perfect for your grimy scifi adventures! These tiles have a grid built in as part of the art.\nWater UNLOCKED!!!\nExpanding on a feature from the Wave One Extra Detail tiles, this set gives you loads of options for lakes, rivers and streams, or even the sea. You can build islands, and shore lines, and includes a bunch of water tiles to create open water. This set is perfect to mix up your wilderness adventures. The Water Set connects to the Heathland Tiles from the first campaign. Available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nMoorland Ruin UNLOCKED!!!\nThis set gives you an alternative wild lands to the Heathland of Wave One. As well as a whole range of attractive moorland tiles with plenty of natural features, this set gives you a bunch of ruined walls that you can piece together into an exciting adventure locale! Available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nDesert UNLOCKED!!!\nRocky outcrops, boulder-strewn chasms, and dusty gulches, this set is perfect for post apocalypse and desert adventures. Available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign. \nHillfort UNLOCKED!!!\nWith this set you can build a series of palisades and roundhouses to explore. Perfect for the hill folk, or orcs, or bandits! This set links up to the Moorland Ruin set. Available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nLinking Tiles 2 UNLOCKED!!!\nThese tiles link up almost all the sets in this wave with each other and those from wave one. Please note that we didn\u2019t feel linking between the painted sets and the Paul Bourne sets worked. It seems like a lovely idea, but it just looked horrible! So there are links between all the painted sets, including the wave one sets. And links between sci fi sets. But not between painted and scifi.  Available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nDid you miss Wave One? Or do you need more? You can get a great deal on those tiles right now!\nDungeon\nThe Dungeon Tile Set was a favourite of wave one. Full of corridors, rooms, junctions and steps this is the perfect set for your subterranean adventures! There are tiles to make larger chambers, as well as a load of choices for your dungeon layout. The Dungeon Tiles have a one inch grid built in, so there's no need to choose gridded or ungridded.\nCavern\nClassic dungeon stuff, this set features narrow passages (two squares wide on the inch grid versions, sometimes narrowing down to one), cramped chambers, and various intersections. There are also lots of tiles for making larger chambers from more than one tile.\nThere are tiles for 2 tile rooms, 3 and 4 tiles rooms, and even larger caves using the cave floor spacer tiles. It's a really versatile set for making that spontaneous troll hole along the road, or a small series of caves to explore.\nAvailable with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nForest\nA series of narrow paths through the green, this set is great for rolling travel on woodland paths. There are a variety of tiles for constructing various size of clearing. There's a tomb entrance, a pool, a woodland stream-crossing and more.\nThe Forest Set is available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign. \nMountain Pass\nThe Mountain Pass set works as a variant dungeon too, but is intended for crossing mountain terrain. It has cliff edges both up and down for walls. There are loads of stepped levels in this set, and tiles to make large arenas in the rock.\nHere's the real thing in action:\nThe Mountain Pass set, like all the sets, is available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nHeathland\nThe Heathland Set one doesn't have the obvious paths or passage ways of the other sets - well not quite. It features rolling open wilderness, scattered with depressions, gullies and rocks. And there's a selection of road tiles that run through the open country. Here's half the set of 30 tiles in action:\nThe Heathland Set is available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nLinking Tiles\nThis set provides links between: Forest, Mountain Pass, Heathland, Dungeon and Mountain Pass tile sets. There are multiple linking tiles to link each set, and between 3 sets. Available with and without one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign. \nExtra Detail Tiles \nThese tiles provide objectives and additional locations for the Wave One Map Tiles sets, featuring flooded chambers, standing stones, a riverbank and islands, cavern entrances, a dungeon... restroom (!) and much much more! They work with the following sets: Cavern, Dungeon, Heathland, Forest, and Mountain Pass. The Extra Detail Set is available with or without one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nAll stretch goals are now unlocked!\n\u00a3500 - FUNDED! IT'S ON!!!\n\u00a31000 Water UNLOCKED!!!! SPLOSH GET IN THE SEA!\n\u00a32000 Moorland Ruin UNLOCKED!!!! RUINOUS!\n\u00a33000 Desert UNLOCKED!!! SCORCHIO!!!\n\u00a34000 Hillfort UNLOCKED!!! \n\u00a35000 Linking Tiles 2 UNLOCKED!!!\nThere are no more stretch goals beyond these. This is it! Any more would delay delivery, and we don't want that! And we want to do all the sets, rather than hold anything back. I think we can do it with your help.\nPledging is very easy - just select the amount of tile sets you\u2019d like. If we meet our funding goal with your pledges, your card will be charged at the end of the campaign.\nYou\u2019ll be able to choose which sets of tiles you\u2019d like once the campaign finishes as part of a survey that will be emailed to you. I WILL be using a pledge manager for this campaign, so you\u2019ll be able to pledge for more tiles once the main campaign has finished. Anything pledged after the campaign won\u2019t count to unlocking stretch goals though!\nPlease note that you can adjust your pledge up and down during the campaign - so if a set you want becomes unlocked, you can add it in by upping your pledge. Which in turn will help unlock more sets.\nOf course you might just want to go all in and get all the sets from day one. And that will certainly speed us towards that goal! There are no specific sets you have to get - the choice is entirely yours from whatever we unlock.\nDigital Map Tiles Pack: \u00a312 - you\u2019ll get all the digital files for all unlocked sets. \nThese will be supplied initially via emailed dropbox link, and then later via DrivethruCards. The digital files are supplied as both jpegs for Virtual Table Tops and fuzzy edged png files, so that you can piece together your own maps. IMPORTANT: the digital files are intended for on-screen usage. They are not intended to be used for printing, and we don't recommend you use them for printing, and we can't help you print them. They do not come with any publication rights.\n  The remaining pledge levels simply allow you to select how many sets you would like for your pledge. You'll select which ones later, in the pledge manager after the campaign closes.\n One Set of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a316\n Two Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a331\n Three Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a345\n Four Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a358\n Five Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a371\n Six Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a385\n Seven Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a398\n Eight Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3110\n Nine Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3121 (all the new sets) \n Ten Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3134\n Eleven Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3146\n Twelve Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3158\n Thirteen Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3170\n Fourteen sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3182\n Fifteen Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3194 \n Sixteen Sets of Map Tiles, plus digital file pack - \u00a3206 (all the new sets plus all the sets from the previous campaign)\nYou'll see your regionalised currency when you pledge.\nShipping to most places is included in your pledge. This is true for the US, UK, and European destinations. \nIf you live in places a long way from the UK you might pay a modest supplement, just to keep things fair - you can check that out in each pledge level, but I've kept it as low as possible, and largely it will be used to pay for superior packaging for those longer journeys.\nParcels will be dispatched from the UK and the US.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned and built upon since my first Map Tiles campaign in 2019. We sent out over 40,000 individual tiles. It\u2019d be weird if we didn\u2019t learn something!\n\n Readiness: I really didn\u2019t expect the success of the last campaign, and so I didn\u2019t have all the tiles painted or proofed. This time all the print files have already been made and proofing is done. As soon as the funds clear we\u2019re ready to go. There\u2019s is literally no work to do beyond ordering a print run, picking and packing. That\u2019s plenty of work in itself, but there\u2019s no danger of any creative issues! The print files are already with the printer.\n Friendliness: I really enjoyed the last campaign, and I hope we can continue the idea of Friendly Kickstarting. I\u2019m simply a human being, working with a couple of friends to deliver this campaign. You\u2019re helping a real person make something cool. As a thank you for your support, I\u2019ll always do my best for you, and communicate as fully and directly as possible. I hope we can all chat like regular people, despite using a computer to do it. The offering, or \"what you can get\" is laid out here. If you'd like something I'm not offering here, then I'm afraid it's not available through this campaign. You can drop me a line via PM if you'd like to discuss something, but I'm not taking requests for maps sets, nor changing what I'm doing here, on this occasion. I am certainly taking notes of suggestions for future campaigns!\n\nPackaging: In the first campaign a small percentage of our packaging failed. Sometimes in extreme situations, but it failed nonetheless. About 2% of parcels had problems with being mishandled, and the packaging split. I\u2019ve changed how we pack the tiles to ensure they arrive in better shape. And changed our supplier for padded envelopes.\nShipping: I\u2019ve tried to keep things as simple as possible. On the last campaign a lot of you from Australia, New Zealand and Japan ordered tiles, and boy those costs add up! To keep things fair to everyone I\u2019ve added a small supplement to shipping to those locations. I wish I could keep shipping flat and the same for everyone but it doesn\u2019t quite work this time, due to changes in shipping charges since the last campaign.\nShipping to most locations is included in the price of the sets. If you\u2019re a long way from me, I have to charge a little bit more. This also allows me to provide much more solid packaging for those distant locales, to ensure your tiles arrive in a good state. We like to imagine our delivery people respect our efforts and move parcels with all due care. But some of them are evil, and use your rewards as a football. And in one notable case from the previous campaign as a... bar of soap for a giant? I don't even\nTimelines: I have significantly padded the timeline for dispatching UK/Europe and Rest of World pledges so that we don\u2019t slip behind our estimate if we unlock our stretch goals. Last time I really didn't plan for the sheer volume of backers - I really thought we'd maybe get 100? This time I have planned for greater numbers, so if I got that wrong, then you get your stuff sooner than expected, not later. I\u2019m also going to assume everything is unlocked, and work on that basis. \nMiniatures shown are from Red Box Games used here with permission\nDice are from Triple Ace Games/The Dice Dudes, used here with permission\nThe Compass Rose is from Handiwork Games from their forthcoming Beowulf Kickstarter. It's made by Campaign Coins and it's GORGEOUS CHECK IT OUT:\nThe dice trays shown are from Handiwork Games and you can get them here\nYou can order Wave One Tiles from Handiwork Games here (UK, EU, Everywhere else) and here (for the US), but the deals are not quite as good as via this KS because here on Kickstarter we have PEOPLE POWER. But you'll get them right away. So that's nice.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the second time we're kickstarting tiles, and I've learned A LOT from that first time. You can read about that above.\n\nThis is my fourth Kickstarter, and I am very familiar with all the processes involved. I'm playing it very safe, and not doing anything I haven't done before. I take kickstarter very very seriously, and your support means a lot to me personally. It concerns me, taking money in advance, and I hope that this makes me a responsible creator.\n\nHere's where I think we could face challenges:\n\nShipping. This is always a roll of the dice (argh!). We might face delays caused by UK customs, or damage caused in transit.

See below for the full box contents.\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is a stand-alone multi-player sequel to the original solitaire game Deep Space D-6.\nIn Deep Space D-6: Armada, you and up to 3 friends will work together to complete missions, fight enemy fleets in ship to ship combat, and ultimately defeat an evil federation. \nYou'll get stronger as the game progresses, building the perfect starship from over 50 station modules, hiring heroes from a pool of more than 30 unique units, and finding resources to help you dismantle your opposition. \nArmada is a complex and deep game made simple and intuitive through visual and user experience design. If you've played Deep Space D-6 before, you'll be immediately familiar with the mechanics of Armada. If you're new to the series- I hope you're ready for tough decisions and tactical planning! \nDeep Space D-6: Armada is played over a series of game rounds. Each round consists of three phases:\n\n1) Planning: Players perform actions to travel between planets and prepare for upcoming tasks such as upgrading their ships or hiring Heroic crew.\n2) Encounter: Players complete Away Missions or combat enemy fleets at their current location (together or alone).\n3) Resolution: Event and Threat Detected cards are drawn and hazard effects are resolved. \n Learn more about the game in upcoming updates:\nThe Starships (Update #2)\nStations Modules and Weapons (Update #4)\nCrew and Special Abilities (Update #6)\nTeam-Up encounters (Update #8)\nRule Book\nWant to know more? Check out the prototype rulebook. This is a work-in-progress rulebook and is subject to change. \n PHASE 1: Planning\nTravel, repair, upgrade ship, hire crew.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 2: Encounter\nShip-to-ship combat and Away Missions.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 3: Resolution \nDraw new event cards, spawn enemies, resolve hazard effects.\nPLAY\n\nCreating a science fiction world where the primary color wasn't black proved to be a large challenge. As a lover of classic science fiction, I was drawn to the bright colors and \"loudness\" of pulp era sci-fi. A true test of Armada's visual direction came from designing the board- or lack thereof. \nA space themed game without the empty blackness of space almost felt wrong, and for some people they probably won't be able to get over it! So Armada uses free floating planet tiles making whatever surface you play on the core color of the \"board\". Still want that dark sci-fi feel? Play on a neoprene star field map. Want to feel like you're floating in space? Try a glass table! \nFor the art, I've enlisted in the help of Gareth Davies. Gareth's unique art style creates a vibrant science fiction world while keeping things minimal and clean. \nFor the components themselves, I aimed for a classic board game look with a slight vintage feel. There are over 50 custom dice in this game!  We're taking advantage of new manufacturing technologies, but don't want to go overboard with component gimmicks. \nGet the full game as a $2 add-on!\nJUMPSHIP is a hidden identity party game for 5-10 players. You can get a copy of the mini-version for $2 with your Armada pledge. Just add $2 to you pledge. See the update for more info (Not available by itself. Limit 1 copy per copy of Armada).\nNo stretch goals. Tau Leader Games does not do Kickstarter exclusives. We fully develop our games and don't piece parts out to be added as stretch goals later.\nBut with your help and community feedback, I've been able to redesign and upgrade the shield and hull trackers! They look like this now:\nOther upgrades:\nA dedicated solo scenario meant for quicker play.\nCustom plastic insert for the hero dice.\nBlack Core cardstock on all cards.\nDrawstring bag for beacon tokens.\nPrinted player pawns (instead of stickers)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. Thanks to the funding progress of this campaign, I've been able to lower shipping rates.\nGames will be shipped though fulfillment partners primarily in Canada, China, the EU, the US, and Australia. This should reduce custom fees and VAT. Shipping rates are partially subsidized. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies by adding $48 for each additional game to your pledge. There will be no extra shipping charge for extra copies. \nFor larger orders (cases of 6+) or retailer pledges, please inquire by sending a message to the creator.\nTabletop games are becoming more and more popular every year. We as consumers (and designers too!) employ platitudes and conjecture comparing the increased complexity and immersion of board games to the capabilities of video games. If we are to make these comparisons, we must also recognize the dangers of any consumer-focused game mediums. Publishers have a responsibility to be morally accountable for any practices that manipulate fans, deceive consumers, or incite misbehavior among those that partake in our hobby. Deceptive pricing schemes, endless boxes of collectible miniatures, nickel & dime expansion structures, undisclosed kickbacks, even player toxicity- these are just a few areas of growing concern within the emerging tabletop industry. Please take a moment to consider how your purchasing habits and use of games reflect on the industry, whether it is my games or someone else's. \nNever forget that tabletop games are a place for communion, self-expression, can have positive effects on our health and mind, and can lead to wonderful careers and societal impact.

Though the game is already designed, we continue to balance and add new features. There is also a non-trivial amount of art assets to be completed. These things will take time. \n\nThis will be my 6th Kickstarter game project. I've been all over the place- let me tell you. From last-second funding escapades to projects far exceeding my own projections and everything in between. This means I've also seen failures and made mistakes. I've been late to hit deadlines. I've been unresponsive when I needed communication the most. I take full responsibility for my actions and hope people will be fair in judgement and understanding. I am fully aware that being an individual does not necessitate leniency in a market full of large companies and publishers with impressive capabilities. Let's just do our best to be reasonable and keep the spirit of independent self-publishing alive!\n\nTauLeaderGames has a 100% delivery rate but every project still has inherent risks. October 2020 is my best estimate for a project of this scope based on my past experience. While this timeframe includes room for errors and overages, it doesn't encapsulate every possible obstacle.

The game is a horror noir science-fiction setting set in a dystopian reality in which the majority of the known universe is either owned or indirectly controlled by the eponymous corporation SLA Industries. The game incorporates themes from the cyberpunk, gothic horror and conspiracy genres, and has always been praised on the quality of writing and art. SLA Industries is considered one of the first and best examples of the Splatterpunk genre in RPGs.\nThe World of Progress, the universe in which SLA Industries operates, is a science-fiction image of the 1980s, where the fax machine spews out information alongside green-screen computers and vat-grown biogenetic monsters, who compete with humans and exotic alien races for work in an overgrown city that plunges deep underground.\nWe are very lucky to still have the original creative team at the core of this RPG. Dave Allsop and Jared Earle have been here from the beginning and have a clear vision for the future of SLA Industries. As with all of the SLA Industries publications, there will be high-quality art, brief stories, character quotes and other in-game content to bring The World of Progress to life. SLA Industries 2nd Edition will be crammed full of full-colour art, presenting one of the best visualised worlds in the RPG arena and the the most stunningly visual representation of The World of Progress to date.\nSome of the threats you will come up against in SLA industries.\nPlayers in SLA Industries take on the role of an Operative, the highly-trained and well-equipped freelancers that serve as the company's agents, investigators and enforcers. Operatives perform tasks for both a pay packet and the promise of an increase in their security clearance, as both provide them access to an increased standard of living, better equipment, progression up the corporate ladder and sponsorship opportunities. Most of all though, they strive for the one thing that everyone in the media-driven World of Progress wants: Notoriety.\nCharacters progress along with the campaign, gaining credits, security clearance and notoriety, and can spend their hard-earned rewards on better equipment, stronger armour, more deadly weapons, powerful combat drugs or something a little bit different, like a down-payment on a Life After Death account, ensuring that even death can't stop them. Each of the nine different races offers its own play style, each armed with unique racial abilities, from the studious Neophron to the drug-addled Frother, from the brutish Stormer to the quick-witted Wraithen, from the versatile Human to the honour-bound Shaktar, pick the race that suits you best and bring them to life.\nSLA Industries Operatives: Shaktar, Malice Stormer, Human and Advanced Carrien\nSLA Industries 2nd Edition features an entirely new d10-based rules system, built from the ground up and designed to offer a more streamlined and cinematic gaming experience than the old system, while remaining true to the setting. Ratings Points are a new mechanic for 2nd Ed, earned from face time in front of the camera, or through bravery, extreme success and spectacular failure. These points enable players to perform cinematic feats that defy the norm and impress audiences, and when things don't quite work out, there's the new Luck mechanism that allows players to alter or re-roll dice results. Both Ratings Points and Luck are a finite resource, however, and should not be used frivolously.   \nIn the following video Shep talks about a few of the changes between 1st and 2nd Edition, as well as some of the new additions to the system...\nOperatives enter the sewer in a typical \"Blue BPN\" mission.\nExamples of how the pages will look.\nSLA Industries 2nd Edition will be a 192-page hardcover book with lavish full-colour illustrations throughout. Most of the pages have been written and the roadmap for the book is complete. In the book, there will be a comprehensive look at the structure of the company and a deep dive into Threat Analysis, which will cover all the major rivals, cults, critters and dangers that SLA and its Operatives face on a day to day basis.\nYou can read more about the contents here.\nThe back cover art featuring Shaktar, Human and Stormer Operatives\n This Quickstart PDF offers a 'rules lite' look at the new system and provides five pre-generated characters and an introductory scenario for up to five players.

Pick the tier you want from the menu on the right of the page. The following graphic explains the content related to each of those tiers (note, many of the images are mock-ups, the campaign is to make them happen):\nThe other HALLOWEEN JACK pledge includes the dice shown on the Slayer's Lounge pledge in place of the dice shown here\nTo add any of the following items to your pledge just increase your pledge by the amount shown for the items you want:\nTwo supporting source books are available: Hunter Sheets Issue Two, an eighty-page book which includes targets that SLA Industries wants you to take care of, and SLA Industries: Cannibal Sector 1, a massive 352-page tome for those that wish to take their adventure out of the city and into the infamous sectors surrounding it. Conversion documents for both of these books to bring them in line with the new 2nd Edition rules system are included as a part of this campaign.\n We have planned out the stretch goals that are realistic both financially and timewise. If we get through them all we will not be adding any extra. \nWe will reveal stretch goals, a few at a time, as the campaign progresses. \nScroll down to the bottom of this section to see the social stretch goals and how to help complete them\n Stretch Goals\n Social Stretch Goals \nTo complete each social stretch goal and help unlock the award associated with the goal go here:\n SLA Industries Facebook Page - like the page\n RPGGeek Page - click the become a fan button\n World of Progress Facebook fan group - join the group\n SLA Industries Twitter account - follow\n Kicktraq - to complete this goal, please visit the Kicktraq link, search for SLA Industries and go to the Kicktraq page for this project.

He is an in-demand artist in the gaming industry having worked on the likes of Magic: the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, to name but a few. \nMany of the regular SLA artists are still part of the team, including Jon Hodgson and Clint Langley, and we have also been joined by many newer artists at the top of their game. \nJared Earle is one of the original members of Nightfall Games and was responsible for a large portion of the original release in 1993. A vital part of the company, and lead on this Kickstarter, Jared continues to write, edit and layout SLA Industries publications around his life as a sysadmin.\nMark Rapson is the owner of Word Forge Games and has had significant creative and operational input in recent Nightfall Games releases. He was the driving force behind the completion of the SLA Industries: Cannibal Sector 1 kickstarter and is lead writer for Thresher, flora, fauna, diseases and the 9th Division.\nChris \u2018Shep\u2019 Shepperson is a writer and games designer responsible for the 2nd Edition rule system and is a prolific content writer, contributing significantly to SLA Industries: Cannibal Sector 1 book and the majority of the writing already done for 2nd Edition. He also led the development of the Cannibal Sector 1 miniature game ruleset and has also contributed heavily to the works of other publishers, including Modiphius and Red Scar publishing.  \nBased on past experience of our team, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. \nDO NOT ADD MONEY FOR SHIPPING NOW - IT WILL NEED REFUNDING AND MAY BE LIABLE TO KS CHARGES THAT CANNOT BE REFUNDED.\nShipping is charged after the campaign, separate to your pledge so we can be fair to all our backers (shipping is rarely one size fits all). We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs and charge shipping from your nearest hub to you. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the USA (US, CA and some ROW backers), Australia (APAC), or the UK (EU & other ROW backers). As a rough estimate, for the 'HALLOWEEN JACK' level pledge, we expect shipping to look something like this:\n UK: \u00a36 (Royal Mail 2nd class 'signed for') \n EU/US/CA: \u00a312\n Rest of the world: \u00a320. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner and at the best delivery cost we can, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions or through special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nAll PDFs will be fulfilled via Drivethrurpg.com\n Why Kickstarter?\nA really good question! Nightfall Games is a small and growing company and although we have produced a lot already we want to commission artists that complement the art already created for this book. When the initial goal is met, this kickstarter funds will be used to pay external artists for their artwork (approx 1/3 of the total art we want to include: approx 50 of 150 pieces) and the production of the hardback rulebook, 'Jack' dice and GM Screen pack. Any additional funds will pay for the stretch goals and newer add-ons to be completed by manufacturers, contractors and commissioned artists and writers. The commissioned individuals will work co-currently with our core team, therefore timescales should not be affected significantly.\nNote, unlike some Kickstarters, we are not running this campaign as a preorder. The money you pledge will be spent on making this game happen, including paying external artists, writers and printing companies.

We're going to make a full colour, one creature per page, hardcover bestiary for the world\u2019s favourite roleplaying game. \n\n\nIt\u2019s going to be expertly converted, beautifully illustrated, wonderfully laid out, and full to the brim with useful content.\nIf we\u2019re extra successful we\u2019ll also include random encounter tables, drop-in encounters with battle maps, and lots of additional digital content. \nWay back at the beginning of the d20 times, when 3rd Edition was the big noise, gamers had two core manuals with which to play. The Player\u2019s Handbook and Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide were available, but there was a pause before we got the official Monster Manual. Into that gap burst The Creature Collection - the very first bestiary of Third Edition monsters! \nNow we\u2019re bringing the Creature Collection to 5th Edition!\nOur aims and campaign are simple: To see how large a 5th Edition bestiary we can create with your help! \nAt the heart of our campaign is The Scarred Lands Creature Collection for 5th Edition. We want to run a very focused, easy-to-understand campaign, and it\u2019s all about the book.\nThe Creature Collection begins at 160 pages, and will feature roughly 140 monsters. Most occupy a full page, some occupy two, occasionally they\u2019re longer. None are split up across pages - they always occupy at least one full page. We think this is vital feature for ease of usage: We want to give you a good-sized illustration for every adversary, along with a good depth of info and tips on using the creature. We also want the book to be a joy to read and use at the table.\nIf the campaign is successful, the book will grow, with additional monsters added as stretch goals are met. You will still pay the same price you pledged at, so it\u2019s worth getting in early and bringing in as many friends as you can! Together we can get MORE MONSTERS!\nWith this campaign our job is to make a single volume, so we're maxing it out at 256 pages. That way we don't break the bank shipping it to you, nor get delayed in delivery. But fear not, there are plenty of additional rewards we'll unlock should we grow beyond that point!\nEvery creature in the Collection is illustrated in full colour and, of course, is fully statted and described, as you would expect.\nThe book will be ordered alphabetically so that if you know what you\u2019re looking for you\u2019ll be able to quickly find it with maximum simplicity. When we reached out to DMs the thing we heard most was the need to be able to look things up easily. We all agree that we\u2019re frustrated by having monsters grouped by type, so we\u2019re using an A-Z navigation option for those times you know the name of the creature you\u2019re looking up.\nIn addition to this, we\u2019ve designed in a bunch of additional navigation aids to make this book super-useful:\nEvery monster has a tab at the side of the page that shows its CR, and they\u2019re colour-coded into groups. That allows you to very quickly gauge what kind of challenge each monster presents to your party.\nThere\u2019s also a series of tabs lower down the page edge that show in which habitat the creature can be found. \nThese tabs each sit in a fixed, exclusive position on the page edge, so when you flick through, you can easily spot what you're looking for. \nThe book will be fully indexed by monster name, and also by CR.\nThe Creature Collection is also available in PDF format. \nThe PDF will be fully bookmarked and hyperlinked. It will be delivered via DriveThruRPG so you\u2019ll have it in your library.\n Accompanying many of the reward tiers is The Digital Pack.\nThis is a set of digital accessories that complement the Creature Collection. Much of the content will be unlocked via stretch goals, so the more pledges we get, the better the Digital Pack becomes, at no extra cost! \nIt will contain digital poster-sized files of any unlocked battle maps from Encounter Pack stretch goals, along with additional battle maps suited to VTT formats and a VTT-friendly version of the Creature Collection if we do well.\nWe\u2019ll include digital files of art of the creatures to show your players, and we may unlock further accessories like VTT tokens and digital \u201cpaper\u201d miniatures. The Digital Pack will be delivered via DriveThruRPG so you\u2019ll have it in your library.\nFor the true Scarred Lands fan, the limited edition hardcover is a wonderful collector's item. Strictly limited to 100 copies, this tome comes in a leather-effect cover (vegan, not dead animal), embossed with the skull of a Spider Goblin. We'll be giving you more details on this exclusive volume during the campaign.  \nThe original Creature Collection was the genesis of the Scarred Lands setting. Scarn and the Divine War grew out of the Creature Collections to become its own vibrant, unique setting.\n\u201cA world known to its inhabitants as Scarn, the Scarred Lands is a place of dynamic heroism, supreme villainy, and incalculable magic. Torn and twisted by battles between the titans and their children, the young gods \u2014fought largely by monstrous titanspawn pitted against humans, elves, dwarves, and other \u201cdivine races\u201d \u2014 Scarn is a world still wounded deeply by the Divine War that took place less than two centuries ago.\nThe Scarred Lands has been a favored fantasy setting since the release of the Creature Collection in 2000. Over the next several years, over 40 titles were published for the Scarred Lands, making it one of the most fully supported fantasy RPG settings ever and the premiere product line of the former Sword & Sorcery Studios\u201d\nThe great news is that while the Creature Collection is a must-have for 5th edition Scarred Lands players, it works just as well for all 5th Edition games! \nWe want your help to decide which creatures to include. We\u2019ve already gathered choices from the Scarred Lands Corebook Kickstarter, from members of the Scarred Lands team, from our writers and artists, and now we want you to help select the next bunch of adversaries. We\u2019ll be running backer-only polls throughout the campaign where you\u2019ll get to choose which monsters are included in this Creature Collection.\nCreatures will be grouped into teams, and they'll battle, the winner being decided by your votes. Don't worry if your favourite Scarred Lands beast gets knocked out! Each creature gets more than one chance of being included in our tournament system! (and it's intended as a bit of fun. We won't wreck the collection so it includes 100 versions of Creature McCreatureface)\n Throughout the campaign we\u2019ll be sharing previews of our monsters! You can get two free chunks here and here, and then throughout the campaign further weekly previews will be backer-only. So if you\u2019d like to get a bunch of monsters for 5e over the next 4 weeks, jump on board!\n We've moved the stretch goal graphic to the top of the campaign to make it nice and easy to find!\nOur stretch goals add pages to the Collection, handy stuff to the Digital Pack, and Encounter Packs.\nHere's an example of an Encounter Pack: The Temple of the Stars. With some details redacted in case you end up playing it! \nWe\u2019ll also expand the Digital Pack that\u2019s available with selected reward tiers with things like VTT tokens, battle maps and more!\nTo Add-On additional copies of the Scarred Lands Creature Collection for 5e including a PDF and an additional copy of the Digital Pack, add the following:\nFor the US: $60 per copy (includes shipping)\nFor The UK/EU: $60 per copy  (includes shipping)\nFor Brazil: $70 per copy  (includes shipping)\nFor everywhere else: $65 per copy  (includes shipping)\nAs part of our campaign, we\u2019re also offering you the chance to grab previous Scarred Lands titles at a great price!\nWe begin with three adds ons: the 5e Scarred Lands Player's Guide in print, and 2 PDF bundles.\nTo get The 5e Scarred Lands Player's Guide in print,  including shipping, simply up your pledge by $30.\nTo get the The 3e Bundle, simply up your pledge by $15.\n\n                              To get The 5e Bundle, simply up your pledge by $15.\n\n\n                              Here\u2019s the details of each Add-On:\nThe Scarred Lands Player's Guide for 5e is a 312 page full colour guide to this fabulous setting. We're offering the offset-printed setting guide (as opposed to the Print-On-Demand version) for this add-on.\nA Land Where Legends Walk\nDrawing enthusiastically on Greek mythology, the revised and re-imagined Scarred Lands nonetheless retains its place as a modern fantasy RPG setting. This is a world shaped by gods and monsters, and only the greatest of heroes can expect to be counted among them. The most populous continent of Scarn, Ghelspad, plays host to vast unexplored regions, hides unsolved riddles from ancient cultures, and taunts adventures with the promise of undiscovered riches hidden among the ruins of older civilizations.\nYet the myths of the Scarred Lands are relatively recent events. The effects of the Titanswar still ripple through the world, and the heroes and villains of many of these stories are part of living memory, if not still living.\n\n\n The 3rd Edition Bundle $15 ($39 value)\nThree 3e \u201cClassic\u201d Creature Collections: \nCreature Collection Revised 3e (normally $13)\nCreature Collection II: Dark Menagerie 3e (normally $13)\nCreature Collection III: Savage Bestiary 3e (normally $13)\n\u2022 Creature Collection Revised 3e\nFrom the horrible wrack dragon to the tiny bottle imp, creatures frightening and wondrous are found throughout the lands of fantasy.

This is a world shaped by gods and monsters, and only the greatest of heroes can expect to be counted among them. The most populous continent of Scarn, Ghelspad, plays host to vast unexplored regions, hides unsolved riddles from ancient cultures, and taunts adventures with the promise of undiscovered riches hidden among the ruins of older civilizations.\nYet the myths of the Scarred Lands are relatively recent events. The effects of the Titanswar still ripple through the world, and the heroines and villains of many of these stories are part of living memory, if not still living.\n\u2022 The Wise & the Wicked 2nd Edition (5e OGL)\nHeroes, Villains, and Others in Between!\nThis tome is a revision of the original book by the same title, which was first published for use with 3rd edition rules for the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game. In this revised edition of The Wise & the Wicked, all the same characters have returned (and we\u2019ve added some new ones, too!), all newly updated to 5th Edition rules, for use with the Scarred Lands Player\u2019s Guide.\nThe Wise & the Wicked introduces a rogue\u2019s gallery of the Scarred Lands\u2019 movers and shakers, characters who carry out the will of the gods or the fallen titans. These non-player characters can be friends, enemies, or simply convenient resources for the player characters in your game.\nHere you\u2019ll find a fascinating compendium of characters from the Scarred Lands, but easily transported into campaigns set elsewhere. In addition, find multiple appendices full of new magic items and artifacts, class archetypes and prestige classes, new feats, new creatures and races, and more.\nWe already have 60 monsters converted, edited, illustrated and laid out, so work is well progressed. Our systems are all in place, and we have an extremely experienced, talented and motivated team ready to complete the project should we fund.  We have more writers and artists in the wings waiting on the green light to start more conversions should we fund. And if we do really well we'll expand that team further.\n  With this Kickstarter we want to get this important and useful traditionally printed book into stores\".  And we\u2019re relying on your help! We're also using this Kickstarter to open up our EU and RoW shipping options.\nWe've worked hard to secure a European shipping option for this campaign, so that we can ship from both the EU and the US, reducing costs to you, and making it viable for our European friends to get in on the action without incurring high shipping fees and import duty!\nThis means this campaign is a little different than others from Onyx Path Publishing. Most of the differences occur backstage, but if it goes well then you may well see more EU-friendly shipping in future.\nThe main difference to you, the backer, is that shipping to the EU and so-called \"Rest of World\" is much cheaper than it has been historically, and books will be dispatched from both the EU and the US.\nThe team producing the Scarred Lands Creature Collection and running this campaign is Handiwork Games. We were approached by Rich Thomas of Onyx Path to lend a hand in creating this whole supplement. We are an extremely experienced team of game producers, writers and artists, led by industry veteran Jon Hodgson, who was formerly creative director at Cubicle Seven, and oversaw all creative production there for 3 years.\nFounded in 2012, Onyx Path Publishing is a Pennsylvania-based company dedicated to the development of exemplary, immersive worlds. Working with a group of amazingly talented creators, we explore print, electronic and other forms of media distribution to make our products available to our fans.\nOnyx Path staff are united in our common background with White Wolf Publishing and we will continue to supplement those famous product settings with new releases, while adding to the industry with brand-new concepts for game play. We are lucky to include ENnie, GAMA and other award-winning creatives as contributors to our upcoming release schedule. Their commitment to quality reflects the goal of Onyx Path and the reason for our existence.\nWith over 20 years of publishing experience from which to draw, we are industry professionals who love the art of the game and plan to continue making meaningful, innovative contributions in the years to come.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween us, we have run or co-run a wide variety of Kickstarter Campaigns. \n\nThe usual risks apply here - if we grow the project beyond the initial scope there may be a short delay on delivery while we make extra material. \n\nIf we encounter sudden delays in converting material for reasons unknown, or the international shipping suddenly changes dramatically we may see some delays while we replan. \n\nBut we won't stop work because of any of these things.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Weekly Preview PDFs", "descp": "You'll get free weekly PDFs during the cmapaign, showing off samples of the creatures found in the Creature Collection.

Pledge now to help us fund an RPG set within the epic fantasy world behind the extremely popular Kings of War miniatures game.\nMantic's Kings of War is a popular global brand that has led to equally venerated games such as Vanguard and Dungeon Saga. For the first time ever, you can now explore Pannithor through the medium of a roleplaying game tailor made for this epic fantasy setting.\nRed Scar are collaborating with Mantic Games and Winged Hussar Publishing to tie together lore that stretches across aeons, all with the purpose of creating a roleplaying game that lives, breathes, and enables your character to take control of their own legendary destiny. \nIn addition to a Quickstart using our very own TriCore ruleset, we've provided a conversion of the introductory adventure for folks who prefer their RPGs with a 5E flavour. Feel free to download either or both!\nNOTE: both the TriCore and 5E Quickstarts can also be downloaded from drivethrurpg.com (simply click on the relevant text for your preferred ruleset).\nThe pregenerated characters offer a wide variety of choice.\nKings of War is a fantasy setting of epic scope. Originally envisioned through the medium of a tabletop wargame, Pannithor has since been expanded with the Dungeon Saga board game and the Kings of War: Vanguard skirmish game. With Kings of War the Roleplaying Game, GMs and players will be able to explore this grandiose fantasy setting like never before!\nThe balance and stability of the world of Pannithor was cataclysmically destroyed in a long-ago age. The surviving Celestians \u2014 the gods worshipped by many races \u2014 were torn in two, each split into a \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 aspect as their energies sundered with the breaking of the enchanted Fenulian Mirror. The surviving deities that now presided over the world, the Shining Ones and the Wicked Ones, plunged Pannithor into an age of warfare as they led man, elf, dwarf, and other species into the countless bloody battles of the God War.\nThe seemingly endless war waged for centuries, claiming the lives of countless thousands of all races. Civilizations rose and fell, entire kingdoms and empires were ruined, and alliances and rivalries were forged that endure to this day. The Wicked Ones created ranks of monstrous beasts charged with annihilating the humans, elves, and dwarfs who fought for the Shining Ones. Colossal battles raged across the world as armies on a scale previously unknown tore each other asunder. Domivar, son of Mescator, God of Justice, took to the skies to fight against Oskan, Father of Lies, and chief power amongst the Wicked Ones.\nIn a climactic duel that raged across the heavens, Domivar defeated Oskan and took from him the Black Axe, symbol of his dark powers. Domivar plummeted from the heavens, smashing the axe into the world and tearing a great wound across Pannithor\u2019s surface. The cursed axe shattered and the dark gods pulled inexorably into the gaping tear, but spent too was the noble Domivar, having sacrificed himself to put an end to the God War. The great scar gouged out of the world\u2019s surface by his heroic sacrifice became known as the Abyss, and its physical and spiritual gateway to the underworld became home to the dark creatures created by the Wicked Ones.\nBut this is merely a brief glance at the world, a few verses in a chapter of the great book of Pannithor. This is now your world to explore, to choose your path for good, for balance, or for darkness. This is your world to create your own stories and your own adventures. In a world of heroes, it is time to forge your own legend.\nThis kickstarter will fund the production of a printed edition of Kings of War the Roleplaying Game. This full-colour hardcover rulebook of approximately 320 pages will not only provide  new content for Pannithor, but will also feature the TriCore ruleset; a lightweight ruleset designed to empower both GMs and players alike with the ability to use the system to keep the game focused on both characters and the narrative.\nThe core book will not only greatly expand upon the factions that have already been introduced by the board games, but will also introduce several new ones. It will also delve further into the history of Pannithor, from the very Day of the Apocalypse to its current timeline,  some twenty years later. Global affairs will also be explored, including a closer look at the new super powers that contend on the world stage.\nRather than act as separate entities that share the same setting, part of our aim is to provide as much cross-platform support as possible for the Kings of War franchise. We will be including crossover rules for Dungeon Saga, Vanguard, and Kings of War. Bust into a dungeon and claim a relic that will help with future adventures or engage in a skirmish that will make exploration easier in later scenarios. The possibilities are endless!\nPlease note, however, that there is absolutely no need to pick up any of the other Kings of War systems. First and foremost, Kings of War the Roleplaying Game has been designed as an RPG ruleset that allows each group to tell their own epic stories. As each crossover component of the game also has a narrative counterpart, the system will run brilliantly on its own as a traditional pen-and-paper RPG. Mantic produce some truly amazing miniatures and scenery, though, so we wanted to enable as much compatibility as possible.\nYou can read all about the dynamic TriCore ruleset in a series of blogs taking place over at the Red Scar website, including in-depth breakdowns of the core Keyword mechanic, crossover elements for the Kings of War range, and Payback. That's not all. however, as we'll be adapting the exciting elements of TriCore into a PDF for the popular 5E mechanics.\nIf you're new to Kickstarter, please follow these simple steps below to help support Kings of War the Roleplaying Game. \nChoosing a pledge level will not only help us reach our funding goal, but will also provide you with amazing content once the Kickstarter is complete and we have finished production. The handy graphics below summarise the content you will receive with your pledge.\nOnce we reach our funding goal, stretch goals will help us unlock even more potential!\nPlus additional content can be unlocked by simply sharing the news of this Kickstarter!\nAdd-ons allow you to include additional items with your pledge, such as extra dice or miniatures. As stretch goals are unlocked, more add-ons will become available.\nWe've participated in a lot of interviews and playtesting sessions since the announcement of Kings of War the Roleplaying Game, plus involved groups from around the globe.

This is especially the case with Brexit highly imminent. Thanks to our logistics guru, Garry Harper, all of these concerns are being prioritised, investigated and leveraged to provide our backers with the best shipping rates possible. With logistics and distribution connections throughout the industry, plus years of experience in delivering the best packages for Modiphius Entertainment, Garry can deliver shipping rates that are Kickstarter friendly and minimally affected by Brexit, if at all.\nShipping will be collected after the Kickstarter campaign concludes as part of the pledge manager process.

Although we also have active playtesters and many other people assisting, the table below introduces you to our core team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any Kickstarter project, there are certain risks and challenges that can present themselves. Both our own team and Mantic have plenty of experience in handling this type of project, and we've been working closely to ensure that it runs as smoothly as possible.\n\nThe core Red Scar team have a good level of experience in managing projects of this scope. They also have an extensive and supportive network to draw upon should any goblins try to loose mawpups amongst the manuscripts. Regular updates will be provided to not only showcase new artwork or content as it arrives, but to also inform of unforeseen delays.\n\nPlaytesting has been ongoing for a long time now, but will continue apace with expanded input from you, the backers, as the Corebook heads into layout in preparation for print. The majority of the fine details and background are in place, but there are other areas, such as crossover rule, that will benefit from deeper feedback.\n\nWe're also not afraid to make the big decisions that mean you'll be getting a top-quality product. With our other Kickstarter project, the Devil's Run RPG, we took the decision to delay production of the Corebook as the unpredictable launch of a new edition of Savage Worlds meant that the rules would essentially be immediately out of date. Delaying production was definitely the right thing to do and has made for a well-rounded project overall. We are in the process of delivering the Devil's Run project now, which means there will be zero impact on this one.\n\nWith Mantic's support, Red Scar's team of artists, writers, editors and graphic designers are passionate about delivering the best possible product that they can for you, in a timely manner.

For those who toil - and those who enchant...  \nChivalry & Sorcery, the legendary game of medieval fantasy roleplaying, is back! Standing on the shoulders of giants, with refined mechanics and a deep, rich atmosphere, this brand-new edition is bigger and better than ever before, and for the first time ever is brought to you as a full colour hardback book! \nPlease join us as we raise funds to complete the layout and fund the printing of this hefty tome, an estimated 500 pages of glorious colour - the Chivalry & Sorcery Roleplaying Game!\nThe text of the Chivalry & Sorcery core book is already complete, and layout is underway, and we're confident of fulfilling the Kickstarter objective of publishing the game by February 2020.\n\nADD-ONS\nThe Add-ons will be as follows:\nTreason -  GBP 11.95 \nCreag Hill  - GBP 9.95 \nNightwalkers - GBP 19.95 \nGoblinoids - GBP 19.95\nArs Bellica - GBP 24.95\nAdditional Core Rule Books - GBP 40.00 (Backers price only - MSRP will be GBP 59.95)\nWeekend Pass for February 20202 Dudley Bug Ball Games Convention - GBP 10.00 (Normally GBP 15.00 does not include accomodation)\nSince its first edition back in 1977, Chivalry & Sorcery's guiding principle has always been that no one is an island. Every character you play will have been shaped by the society around them - even your landless adventurer or free-booting wanderer had a home and family once!\nChivalry & Sorcery character generation therefore gives you the tools to create well-rounded characters who really feel like they belong to their world. Knights wield secular power and command the battlefield, while other warriors strive to win their spurs in combat and rise to join their ranks. Magick is deep and mysterious, drawing on real-world historical detail, and encompasses many forms, from divination magic to illusions, from harnessing the elemental powers of Air, Earth, Fire and Water, to enchanting wondrous items and artifacts of great power. Priests utter prayers and call upon the very miracles of their gods!\nPrevious editions of Chivalry & Sorcery focused on Christianity as the core religion of the medieval setting. In this new edition, we're expanding the rules to incorporate Judaism and Islam as possible faiths for your characters. At the same time, the rules for priests and miracles are structured for you to tailor them to any religion, whether real-world or fictional, to best fit your campaign. \nIn Chivalry & Sorcery, you decide the level of magic and fantasy for your game. Run a medieval high fantasy game filled with magic, miracles and myth, archmages, elementalists, and dragonfire - or one of gritty, low fantasy, or even pure historical simulation. The choice is yours!   \nFrom fairy-tale romance to courtly love, from religious intrigue to brutal, bloody battle, Chivalry & Sorcery lets you play in just the Middle Ages you want. It caters for the full gamut of your medieval fantasy needs, from knightly vigils and holy quests, dynasties and domain management, right through to gaggles of bad-ass goblins and terrifying dragons.  \nThe Rules\nBack in the day, Chivalry & Sorcery often had a reputation as a complex game. A lot of that was down to the presentation of the core book with pages of dense, tiny print. Today, we'd say that C&S is a detailed game, but not a complicated one. It provides you with all the rules you could want (or need) for running a deep game of medieval adventure with a strongly realistic feel. But the rules themselves, centred on the Skillscape system, are clean and consistent, and adaptable to all the situations you'll experience in play.  \nQuickstart rules can be found here\n https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/281664/Chivalry--Sorcery-5-Quickstart-Rules \nSample Page Spread\n\n\n\n\n\nPDFs FULFILLED VIA\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge level. Shipping costs will be calculated using a pledge manager after the close of the Kickstarter campaign, and will be based on the exact products contained in your final pledge, and are therefore additional to your Kickstarter pledge.

It is, however, a healing potion, which is almost as good. Here's your chance to get a set of 10 dice designed specifically to use for healing potions in the 5E system! Each dice is labeled 2-5, negating the need to add anything to the dice when rolling for anything except a supreme healing potion.  \n  The response I received when I unveiled my prototype of these dice on Reddit was overwhelming, showing me a demand far beyond my own meager production capabilities! As such, I've reached out to get these dice injection-molded so that I can make them available to everyone at a quality level I'm happy with. \nOne major change these have over my initial product release is the corrected healer's symbol: These dice will bear the Rod of Asclepius instead of the Caduceus. \nMy objective with this Kickstarter is to raise enough money to pay for a production run of these dice. They will be finished and packaged in house, as I want to verify the quality myself before I send them to anyone. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll get: \nThe beauty of this Kickstarter is that you\u2019re backing a fully developed product, fully engineered and ready for production! I developed these dice a while ago and have been producing them in prototype-level quantities in my workshop - mainly for friends and family, as a result I know these dice throw well, and the designs you\u2019re buying are complete and beautiful. Effectively, you know exactly what you\u2019re getting.\nEach set contains ten (10) healing d4's - the exact amount you'll need if you ever get lucky enough to find a supreme healing potion. \n*NOTE: The boxes come without dice by default, which is why they're an add-on item. If you want to include extra dice with them, the prices are as follows:\nSmall cherry or walnut case & bottle: $28 for the bottle, box, and two dice.\nLarge cherry or walnut case & 5 bottles: $110 for the bottles, box, and ten dice. \nTo add an add-on, simply add that amount to your pledge. When you receive your backer survey you'll be able to list exactly which items you added. \nI\u2019m a total geek who has way too many hobbies. I\u2019ve played D&D since 3rd Edition, and have loved seeing the community grow into mainstream. I\u2019ve watched Critical Role ever since discovering it a few years back, and am currently involved in at least four active RPG campaigns. \nLooking at the giant chessboard around him, Caolan realized that there was no escape. Two of his friends had already fallen and the enemy queen glared down at him, raising her sword. Resigning himself to his fate, he fruitlessly tried to ward her off. \u201cIf only we\u2019d brought more healing potions\u2026\u201d he thought as everything faded into blackness.\nThe idea for this project ties back to a particularly costly engagement in which three members of my D&D party fell in battle, failing all our death saves and effectively wiping out half the group. My replacement character is a pure healing cleric/warlock who I made to be the ultimate combat medic. Me, being the ridiculous human being that I am, decided she should have her own unique dice. After a completely frenetic week involving significant amounts of caffeine, a decided lack of sleep, and way too much metal music and Critical Role podcasts, the healer\u2019s dice were born.\nWhen I shared my initial prototypes for these dice on Reddit, the response I received was overwhelming. By popular demand I opened the Etsy shop I\u2019d been toying with for a while, and sold out of the original Caduceus dice within a few minutes. I realized there was no way to keep up with demand if I was doing everything in-house, so I put together this Kickstarter to raise the money to get someone to help me produce them (and maybe bring some of my other ideas to light as well - at the time of this writing I have 67 more product ideas in my development list).\n The majority of these funds will go toward getting a mold and producing dice. I have some stretch goals planned (all the way to $100,000 if this entirely blows me away) to get you guys even cooler things if this goes well. \nSome of the money will go toward moving my tools out of my house and into a shop (currently about half of my home is configured as a workshop, and though that\u2019s what I always thought I wanted growing up, it turns out it is not at all what I want. Careful what you wish for, kids. It\u2019s almost impossible to stop working if you\u2019re living in your workspace.) \nExtra funds will go toward getting more of these ideas on my list developed, and bringing you a huge array of completely unique RPG products!\nThe Infinity-Edge is patent-pending by Dice Envy and is being used with express permission.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks I foresee with this project come with outsourced production. I've been making these in house for a while, but I can't make enough to meet demand without outside assistance.

They should be testing the molds this week, then delivery will happen shortly after that. As soon as the dice are delivered to me I'll begin fulfillment. After gaining more experience through my Etsy shop, I feel comfortable stating that I can complete fulfillment on 40-50 orders a day.

You\u2019ll be asked what sets you\u2019d like after the campaign ends, in the survey. \nShipping is included - there\u2019s no more to pay. \nThe digital pack that gets you all the tiles in a format suited to virtual table tops. \nEvery physical reward pledge level gets you the digital pack at no extra cost. \nFor more detail, read on!\n\nBattle maps are awesome! \nEveryone knows that having a wonderful resin scenery set-up, or a fancy neoprene battle map for those set-piece battles is great. \nBut what about random encounters or locations you haven\u2019t planned for? Or what if (like me) you simply don\u2019t have the budget for loads of scenery? \nAnd how do you even transport all that stuff to the game anyway? And even then, how do you keep things sufficiently varied?\nWhen I started using maps and miniatures for my own RPG games these were questions I had to find answers to. \nAnd that\u2019s where my map tiles come in. \nSupplied in sets of 30, my double-sided, card-stock map tile sets will fit in a coat pocket and won\u2019t break the bank. \nDesigned to be extremely flexible in usage they cover 4 main locations: Forest, Mountain Pass, Heathland and Cavern. \nThe art is all hand-made. I use digital painting programs rather than 3d renders, so everything has a nice handmade feel that blends right in with painted miniatures.\nThey\u2019re six inches square - a size I have come to really love in my home games. It\u2019s a great balance of flexibility, allowing you to build very different encounter maps from a few tiles, with extreme portability. 120 tiles will fit in your bag with ease and allow endless set ups on the fly.\nHere's the bullet points: \n30 tiles per set\n4 Sets available: Mountain Pass, Forest, Cavern and Heathland\nFull colour\nDouble-sided \nPrinted on 270gsm card-stock\nHighly connectable within each set\n6 inches square\nGridded and Grid-free options available \nDigital versions available for virtual table tops \nShipping is included in your pledge\nEach tile is repeated in the set so you can have at least one more than one of a particularly useful tile in any set up. Each set has at least twenty two unique faces - I've added more of any given tile where it seemed useful to have spares.\nAnd of course, if you want to be really fancy, just pledge for two lots of each set, and then you can make whatever you like without restraint!\nThe tiles are full colour, 6 inches square and printed on card-stock, in the USA. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s a key feature of the design that these tiles are NOT board - they're not made from the stuff board game tokens are made from. They're printed on 270gsm card-stock, and with good reason: 30 board tiles just wouldn\u2019t fit in your jacket pocket, and would cost a lot more!\nThis is an important point. With many years in games production under my belt I could have these made on board, or indeed other, fancier materials. And maybe another time I'll make something more demanding and expensive. But for this nice straightforward Kickstarter I want the tiles to be both affordable and transportable.\nThey are professionally printed, with a nice satin finish. Let's take a look at some of my samples. These are the real thing:\nHere's a low resolution PDF of the whole Cavern Set.\nCavern\nClassic dungeon stuff, this set features narrow passages (two squares wide on the inch grid versions, sometimes narrowing down to one), cramped chambers, and various intersections. There are also lots of tiles for making larger chambers from more than one tile. \n(The tiles in this image are home-printed prototypes, but show the kind of tiles you'll find in the Cavern Set)\nThere are tiles for 2 tile rooms, 3 and 4 tiles rooms, and even larger caves using the cave floor spacer tiles. It's a really versatile set for making that spontaneous troll hole along the road, or a small series of caves to explore.\nAvailable with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\n Forest \nA series of narrow paths through the green, this set is great for rolling travel on woodland paths. There are a variety of tiles for constructing various size of clearing. There's a tomb entrance, a pool, a woodland stream-crossing and more.\nThe Forest Set is available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\n Mountain Pass \nThe Mountain Pass set works as a variant dungeon too, but is intended for crossing mountain terrain. It has cliff edges both up and down for walls. There are loads of stepped levels in this set, and tiles to make large arenas in the rock.\nHere's the real thing in action: \nThe Mountain Pass set, like all the sets, is available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\n Heathland \nThe Heathland Set one doesn't have the obvious paths or passage ways of the other sets - well not quite. It features rolling open wilderness, scattered with depressions, gullies and rocks. And there's a selection of road tiles that run through the open country. Here's half the set of 30 tiles in action:\nThe Heathland Set is available with or without a one inch grid. You'll be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nFor this Kickstarter we have just four stretch goals. They have all been unlocked. \nOur aim here is to keep things nice and easy for everyone, and to deliver in a timely fashion. \nThese are the entirety of our stretch goals for this Kickstarter:\n\u00a3500 - We fund UNLOCKED!\nThe tiles become real! \n\u00a3750  - Linking tiles UNLOCKED!\nThese \"linking tiles\" bridge between the sets, allowing you to mix them together. There will be 30 tiles in this set, with just the same specification as the initial sets. To get these, simply amend your pledge to include an additional set of tiles.\n\u00a31000 - Extra Detail Tiles UNLOCKED!\nThis is another set of 30 tiles you'll be able to add to your pledge, which feature more specific detailed locations to each of the pre-existing tile sets. To get these, simply amend your pledge to include an additional set of tiles.\n(Mock up to come!)\n\u00a36000 - Dungeon Tile Set UNLOCKED!\nThis is another set of 30 tiles you can add to your pledge, which features rectangular dungeon chambers and corridors. To get these, simply amend your pledge to include an additional set of tiles.\nHere's a mock up of the Dungeon Tiles in progress:\n\nThe art is complete for the initial four sets, layout is done, and they\u2019re ready to be printed. \nWork on the linking tiles and the extra detail sets is well underway, and is a case of customising existing files, rather than making new images from scratch. So if we're lucky enough to unlock those, that won't delay us, nor move the estimated delivery date.\nThe Dungeon Tile set was a surprise addition, but is in layout now.\nWe have to wait 2 weeks for KS to process pledges, during which time I'll make any additional art I may need to.\nPrinting will require a proofing process which takes a few weeks. Once we\u2019re happy with the proofs, we\u2019ll have the printer send out your tiles direct to you for US orders. For those of us elsewhere in the world we\u2019ll order a single large batch to the UK and dispatch from there. \nWe are aiming to be all wrapped up way before Brexit makes things anymore complicated.\nI make art, write and design games. You may have seen my work in Dungeons & Dragons, The One Ring, Adventures in Middle-earth, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Warhammer Historical, Dragon Warriors, Beyond the Wall and many other games. You may have even played the Forest Dragon, a game I made with my young sons. For a long time I was creative director at Cubicle 7. Now I run my own games company, Handiwork Games.\nI also run a very friendly Patreon here: www.jonhodgsonmaps.com, from whence this idea all springs.\nI'm ably assisted in this project by Paul Bourne, who is an amazing graphic designer. Paul has a ton of experience in prepping files for print, and he's helped me get everything ready for production, as well as producing the wonderful graphics you see on this campaign page.\nSomething I want to do with this Kickstarter is move toward the heady days of being a (more or less) lone creator with a cool thing looking for support. And if you like it, you can get some of the cool things for supporting the project. \nMy aim is to keep it simple, and to deliver as smoothly as humanly possible. \nI\u2019m a person, you\u2019re a person, and maybe if a bunch of us get together we can make a cool thing happen! That\u2019s super awesome and what Kickstarter is all about, right?\nWhile I\u2019m going to make every reasonable effort to spread the word of this campaign, I\u2019m not going to use external, paid promoters. I\u2019ll just rely on anyone who wants to help me to spread the word, like the olden days. And that means I'm not anticipating any huge pile of loot here - I just want to gather together everyone who sees a use for my tiles, and together we can make them happen!\nI know far too many people who\u2019ve burned themselves out and really damaged their mental health using Kickstarter, trying to please everyone and squeeze out every drop of revenue. And that\u2019s not right for this project or for me. \nAnd if there\u2019s not enough interest, or this isn\u2019t exactly the project you\u2019re looking for? Never mind! It\u2019s all good! We'll have some fun along the way!\nPledging is easy - simply choose from the menu of rewards how many sets of tiles you'd like. All the sets cost the same, and are all comprised of 30 double sided tiles. Just pick how many you'd like. You can adjust your pledge throughout the campaign. \nThere's a really good deal to be had in pledging for more than one set, and free shipping will not be available after the campaign ends. So don't miss out!\nThis section is nice and easy: Shipping is included for simplicity's sake. I've spend a loooong time working out all our costs, and it should work out just fine for us, while keeping things nice and easy for you. \n\nThanks for reading this far, and I hope you like the tiles and decide to support us bringing them to life!\nThe beautiful Viking Dice are from http://www.dicedudes.co.uk/product/viking-dice-set/\nThe awesome Miniatures are from Red Box Games: http://red-box-games.com\nThe gorgeous Deven Rue Compass Rose is from Campaign Coins: https://campaigncoins.com/deven-rue-compass-rose/\nAll appear here by kind permission of their creators, and I thank them for their support and encourage you to support them in turn!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've run two previous Kickstarters and both delivered nice and quickly. The first doubled in size through the campaign, so slipped a little on initial estimates - we really didnt think we'd enjoy such support!\n\nHaving learned from that, the second campaign was better prepared, and we delivered approximately one month early to most backers and on time to everyone else. That's our aim here too - to deliver ahead of time if we possibly can.\n\nOne \"risk\" is that we're not really taking requests on this campaign. If you have an amazing idea for a set of tiles, or a feature that should be included, we might be able to include that in a future campaign. But this set of tiles is all planned out, and the work is almost entirely done. So in order to meet our targets of a nice simple campaign that delivers on time, we can't change course very much.\n\nAnother is that because our work is largely done I won't delay delivery by adding more sets that need to be made from scratch, so if you're looking for a campaign that explodes with extra content, maybe this one isn't for you. But hopefully, there's plenty to enjoy from the get-go!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Digital Map Pack", "descp": "\u2022 All unlocked maps in digital format, suitable for Virtual Table Tops.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Map Tiles Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["109 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "One set of Map Tiles", "descp": "One set of 30, double sided, full colour, 6 inch square, playing card stock map tiles.

The great news is that batch has positively whizzed across the Atlantic, and is through customs and en route to me right now. That\u2019s quite the contrast to the previous batch.

I took delivery of the first of what I estimate to be a 10 box delivery of tiles! So, we have some on hand, and so dispatch is officially begun to Uk/EU/RoW!\n\nThe (slightly) bad news is that the box was damaged before it reached here. To be completely honest I\u2019m disappointed in the packaging from the printer. The parcel weighs more than 15kg, and is a single wall cardboard box. It tore itself apart in transit, which is entirely predictable if you\u2019ve done much shipping.\n\nSo I\u2019ll be dropping them a line about that. As much as anything else, they need to know their cartons aren\u2019t up to the task. They\u2019ve always been very good to me in the past, so hopefully we\u2019ll get that fixed.\n\nThe UK carrier included an incredibly vague note to say that some of the contents of the parcel had to be destroyed, or repackaged. But that they were not liable for the damage since it occurred before it reached them. So I don\u2019t actually know at this point if we lost any tiles sets.\n\nNo one's rewards will be delayed by this. We\u2019ll see what the damage was when the rest arrive and we can do a count. I'm telling the story only because it's all part of the rich tapestry of Kickstarter!\n\nAs to the remaining 9 boxes:\n\nI have paid modest duty on 2 more, as requested by the carrier. They arrive tomorrow. Her Majesty's Revenue have been very reasonable in their charges, which is good news. You never quite know what to expect, and I've ring fenced a sizeable fund to cover it.\n\nI have notification of another box having arrived with the local post office - I expect there will be some duty to pay on that one before it reaches me.\n\nSo that\u2019s 4 out of an estimated 10 accounted for. I\u2019m hopeful over the coming days the rest will make their presence felt. And that there are no further damages.

Consider backing with any amount at the \"No Reward\" tier to stay updated and get all the PDF content. Become a Dragonbonded backer today and discover this Draconic universe we are creating for your entertainment! \nLast chance to join, final hours of the campaign.\nGargantuan dragons of 200mm tall, with unique designs and dynamic poses. For painters, collectors, gamers, and dragon lovers alike!\nDragons are intriguing creatures of absolute intelligence, wit, strength, and magic, are the indisputable kings and queens of mythical beasts, taking part in the birth of fantasy as a genre. Being a recurring figure in several cultures since ancient times, has given them an arcane mysticism which has captivated and fascinated our minds.\nHence, and bound to their will, we present you this passionate project, so you can take part in this quest and join us to pay proud homage for these most compelling and enchanting beings. \nThe mythical kings of beasts have been part of tabletop games since the first red dragon graced the pages of RPGs. They have been enemies, main antagonists, rulers, greatest of calamities, and even allies in some games. Nevertheless, whichever is their motivation or drive, they always evoke greatness and an ever present sense of danger and omen to the players. In war games, dragons  are tide changers in battle; fielding one of these creatures makes the opponent completely focus their efforts on it, hoping to eradicate it before it can wreck their plans. Due to its nature, no matter the instance or occasion in which a dragon gets involved in the plot, it will never fail to play a role of crucial importance or to cause great commotion and awe among those who behold its majesty. \nThe Red Moon, being in truth a Dralorian misnomer for the planet of Drakha, is the residence to the Great Wyrms. \nKadmos, the first dragon in existence, kept a great desire to make more beings of its likeness, achieving it through a rare fission process. Each new dragon was unique in their own way, and from them, in time, 33 broods conquered every corner of the Red Moon.\nThe Great Wyrms, direct descendants from Kadmos, rule their own broods and pursue their ideals and desires. Draconic offspring and dragonkin are usually present on the Great Wyrms\u2019 lair but each and every brood retains singularities which differentiate them from the rest. \nAs expected from any Great Wyrm, eldest and most powerful among the ancient dragons, these miniatures are really huge and fall in the \u2018Gargantuan\u2019 category, with around 200mm of height! \nThese dragon miniatures can be used in all fantasy roleplaying games and war games. We will provide backers with stats for 5e, the 9th age, stats for our Draco system RPG and other games where you might want to introduce your dragons.\nThis is not just another Kickstarter campaign, this is the beginning of a long and exciting journey in the best Draconic setting you will ever see. Join us today on Kickstarter, and fly with us for many years to come in every new release of this Draconic saga.\nWhether you are a dragon fan, a 3D maker, a role-playing gamer, a war gamer or a collector, we want to reward you for your kind support toward this project and you will receive awesome rewards for your contribution. \nFinal product and colors may vary from those shown\nwhat is included in the STL bundle pledge\nwhat is included in the STL bust add-on\n\n Kickstarter exclusive notice: Please note that some of these rewards might be exclusive of this campaign. Even though we can\u2019t confirm yet what is exclusive and what is not (even the actual miniatures), we can assure you that pledging now will get you extra perks and/or additional items at a discount depending on your pledge level.\nDelivery date notice: You may notice that pledge levels for miniatures are limited. We can produce around 150 gargantuan miniatures to ship on December 2019. From there, we can produce additional 150 miniatures every 6 months. This affects in two ways:\nReward tiers for the same delivery date might have their availability changing to always have at least 1 left for each. When that is not possible, that shipping batch will be closed and we will open new reward tiers for a new shipping wave (6months).\nWhen we open a new shipping batch, the delivery date will display 6 months after the previous one.\nPlease note that this was calculated with the worst case scenario so we might run into happy surprises and be able to ship extra copies if everything goes smoothly and/or if we are able to expand our workshop.\nIn this Kickstarter, we want you to be part of a premium experience and as the campaign's funding progresses we will improve what you get in exchange for your support. Some stretch goals are freebies while others will allow us to cover modelling and fixed costs to enable add-ons.\nThese busts are available as add-ons for $25 USD each.

You can frame it or just keep it as reference for painting your dragon.\nAn alternate sculpt of the head; opening its jaws if they are closed in the original sculpt, or closing them if it is the other way!\nThis head will come as an extra in your resin kit (it is also included in the .stl pack) and if you are good with magnets you will be able to have both head options on your awesome dragon! \nNow that Nixis is unlocked we will start working on the body design and 3d sculpt. We will share the progress with you!\nNixis will be available for any 'Shipping wave 2' pledge level. The 'x4 dragons' reward tier will go live on Wednesday March 20th at 10am Pacific daylight time in case you are all-in for these great wyrms. \nThis bust is included in the digital .stl bust bundle ($15) or as a separate bust casted in resin ($25) and will ship on wave 2 and further.\nScenic bases will be unique to each dragon in both style and size to fit the very unique dragons. The prices for each base is explained in the add-ons section below. \nEpic Encounters are designed as awesome fights where the dragons lore, attributes and unique abilities really come into play.\n Baastherox The Mightiest, a Wyrm of incredible strength and size, has now been added as a dragon reward, we are still waiting for his art, which we will update as soon as it is ready.\n Baastherox bustis available as an add-on for $25 USD which you can add to your pledge, and is also included for free in the bust STL bundle\n More epic encounters, this time featuring Nixis and Baaserthox, these two wyrms are going to get epic battles where they get to show their true might against any weary adventurers.\n All dragons have lairs, big or small. But the great Wyrms from the Red Moon have often huge cities as their Lairs, they claim whole regions and make them their own and have some minions to build their lairs to their liking. We will now be able to make art for every unlocked dragon's Lair and include it in the ever-growing PDF.\nWe were already going to make the stats, but having them ready and printed for your convenience will be great! two a5 prints, one containing the 5e stats and one containing the 9th Age stats will be included with every dragon you order.\nBreath Weapons, cast in translucent resin one unique for each dragon. Similar to the Scenic base they all have individual prices listed below in the add-on section.\nRawraxxa, the Insatiable Predator has been added as a Dragon Reward! This is the sixth dragon in total. \n Rawraxxa bust is now available as an add-on in resin for $25 and included in the bust STL pack.\nImage is a placeholder owned by Wizards of the Coast LLC, we will make new images for every lair, size is still TBD\nBattle scares include the head and one body part (will vary by dragon) with damage and battle scars. this is an option add-on for resin dragons, the bundle for every dragon (that includes both parts) will be $15. The STL files for these is included in the Bust STL pack add-on. So if you want them make sure to add that to your pledge.\nA premium collectors item only for our KS backers, and a great place to store all the printed content, and maybe even the dice after you build your dragon. Every dragon will come in a separate premium box, with the Dragons of the Red moon logo and a scale finish.\nDehrilya the forge queen has been unleashed! if you want new things you must create them is her edict and she is the first to follow it. \nThe last bust, and this SG also includes epic encounters for both Dehrilya and Rawraxxa, their lairs and battlemaps and everything else. With this SG we have unlocked every detail and every extra for the dragons, but we still have more to achieve.\n*physical print with Art and Map included with every physical dragon pledge or above (1 per order) a5 format. Also included in the Art pack\n The Tongue of Dragons (social goal) \nThere is a song, known and intoned by dragons all over the Red Moon. For the longest of times, there never was a record of it, for it only was learned and repeated in the tongue of the dragons. The following transcription can be found engraved in a stone, a painstaking recreation of that song, most likely made by an unfortunate dralorian, dragged there many redmoons ago. Based on the choice of letters to represent the complex sounds produced by dragons, the unfortunate transcriber was of Ysvalian or Tyverian origin. Herein you can find the text, as it was transcribed then, a key to understand the tongue of the Dragons.\nJoin other Dragonbonded backers to translate the song. Once you achieve it, we will consult with the backers involved in this activity to determine an extra digital reward that they would enjoy (RPG based, content, art, etc) and that reward will be sent to all backers in the campaign. \nAdd-ons\nYou can include additional items by adding extra funds to your pledge by clicking on the blue button \u201cManage my pledge\u201d and modifying the pledge amount on top of the amount for your reward tier.\nOne month after the campaign ends, you will receive a survey where you will let us know the details of any items you included as add-ons as well as your mailing address for your physical rewards.\nDice set\n+$10 USD Full polyhedral Dice-set\n Include a full polyhedral dice-set for RPG with the Dragons of the Red Moon style: d4, d6, d8, d10, d%, d12, d20.\nDragon Busts\n+$25 USD Dragon Bust\nThe scale is 75mm.

Join to our community forums to discuss everything about it.\nDragonbond\nAureus Fulgen, His Radiant Majesty\nSivax Magnifex, The Prince of Perfect Ecstasy\nKuxcoatl, Arcane of Power\nAnd more about the unlocked great wyrms as we develop this universe.\nDesign\nThe dragons were masterfully drawn by Tom Babbey, with his expertise and knowledge of wildlife and anatomy of real animals, he manages to create fantastic creatures such as dragons that look as if they could be real. This incredible skill coupled with the complex lore and personalities thought for the creatures, resulted in unique and amazing dragons which are the beginning of a bigger and very rich universe.\nThe drawings are then brought to life by interpreting the detail and emotion from the image and translating it into a 3d model, keeping as much detail in both, proportions and pose, to stay true to the original concept. \nThe 3d model is then printed in a jewelry quality resin printer, the model is split into pieces to optimize number of parts while keeping the most detail and achieving the best result while casting the pieces. \nThe final result is a model truly incredible to behold. As a center piece, the final challenge for the players, a statue on a shelf, a painted entry to a contest, or anything you want it to be. \nOur aim is to make the best dragons out there, and with your help this is the first step to becoming known for that small, yet incredibly fantastic feat.\n\nThe art process of the dragons explained by Tom Babbey:\n\nPLAY\n\nManufacture\nOur resin is of the highest quality, vacuumed and pressure cast to release and avoid most imperfections. We have the highest standards and discard any large imperfections that do not meet what we know people expect to see when they receive their miniatures. We have been producing miniatures for over a year now and we have increased our output and quality exponentially. With these dragons we will deliver our best quality yet, and what we know every collector, painter, gamer, and dragon lover is hoping for.\nYou can read more about or workshop and trajectory in this project update.\nPackaging\nThe miniatures will be produced in high quality resin, they will come unassembled and will need washing with warm water and soap to remove the de-molding agent used in production. The pieces will be keyed for better assembly and small pieces will be stored in plastic bags so they don't get lost in transit or inside the box.\nAll miniatures will arrive in a premium draconic box which we are still designing and inside you will find the unassembled parts ready to prime, glue and paint. If we unlock stretch goals with alternate heads or parts, you will be able to customize your own dragons.\nPledge Manager\nWe are proud to partner again with Backerkit to manage your pledge and get everything right before fulfillment.\nAfter this Kickstarter campaign ends, you will receive an e-mail with a personal link to your Backerkit survey where you will be able to include extra items, or let us know how to allocate the funds pledged during the campaign, and which dragons you want to include, whether you want one of each or multiple copies for any of them. You will be required to introduce the mailing address where you would like us to send your digital rewards.\nAll shipping fees will be charged in Backerkit.\nShipping\nWe will ship parcels to from Mexico to Quartermaster Logistics who will help us fulfill orders with customs-Friendly shipping for US, EU, Canada, Australia and China. In addition, we will ship from Mexico as well offering Mexico-Friendly shipping for our Mexican backers. \nThis campaign has friendly shipping for North-America and Europe. Orders for the rest of the world will be fulfilled from USA or Germany.\nDice shipping: No extra cost if you pledged for at least 1 dragon. Otherwise, if you are a backer for the STL or just the Dice the shipping is $5 for NorthAmerica & Europe and $8 for the rest of the world.\nMiniatures shipping: Please note that each of these huge dragons weight around 1kg including packaging. We need to ship the product from our country to the hubs first and then cover domestic shipping. It is a good idea to order multiple dragons to have them share shipping costs.\nWe will use a whole-order shipping profile on Backerkit, meaning that shipping fees will apply depending on the total weight. \nBase shipping indicate the cost for 1 dragon (or 2 busts); for each additional dragon (or additional 2 busts) you must consider the extra fee. \nThe extra shipping cost on the rightmost column is cumulative for each extra dragon beyond the 1st.\n*Europe zone 1 includes: United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg , Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.\n**Asia zone 1: China, Macao, Hong-Kong\nRest of Asia includes: Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan\nRest of the World: We know how frustrating it is to have high shipping fees (Mexico is usually within that category), at this moment we are sorry we can't offer a better solution, please se group pledges below to learn how to save a little further. \nDelivery date notice: You may notice that pledge levels for miniatures are limited. We can produce around 150 gargantuan miniatures to ship on December 2019. From there, we can produce additional 300 miniatures every 6 months after that. This affects in two ways:\nReward tiers for the same delivery date might have their availability changing to always have at least 1 left for each. When that is not possible, that shipping batch will be closed and we will open new reward tiers for a new shipping wave (6months).\nWhen we open a new shipping batch, the delivery date will display a later delivery date than the previous tiers.\nPlease note that this was calculated with the worst case scenario so we might run into happy surprises and be able to ship extra copies if everything goes smoothly and/or if we are able to expand our workshop.\nSplit shipping\nYou will be able to choose in your Backerkit survey whether you want to have 2 separate shippings, which might incur into extra costs. Or save on shipping and wait until all dragons in your order are finished.\nWave 1 will ship on December 2019 and is available for the first 150 copies of Aureus, Sivax and Kuxcoatl.\nWave 2 will ship on June 2020 and includes the next 375 dragons from Aureus, Sivax, Kuxcoat and any new dragons unlocked via Stretch Goals such as Nixis and Baastherox. \nAny add-ons not included in your pledge will be scheduled for wave 2.\nGroup Pledges\nWe truly value your effort and while we usually welcome group pledges, at this time we cannot offer discounts for bulk other than saving on shipping for the maximum amount of dragons per pledge tier. These dragons are printed on demand so it is not possible to lower our costs per massive manufacture.\nIf you would like to know more details about shipping costs for more than 5 dragons, please contact us.\n Local Pickup (Mexico)\nYou will be able to collect your rewards in our HQ at Mexico City when production is finished. Due to past experiences, it is troublesome to ask in the survey for local pickup to waive shipping fee (a number of reasons may cause this to change in the months between answering the survey and finishing production). However, for the shipping fee that you paid we will credit you that amount at our online store for additional products.\nDragons of the Red Moon is a work of love by people who loves dragons, for people who loves dragons. \nDraco Studios has been developing the setting for over a year; at GenCon 2018 Draco Studios met Tom Babbey. With so much in common regarding unique dragon designs, the idea of collaborating together ignited and since then, the creative process for bringing these dragons to life has been amazingly smooth and perfect. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nDRACO GAMING STAFF\nCreative Director - Daniel Servitje.\nManaging Director - William Burgos.\nArt & Sculpt Director - Daniel Ehrli.\nBrand & Design Director - Renato Escalante.\nContent Director - Rub\u00e9n Ba\u00f1uelos.\nRPG Director - Alastor Guzm\u00e1n.\nGraphic Designer - Heidi Badillo. \nLead Content Creator - Raquel Palafox.\nContent Creator - Sergio Ake. \nPlaytest Coordinator - Ricardo Torrero.\n------------------------------------------------\nDRACO FORGE STAFF\nWorkshop Manager - Abraham Cruz.\nCasters: \n      - Franco Villela.\n      - Roberto Calder\u00f3n.\n      - Itzel Rivera.\n      - Alejandro Vazquez.\n------------------------------------------------\nDRACO GAMES STAFF:\nGonzalo D\u00edaz - Commercial Director.\nMariana Gonz\u00e1lez - Commercial Manager.\nSales Team:\n     - Sebastian Rold\u00e1n.\n     - Gonzalo Diaz H. \n     - Arturo Melgoza.\n     - Saul Borbolla.\n     - Kevin Ram\u00edrez.\n------------------------------------------------\nMusic Theme in Main Video: Scott Buckley.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nCommunity\nDiscuss anything in our community forums.\nJoin our Facebook Ambassadors group. \nFollow us in Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nTrack this project on Kicktraq.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOBJECTIVE \nWith this campaign we want to make majestic and top-quality resin miniatures at our own workshop. Some components in this campaign, including the miniatures themselves, might not be obtainable elsewhere. Our Kickstarter Exclusives / Promos are available only for Kickstarter backers or at special events and fairs directly with us.\n\nWe are working with some of the best partners for this project based in the universe from Draco Gaming (Dragonbond:Dragons of the Red Moon).\nConcept Art & dragon design by Tom Babbey, 3D sculpts by Axolote Gaming, manufacture with Draco Forge, Kickstarter management by Draco Gaming, pledge management with Backerkit and fulfillment with Quartermaster Logistics and La Caravana.\n\nPOLICIES \nThis the third campaign for a physical product of Draco Studios and second for Resin miniatures produced by Draco Forge. Just as the last time we are committed to do everything right and connect with people from around the world who share the love for DRAGONS. \nWe can refund you within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (between 10% and 12%). This policy lasts until the time when we lock orders in our pledge manager, after that point no refunds are possible. If we realise a component cannot be delivered after many months of trying, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nThis will be a transparent campaign, if any issues occur, we will let you know through project updates \u2013 which will be regularly posted after the campaign is funded. At least once per month.\n\nWe are so committed to publish our products with the best quality, that we will put money from our pockets if needed in case of any undesired events.\n\nBackerKit is our preferred software to manage the pledges and to ensure a smooth process for our backers for selecting add-ons. Backers should answer their surveys before the indicated deadline to expect to receive their rewards at the promised time. Otherwise, their rewards will be sent on a second wave of deliveries or incur in extra shipping charges.\n\nManufacture will be held in Mexico. If your product arrives damaged after shipping or has any missing pieces due to assembly problems, we will send you a replacement for no extra cost. We might ask you to return the other copy and send proof of the issue with a picture (in case we need to file a claim with the postal service).\n\nAny Kickstarter Exclusives are available by us only on active Kickstarter campaigns and special events such as gaming conventions. Availability on pledge manager is not mandatory and we reserve the right to take that decision.\n\nCHALLENGES \nEven though we are trying to offer you a flawless campaign, we don't know if this campaign will get enough backers to reach the funding goal. We have a large team that will work on fulfilling this project. We would like to ask for your help to spread the word with a friend, a local store, or your social media.\n\nRISKS \nThird-party issues happening during shipping will be treated in a case-by-case basis. We will share with you every progress related to the project. \nThe most probable delays are: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays \nWe have added some buffer time to the project timeline scope.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, colours and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project page.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Dice Set", "descp": "Get 1 thematic polyhedral dice set with the Dragons of the Red Moon style.

This range features: reinforced walls, gates, towers, and an expandable bunker system, all of which can be built in a variety of ways each time you use them.\nThe terrain is fun to put together, beautiful to look at, and wont break your bank balance.\nHere is a quick look around the contents of our 'Checkpoint' pledge, which measures over a metre across:\nPLAY\n\nThe starting point for the Battlefield range of Magnetronic Terrain is our walls. Like the majority of the range, the walls snap together allowing easy construction of you tabletop battlefield. With a mixture of straight sections, corners, gates, and end pieces, it is possible to construct enclosed compounds and perimeters for your games. \nOur Integrated Guard Towers and Bunkers are also compatible with the walls, further increasing the available options for your tabletop skirmishes. All terrain is suited for 28-32mm scales, making it compatible with the vast majority of mainstream tabletop war-games:\nMiniature used in above example is of a typical 28-32mm scale, standing 35mm high and mounted to a 3mm tall base.\nWe have organised the Magnetronic Battlefield range into a range of pledge tiers and add-ons to allow you to build your collection easily. Start with one of our pledge tiers and then add in extra packs as needed to create a terrain set that meets your needs.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nIn addition to the pledge tiers above, our 'Support!' tier allows you to pledge as little as just \u00a31 in order to follow along with the campaign updates and access the pledge manager after the campaign, where you will be able to upgrade that pledge to a higher tier if you so wish. The 'Support!' tier should also be used if you only wish to purchase items from the add-ons section below, increasing your \u00a31 pledge by the value of the add-ons you have selected.\nWe have arranged this kickstarter into packs that will allow you to generate a variety of walls, bunkers and fortified positions. Simply mix and match the packs to achieve the terrain you need.\nIf you wish to add any of the following packs to your pledge, simply increase your pledge amount by the pack price(s) shown below. You will be able to confirm your selections in the pledge manager following the campaign.\nI\u2019m John Braisby, owner of Cromarty Forge Ltd. I\u2019m a freelance miniature sculptor living in Aberdeen, Scotland. I have been a digital sculptor for over seven years, and have worked with multiple companies to make their dreams of miniature warfare domination into realities. \nThe Magnetronic Terrain range, which we are kicking off with the 'Battlefield' range presented here, started as an experiment on how to imbed a magnet into a cast part. Anyone who has struggled with magnetising miniatures, only to get wrong polarities, misalignment, or magnet-pop-outs, will understand the benefit of moving the magnetisation onto the casting side of the process. Once I came up with a prototype system, I reached out to Mark Rapson at Word Forge Games to develop the product.\nTogether we formed Miniature Forge to bring that product to you. The Magnetronic range combines detailed sculpts, a unique manufacturing processes, and years of casting experience, to bring you a product that is a joy to use.\nThe 'Battlefield' range presented here is our starting point. We already have plans for additional terrain settings, as well as expansions to this line. \nThanks so much for checking out this campaign!\nJohn & the Miniature Forge team.\nAll shipping with be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager and will be based on the weight of the package. We will be shipping worldwide.\nThe following values give an approximate cost of shipping:\n UK: up to 2kg = \u00a35  /  over 2kg = \u00a38\n EU: up to 2kg = \u00a310  /  over 2kg = \u00a315\n US/CA: up to 2kg = \u00a312  /  over 2kg = \u00a317\n Rest of the world: up to 2kg = \u00a315  /  over 2kg = \u00a325\nCertain countries may end up slightly cheaper or more expensive than the estimates stated above, but these will be confirmed in the pledge manager. \nPlease note that all packages will be sent from the UK. Miniature Forge is not responsible for  any taxes or charges incurred from the import of these items.\nAh, stretch goals, my old nemesis! Magnetronic Terrain has been through a great deal of development to bring it to the stage it is currently at. We want to reward our backers for bringing this product range to life, and have done this by offering these items at the most competitive value we can.\nWe have all backed campaigns that have a gigantic list of stretch goals that unlock themselves every time the funding total goes up by 17p, but in order to maintain a fair price to the backer and prevent the campaign costs, logistics and fulfilment time being increased dramatically, we have decided against using stretch goals on this campaign. The product quality is already as high as we can make it and the cost associated with adding usable items make them unsuitable for use as stretch goals.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMiniature Forge is a new partnership between Cromarty Forge and Word Forge Games.

It\u2019s focused around the themes of memory, nature and artificiality, and features a rich world (inspired by Ancient Mesopotamia) as well as a quick-to-learn system that builds each player's persona based on the retelling of their pasts.\nNibiru is a space station submerged in the ocean of debris orbiting the Star of Fomalhaut. A monstrous, steel-clad vulture feeding off of a collection of unborn planets, Nibiru's purpose is unknown\u2014at least, for those that reside in it. Near the Core of this skyless world, a group of enclosed city-states harbors the majority of the human population.\nThe final cover of the book is subject to change.\nThe characters portrayed by the players are different from the rest of the peoples of Nibiru. They come from strange places called Habitats, each functioning as an archetype that changes not just the backdrop of your memories, but the mechanics of how you recall them. From Dreamlanders\u2014people that only seem to remember the lives of other individuals\u2014to Vagabonds of the Machine\u2014who share the memories prompted by a sentience-inducing computer virus\u2014each of the five habitats holds mysteries of their own, as well as unique mechanics that make them all the more exciting to play.\nNibiru shines not just because of its otherworldly premise, but also due to it's deeply thematic and creative mechanics. The game features a very simple, skill-less system that makes your character grow as you recover the memories of your past. Each new entry in your Journal contains a narrative bit tied to a bonus (or penalty!) that serves to slowly reveal your character's strengths and weaknesses.\n As the game progresses, your journal grows along with your character, slowly revealing their true potential as well as their hidden past!\nThe way in which you write your memories has a power of its own. Far from being just narrative justifications for the mechanical development of your character, memories can impact the game via Revelations. Revelations enable you to add new consequences to what you write. Whether by using your memories as a message that can be stored within objects, producing a mind-shattering poison made up of your darkest recollections, getting bonuses for writing in rhyme or for telling an expansive story arc, Revelations allow for interesting tales to unfold not just verbally, but also in written form.\nWhat are you waiting for? Try out a sample adventure and the basic MEMOs system with our free Quickstart Guide!\nThis Kickstarter has been launched to fund the printing of the Nibiru Corebook in a high-quality, hard cover format, with several of our goals pertaining the expansion and improvement of the book. Up until now, the game had been under development for two years\u2014a labor of love that saw us invest heavily in the setting's portrayal, working with amazingly talented artists to bring Nibiru to life. \nLuckily for you, most of the art is now complete, as is its funding. Writing of the book is almost finished, with editing already taking place for the early chapters. Thanks to this commitment, we are able to keep our Kickstarter funding goal low and our delivery times reduced!\nTo avoid keeping you from playing the game for long, and given that we want every backer to feel like they get more as the Kickstarter progresses, the stretch goals we have designed are mainly geared towards expanding the content and improving the quality of our Corebook, which already includes...\n\u25ba An overview of the Nibiru setting, as well as the story of the first nomad peoples that crawled out of the darkness to settle in the verdant immediacies of the Core.\n\u25ba A dedicated chapter for each of the three regions of the Skyless World: Antumbra and the cradle of civilization, Penumbra and its humble colonies, as well as the untamed expanse of Umbra, where silence and darkness reign uncontested. Included with each area, we also feature a sample settlement with interesting story hooks, and a host of characters to meet, so that you can dive right in with your group.\n\u25ba The mysterious Habitats and their Vagabonds, rumors about their nature as well as advice on how to write your memories, tap into the story-weaving elements of the MEMOs system and everything you need to remember your past while securing your future.\n\u25ba Details on the bio-electric life forms of Nibiru, as well as the intelligent machines that are part of humanity's daily lives\u2014each of these beautifully illustrated and showered with story ideas for you to utilize.\n\u25ba A chapter focused on narration, and running games and story arcs centered around the recovery of the characters' memories, including tips on weaving plots in which your characters drive the story via their ambitions, face world-shattering events, escape dark conspiracies and fight to stay alive.\n\u25ba A one-shot adventure designed to get you exploring the station from the get go!\nEither if you just want to dip your toes with Just Awakened or you want to explore the full potential of Nibiru as a Whisperer, there are several different pledges for you to choose depending on how much you want to get involved! As we move past the funding goal, you'll see how your pledge gains value with each unlocked stretch goal, the bulk of which will be focused on adding to the Nibiru Corebook with extra content.\nThe Vagabond pledges come along with a choice: the choice of where your adventure starts. You'll receive a map of the region and their featured settlement, as well as an adventure set in said locale in PDF.\nAntumbra, where Nibiru's city-states stand proud\u2014each older than the other, each a beacon of hope for those escaping the harshness of the lower depths. Your character will need wits to navigate the complex social networks of the city-states, hiding in plain sight, and slowly carving a place for themselves amidst the masses that make this, the sprawl of the Core Sectors, their home\n\nThe discovery of massive tunnels under the Core Sectors delivered the Antumbran peoples a promise of new beginnings: Penumbra, the depths beyond. With time, however, their colonies grew increasingly isolated from the Core\u2014and soon enough, they found within them the strength to cut ties. Your character will need to be bold, facing both the dangers that lie neath the shadow of the world and the conflict that plagues the struggling societies of Penumbra.\nThe domains of the Darkness are highly hostile to human life, with pressure 50% higher than Earth's gravity. Even with that, some exceptional people manage to thrive in Umbra. Weird folklore, mysterious locales, and the ever-looming dangers that crawl beyond the light; the Darkness is only for the strong and the mad. Your character will need to be brave to face the mysteries of Umbra\u2014accepting of the fact that the place will change them forever.\nRegarding shipping...\nYou may use the table below to estimate what your shipping charges will be. Bear in mind that, if you purchase add-ons, your price might slightly differ from that shown here:\nOnce we are past our initial funding goal, we have a host of stretch goals to improve your experience! Most stretch goals will be focused on overhauling the Corebook. When more backers hop onto the campaign, everyone wins. Spread the word!\nYou can purchase add-ons for your pledge, with the options listed down below. Some pledges provide you with one option of a particular product (for example, a specific adventure or map). Buying add-ons allows you to purchase other products not included in your pledge.\nTo buy an add on, make sure to add the amount charged for it (see below) to your pledge. After the campaign is over, we'll notify you when it's time to process your order\u2014where you'll get to choose the add-on you want to include.\nRemember that physical add-ons might increase your shipping cost slightly.

We are doing fulfillment via GamesQuest, and the team is personally going to be helping out to hand pack the pledges. We've looked at options to overcome possible challenges (such as Brexit, for which we've consulted with logistics agents, the likes of RPG shipping specialist Garry Harper). For this reason we've chosen to take shipping payments after the Kickstarter is over.\n\nThe writing in the book (with the exception of parts that might be expanded via the Kickstarter) is almost finished; the game mechanics thoroughly tested, and editing & proofreading is underway. All of this helps us focus on outreach, promotion of the game, and its production.

We hope you\u2019ll come along for the ride!\nThe Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and fun game of keeping up with an ever-changing piece of music, played by a variety of characters on a variety of characterful instruments from the world of The Forest Dragon.\nThe musicians gather at crossroads and campfires across the forest. They produce their instruments, tune up and begin to play! They play tunes both weird and wonderful, with many a twang and bang from their array of amazing musical implements. As the tunes get faster and more complicated, the musicians wrestle to keep up and challenge each others\u2019 musical ability.\nWith amazing art from Rory, Ben, and with just a little help from their dad, games-industry veteran Jon Hodgson, The Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and exciting game for the whole family!\nThe Forest Dragon centres around 3 special cards. On one side they have \u201cBang\u201d and on the other, they have \u201cTwang\u201d.\nThere\u2019s also a deck of 24 other cards, from which players draw a hand of 2 cards. Players must try to match the sequence shown on those special \u201criff\u201d cards with the cards in their hand. They can flip one of the riff cards, or they can move one of them. If they can match a riff they \"bank\" that card. Or they can play a special card that has special effects. \nA round of play takes around ten minutes, and play moves around the table nice and fast!\n\nWe\u2019ve made the game so there\u2019s almost always something to do on your turn, so no one gets left out. And for younger players, you can just play along and have an enjoyable time. For older players though, there\u2019s a lot more strategy - remembering who has \u201cbanked\u201d what card, and deciding which of the possible moves is the best one on your turn adds a lot more depth.\nThere are 8 special cards in the Bang & Twang deck, and these cards form \u201cthe tune\u201d. If you want to change the tune for the next game, you can take out those 8 special cards, and replace them with a different set! This makes gameplay really varied!\nBang & Twang features 6 sets of special cards - 6 \u201ctunes\u201d, and totals 67 cards in the box!\nYou can download a print and play version of Bang & Twang right now! It doesn\u2019t have art - we\u2019ve kept it very simple for home printing, but you can try out the first \u201ctune\u201d, absolutely free! Download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/\nIn 2016 we Kickstarted our first game together. The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9 proved to be a huge success. We raised way more support than we expected, and doubled the size of the game through the campaign! It was an amazing ride!\nThe Forest Dragon was created by Rory when he was 7. He\u2019d been thinking about games, and described the whole thing in pretty much one breath. We wrote it down and slowly over a couple of years turned it into a playable game. And with your help on Kickstarter we made it into a reality. You can buy our first game in selected stores and on line.\nClearly, this isn't really just about making another game. I want my kids, Rory and Ben to continue to learn about hard work, games design, probability, art, layout, writing rules, product design, costings and all kinds of things that are good to learn about. \nMaking a game with them has been a way to show them a creative path, and how the whole world around them is someone's idea put into practice. With this second game, we\u2019re learning about sticking with something, persistence, and all the trials and pitfalls of making that second game. Can we do it? We think so!\nI really want to show the boys the reality of how games get made, and all the different processes involved. With Bang & Twang, we\u2019re learning about what it means to make an \u201cintellectual property\u201d and how we approach a line of games, rather than just one game. \nOur first game was made with print on demand technology that let us order one game for each person that backed us. This time we\u2019d like to try to go one further and make a full print run of the game, and get it deeper into more shops around the world! If we fund, it means we\u2019ll make the game through print on demand once again. And we\u2019ll be very happy with that. But if we can reach some of our stretch goals, we\u2019ll be able to make a more fancy box, and do a whole print run, which will be a big learn for the boys! (Dad has made many such boxed games in his day job, so you\u2019re in safe hands!)\nTo help build towards our goal we had some great Add-Ons. These are extra things you can pledge for. If you decide you\u2019d like an Add-On, then up your pledge by the appropriate amount. You can pledge for them before they are unlocked if you wish - that will help them get unlocked.\n\nIf we do manage to unlock some of these Add-Ons we\u2019ll make some new pledge levels that include them too, for your convenience.\n\nAll prices include shipping.\nBang & Twang Badge Set Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nYou\u2019ll get a cool selection of exclusive Forest Dragon goodies! 4 Forest Dragon badges, a cool round sticker, and a square fridge magnet!\n\nThe Forest Dragon By Rory Add \u00a317 to your pledge\nThis is the game that started it all. The price includes shipping.\nThe Forest Dragon Expansion Box Add \u00a317 to your pledge\n A selection of amazing expansions to the original Forest Dragon game! Includes The Poo Cave, Dogs and Stuff, Robo Realm, Fire Dragon Realm, Quest Givers!\n\nOriginal Game Double Up! Add \u00a330 to your pledge\nBoth the original Forest Dragon by Rory game AND the Expansion Box\nBang & Twang Play Mat LOCKED Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! A neoprene play mat that makes a lovely space to hold the riff cards and the draw deck. It\u2019s 13 inches square making it large enough to use the coasters on too! It\u2019s like a mouse mat but bigger and cooler!\nBang & Twang Coasters Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! These are adorable! Replace the Riff cards you get in your Bang & Twang Box with a set of 3 Bang & Twang Coasters! \nBang & Twang Coins Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! The Bang & Twang coins are something very special - a strictly limited edition set of real metal coins, with gorgeous enamel colours - green on one side, orange on the other. Made by the coin experts at Campaign Coins these are really amazing. They come in a set of three, and are perfect to replace the riff cards in the Bang & Twang box for the fanciest game imaginable!\nBurp & Fart LOCKED Add \u00a315 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! This is basically disgusting. One of our playtesters who is old enough to know better suggested the whole game could be re-skinned as \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d. This will feature the adorable \u201cGreedy Boys\u201d characters sat in a ditch, holding a burping and farting contest. If we unlock this stretch goal we\u2019ll make a whole new base game available as an Add-On. It will have the same rules, but all new, deeply ill-mannered card art. \nWARNING: Will contain pictures of burps and farts drawn by giddy children.\nMany of our fans are friends and family who don't know much about Kickstarter. Thanks for making it this far! We love you!\nKickstarter is a website that allows project creators with an idea to pitch that idea to the audience of the Internet. There's usually a product at the heart of a Kickstarter campaign. In this case, it's the Bang & Twang game. \nIf people like the idea they can pledge money to the project. If enough money is pledged in order to meet the campaign's funding goal by the end, the money is collected from your card by Kickstarter, they take a cut, and the rest is passed on to the creator. And the project is made a reality. If we don\u2019t raise enough pledges no one gets charged. And we go away to think very hard about what we did wrong. \nTo encourage and thank supporters, or \"backers\" as they are known, we are offering a range of Rewards and Add-Ons. These start out at the game itself, and you can get more stuff like artwork, your own expansions and more!\nAnother encouragement to spread the word and convince others to join in, are Stretch Goals. These are milestones which unlock extra rewards. Sometimes they allow backers to buy something new, by upping their pledge. Other times they add something to existing rewards for free. \n\nThroughout the period of the campaign, you can amend your pledge up and down as you see fit. Only once the campaign ends is the amount you pay locked in. So it pays to keep an eye on progress, and pledge for everything you'd like!\nIf you have any questions at all, please drop me (Jon) a line via PM, email, text or whatever method suits you best, and I\u2019ll do my best to explain how to back us! Don\u2019t be shy, we understand that Kickstarter can be daunting if you\u2019ve never used it.\nTo pledge to our campaign you need to hit the Pledge button. You'll sign up to an account, decide how much you'd like to pledge, select what kind of reward you'd like - you can choose to just give to the campaign out of kindness, or you can select what you'd like to receive for your support. We'd love you to have a copy of the game.\nYou can throw in whatever you like above the basic pledge levels - there aren't fixed amounts you have to give.\nYou'll provide some payment details and, if enough people chose to support us, at the end of the campaign your card will be charged. The project creators get in touch a short time after that to collect any additional information they might need.\nFollowing a Kickstarter campaign is a lot of fun. A community of supporters is created, who can all share their excitement and support in the comments section, as well as ask questions or make requests of the project. You'll also receive updates throughout the campaign either here or by email.\nFor our second campaign we\u2019re playing it very safe - the whole of the base game is done. 5 additional Expansions are completely made. With children helping to make the core reward we needed to know they'd be able to finish the project. And they have. We just need money for printing and shipping it to you. We are not spending any time after the campaign on further development, testing or art for the core game. It\u2019s done. This does mean we won\u2019t go much beyond 5 additional expansions, but we feel that\u2019s the best and most honest way to do things. We have not yet completed work on the art and graphics for \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d but should we be lucky enough to unlock that stretch goal we\u2019ll get it done as soon as possible! It won\u2019t take long.\nStretch goals are each unlocked as we reach their milestone in our funding level. If we\u2019re lucky we\u2019ll reveal more as the campaign progresses!\n\u00a31500 This is our basic goal. At this level, we\u2019ll make a print on demand version of the game in a nice tuck box and send it to you with our thanks. \nWe\u2019ll reveal more stretch goals if we do well!\nPraise for the Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it, here are some thoughts about our first game, The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9: \n\"The Forest Dragon is a precious thing, an experience Jon Hodgson and his son Rory will treasure for years to come. And it\u2019s a fine game to boot! We\u2019re so lucky they decided to share it with us.\" - Francesco Nepitello, game designer\n\u201cThe Forest Dragon is as indispensable as wet wipes and snacks, and occupies a permanent place in my 'leaving the house with the kids' bag.\u201d - Gareth Ryder Hanrahan, author, game designer \n\"If you\u2019ve ever experienced wonder while wandering and exploring, the Forest Dragon contains that excitement in a conveniently-carried, child-friendly card game.\" - Jacob Rodgers, game designer\n\u201cIt's very easy to pick up and play the game, with enough depth in the game to keep kids of all ages entertained. At its heart, there's a marvelous whimsical adventure, which had my pair (an 8 and 11-year-old) coming back for more. I knew I was onto a winner when they were picking up the cards and having games without me :) \u201d - Newt Newport, game designer\n\u201cThe most nutritious cardgame I have ever eaten!\u201d - Patric G\u00f6tz, game publisher \n\"Our Forest Dragon card game has (literally) been to the base of Mount Doom and to Hobbiton, entertained plenty of adults and children along the trek and is an absolute joy to play.\" - Scott Purdy, artist\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good game because it was written by a kid; it\u2019s a good game because it\u2019s a good game.\u201d - Jared Earle, writer, photographer\n\u201cIt's an awesome game which my kids love playing! Especially when they beat me at it!\u201d - Gordon Kennedy, game artist\n\n\"With its bright colors, fun illustrations, and easy rules, The Forest Dragon became a fast favorite in our house. It is quick enough to learn to hold my children's attention and fun enough to appeal to adults as well.\" - August Hahn, game designer\n\n\"This game is amazing. I like stealing items from my family, especially my brother. We usually play with the whole pack to make the game really long and exciting, and my favourite bit is the Poo Portal!\" - Milla aged 7.\n\"Both enchanting and hilarious, this simple-but-fun card game is already a favourite in our house. The artwork is delightful. The Poo Cave Expansion is essential. We've played it with small people and with my eighty-year-old parents. It's a winner with everyone. Gutted we missed out on Clarinetto.\" - Claire Longhurst, gamer\n\n\"So good I wrote a review of it\"  - Pookie, game reviewer\n\n\"It\u2019s funny and my wife likes it\" - Adam Littlefield, musician\n\n\"I\u2019ve so far only played it with adults, but they all loved it (and it wasn\u2019t too complicated for them) \ud83d\ude42\" Andrew Peregrine, game designer\n\n\"Fantastic game. My kids have racked up over 200 hours playing this game. A family favourite that never get old! Highly recommended.\" - Wayne McNamara, gamer\n\n\"Such a simple game and great fun to play. That said, I\u2019ve yet to win a game against my eight year old and his friends!\" -Tom Cusworth, gamer\n\"The Forest Dragon is a great game. Attractive to look at, simple enough to play as soon as the box is open, but with enough variety to repay any number of repeat plays. And the monsters are very cool.\" - Matt Cambridge, writer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve successfully made our first game and delivered it to people all around the world. \n\nWe're keeping things very simple. We have our game completely planned, made and costed. Everything is already completed at a digital level, except the Burp & Fart reskin. Everything will be ready to start printing at the end of the campaign. \n\nLike every kickstarter creator, we\u2019re a bit worried about shipping - the price of moving stuff around the world can change a LOT in a short time. We hope we've done our sums right.\n\nWhere we print the game will depend on how well we do. If we fund at a lower level it will be printed in the UK. If we manage to unlock the fancier version it will be printed in Europe, and dispatched worldwide from the UK.\n\nWe want to deliver in a timely fashion, using processes we understand, even if that means a lower final figure.

Ultra high quality components, plastic coated cards & finely detailed miniatures make this the ultimate survival horror experience!\n                                                                                                                                           The Exodus comic book campaign, which can be played either solo, or 2 player co-operative (for 4 player co-op details see \"Kickstarter\" section), sees players taking on the roles of two war veterans, stranded on an island ravaged by a rapidly mutating super virus. Their perilous journey will take them from infested towns and harbors, to the claustrophobic corridors of an abandoned cargo ship and even out onto the open water, where untold horrors lurk.  \nThe comic weaves a narrative around the missions in the manner of a video game cutscene\nComic book \"cut scenes\" link the increasingly challenging missions as the heroes work to complete objectives across a variety of hostile locations. Resources roll over from one mission to the next, so they will need to scour the environment for ammunition & craftable items to build & replenish their inventory.\nThe more time that is taken over your shots, the greater your accuracy. When ammunition is limited every bullet counts!\nThe \"pregame lobby\" feature allows players to level up their heroes between missions, choosing from a wide array of available \"perks\". They may also freely craft items, reload weapons and assign equipment. At this point, players also have the option to \"save\" the game, but choose your save point wisely, as there are just 3 available save tickets for the 7 chapter campaign.\nHop aboard a rib and head out into the open water for a terrifying tussle with the aquatic Reavers!\n The above tutorial video shows the basics of Exodus game play, for more detail you can download the work in progress version of the Exodus Rule Book here: Part 1 & Part 2\nThe 2-5 player Director Mode is a game variation which allows an extra player to take on the roll of \"the director\". Through the use of director cards, this player can stack the odds against the heroes, manipulating spawning, pacing & enemy behavior to suit their own evil design. A director can even be added to the campaign, but only if you're feeling brave!\nThe Kickstarter edition of Exodus comes complete with the intense & emotionally charged \"Dark Tide\" expansion. Experience the terror of the initial outbreak from the perspective of two desperate parents, fighting to get their daughter to safety.  \nThis ferociously tough prequel campaign introduces new characters, locations & monsters to the Exodus roster!\nDark Tide also includes the 2-4 player \"Renegade Mode\". Work individually or as a team to collect as many loot cards as possible, use director cards to hinder your opponent's progress. If you are taken down, continue your fight from beyond the grave, using your freshly infected hero to tear apart the opposition!\nUtilising elements from the base game, expansion & all unlocked stretch goals, the \"The Kickstarter Cut\" is an expanded & extended version of the Exodus campaign. \nThis game mode is balanced for playing with either 2 or 4 heroes & is exclusive to this Kickstarter!\nThe miniatures are created using 3D sculpting techniques. They are then 3D printed and cast in polyurethane resin (near identical to Forgeworld and Warlord resin) or metal. We will confirm your material choice through the pledge manager. \nTo add an \"add on\" to your pledge simply increase your pledge by the stated amount, your selections will be confirmed in the pledge manager.\nZ War One - Damnation was the first Z War Game we made, you do not need it, or any of it's components to play Z War One - Exodus.

Later in the campaign if there is enough interest  from our foreign backers we will add a stretch goal for translated versions of the rule book & cards for some or all of the following languages: French, German, Spanish & Italian.  \nShipping will be charged after the campaign finishes and will be subsidised for all areas.

The HMRC say that VAT should not be charged again on transactions which took place prior to brexit so they will not refund any of these transactions, the various exporters / shipping companies & other people I have spoken to have said that in practice VAT is being charged on everything at the boarder (even things that are below the 20 euro threshold)."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update US & EU", "update_content": "Hi guys, \n\nFirst up the good news.

Our campaign was tagged as being \"EU friendly\" meaning that the VAT and duty was covered by us & not chargeable to the backers on delivery. At that time we were part of the EU and under the legislation of the time the VAT was paid to the HMRC at the point of supply (the VAT quarter that we took payment from the backers).  I spoke to the governments official brexit advisor on two occasions & also spoke to my accountant who had sat in on a seminar with a another Brexit advisor and the conclusion was that backers should not be charged any additional fees in this circumstance. That should be the solution to the problem, however it appears, after speaking with various courier & fulfillment companies that this may not be the case & we are going to be in the bizarre situation of the same goods possibly being taxed twice. I say \"possibly\" because I have heard reports from various sources of not VAT being charged on items below \u00a3130 and then other cases of 20% vat being charged + additional massive handling fees imposed by various countries cowboy couriers.

I have already used my own money to make the prototype and it has been play-tested over the last 9 months by seasoned table-top gamers and children 6-10. At the UK Games Expo 2018 the game was heavily demoed with a huge range of ages from 5 - 55 and throughout the weekend the feedback remained extremely positive. This experience is what has led to me believing in Hyperleague Racing as a product that can be enjoyed by the whole family.\n\nHow to try the game for free!\nOn the website is a free 'print and play' version of the rules and all the current All-Star cards for you to mess about with! I recorded some 'how to play' videos with Luke and Rich from the Glory Goals YouTube channel and you can find them here on YouTube. \n\nInterviews and reviews\nThe amazing Nerdling Mum did a great interview about all things Hyperleague Racing on her Blog page. Check it out here!\n\nRory from Stepping through Games also interviewed me and we spoke about the game but also about Mad-Dad Games and why I choose that name. Read it here!  \n\nTris from The Hairy gamers gave the 'Print and Play' version a go with his 8 year old daughter! You can read about his experience over on their Facebook page!\n\nAt the UK Games Expo 2018, Beasts of War did a short interview with me. You can watch it here! \n\nI mentioned the awesome Luke and Rich from The Glory Goals YouTube channel earlier. While we were playtesting the game, we recorded a play through with a chat afterwards. You can find that on their YouTube channel here. \nBeyond Kickstarter \n\nOnce Hyperleague Racing has finished, I will work my socks off alongside the manufacturers and artists to get the game made! Good news is that the conversations I have had with these partners have been extremely positive to date, so I expect no issues going forward! When they are complete, I will open a Pledge Manager to allow you to confirm your shipping address and postage. I also promise to update you on our progress on a weekly basis at least!\nHyperleague Racing has already got two expansions scripted and more beyond. The Sector 98 setting has a storytelling game within it that my daughters and I made up over a year ago and there is more. But all that depends on whether this is successful first. \n\nShipping Information!\nI have looked in to this and shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers (shipping is rarely one size fits all). As a rough estimate, the game will cost about \u00a35-10 to send within the U.K. and roughly \u00a310-15 to ship within Europe and approx \u00a320-25 elsewhere (for a 2kg parcel), but that is a rough estimate, and this may well change by the time we get to shipping due to socio-political changes in the U.K. and abroad. The only assurance I can give is that you will pay the exact postage it costs me to send your game to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis game has a few key challenges ahead of it but I'm fortunate to be surrounded by several experts in the gaming industry who are doing a marvellous job of keeping my anxiety at bay :)\n\nChallenge 1: Manufacture \nThe prototypes and ships are being made by Dicesports and WordForge Games respectively. I have a great amount of respect for both Rob and Mark and they have successfully Kick-Started several projects between them. I have already discussed quantities, shipping, distribution and am confident that unless a major disaster befalls the project, the game will be able to be manufactured and distributed on time. \n\nChallenge 2: This goes bigger than I anticipated! \nIf the volume exceeds 2000 units, then it may be a case that the date for dispatch will be put back as the manufacture may have to leave the UK for distant shores. I have already approached several overseas companies with good track records of producing quality products. If this is the case, then we will keep everyone informed with regular updates through Kick-Starter and through social media. \n\nChallenge 3: It's my first project. (But not my first rodeo...)\nI have less experience in table-top games design specifically but I do have over 20 experience in writing and running live role-play systems. \n\nMost notably, Shadow Wars; which won Best Medium Sized LARP at the UK Live Roleplay Awards in 2016 and ran for 10 years.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Andy Thomas\nFirst created \u00b7 15 backed\nAndy T is a father of 2 daughters who love gaming and over the last few years has been making simple games for them to play.

In the case of Po if he rolls a Chi symbol, he can use it to heal wounds. \nThe game uses the Furious Action Dice which show various faces: a Kick, a Punch, two Moves, a Chi and a Claw. Players frantically roll four dice to get different combos to move around the board, attack enemies, and complete exciting objectives. The game features a unique mechanic, if you roll Claws on the dice, you move around the Dial of Destiny triggering enemies to spawn and attack!\nWe have a mode for young Masters where the timer is not used, to help them learn the game, you can also use this with your group to learn how to play before the clock starts ticking!\nThe special move cards add more depth and fun to your games, and more challenge to your campaigns. The cards let you summon and use your Chi roles in new ways; breaking walls on your own; throwing enemies great distances; or even reviving players previously out of reach. \nPREVIEWS\nBarry Doublet added an interview with Chris talking about the game from Paris Est Ludique\nWe had a great review from Kung Fu legend and Youtube reviewer, Rahdo Runs Through It at UK Games Expo!\nHere's one of our playtest playthroughs (not final components) to give you an idea of a four player game\nWe've created the Furious Five and the various enemies as PVC plastic figures. \n       You can read more about Kung Fu Panda movies, games and TV series on the official DreamWorks page.\nThe Kung Fu Panda board game is being designed by Kristian Osterby (Escape from the Temple), Nick Fallon (Airfix Battles), James Sheahan (Fallout: Wasteland Warfare) and Rob Harris.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been developing the project for 3 years and the game rules and component design have been through many versions but are now complete except for some final approvals on components, the rules and counter sheet layout. The core game is locked and will not change regardless of stretch goals. The rules themselves are ready to go in to layout in late June. In order to reduce any risks of delays we've taken a number of steps as follows: \n\n1) We have started the tooling process to speed up the 'pre-production' part of the development for the base game and the Masters pledge. This is the expensive production of the metal moulds to cast the plastic miniatures and is usually where you can get delays. We're committed to making Kung Fu Panda the Boardgame so getting this part of the process underway saves us a lot of time later on. \n\n2) We are keeping the Stretch Goals simple and manageable, either with content that is already designed (but would cost to add to the game) or that is easy to develop (though still adds cost to production). \n\n3) There are no add ons to make the project fulfilment complex and this also helps reduce shipping costs as we'll only be packaging one of two different boxes.\n\nOf course games are made by people though, and we've experienced our fair share of life intervening in well laid plans. If this happens we'll let you know and what our plan is to resolve any issues. \n\nFactory production can encounter delays - as mentioned above the tooling can sometimes require changes based on the quality of samples (which is why we're starting now), errors in print files or formats and other issues can add up. With our experience we try hard to avoid these problems but it can still happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "JADE PALACE ACOLYTE", "descp": "Get the email updates about this Kickstarter and decide later if you'll join the adventure!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["145 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "KUNG FU PANDA BOARDGAME", "descp": "The Kung Fu Panda Board Game, your name in the credits PLUS Unlocked Game Stretchgoals marked with the Panda Plus symbol!

There will be an expedited option for ROW which i will post about next once we have more pledges packed.\n\nGlyn (our painter) is currently beavering away on the painted sets and these are going to start shipping to UK backers this week as we receive them from him.

We came back to work for 2 days only then to be hit with a 2 day power cut, 1 day back in work then closed for heavy snow, I managed to get back in for a week before my partner was rushed into hospital for emergency surgery which left me at home with the Kids.

I was supposed to take over a print company back in March, it was already a going concern & was already doing most of the Dice Sports manufacturing work (prototyping etc).  My intention was to bring in extra staff to deal with all things games related. What actually happened is that by far the biggest customer of the company I'm taking over went into administration immediately at the beginning of lockdown (& the rest of the work dropped off to virtually zero). Manufacturing jobs that were underway stopped entirely as trade suppliers & services ceased to operate. Staff have been (and still are) furloughed with it still unclear as to weather there will still be jobs to come back to at the end of furlough next month.

Each base has to have it's backing peeled, surface & edges cleaned, and in most cases tidying up done to get the desired action on the mat. This process takes 1-2 minutes per base and there are 6000 of them. Up to this point i have been using my free time (mostly mornings) to work through them, however current lockdown circumstances mean that I do have now much more time at home to do this. As such, instead of returning defective bases to Poland for them to be fixed and sent back here for me to then test again I have asked to supplier to send me all of the remaining based that they have for me to do here.

Have pro painter Michael Mordor paint your miniatures wasteland ready and grab one of the limited painted pledges before they're gone!\nThe painted pledge - awesome, right?\nSounds pretty cool, right? But don't just take my word for it - this game has been played at UKGE, Dragonmeet and Airecon by hundreds of gamers, each one with a smile on their face. That not good enough? The game has been to many reviewers in the UK and the States, and here's what they had to say:\nThe earth as we know it has long been destroyed, replaced with a barren wasteland. Our once great cities, our achievements, all gone: buried beneath the sands of time. Yet life still exists in this bleak future: a number of factions roam the wasteland in search of salvage - technology from the byegone age - to continue their existence: driving relics from a time long past, they use vehicles to survive the harsh and inhospitable Wastes, and are suitably armed, and armoured, for the task. The sands are ever-shifting, revealing ruins ripe with tech ready for the taking. And take it you will - if you can get to it first. Only the strongest will survive...\nThere are no doubt countless tribes, gangs and settlements spread out across the wasteland, but these are the 4 main factions that the players control:\nThe Salvoes, short for Salvagers, are people who eke out an existence from the barren wasteland. A tough existence has taught them how to survive the harshest conditions and outlast their enemies. Their abilities help them to stay in the fight longer and gather more resources to outplay their enemies. \nReapers live only to sow death and destruction. They are violent and aggressive, and follow only the most powerful warriors. Their vehicles are adorned with the trophies of the their previous kills, a testament to their fighting prowess. Their abilities favour aggressive players, from hijacking vehicles to striking fear into the enemy ranks.\nRuin is the only city that is known to exist - the Ruin Army is tasked with protecting its inhabitants from threats and collecting valuable supplies to keep its people fed and its technology working. Ruin was built around an old military installation so they have access to the most advanced technology to perform their duties. Their abilities use tactical training and experimental tech they can call upon to aid their cause. \nChoosing to lead a simpler existence following mankind's fall from grace, the Desertkin thrive in the wasteland. They have formed a symbiotic bond with some of its inhabitants, hulking creatures which have evolved to survive their habitat. Their abilities allow them to use the wasteland and its creatures against the enemy.\nSelect a faction which suits your playstyle or choose one at random - your game, your rules!\nMichael's Reapers, ready to join the fray\nThe real stars of the show, these highly detailed miniatures allow you to ride across the wasteland in style. These miniatures are designed to fit within the 30mm hexes, from the small scouts up to the hulking big rig at over 60mm long! Although there are many different vehicles out in the Wastes, they broadly fall into 4 size categories:\nEach vehicle has its own set of stats as well as a unique ability - using the right vehicle for the job will improve your chances of success! Miniatures have pegholes in them to represent damage and are supplied unpainted in their faction colours, unless you go for the painted pledge!\nThe objective of Wreck and Ruin is to raid more salvage sites than your opponents by the end of the game: this is a game of resource management, tactical planning and dice chucking as players battle to collect their own salvage tokens whilst stopping their opponents from doing the same. How do you do that? I'm glad you asked!\nA player will spend their action points to move, shoot, and ram with their vehicles.\nAny salvage tokens that a vehicle moves on top of are classed as occupied: at the end of the turn they will be flipped from their red side to green, showing they are ready to score!\nThe Desertkin buggy holding a site\nIn order to stop an occupied site from scoring, an opponent must inflict damage on the vehicle either by attacking it, or ramming it: ramming also has the advantage of being able to push smaller vehicles off occupied tokens and allow you to claim it at the same time! If an occupying vehicle takes damage the token is flipped back to red as it has been contested.\nOnce all actions have been taken, any tokens still green are removed as victory points and new tokens are placed on the map to replace them. All occupied tokens then flip to green again, ready for the next player to contest them!\nThe wrecker holds the site, but the scout has crashed!\nEach turn will have players spending their limited actions to move to claim sites as well as attacking other players. Throw in salvage cards, faction powers, and global events and you're guaranteed a white-knuckle ride to the finish line.\nAction points are the limited resource you have each turn to activate your vehicles. A vehicle's stats show how powerful those actions are:\nThe scout's stats: fast but weak!\nMove: spend an action point to move that many hexes. Each turn of a hex face costs 1 of your movement allowance.\nAttack: shoot an enemy within range. The stat shows how many dice you roll - the bigger the vehicle, the more dice it rolls! Every roll equal or above the target's armour stat is a hit, placing one flame peg on it.\nRam: The bigger the vehicle, the harder it hits! When ramming an equal sized or smaller vehicle, not only do you get to damage it, but you get to push it too! Use this to clear enemies off sites and get you onto them. Ramming uses the armour stat as well as the vehicle's size to determine the winner.\nNeed to know more?

On their quest they\u2019ll encounter many enemies, including infuriating Bogbeans and terrifying Nightmares like the Banshee, the Changeling and the Dullahan. To triumph, heroes must gather charms, equipment and magical relics, to increase their powers and use their skills and combat abilities effectively. \nA little bit of fun inspired by comments from those who got to see MourneQuest in the flesh at the UK Games Expo. It's a work of art apparently!\n                                    WELCOME BACK\nOver the last 8 weeks, we have been working hard to bring MourneQuest back on to Kickstarter.  We want to thank everyone who supported us back in March and offer our appreciation for the feedback that we received during and after that campaign.\nIn this campaign, we have done our best to answer the points and suggestions that were raised.  This includes offering a lower entry-level option for backers, as well as including all the quality improvements that were originally planned as stretch goals as automatic upgrades in all games.  We have also found ways to reduce our production costs so we can now offer MourneQuest to everyone backing on Kickstarter at a new special price.   \nIn addition, MourneQuest author, Garry McElherron, has now agreed to offer a Free eCopy of his first novel 'MourneQuest. The Secret of the Silver Orb\" to ALL BACKERS, who pledge for a copy of the game.\nFollow our progress and help spread the word on kicktraq.com\n                       Click above to view video\n                                                           \n             Download a low res version of the rule book here.\n   \nThere are six hero characters to choose from.\nEach brings something different to the game with various levels of Courage, Strength & Magic and a unique skill they can use during the quest. Heroes can also find some relics such as weapons, jewellery and perhaps a magical dandelion clock left behind by the Elderfolk, which they can use to improve their chances against their enemies.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nAt the start of a game players chose a hero to play, and take the matching Character Card and miniature. During the quest, they must make sure to visit the Nexus Points to gather weapons and items to increase their starting abilities and make themselves into more formidable warriors. By the end of the quest, your team of heroes should be ready to take on the Shimnavore with all the skills and weapons they\u2019ve accumulated! \nDuring MourneQuest many enemies will be out to hinder, hurt or destroy the heroes.\nFirst it will be the pestering Bogbeans, who will more often attempt to steal than to kill; but as the heroes strive to free the terrifying Nightmares, tougher Bogbeans will be spawned and stand in their way. If the heroes cannot Cast-out the Nightmares before they are released into the Kingdom of Mourne, they will then be forced to fight them and suffer misery or even death, from their evil powers. On the Enemies\u2019 Phase, enemies move and attack the nearest hero, more are spawned and occasionally relics are revealed. But do you risk collecting a relic when a Nightmare is close by?\nThere are three types of Bogbeans in MourneQuest.\nThe first, and smallest are the Snipes. They stand about one foot in height and have mottled brown skin with yellow stripes. The second type are Speedwells. They look a lot like a white mole, but despite having a well know taste for worms, they are far from harmless. Beware \u2026.\nFinally, there are the Worts! Worts are tough, three legged creatures that like to sneak up on you, do their devilment and leave you in a very bad way\u2026 Bogbeans are out to steal your loot, but if you fend them off, they will probably drop items that they were carrying, so you can grab it for yourself.\nAnd then there are the Nightmares!\nThese powerful foes are at the behest of the Shimnavore and if not Cast-out from its grip, will break into the Kingdom of Mourne and hunt down the heroes. Irish mythology has foretold of these creatures, no-one believed it\u2026but they are real, terrifying and wanting to destroy. Each Nightmare has an Evil Power which they get to use on the heroes during the Enemies Phase.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nNightmares attack with great power and must be beaten on each ability of Courage, Strength and Magic before being defeated. So, its best to gather the Charms required to cast them out before they come after you.\nPLAY\n\nThe dreaded Shimnavore, trapped within the Silver Orb, bound by the Mighty Mourne Wall is stirring. It calls to all manner of evil nightmares to aid in its escape. The Elderfolk wizards are long gone, so it\u2019s up to young Jack Turner and a few friends of the Hawksbeard Clan to stop them. But time is not on their side, evil magic is being used against them and their skills are untested against such formidable enemies.\nCan they release the Nightmares, defeat the Shimnavore and save the Mourne Wall before it\u2019s too late?\nAll combat in MourneQuest is resolved with a single dice roll. There are four levels of Combat dice. Players add the dice results, together any extras from equipment, to their chosen ability level for each fight, (either Courage, Strength or Magic). They must equal or better their opponent's ability level which can vary depending on the current phase of the Moon to win. \nRelics can give heroes additional power or abilities to increase their chances in battle.\n Prototype copy shown. Some components may vary. ** Miniatures supplied unpainted.\n                                           We are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.  \nInformation about the MourneQuest retailer pledge options can be found here.\n  MourneQuest will be manufactured in China, with one of Backspindle Games' long-term production partners, ensuring the highest quality of game components. The most complex components are the miniatures. Poducing quality miniatures is a long process, which will require us to approve samples and then check the final production quality. Estimated production start date is about 3-4 weeks after the campaign ends and the lead time for most components is 90 days. The custom dice, miniatures and all deluxe edition components may add up to 25 extra days, but we're confident that final delivery time will not be affected.\nWe plan to have copies for UK Games Expo 2019, so the turnaround on this will be as fast as we can manage.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBackspindle Games has been publishing quality board games since 2011. We successfully funded Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice on Kickstarter in 2014 and delivered to backers early. Since then we have published Discworld Clacks in three languages, Codinca and Dance of the Fireflies.\n\nWe have been partnered with a number of leading hobby industry companies over the last seven years. Using these experiences, we are constantly improving our processes, decreasing any potential risks and have the knowledge, and the experience to face any possible challenges that arise.\n\nTo ensure we fulfill our obligations to you the backer, we (Backspindle Games) will be organizing production of the game. Every game project is subject to potential delays, but we will be controlling the production quality and manufacturing of this project directly and believe we've allowed enough wiggle-room to bring MourneQuest to you on time.\n\nPLEDGE MANAGER & FULFILLMENT \nOur Pledge manager is likely to be a pledge manager company in the US and fulfillment will be through a leading distribution channel in the UK. All of our previous games have been delivered 'ahead of', or 'on schedule' and we aim to do the same with MourneQuest. This includes the EU-friendly shipping.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nWe are producing, packing and shipping large quantities of games, so there is always a chance of human error or damaging some game components.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest! (Unlocked): Share videos, photos or audio files of your family and friends with a pirate theme. If we get 200 interactions, between Twitter & Facebook, we will include a sliding chest box to store our booty (80x80x50mm) for all the backers of the game. Additionally, we will include a new Journey card dedicated to the crew of the best submission, as well as a gift for the winning crew.\nFor more information.\nFor more information: See all our booty: the first 46 Stretch Goals.\n$431000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Amazons (6 miniatures). They were strong, muscular women with a height that surpassed our tallest men. They seemed taken by some strange trance, as their rage was supernatural\u2026 The true Amazonians arrive, whose legend gave name to one of the most famous rivers in the world. These warrior princesses are willing to fight to the last woman, and woe the man who stands in their way! 6 Amazonian miniatures with enemy card.\n$438000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New cards for the incident deck, adding 4 new dangers to our adventures.\n$445000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): We are changing four small tile designs into two large tile designs to give scenarios more variety. This double-sided tile is like the Village tiles in that it is 4 times bigger than the smaller ones.\n$460000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Stranglers (4 miniatures). We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed. Another enemy comes to join the rest of the abominations. On this occasion, we\u2019re releasing 4 Strangler miniatures and their enemy card.\n$467000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards (2 models). You won\u2019t believe the beauty that I found on the last galley captured by the Brotherhood\u2026 Our market keeps on receiving new merchandise to equip your pirates with the best against their enemies. 2 x Light Blunderbuss: able to fire at adjacent enemies, but with a shorter range than pistols. 2 x Poison Vials: choose a melee weapon at the beginning of the adventure. That weapon inflicts an additional wound.\n$487000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Tarantula Anansi (Giant miniature). And Anansi came from the shadows, wrapping that pirate up in a cocoon of silk, making quick work of the poor lad\u2026 The powerful tarantula Anansi has arrived to Skull Tales: Full Sail! the Caribbean will never be safe with the presence of this supernatural beast. This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events. The chapel was quieter than usual, the silence falling over the silhouettes as they brought their offerings. This didn\u2019t feel right\u2026 Five new events to add variety to the Port Phase.\n$509000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Campaign V complete. The Brotherhood has received what at first was thought to be a Royal order. After the initial refusal to carry it out, it has become an ultimatum. They have been accused of being behind a series of supernatural events that is reducing the free labor population in the colonies and negatively affecting profits from the slave trade. Either the Brotherhood takes charge of solving this mystery, or the British Empire will bring down all its might upon Tortuga Isle. The only clue that we have involves the appearance, however strange, of huge amounts of spider webs after each event\u2026\n$516000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards. You have asked us on many occasions and our armorer has listened\u2026we\u2019re adding one more copy of the Net, Hook, Bandoleer, and Shovel cards.\n$530000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Character: Swordsman.  \"He spent years searching for his mother\u2019s assassin. But, although he is a master fencer, his sanity is fading away, and he now spends most of his day accusing anyone who crosses his path: \u201cYou killed my mother... prepare to die!\"\nWe\u2019re going to add 6 Final Boss designs to the enemy cards. Each boss will have its own personalized characteristics with different behaviors and abilities. Tlanchana, the queen of the mermaids; Oggum, herald of Yemay\u00e1; Charles Vane, Captain of the Black Sails; and Anansi, the avatar tarantula. We kept rummaging through our last treasure chest and we\u2019ve found a pack of more than 5 cards that are being added to the ones already unlocked. What surprises are to be found on these cards?\nGo to your pledge, use the \"manage my pledge\" button and manually add the amount of US$ for everything you would like to add.

However, we expect to receive the game between December this year and April 2019. We will keep you informed about the production process through Kickstarter updates as we have done with other games. We will try to deliver the game earlier, but only once we can guarantee the quality of the game components.\nThis project is US-Friendly, EU-Friendly, Australia-Friendly, and Canada-Friendly, and therefore no additional charges or fees will apply due to taxes or customs.

Players control a group of Survivors trying to defend their remote mining outpost from a swarm of infected aliens controlled by the game itself. The more experience and power the Survivors earn, the more Xenos invade the facility!\nThis sci-fi interpretation of Zombicide is as sleek as ever, playing fast and furious. The rules have been optimized to reduce setup time and make the game flow quickly, focusing the action on the struggle between the Survivors and the Xenos.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Dark Side / Promo Xenos / Plague Survivor Pack / Orphans Survivor Pack / Kabuki Survivor Pack / Tiles Set / Plastic Token Pack / 3D Plastic Doors / Deck Holders Set / Counter Base Set.\nThe game's character artwork was created by renowned artist Adrian Smith, and brought to life as miniatures by the talented team at BigChild Creatives.\nThe Survivors in the PK-L7 outpost came from all walks of life to aid in the Xenium mining operations, and are divided into two types: Civilians are incredibly resourceful, being able to find useful gear in any room of the facility, on the downside they tend to not be very well protected. Soldiers, on the other hand, usually wear heavy combat armor which give them an edge against the invaders. However, their military training means they'll only find gear in specific Security rooms.\nExplore the Survivors more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres. NOTE THAT MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED. CLICK THE IMAGE TO SEE A HIGH RES ALBUM\nWith some luck, Survivors may be able to use some advanced machines to aid their struggle. If you can find the right remote (or are a tech wiz) you'll be able to control the Falchion Sentry Gun to mow down Xenos, or maneuver the Peacekeeper Bot in coordinated attacks.\nIf they manage to last long enough, Survivors can become formidable fighting machines. The more Xenos they kill, the more experience they get, allowing them to unlock new skills as the game progresses. The equipment they find is arranged in their plastic dashboard, with slots for Hand weapons, armor and other gear that can be carried on the body, and a Backpack to store those things you may not need right now.\nSurvivor plastic dashboard.\nPrototype weapons are amazing silent killing machines, but they require an attached Energy Cell to use.\nSurvivors will need all the help they can get to face the Xeno invasion. These mindless creatures come in several different types. Workers are numerous, but manageable. Hunters are deadly fast predators you need to be always on the lookout for. Tanks can take a beating, and dole out an even worse beating. Keep your distance!\nThe different types of Xenos.\nXeno Worker figures 3D renders.\nXeno Hunter and Tank figures 3D renders.\nCertainly the worst of the Xenos is the hulking Spoiler Abomination! This nightmare can only be put down by concentrating your fire, or literally disintegrating it with Hellfire! Don't be fooled by its size, this thing can run you down when you least expect it. While its spawn cards give it extra activations, it will also leap forward if you ever run out of miniatures. The other Xenos may be threatening, but, make no mistake, this is the last thing you'll see before you die.\nSpoiler Abomination figure 3D render.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Spoiler Abomination also fills any room it moves into with a terrible alien substance we call Mold. This thing eats through doors and walls, completely destroying the room and changing the layout of the map. This Mold may spawn even more Xenos, but worse yet, if it spreads too far, the base will be irrevocably lost (and so will you). Burn it down before it's too late.\nExplore the Xenos more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nUse a flamethrower to burn that Mold to a crisp before it can consume the base!\nThe base at PK-L7 is all you have. Walking out into the planet's surface may be necessary at times, but it's a dangerous endeavor. You'll need to get an Oxygen tank in the Supply room if you want to walk out the airlock. And you better arm yourself with a melee or energy weapon, since the outside atmosphere keeps bullet weapons or flamethrowers from working.\nThe tiles feature several different Zone types, like Exterior, Oxygen Supply Room, Airlock, Security, and Corridor.\nZombicide: Invader comes with:\n9 Double-sided Game Tiles \n72 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n6 Dice \n125 Mini Cards \n15 Mold Cards \n50 Tokens \n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nThe journey into the unknown doesn't end here!\nThe Zombicide: Black Ops expansion raises the intensity to new heights while bringing new challenges for an elite group of Survivors! The Soldiers of Black Squad can be added to your roster, allowing you to play the game with up to 12 players at the same time!\nThese battle-hardened soldiers have been called in to deal with the situation on PK-L7, and find a base already being consumed by the Mold. The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.\nThe Black Ops tiles feature explosive Xenium Pod Zones.\nThis dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.\nBlack Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 \"Crawley\" Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.\nExtra arsenal for the Black Ops.\nExplore Black Ops more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nZombicide: Black Ops comes with:\n3 Double-sided Game Tiles \n9 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n29 Mini Cards\n10 Mold Cards\n39 Tokens\n1 Rulebook \nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China and Thailand, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n\u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 30th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is May 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Invader.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

This first foray brought together Reiner Knizia and \"the Grand Shaman of Games\" himself Greg Stafford, for the family game Khan of Khans set in the mythic world of Glorantha. Now we're back with a Kickstarter for our first Lovecraftian board game since 1987! I'm excited to be working with Reiner again, exploring the world of horror in a fast-paced, fun-filled, push-your-luck game.\n\nSet in the treacherous and terrifying Restricted Collection of Miskatonic University's Orne Library, the game features grimoires, elder signs, academic politics and madness \u2014 and that endlessly renewable resource, graduate students! We hope you'll join us on our journey by supporting this Kickstarter and make the Miskatonic University game a reality!\nThe Details\nThe game comes in an awesome box (8\" x 6\" or 20cm x 15cm), disguised as a book. Very appropriate for a game about libraries!\n What's in the box?\n5 Player Desk Boards \n80 Library Cards\n5 sets of Defense Cards \nScoring Cards \nRule Book  \nThe Story \nThe game is a quest.  An extremely dangerous quest. Dr Henry Armitage, Chief Librarian, needs you to search the perilous Restricted Collection for fragments of lore from among the grimoires, and recover pieces of a particular sigil.\n\nIt all began when, as leading scholars at Miskatonic University, you were gathered together to discuss who would be awarded the coveted position of Head of the Library Committee. Suddenly tragedy and horror struck\u2014a monster had been unleashed, presumably by some foolish graduate student! Dr. Armitage leapt into action and asked for your help. He needs you to gather the necessary tools to banish the foul abomination.\n\nYou explore the Restricted Collection for the grimoire fragments and sigils he needs. However it is a perilous journey and you must be prepared to flee before you are driven mad! The victor is the professor who finds the most sets, while retaining a semblance of sanity. Also, look out for hapless wandering graduate students as they can aid in your defenses!\nHow to Play\nThere are five rounds in the game. Each round continues until no-one is left in the library, having left \"voluntarily\" or having been expelled. \nBasic play consists of taking turns to select a Library Card and placing these cards face up on your player mats.\nThere are three types of Library Cards. Sigil Pieces, Grimoire Fragments and Graduate Students, that fit neatly into the player mat:\nThere are two ways to exit the library. Choosing to leave or being expelled:\n Defense cards are a key part of the game:\n You win by having the highest score:\nGame End \nThe game ends when the final fifth round is played. \nYou then add up all the score cards they have received and the one with the highest score wins! \nThe winning scholar will become the head of the Library committee! And armed with the sigil pieces and grimoire fragments you collected, Dr. Armitage heads out into the night to take on the monster. He beckons you to follow him . . .\nVideos\nOur Board Games Line Editor, Susan, shows how the game is set up to play\n.\nPLAY\n\nSusan discusses how the game unfolds...\nPLAY\n\nHere is actual play of the game, recorded in the chapel at Schloss Neuhausen, Germany in October 2017. Please note, the game components used here are a prototype, but the game play and rules are exactly the same as in the final version that will go to publication.

We will announce these as the campaign proceeds...\nRewards\nYou'll see in the pledge levels, aside from the game itself we have some extra rewards.  Here's some more details about these:\nPledge Levels\nWe have 10 different pledge levels, starting at student and progressing up to Dean of as yet unnamed new departments. Along with the basic level of professor, where you get the game, we have opportunities for you to join a fraternity or sorority where you can nominate the name of those graduate students wandering the Restricted Collection!\nOr you can choose to be a valedictorian, with a special plaque to prove it! There are vacancies for the Vice Chancellor, the Chancellor, or even a prestigious position as a member of the Board of Trustees. \nSHIPPING\nWhat about shipping? We hate the high cost of shipping, and have worked hard to set up the fulfillment of the rewards so they get shipped as quickly and inexpensively as possible. We do not expect to make any money from our shipping charges. However, we also cannot afford to lose money on shipping. The way it will work is after the campaign we will send out a survey to gather your addresses. We will use this data to get the most detailed shipping pricing we can based on our actual cost to ship your reward level to your home and then charge you that amount. We will ship from fulfillment centers in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia. More locations may be added based on where backers are located. The approximate weight of the game will be under one kilogram (under two pounds), including the shipping box and packing material.

Average playing time 60-90 minutes\nPlayers assume the roles of the book's heroes and must journey in the Mourne Mountains to work together to defeat the evil Shimnavore before it is too late. On their quest they\u2019ll encounter many enemies, including infuriating Bogbeans and terrifying Nightmares like the Banshee, the Changeling and the Dullahan. To triumph, heroes must gather charms, equipment and magical relics, to increase their powers and use their skills and combat abilities effectively.\n                                      There are six hero characters to choose from.  \nEach brings something different to the game with various levels of Courage, Strength & Magic and a unique skill they can use during the quest. Heroes can also find some relics such as weapons, jewellery and perhaps a magical dandelion clock left behind by the Elderfolk, which they can use to improve their chances against their enemies.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nAt the start of a game players chose a hero to play, and take the matching Character Card and miniature. During the quest, they must make sure to visit the Nexus Points to gather weapons and items to increase their starting abilities and make themselves into more formidable warriors. By the end of the quest, your team of heroes should be ready to take on the Shimnavore with all the skills and weapons they\u2019ve accumulated!\nDuring MourneQuest many enemies will be out to hinder, hurt or destroy the heroes. \nFirst it will be the pestering Bogbeans, who will more often attempt to steal than to kill; but as the heroes strive to free the terrifying Nightmares, tougher Bogbeans will be spawned and stand in their way. If the heroes cannot Cast-out the Nightmares before they are released into the Kingdom of Mourne, they will then be forced to fight them and suffer misery or even death, from their evil powers. On the Enemies\u2019 Phase, enemies move and attack the nearest hero, more are spawned and occasionally relics are revealed. But do you risk collecting a relic when a Nightmare is close by?\nThere are three types of Bogbeans in MourneQuest. \nThe first, and smallest are the Snipes. They stand about one foot in height and have mottled brown skin with yellow stripes. The second type are Speedwells. They look a lot like a white mole, but despite having a well know taste for worms, they are far from harmless. Beware \u2026.  \nFinally, there are the Worts! Worts are tough, three legged creatures that like to sneak up on you, do their devilment and leave you in a very bad way\u2026 Bogbeans are out to steal your loot, but if you fend them off, they will probably drop items that they were carrying, so you can grab it for yourself. \n And then there are the Nightmares! \nThese powerful foes are at the behest of the Shimnavore and if not Cast-out from its grip, will break into the Kingdom of Mourne and hunt down the heroes. Irish mythology has foretold of these creatures, no-one believed it\u2026but they are real, terrifying and wanting to destroy. Each Nightmare has an Evil Power which they get to use on the heroes during the Enemies Phase. \nPLAY\n\nNightmares attack with great power and must be beaten on each ability of Courage, Strength and Magic before being defeated. So, its best to gather the Charms required to cast them out before they come after you. \nThe dreaded Shimnavore, trapped within the Silver Orb, bound by the Mighty Mourne Wall is stirring. It calls to all manner of evil nightmares to aid in its escape. The Elderfolk wizards are long gone, so it\u2019s up to young Jack Turner and a few friends of the Hawksbeard Clan to stop them. But time is not on their side, evil magic is being used against them and their skills are untested against such formidable enemies. \nCan they release the Nightmares, defeat the Shimnavore and save the Mourne Wall before it\u2019s too late?\nAll combat in MourneQuest is resolved with a single dice roll. There are four levels of Combat dice. Players add the dice results, together any extras from equipment, to their chosen ability level for each fight, (either Courage, Strength or Magic). They must equal or better their opponent's ability level which can vary depending on the current phase of the Moon to win.\nRelics can give heroes additional power or abilities to increase their chances in battle.\nPrototype copy shown. Some components may vary. ** Miniatures supplied unpainted.\nPLAY\n\n** Miniatures supplied unpainted.\nMourneQuest (both retail and deluxe editions) will be manufactured in China, with one of Backspindle Games' long-term production partners, ensuring the highest quality of game components. The most complex components are the miniatures. With guidance from Soda Pop Miniatures (many thanks for your support) our emphasis has been on creating quality products. However producing quality miniatures is a long process, which will require us to approve samples and then check the final production quality. Estimated production start date is about 3 weeks after the campaign ends and the lead time for most components is 90 days. The custom dice, miniatures and all deluxe edition components may add up to 15 extra days, but we're confident that final delivery time will not be affected.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBackspindle Games has been publishing quality board games since 2011. We successfully funded Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice on Kickstarter in 2014 and delivered to backers early. Since then we have published Discworld Clacks in three languages, Codinca and Dance of the Fireflies.\n\nWe have been partnered with a number of leading hobby industry companies over the last seven years. Using these experiences, we are constantly improving our processes, decreasing any potential risks and have the knowledge, and the experience to face any possible challenges that arise.\n\nTo ensure we fulfill our obligations to you the backer, we (Backspindle Games) will be organizing production of the game. Every game project is subject to potential delays, but we will be controlling the production quality and manufacturing of this project directly and believe we've allowed enough wiggle-room to bring MourneQuest to you on time. \n\nWe plan to have copies for Essen 2018, so the turnaround on this will be as fast as we can manage.\n\nPLEDGE MANAGER & FULFILLMENT\nOur Pledge manager is likely to be BackerKit and fulfillment will be through a leading distribution channel in the UK. All of our previous games have been delivered ahead of, or on schedule and we aim to do the same with MourneQuest. This includes the EU-friendly shipping.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nWe are producing, packing and shipping large quantities of games, so there is always a chance of human error or damaging some game components.

A mysterious outbreak has claimed the lives of nearly everyone there... what's worse is they are crawling the stores and commons as Zombies hungry for flesh. Only a few Survivors remain. Are you among the Survivors? Or are you one of the ravenous Zombies? The choice is yours in Tiny Epic Zombies!\nArm your Meeples for Survival with...\nBazooka and Katana included in Deluxe games only. Additional items unlockable through stretch goals.\n   Tiny Epic Zombies is a 30 minute, 1-5 player, game of survival that features 5 distinct play modes:\n1. Cooperative team-play with game controlled Zombies.\n2. Cooperative team-play with Zombies controlled by a non-team player.\n3. Competitive free-for-all with game controlled Zombies.\n4. Competitive free-for-all with Zombies controlled by a player.\n5. Solo.\nIn Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.\nWhy Back This Project? \nGreat Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action.

Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!\nWIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.\nOVERVIEW: Simplicity shines in Tiny Epic Zombies. \nBased on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.\nExample Survivor:\nNote: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.\nIf you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.\nAs a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! However, due to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

The 32 mm Versions have metal wheels but the 15 mm & 20 mm Casts will be 1 piece and include the wheels. \n The smaller Scale LARC's will be available as Add ons, and will come as a Regular Model with the Upgrade Components available Separately. Note: the 15 mm & 20 mm Upgrade Components will also be great for a variety of conversions and other Tabletop Car Games.\nFunding Goal - \u00a3750.00\n  Our first Goal  is \u00a3750.00 - this will allow us to have the first 4 Sculpts produced in 20 mm, all 15 designs in 15mm and new Masters 3d Printed plus fund the first production run in both scales. This will fund the whole of Bundle 1 in both scales; the Compact Car, SUV, Luxury 4x4 & People Carrier. \nBIG UPDATE TIME!\nAfter having spent a lot of time planning with our Caster today - we have a few changes to make; firstly, when we reach the \u00a3750  funding goal we can make ALL of the designs in 15mm, this is because instead of multiple moulds with 1 car each, we can do a few moulds with multiple cars each - the 20mm are larger, so we will still have stretch goals on those. \nAlso, we can add in the 15mm & 20mm Landrover as an Addon when we reach \u00a3750. \nIf that weren't enough, the Caster has sorted out the sprues for the Weapons addons, and we will be offering those up as well!\nWeapon loadout A - minus VTOL spades\n  Sci Fi Weapons - taxi for show!\n  Funding Goal - Bundle 1\n  20mm Cars - 3d Masters\n  Stretch Goal 1 - Bundle 2 - \u00a31,500\n Reaching \u00a31,500 will allow us to miniaturise the next 4 vehicles and have them 3d printed and put into production - the \"Working Cars\" are the Taxi, Delivery Van, Pickup and Police Pursuit Cruiser. Reaching this Stretch Gol will allow us to make them in 20 mm scale.\nBundle 2 - Working Cars\n  20mm Cars - 3d Masters\n  Stretch Goal 2 - 15 mm LARC - \u00a31,750\nLARC Render\n  15mm LARC\n  15mm LARC Sample Size - tank for show only\nReaching \u00a31,750 will allow us to Miniaturise the LARC VTOL and 3d print it in 15 mm. This will then become an addon for only an additional +\u00a310.00 to your pledge. \n15mm LARC\nWe can also look at creating the LARC Upgrade pack as an addon - this will be a further +\u00a37.50 but contains no less than 12 High Quality Resin components including; Grenade Launcher, 2 Rocket Launchers, 2 Mini Guns, 2 Life Pods, 2 Drone Racks, Camera Gear.\nLARC Weapon & Equipment Upgrades\n Stretch Goal 3 - Bundle 3 - \u00a32,500\nReaching \u00a32,500 will allow us to miniaturise the next 4 vehicles and have them 3d printed and put into production - the \"Classic 80's Cars\" are the Small Car, the 80's Sports Car, the Muscle Car and the Little Italian. Reaching this Stretch Gol will allow us to make them in 20 mm scale.\n    80's Classic Cars\n  15mm 80's cars\n And.. should we surpass that?\nWell.. we have the LARC in 20 mm still to come and the Sci Fi cars bundle consisting of the Miniaturised Augustus Street Car, Romulus Stretched Limo and Remus Roadster. \nAnd.. after that..? Lets wait and see how far the journey takes us. \n        Sci Fi Cars\n  20 mm LARC\n FREE TUKTUK!!\nKS Exclusive TukTuk\n    20mm TukTuk Sample 3d Master Print\nEvery backer whom supports our Kickstarter will receive a FREE 15 mm or 20 mm Coffeeshop Tuktuk (to go with your matching scale Pledge).

These are gorgeous little models and you can see a photograph of a few samples of the 15mm version that we have had made already. \nWeapons packs Addon\n   The weapons packs consist of;\n2 x Mini gun, 2 x Quad Rocket Pods, 1 x Grenade Launcher Turret, 2 x MG's, 2 x Heavy Beamers. In 15mm they are \u00a33.50 per pack as an addon or in 20mm +\u00a36.00 as an addon. \n(The taxi in the above image is for show and scale purposes only - images shown are the 15mm scaled Weapons).\nPhotography\nLets take a look at some of the Models themselves - we have a full fun of the 32mm Cars to give a good idea of what they look like, and have had a small scattering of both the 20 mm and the 15 mm Vehicles 3d Printed to give an indication of size. \n15mm Samples\n  20mm Cars Street Scene\n  15mm LARC & Tank\n  15mm Sci Fi Cars\nWe have used a few sample Miniatures from other ranges to give an idea of how these miniatures lineup with them and also taken several Photographs of the models with Rulers to give you an accurate idea on exactly what size they are. \nCan't I just get XXX Toy Cars for \u00a32.00 each? \nToy cars are so cheap, i can buy loads for 50p... \nI can buy that for a dollar!\nThis is true - and there is no way we can compete with the prices of many of the Mass produced metal cars out there - Hotwheels, Matchbox, etc.. and we wouldn't even try.\nOur cars simply offer an alternative, we can't quite match the price (but aren't far off) but resin is easier to work with, holds detail beautifully, is easier to convert than hard metal, give you more options (you can never have too many different little cars) and.. all going well.. we will be offering packs of Weapons, etc in 2 scales with which to convert any other models!\nShown with Toy car for size comparison\n     Postage\nWe will add Postage on after the Kickstarter, when the questionnaires go out to ask you what Bundles, Cars, etc you would like for your pledge.\nWe have an excellent 3rd party whom will ship the Pledges for us - prices will be approximately\n\u00a34-\u00a35 to the UK\n\u00a37-\u00a38 to the Rest of World\nAs we believe 99% of the Pledges will be under 2kg, which seems to be the magic number for Mailing! \n- Of course, smaller pledges globally may be a little less whilst any crazy big pledges might be slightly more.

You will collect allies and live entire lives to give you the greatest chance at winning your duels - but you do not get to decide when exactly you will meet your foes on the battlefield \u2013 all you can do is prepare in the hope that you are the more powerful!\n\"Highlander\u201d is a trademark of Studiocanal S.A.S.

Each model will be made of white metal and will come with a character sheet to integrate him into the game. \nTo add Osta Vasilek to your pledge, follow these steps:\n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page. If you have not pledged yet it will say 'back this project'.\n2. Increase your pledge by \u00a310. If you wish multiple copies of Vasilek you can increase your pledge by the approppriate amount (\u00a310 per copy of Vasilek add-on)\n3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at. After the campaign finishes we will be using a pledge manager to ask you whether you requested the Vasilek add-on. At this point you should also be able to change your pledge to a higher value to add Osta, if you have not already done so.\nWE HAVE UNLOCKED ALL OF OUR STRETCH GOALS! CHECK OUT WHAT YOU WILL GET WITH EVERY COPY OF HIGHLANDER BELOW!\nUnique cards which open up new possibilities. Each additional set of cards will increase the variance between your games as you cannot know for certain what lies within your deck. \nIconic immortals from the movie (as well as all new immortals?) to control. Each immortal has their own biography as well as a special power to aid them in claiming the prize. Will you fight the good fight or claim the prize for evil, and plunge the world into an age of darkness and despair? \nAll stretch goals are in US DOLLARS.\n                                         PLAY\n\nHighlander is a game of elimination. It is short and furious, where the fate of your game relies on your wits as well as the whims of fate. Before the game you choose an immortal to play, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\nAn immortal has three important stats: Cunning, Power and Influence, each is represented by a die value, the lowest being a D4 and the highest being a  D8.\nCunning represents an immortal's ability to out think their opponents and gives you a better chance at going first in a turn or avoiding duels that are not favorable for you.\nInfluence represents the immortal's social and economic capital and allows you to look at more cards whenever you are laying low or on the hunt.\nPower. At some point you are going to need power to destroy your opponent, power wins duels and duels are how you defeat other immortals to become the one to claim the prize.\nFinally each immortal has a unique special ability that gives them an edge over their opponents\nEach turn immortals roll their cunning to see who goes first, if two immortals roll the same number a duel occurs! The immortals that are not dueling may then take actions, either delving into the era deck in search of upgrades or into the encounter deck to hunt their fellow immortals.\nThese actions will give you access to different cards which give them new abilities or upgrades (and downgrades!) to their three stats.\nWeapon and ally cards are slotted into your immortal card vertically and give you a special ability. \nLife cards represent a life spent towards a single pursuit, be it justice, war or even indulgence. Life cards upgrade and downgrade your main stats and allow you to roll D10s or even D12s, giving you a better chance to defeat your enemies.\nAll things must come to an end however and when the era deck runs out the game enters the Gathering phase. Gone is the opportunity to hide from duels, gone is the orderly turn taking - each immortal must duel until only one remains.\nEach immortal in a duel must roll power, the immortal that rolls highest draws a fate card and activates it. Fate cards can be bonuses to the victor or penalties to the vanquished but hidden within the fate deck is the behead card which ends the game for your foe and brings you one step closer to victory. The behead card is always shuffled back into the fate deck so as the game goes on your chances of survival get lower and lower. If you are the last immortal standing, you claim the prize and win the game!\nRiver Horse was started in 2010 by Alessio Cavatore (Warhammer, 40K, The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game, Kings of War, and Bolt Action). Since then we have worked tirelessly on original and licensed titles, combining famous media with thematic design to create evocative tabletop experiences (Terminator Genisys: The miniatures game, Jim Hensons Labyrinth: The board game, Tails of Equestria: The storytelling game). So join us as we embark once again to bring the silver screen to the tabletop in Highlander, The board game.\nThere are many reasons to use kickstarter but the one that is most prevalent in our minds is that it allows us to give our customers the product they deserve. Each stretch goal you unlock makes our process more economically viable and so we can pass those savings onto you, stuffing the game with more and more options, cards and miniatures. The end result being a game which has a lot more inside than would have been possible with more traditional methods.\nWe will be charging shipping costs after the Kickstarter ends, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this in our pledge manager after the end of the campaign. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in NA or the UK. As an estimate, the shipping charge will be around USD10-25, depending on territory, the quantity of stretch goals we unlock and your choices. Please note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner and at the best delivery cost we can, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough of course there are risks and challenges to any new endeavour, the foreseeable obstacles on this project are small.

Choose the plays, make the passes, and try to score, but remember: time is running out in the fourth quarter.\n Fourth Quarter Football gives you the feel of Football, but in a game that can be played in under one and a half hours. There are no endless tables and charts, just heart pumping action focusing on the key skill players (although with the addition of Subs Pack One, the game can be played up to the full eleven a side). The game has a unique combination table top miniatures action with tactical deck building.\nFor further game play information, visit our You Tube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK82FGKNUzL7NKkF-8qSykA\nTo see a full game being played out 'live' visit our Face Book Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FourthQuarterFootballGame/videos/307653389723329/\nThe figures\nFantastically Detailed 32mm Figures\n Fourth Quarter Football comes with a selection of superbly detailed 32mm scale resin figures. The base game has an offense and a defense in different coloured resin, so they can be played with no painting required. Or you can paint the figures in your own designs.\n  Molded figures from our test run.\nStep One: choose your pledge:\nOption One:\n Option two:\nStep Two: choose your optional add ons\nWhen ordering the extra team please note: this will come with player cards and a 20 card play deck (a selection from the base game). The players in the team will comprise the 13 from the base game plus the center figure.\nWhen ordering individual players, please note:\nThe player will come with one player card.\nA skill player from the offense will include between one a three play cards.\nYou may pledge for any player, but there are positional maximums in the game. No more than two of any skill position. No extra linemen. Only one Quarter back. On defense, no more than three of any positions.\nWhen ordering the Substitutes pack one please note: The pack contains six figures, but for any of the pledges og \u00a399 and over, it will contain a bonus six figures.\nStretch Goals\nWe made all of our original stretch goals, so we added more to the list!\nStretch goal figures unlocked so far:\nSo far the Tight End, Full Back, Alternative QB and Safety extra figures have been unlocked and added to the base game. These figures also include player cards and for the Tight End, new play cards specifically to get him into the action. \nThere is now a center figure, as an alternative pose for a lineman,  included in each team. \nGame Play\nFourth Quarter Football is the closest you can come to playing Gridiron Football without donning shoulder pads. Players create playbook decks of play cards and select plays from those dealt to their hand. The play card chosen is then executed on the field, using a series of unique mechanics.\nFor more information see our you tube channel, or scroll to the bottom of this page to view more details. \nUnique Counters\nCustom Dice\nNew: Substitutes Pack 1\nNote: If you wish to play with the full eleven-a-side, this is possible by  adding on this substitute pack to your pledge.\nThis pack contains six figures to add new tactical options in Fourth Quarter Football (2 Tackles, 1 Running Back, Two Outside Linebackers and a Defensive Tackle).  Note: The running back and D Tackle figures are the same figures as in the base game.  The pack also contains rules for expanding Fourth Quarter Football  to eight, nine and eleven a side. Players cards and new play cards are also included.\nGame Play in More Detail.\nThe Field of Play:   \n.    \nThe blimp eye view of the FQF Stadium\nThere are three types of play: pass, run and trick plays.  Players may mix as many pass and run plays in their deck as they like, but they may have only two trick plays. Their opponent is allowed to see all the cards in the playbook before the match starts, except for trick plays.  \nHere is an example of a pass play (this is not the finalized design of the cards):\nA simple slant play.\nIn this case, the card shows you the zone certain players must reach for the play to execute correctly. The zones match those on the field of play. Players receive a bonus to their catch attempt if they receive the ball in the required zone. If they attempt to improvise and go elsewhere, there is a negative modifier to any catch rolls.  \nAfter the play has been executed. The coach must discard the play he called to a discard pile..The play on the 'audible' zone (if it was not a trick play) is placed in a separate discard pile. He then draws two cards from the playbook, to bring his total plays available back to three.\nFor further game play information, visit our You Tube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK82FGKNUzL7NKkF-8qSykA\nFantasy Football Option\nFor those of you who wish to purchase the figures for use in other fanatsy football games, this is your option. This pledge gives you 16 figures, two FQF dice and one each of our four \"Hour Glass\" status counters. It does not give player cards or rules for FQF.\nFantasy Football Option not the full game.\nNo Zone, Wild Animal, Prone and Ball\nShipping\nShipping will be charged after the project finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system.

Create your own modular board from the selection of double-sided tiles, producing a new battlefield with every game. Play as one of the factions and drive your convoy out into the Wastes in search of fortune and glory.\nOccupy salvage tokens and successfully survive the next player's turn to score points and collect salvage. Played over 4-6 rounds, the player who collects the most salvage tokens by the end wins!\nThe game is very quick to set up and tear down, meaning you can spend all your time gaming - that is what you're here for, right? With player guides and a quick setup guide, the game can be played right out the box. The rules are relatively simple, but with enough depth to reveal many different strategies to win - you'll be ramming and wrecking your way across the wasteland in no time! The unique damage-recording flame pegs ensure that you always know your tactical situation, as well as the other players - no more peering over the table to look at tableaus or damage tracks. Fast, frantic, highly cinematic vehicle violence for those who want a skirmish game without the time, cost, and space required! \nHere's the game set up for when I attended UKGE this year, where the game was very well received! I demo'd around the UK this year, and will be doing so again in 2018.\n  The world we know has long since disappeared, reduced to ash and dust. Mankind has dwindled into near-extinction: our cities and our achievements buried beneath the sands of time. The face of our planet has been forever changed -  the barren, inhospitable environment that remains is known as the Wastes.\n4 factions have emerged to claim our lost technology, buried within the crumbling ruins of now ancient derelict buildings: discovered salvage can be traded, used, even weaponised. They roam the wasteland in heavily armed and armoured convoys seeking out these salvage sites to continue their existence, but inevitably there are disputes...\nCan you collect more salvage than your opponents? Will you leave a trail of destruction in your wake, or be left as a burning wreck out in the Wastes? Only one way to find out, so let's buckle up and get ready to Wreck and Ruin...\n Choosing a faction gives you access to their unique faction abilities, but which suits your play style?\nThe Salvoes, which is short for salvagers, are people who eke out an existence from the barren wasteland. A tough existence has taught them how to survive the harshest conditions and outlast their enemies. Their abilities help them to stay in the fight longer and gather more resources to outplay their enemies.\nReapers live only to sow death and destruction. They are violent and aggressive, and follow only the most powerful warriors. Their vehicles are adorned with the trophies of the their previous kills, a testament to their fighting prowess. Their abilities favour aggressive players, from hijacking vehicles to striking fear into the enemy ranks.\nChoosing to lead a simpler existence following mankind's fall from grace, the Desertkin thrive in the wasteland. They have formed a symbiotic bond with some of its inhabitants, hulking creatures which have evolved to survive their habitat. Their abilities allow them to use the wasteland and its creatures against the enemy.\nRuin is the only city that is known to exist - the army is tasked with protecting its inhabitants from threats and collecting valuable supplies to keep its people fed and its technology working. Ruin was built around an old military installation so they have access to the most advanced technology to perform their duties. Their abilities use advanced training and tech they can call upon to aid their cause.\nMore reviews to come, but for now here is a little taster. You can read any of the reviews in full on their websites, or on the Wreck and Ruin BGG page.\n         These miniatures are made of plastic and are designed at 15mm scale to fit within the 30mm hexes - scouts are the smallest at 26mm, leading up to the hulking big rig at over 60mm long! \nVehicles have a number of stats which show how far they can move, how many dice they roll when attacking, and how difficult they are to damage. Which vehicle will you use to execute your plan?\n  Each vehicle has its owns strengths and special skills, but with only limited resources, not every vehicle can be used every turn. Will you use your agile scouts to speed across the wasteland seizing objectives? Or will you move up your big rig to soak up enemy fire and dispense wasteland justice to those who dare come in range? Each turn you will have to decide how to split your precious actions between occupying empty sites and wrecking your enemies to prevent them from scoring.\nI've tried to keep my funding goal low by having only one style of minis shown above in different colours for each faction, but here's what I hope to unlock with enough funding to give each faction its own identity! They'll replace the minis in the box - how much cooler would it look with all these rampaging through the Wastes? Faction stretch goals will be revealed if we can get enough backers. Here's the alternate faction sculpts I hope to unlock:\n     Each of the alternate sculpts contains the same number of vehicles - 2 scouts, a buggy, a wrecker, and a big rig. Do you have a favourite already?\n  Create a map using the board tiles, with a setup area for each player. 4 salvage site tokens are placed on the central tile. Each player selects a faction, sets their vehicles up within their setup area, and draws one of their 4 faction powers at random.\nPlayed over 4-6 rounds dependant on time and number of players, the object of the game is to clear out more salvage sites than your opponents.\nPlayers have 5 action points per turn which they can use to activate their vehicles: move a vehicle onto a site to occupy it. Attack enemies at range. Ramming a vehicle can cause major damage - the bigger the size difference the more damage is inflicted! Ramming also has the advantage of being able to push enemies back, meaning you can push an enemy off a site and occupy it yourself at the same time!\nOccupied tokens are flipped to their green side at the start of the next player's turn, and if it remains green at the end of the turn it is removed and awarded to the occupying player, which counts as a victory point. New tokens are then placed elsewhere on the map so there are always 4 to play for.\nDamage is recorded by inserting an orange peg into the target. It will run as normal until the last peg is inserted - a black peg which shows it is wrecked! It will then crash and burn: it loses control and the flaming wreck can crash into other vehicles causing a chain reaction of destruction!\nAn event is drawn at the beginning of each round - it will affect each player in turn and poses different challenges: drawing slippery surface means opponents can turn vehicles to face another direction, or having engine trouble makes it difficult for a target vehicle to complete actions.\nSPOILER ALERT! The event deck\n  Salvage cards are gained by collecting salvage sites - these cards are all unique and allow you to bend or break a rule in the game. Did I mention they were free to use? Play to boost your own vehicles, or on an opponent's turn to mess their plans up.\nThe salvage deck\nYour faction card is the most powerful card you will have - it can only be used once so you must decide the right time! The Ruin Army can summon an unmanned drone to fight for them whereas the Reapers can try and hijack an enemy vehicle - having the right card at the right time can turn the tide of battle in your favour.\nFaction cards - one off powerful attacks and buffs!\n If You'd like to learn more about how the game plays, look at the rulebook here. \nI'm using Gamesquest with their proven excellent track record to handle fulfilment, meaning I can offer EU and US/Canadian friendly shipping to you lovely people! Shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended and may change but are likely to be:\nUK \u00a37\nEU \u00a314\nUS/CANADA \u00a315\nREST OF THE WORLD \u00a320\nThe game is quite heavy hence the price, however backing now including shipping will still be cheaper than buying it post-campaign. Now is your chance to get a bargain! You will receive the game before anyone else - you guys are my number 1 priority before it becomes more readily available.\nI have different sculpts for each of the faction's vehicles but I need your help to fund them - let's work together to improve the components and expand the wasteland world for even more replayability.  As you've seen above there are some tasty minis hiding in there, so let's get revealing!\n     Don't worry, there's plenty more lined up should we successfully go beyond funding! \nI'm a big believer in the platform, giving little people with big ideas the chance to make something that they love, for the people they love doing it with! It gives me the chance to share something with you that would never exist otherwise. I love being a part of the community, and this game is about community - I want to build something that we all can enjoy and expand upon. 2 years in the making: of playtesting, attending conventions, building up a following, interacting with all you lovely people that make this hobby so great. I plan to continue supporting this game by creating new scenarios, map layouts, new board tiles, but I also can't wait to see what you come up with too! The wasteland no longer just belongs to me - you are now a wasteland warrior.\nAs a superbacker, we all get annoyed at the same things we see happening on campaigns - this game will not be sold anywhere else until my backers have games in their eager hands!\nEnough chit chat - let's load up, move out and show our enemies what it means to cross us!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first project as a creator, although I have backed quite a few so I know how it works.
