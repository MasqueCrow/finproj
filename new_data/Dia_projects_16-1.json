(underdog) a competitor thought to have little chance of winning a fight or contest\n2. one born under the sign of the dog (Canis Major - Sirius) embodying loyalty, speed, the hunt, and watchfulness\nFrom Ishii-san:\n\u201cIf your parents, family, or classmates are taken hostage and if you die, your family will die too. If you fail, your family will die. If you run away, your family will die. In such a situation where you are driven into a corner [...] and must kill [your] fellow compatriots.\u201d What would you do? How would you live out your life? Your death? \u201c[...] if you have only the choice of dying, how will you die, how can that death help the world that you have left behind?\u201d This is what it is to be \u201cUnder the Dog.\u201d\nOur enemy is the light of Humanity\nThe year is 2025 in the city of Tokyo Bayside Special District, five years following the devastation wrought by a specially enhanced groups of terrorists at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Out of the ashes of that desolation, the UN formed a special covert branch headquartered in Tokyo Bay solely purposed with searching out and eliminating the forces responsible for the attack along with anyone even bearing a remote resemblance to them.\nAs a cover, the International School for Boys and Girls was established for the ongoing covert operation of discovering and recruiting gifted high school students, each with their own special abilities, and to coerce them in the service of an elite death squad. These troops are tasked with ferreting out and exterminating all individuals with powers like their own.\nThere is no choosing sides for these recruits and failure is not an option. Failure on the field assures not only their own, but also their loved ones' deaths. In order to assure compliance, each agent\u2019s dearest loved ones have been secretly outfitted with a micro cranial bomb and all agent's actions and speech are closely monitored and recorded through a battle chip embedded in their brain. In the event the UN commanding officer determines an agent falls out of protocol, their loved ones immediately suffer the consequences. \nAnthea Kallenberg - Number 03 - Special Operations\nAnthea, a Swedish girl, is the team's infiltrator and assassin who was personally raised by Colonel Amagata. She prides herself in her abilities in combat and for good reason. Because of her skill, Anthea is often given point on special operations, usually to get the other agents out of a jam.\nSayuri Hyuga - Number 08 - Espionage\nSayuri is a Japanese girl from Sapporo who was forced into service during middle school. As a young, intelligent girl, the art of espionage is her specialty. She is frequently paired together with Estella for missions to lure out otherwise hard to acquire targets.\nEstella - Number 02 - Sniper\nEstella is the veteran of the team having been recruited at age eight. She is a Spanish American girl skilled in long range combat, especially the sniper rifle. On missions, she is often paired with Sayuri. Although typically sarcastic, she can surprise with her warm hearted whims.\nHana Tougetsu - Number 06 - Op Support\nHana is the main character of Episode 1. Although not remarkably skilled in combat, her stereotypical Japanese high schooler exterior belies her unique gift to shift people's' moods and mental states. Using her talent, she often gives much needed stability and catharsis to the team, helping shield them from their tremendous burdens. An all around nice girl with strong family ties, she lives with her family and brother.\nColonel (Junichi) Amagata - UN Commander\nAmagata came to command the covert branch of the UN shortly after his discovery and subsequent rescue of Anthea from a human trafficking cell during a top secret mission in Scandinavia. A now former NATO soldier, Amagata poses as staff for the international school while he dictates and supervises the various missions and objectives for the team.\nTrike Design\nPLAY\n\nOne of the fun toys at Anthea's disposal is the trike which was designed by a motorcycle industry design specialist, EM, in coordination with Kozaki-san. Here are some notes from Kozaki-san regarding the different elements.\nElectric\nThe trike is all electric which allows users to approach stealthily. Plus, it\u2019s eco-friendly! It also integrates with Anthea\u2019s power suit for heads-up-display and to share charge back and forth.\nHUD\nThe on-board HUD integrates seamlessly with Anthea\u2019s power suit and helmet HUD to provide navigational data, weapons and targeting data for the trike, as well as providing a dashboard for the trike\u2019s vital stats. Modes\nThe trike has three modes which it can shift back and forth between on the fly.\nSpeed\nThis is the standard configuration for the trike and it is built for speed with a slim design.\nArmor\nFor when Anthea is taking fire from oncoming assailants, the armor plates spread out to provide cover for the pilot. During this mode the handles also shift down and hug the body of the trike. \nOffense\nThis last design offers stability and mobility to Anthea when she wants to avoid taking fire and needing to return some of her own.\nThe dual wheels in the front of the trike allow for the pilot to engage the foot controls for steering, acceleration, and deceleration.\nThe trike also integrates with Anthea\u2019s power suit in this mode to provide stabilization for firing hand weapons.\n(will update as we meet stretch goals)\n\u25cf A professionally executed 24 minute anime episode full of awesome\n\u25cf Top notch Japanese Voice-Over\n\u25cf English subtitles\n\u25cf Behind the scenes development diaries and interviews\n\u25cf An original soundtrack\nWe hope to have everything (rewards included) done and delivered by Late-2015.\nProducing a standout soundtrack and stellar sound design usually breaks the bank and makes the budgeters cry but we are getting a steal with our audio legends:\nWe chose Kickstarter for a number of reasons:\n1. The team and plan we have assembled together provide a unique vision and a quality of animation we, and you, can be proud of. We want to blow you away and it is increasingly difficult to attain that level of excellence with traditional partnerships, especially for a brand new IP.\n2. This will allow us to retain creative independence, creative rights, and thereby the confidence our vision is being represented as it should be and you will reap the benefits.\n3. If this project is successfully funded it will possibly pave the way for us to pursue other projects to further the \u201cUnder the Dog\u201d universe and even to work on additional series!\n4.

In such circumstances right now, a writer with remarkable talent, Jiro Ishii, who brought to the world numerous renowned adventure games during his \u201csalary man\u201d days, has now taken up the torch in order to challenge the traditions and establish this new future of \u201ccreating.\u201d This is \u201cUnder the Dog,\u201d the crowdfunding effort for an indie anime based on Jiro Ishii\u2019s original story.\nOne cannot help but pay close attention to this project. One cannot help but cheer on this project. In particular, how can this creator who garners cult-like popularity catalyze a new chemical reaction [in the industry] by putting an emphasis on \u201ccreating,\u201d which stands apart from the typical commercial oriented projects? One cannot help but look forward to this succeeding.\nJiro Ishii\u2019s indie challenge will not only change the path for \u201ccreating,\u201d but at the same time declare the answer for the question: Can game designers be accepted by the world as storytellers in [other mediums] as well?\u201d\nWe are working with top talent to create, produce, and fully realize this AAA project. We have the experience and the know-how and now we just need the support! =D\nThe next ranking challenge is producing the rewards and getting them shipped out to all y'all. We will be coordinating with our 3rd parties to ensure both quality of production and timely shipments.\nAll that said, unforeseen issues can occur and while we will provide updates on our various productions as they get underway, the hope is for the grace and patience of our backers that should accompany any artistic endeavor. Thank you!\n1.We are professionals with the resumes to back up our claims. We have each put out quality works that have been well reviewed by critics and fans alike.\n2.This cost will not go up! Because of our experience and knowledge of the industry, our goal is the honest amount of what this project will require. We have been doing this for a while and we know what we can do with a given amount of funding for an anime production!\n3. We will create a level of quality and something unique not often seen in the anime world which is simply not attainable through traditional funding and support.\n4.Costs include hiring Kinema Citrus for the animation, Japanese voice actors, English subtitles, fees, backer rewards(!), shipping, hosting, and our general operational expenses.\nNow, while percentages are good, perhaps what is not as apparent are the actual costs of things given the $580,000 budget we are going for with this KS. \n$580,000 - Total - Broken down as follows: \n-------------------------------------------------------------- \n$232,000 - 40% - Animation Production - This is the budget for the actual design, direction, and animation of said 24 mins. Note the project will actually cost closer to $350,000.\n$174,000 - 30% - Backer Rewards - Budget for reward production, warehousing, shipping, etc. \n$87,000 - 15% - Pre-Production - Money we would like to recoup from investing our own funds in the trailer (of which we have actually spent in excess of $100,000) \n$29,000 - 5% - Operational Costs - Budget for operational costs such as daily staff, web hosting, paying bills, etc. \n$29,000 - 5% - KS fees - KS levies fees for all KS campaigns. They need to make their money too \n$29,000 - 5% - Amazon Credit Card fees - The fees from Amazon Payments \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nIn closing, we will say it again and again...  We want to be able to work on something that sparks our passion and have the end result be something we and you can be proud of. We are coming to Kickstarter because we believe in the benefits it can offer over our traditional avenues of funding and it gives our fans the unique opportunity to be involved and take part of something special.\nIn Japan, it is very difficult to obtain independent funding since the anime industry heavily relies on what is known as \"seisaku iinkai\" or \"production committees.\" This committee requires buy-in from multiple major corporations that combine their efforts to help carry the load of the production costs and thereby minimize the financial risk for each individual company. One company could take on animation, another music, another advertising, another distribution, and so on. It can also drive down the costs of production due to companies willing to take an initial loss with the hopes of turning a profit over the course of several years as the anime and any licensing deals run their course (music, toys, manga, etc.).\nThese committees are usually composed of people with an investor's mindset who look to profit first and then to creative awesomeness, if at all. This can often lead to projects stalled or mired in bureaucracy, indecision, and conflicts of interest. Production committees also generally require intellectual property buyouts in which the creatives involved essentially sacrifice all rights to their work just so they can see their dreams come to fruition in any form at all. Kickstarter will allow our artists to retain their rights and control as well as maintain their passion and investment for the lifetime of the series and any spin-offs. We also have less \"cooks in the kitchen,\" so to speak, so that creative direction will be decisive. No marketing or advertising based creative decisions or delays here!\nAdditional info:\nThis article at Anime News Network from 2012 has some great info on what it takes to make an anime as of 2012: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-05\nThis Crunchy Roll article from 2010 also has some great information on the whole process: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/10/30-1/how-much-does-one-episode-of-anime-cost-to-make\nAll trademarks referenced herein are the properties of their respective owners.\n\u00a92014 Creative Intelligence Arts, Inc.\n\u00a92014 Jiro Ishii\n\u00a92014 Yusuke Kozaki\n\u00a92014 Hiroaki Yura\nAll rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSee above.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #113", "update_userinfo": "The new project for Under The Dog adaptation has been launched!", "update_content": "[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u5f8c\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002Japanese text follows after English.]\n\n\nDear backers!\nAs we've announced, new projects for UNDER THE DOG has been launched today.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1356660673/under-the-dog-the-movie-live-action-short-and-musi/description\n\nPlease check it out, and we hope for your continuous support for our new project as well.\nLet's make the UNDER THE DOG project even bigger!\n\n\n\n\u30d0\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u7686\u69d8 \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\uff01\n\n\u5148\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3001  \n\u300cUNDER THE DOG\u300d\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u9042\u306b\u59cb\u307e\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\n\n\n\n\u662f\u975e\u304a\u76ee\u901a\u3057\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3044\u3066\u3001\u5909\u308f\u3089\u306c\u3054\u652f\u63f4\u3092\u3054\u5354\u529b\u306e\u307b\u3069\u3001 \u304a\u9858\u3044\u81f4\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff01\n\u307f\u3093\u306a\u3067UNDER THE DOG\u3092\u76db\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #112", "update_userinfo": "The Next Under the Dog Project - Update #4", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #111", "update_userinfo": "The Next Under the Dog Project - Update #3", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "The Next Under the Dog Project #2", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #109", "update_userinfo": "The Next Under the Dog Project", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #108", "update_userinfo": "End of Support", "update_content": "[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u5f8c\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002Japanese text follows after English.]\nDear All,\nPlease be informed that the support for Under the Dog rewards shipment and figurine refunds will come to an end on June 30.

But while the art world has evolved dramatically, these classic references have remained unchanged. We believe it's time for a refresh.\nMaster of Anatomy: The Ideal Male and Female, is a one-of-a-kind collection of artistic anatomy bringing together the work over 100 artists from different industries. Each artist recreates the Ideal Male and Female illustrated in their own signature style and without the aid of external reference. Each angle is neutral, symmetrical and un-posed showing the front, side and 3/4 front angles as a classic animation turn-around. The goal: to translate a decades-old sketch into something more relevant to a modern aesthetic. The result is a volume unlike anything that exists today. A must have for any aspiring artist; digital or traditional.\n*NOTE: The 3 angles presented will be Front, Side and 3/4 front. Each Artist will draw the figures in their own signature style to best of their ability in a completely finished, detailed Black & White render. The above picture depicts the poses only - it will not influence the style or look of the final concept.\nThe Problem with Anatomy Books\nThe biggest problem with most artistic anatomy books is that there is only one contributing artist. He or she is trying to appeal to the broadest market possible which makes \"popular\" or \"experimental\" anatomy too financially risky to publish. This diminishes the concept of inventive design and it makes it impossible to compare the work of various artists. In the end your left with a heavy volume where only a handful of pages are of any real use. That's why we hired 100 artists to produce over 200 unique characters in the 3 most helpful angles - there is something new and beautiful ON EACH PAGE!!!\nThe Artists\nOver 100 popular Animators, Illustrators, Comic-Book artists and Video-Game Designers!!! We solicited work from artists all over the world even children's books. Each artist was carefully chosen for their style, appeal and underlying knowledge of anatomy. Together they have produced over 200 unique male and female anatomies with over 600 angles all beautifully drawn for you to examine and explore.\nJoe Mad\nFrancisco Herrera\nWarren Louw\nDave Malan\nJ.

There we met a young concept artist named Edouard Guitton who was working as a lead designer for the famous Rackham Studios. It's was his designs that made Rackham miniatures an international sensation. Watching him sketch in the studio below was like magic! He explained to us why the sculpts based on his drawings were so appealing. \"sculpting and drawing is the same - it's all about the silhouette. Details and realism are secondary, they only get in the way; the silhouette is what really matters.\" It was a revelation!\nThose words floated around in our minds for the next few years until we began working on a video tutorial about anatomy (yet to be released). We wanted to provide our sculptors with an in-depth level of instruction but we felt the video by itself was too much of an instructional tool; too rigid. We needed something to stoke the creative fires, something that could embody Edouard's ideas about the silhouette. Thus, was Masters of Anatomy born.\nLoish\nMattias Adolfsson\ntwei\nBezerroBizarro\nLuigiL\nCharlie Bowater\nRobert Porter (Robaato)\nJoe Olson\nWhy Commission New Work?\nIt became evident in the early stages of research that well-drawn examples of neutral anatomy turnarounds like Loomis's were rare and difficult to find. What we did manage to scrape together was of generally poor quality. What we became aware of instead, browsing hundreds of art blogs, was the huge number of brilliant artists out there. But even among their work there were few examples of neutral anatomy turnarounds. We then understood why so many amateur sculptors and 3D artists were having a difficult time making unique figures - a lack of well-drawn reference art.\nWho is This Book For?\nThis book is for any artist interested in human anatomy and proportions. By examining the subtle differences between similar drawings you will strengthen your knowledge of the human anatomy and begin to recognize which areas contain the majority of changes. We believe that a single reference is limiting and counter-intuitive to creative minds. It makes the learning curve rigid and inflexible. We believe multiple references are needed to examine the true definition of an \"ideal\". And since the drawings appear in the same place on each page it makes side-by-side comparison much easier and more fun. The end goal is to help artists develop their own unique style and voice.\nDan Seddon\nLuis Gadea\nAnna Cattish\ntincan21 (Jae Hong Kim)\nEndling\nRene Cordova\nPatricio Betteo\nFlorian Satzinger\nChhuying\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBecause hiring over 100 well-known artists costs money: A LOT OF MONEY! But we think our book has a place in this world as a source of inspiration. If we can make it easier for artists to achieve their goals then it's cause worth doing. That's why we need Kickstarter - it's one of the only places where you, the customer, can help bring out-of-the-box ideas to life.\nWhy Help Us?\nIf you're reading this far down into the page, chances are you're intrigued by our project, which is good. So here's the bottom line - We need you. Plain and simple. If we fail to raise our funding goal we lose the enormous investment we have sunk into this project. So, if you like what you see and you have faith we can deliver then pledge away. Or help us by spreading the word, telling your artist friends/husbands/colleagues, Facebook liking us or giving us a shout-out on national TV. You'll give us a tremendous shot of confidence at this critical point and hopefully fund a whole wave of similar books from us down the road.\nWho Are We?\nMasters of Anatomy is a brand-new publishing company devoted to producing extraordinary, one-of-a-kind anatomy books to help artists discover their own unique style.

After all, we\u2019ve got a brave, stubborn, if somewhat forgetful angel on our side, reminding us of what we truly stand for!\nProject Phoenix is a fantasy themed squad-based real-time strategy game combined with Japanese RPG design influences.  The game draws you in with its breathtaking fantasy world, deep storyline, Japanese character designs, and a memorable cast, most notably, the band of heroes under your command.  Furthermore, its intuitive real-time tactical combat is dynamic, fluid, and streamlined, allowing you to experience the strategic options without being bogged down by overwhelming archaic battle systems.\nThroughout the adventure, players will piece together the mysteries of an angel with amnesia and travel through the land of Azuregard with an unusual band of heroes searching for answers.\nCity of Cordo by Koya Takahashi\nProject Phoenix is being produced by some of the greatest creative talents in the video game industry, with credits including several Final Fantasies, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Valkyria Chronicles, L.A. Noire, Diablo III, Halo 4, Crysis 3, and much more.  Many of us have boldly committed ourselves to this ambitious project in a creative leap of faith  with the goal of changing the direction of the Japanese game industry. Now we need the extra push that only funding can give to help us move forward and complete the game!\nThe team includes such talents as:\nMore staff members will be announced as the development process continues!\nThe world is changing...\nThe orcish clans, mankind's ancient enemy, have begun migrating from the mountains and their raids upon human settlements become more brazen and audacious by the day.  If this wasn't enough, the denizens of the southern coastal regions hear rumor of the free men who, once vanquished, have emerged, more organized than before, all with the goal of toppling the Empire. Amidst the stirrings of war, the elves watch a fateful star and recognize it as a portent that will decide the fate of all those who live in Azuregard.\nIt is within these tumultumous times that the troubled Templar Marcus Stern encounters Ruffles, an angel stricken with amnesia. Together with the Elven Pathfinder, Sylrianah, reserved but curious to see the world beyond the forest, and Zarum the Lost, a battlemage with his own internal conflicts, they form an unlikely bond. These four heroes must discover their place in a world brought to war by misunderstanding and ignorance, and perhaps ultimately even save it from itself.\nThe worldmap of Azuregard. Created by Rebecca Catt and illustrated by Koya Takahashi\nPlease note that there are more than SIX playable characters. There will be more announcements in future updates!\nMarcus Stern\nBorn to King Magnus Stern and the Second Prince of the Kingdom of Izaria, Marcus\u2019 early life was marred by a great tragedy that has shaped his short-tempered personality and his outlook towards those of other races, especially Orcs. The tragedy was what drove Marcus to eventually join the feared unit known as the Death Templars. Through their training and Marcus\u2019 single-minded dedication to become stronger, Marcus has become a weapons master and adept in swordplay, especially with the longsword and shortsword. Unfortunately, his decision to join the Death Templars has driven a wedge between him and his family and even now, their relationship is respectful, but distant.\nPrince Marcus Stern, Knight-Templar of Izaria\nRuffles\nAn amnesiac angel, Ruffles seeks to find out who she is and her place within the larger world. She\u2019s a being of pure heart who tries to help everyone she can, even if it inconveniences her or puts her in danger. She also tries to see the good in people, doing her best to guide troubled souls out of the shroud and back on the path of goodness.\nRuffles, a lost angel in search of her own destiny\nSylrianah Tyrnearaheal\nSylrianah, the Elven Princess, has always been driven by the desire to see the world beyond the forest\u2019s borders, but only now, taking the first steps to venture outside the sanctity of the elven lands. She shares many of her people\u2019s traits: she\u2019s calm, cool, and collected, with a great reverence for life, but can also seem just a bit aloof. Like many of her people, she\u2019s stealthy, especially in forest environs and she can wield a shortbow to devastating effect, as her keen elven sights and marksmanship training make her a fine scout.\nPrincess Sylrianah, Pathfinder of Vervanna\nZarum\nIt\u2019s not difficult to feel just a bit uneasy around Zarum.The battlemage has long had a reputation for being dangerous, with a hairpin trigger that, more often than not, leaves only destruction in his wake. This reputation allows Zarum to journey across Azuregard unimpeded, though the motives that drive him on are inscrutable to most. Those who come across Zarum\u2019s path are advised to tread lightly lest they find their lifespan being shortened unexpectedly\u2026\nZarum, The Lost\nGorek Greyhelm\nGorek is a dwarf with a jovial personality whose thirst for the beer cups is only rivaled by his thirst for combat, both of which has made him a favorite of the Dwarven King who finds his skills with his Stormhammer to be reliable and his seemingly endless banter to be even more pleasing. Despite this seemingly happy-go-lucky attitude towards most things, if there\u2019s one thing those around Gorek should be aware of, it\u2019s his enormous pride which can bring him to be angry at the smallest perceived slight, especially when drunk.\nGorek Greyhelm, Captain of the Royal Guards of Stormhammer\nSatsuki Kagamizu\nSatsuki has fully embraced her training as a samurai and carries an earnest demeanor when it comes to most things. In fact, it\u2019s often said that she\u2019s so serious that she seems to be unable to immediately grasp the humor in many situations. She is very kind, thoughtful and introspective, though any enemies would be wise not to underestimate her as she\u2019s capable of cutting her opponents with a single stroke from her finely honed sword skills.\nSatsuki Kagamizu, Samurai of Akitsu\nProject Phoenix is a sprawling adventure in which you explore a vast, rich land and do battle against formidable enemies. The gameplay eschews micromanagement in favour of a focused Real Time Strategy system enhanced by JRPG elements. You can level your characters and teach them new abilities but at the same time they behave intelligently when you are not controlling them directly.\nThe game has three distinct modes: Exploration, Combat and Character Advancement.\nA rough in-game version's 3D model reference of Marcus Stern by GONTARO\nExploration is where you travel the many realms of Azuregard. As well as progressing the story, you will discover different races, acquire better equipment and meet new characters. Each time you arrive somewhere new, you\u2019ll be able to outfit yourself with the local equipment and experience some of their culture. There will be no grinding through enemies to be able to advance to the next area. You will be able to advance at your own pace, and either push on with the story or take your time as you see fit.\nEach town or city you find yourself in will be populated by an interesting cast of characters, with their own stories to tell. There\u2019ll be good reason to stick around some places, or to do a bit of extra exploration.\nCombat takes place in predefined areas, tailored to match the locale. There will be two main types of combat: Story battles and Random battles. Story battles will be carefully-tuned scenarios integral to the story\u2019s progression. Random battles will be dynamic combat scenarios activated occasionally during the story, but generally when exploring areas without any new story content (such as when backtracking). They will be available whenever you want, without being a burden to play.\nCombat uses a point and click system to control your party of heroes. Each hero has abilities they can use in battle, and the use of these abilities depletes either their mana (magic reserves) or their stamina. Tactical play and the combination of different heroes will be the main factors in your success, as well as taking advantage of the following conditions:\nTerrain: Terrain comes in different heights, so you can use the lay of the land to your advantage. There are also destructible elements to damage or slow down your foes. Some units also get a movement advantage in different terrain to allow for more strategy.\nFog of War: Apart from special scenario objectives, the combat map will be hidden until explored. This helps keep things exciting and suspenseful and also gives you plenty of opportunity to use the scouting abilities of particular heroes.\nThreat Management: Generally enemies will target those they consider the greatest threat, or a specific target when the story dictates. However there are character abilities to redirect their attention to another character. Not only does this lend itself to structured defensive play \u2013 knowing who the enemy will target will allow you to set up some cunning traps! Of course, no JRPG is complete without memorable, awe-inspiring bosses, and we have plenty of those as well. These challenging scenarios will have you focusing your entire party on an epic enemy, using your skill to win the day.  \nIn game battle concept of Project Phoenix\nCharacter Advancement is an important piece, and comes from the game\u2019s JRPG heritage. Each hero you control will be a distinct class, with their own look, abilities, and usable equipment. Of course there will be overlaps in equipment, but there won\u2019t be too many dilemmas when it comes to selecting who gets a new item. As characters increase in experience, they automatically get improved stats, as well as new abilities. For further customisation we have a simple talent system in place, so that you can choose the path you want your characters to take. If you want to have more control over your team, we are also including customable heroes that can be recruited as you progress through the game. That way, if you love a character class but want to put your own spin on it, you can.  \nRough concept sketches of characters & classes from Project Phoenix by GONTARO\nThe art brings the game to life, especially through the cinematic and story sequences, which will feature characters that match human proportions.\nIn-game battle sequences will make use of super-deformed characters with movement and actions designed, in a way that should feel instantly familiar to many JRPG fans.\nEarly battle concept by Koya Takahashi\nAzuregard is an ancient world with a storied history, and it is essential that we convey the richness of that world's lore through diverse music which is not only authentic but also guides JRPG fans through its intricacies.\nOur team of composers, including legendary Final Fantasy maestro Nobuo Uematsu and industry veterans Tomoki Miyoshi and Kevin Penkin, are more than up to this task, as illustrated by the brief samples below:\nHigher funding through a stretch goal would allow us to raise the quality of the soundtrack to another dimension with the Eminence Symphony Orchestra. As well as performing live, this accomplished orchestra has recorded the music for such games as SoulCalibur V and Valkyria Chronicles, as well as the hit anime series Steins;Gate.\nHere's a message from our Lead Composer, Nobuo Uematsu.\nOur vision for Project Phoenix to revive the concept of the JRPG is quite lofty, and each one of us is well-known in our respective field of work. We\u2019re putting our reputations (and honor!) on the line, and no matter whether we\u2019re artists, game designers, musicians, programmers, or scenario writers, we\u2019re committed to see this all the way to the end as we donate our blood and sweat to make a JRPG that aligns with our passionate vision and present it to the world, and not just Japan. We would love to hear what you all think!\nWe\u2019re at the pre-production stage at the moment and have already mapped out the storyline and the struggles that Ruffles and her newfound companions must endure. The game design is laid out and we\u2019re working on the initial setup of the game mechanics like the combat system so that battles are as intense and engaging as possible and like the character creation process. We\u2019re also using Unity as that provides a simple and easy platform to create and port a game to different devices. Finally, our art team is furiously working on the landscapes and character art that bring the world of Azuregard to life while our composers, including Nobuo Uematsu, complement the artists\u2019 efforts by using the power of music to immerse you into the setting.\nThe missing piece of the puzzle that will make Project Phoenix awesome is one that requires outside help: the 3D modeling. In our pursuit of making Project Phoenix dynamic and immersive, we\u2019ll be relying upon Steffen Unger and his team of 3D modelers, whose works include game franchises as Crysis and Halo. So all funds raised through Kickstarter will go towards making the 3D models and making sure they\u2019re as polished as possible.\nSo we\u2019re taking no shortcuts in our quest to make Project Phoenix a reality and our team is aligned in our goal of what we want this game to become: the seamless integration of Japanese design and Western functionality to yield high fantasy, but with a Japanese twist! We\u2019re aiming for the stars on this one, but only because that\u2019s what you JRPG fans deserve.\nProject Phoenix brings together a group of world-class professionals with a unified vision of how JRPGs ought to be and are determined to bring that vision to life without major studio backing! Each member of our team has taken a creative leap of faith in joining the project. Many of them have taken time out of their personal schedule to contribute their expertise towards Project Phoenix's success.  So while everyone has donated a lot of their time, there\u2019s only so much more we can do for free. Getting the necessary funds to create the 3D character models would be a major step towards achieving our lofty goals.\nAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve turned to Kickstarter and its wonderful community of independent game fans! We can\u2019t think of a better group of people to come to for support and make this project a reality. By hitting our Kickstarter goal, we can complete game production with 3D models that are worthy of our vision. Additional funds will give us the capability to include more 3D modeling in the game, hire studio time with an Academy Award\u00ae-winning audio engineer, and enhance the gameplay experience even further.\nWhile there are many worthy gaming projects on Kickstarter, we believe we\u2019re not just making one game \u2013 we\u2019re making a new way of producing games. To be truly revolutionary, we\u2019re breaking out of the normal studio format \u2013 calling in talent and fans from around the world to provide the spark that will mark a rebirth of the Japanese gaming industry!\n* All physical rewards are high quality, made and printed in Japan\n** They will be shipped in a special package from Japan.

Some of the challenges looming include:\n\n- Programming the game: Programming is, by far, the most important part of a video game. It's difficult to find someone with the programming skills necessary for this endeavour. Luckily, we have industry veterans on staff who are reliable, not only in the art of programming, but also in the art of project management. \n- Art production: There\u2019s more to art than just creating characters, buildings, and terrain, and then slapping them into the game. It takes time making concept art, 3D characters, animations, environments, or particle effects. Seeing how the players\u2019 perception of the world is fueled by the artwork, we want to make it look as good as possible. That means making sure the art is in the same uniform style and aligns with our vision for the project. Thankfully, our team of artists have extensive experience working for major studios, creating the art for many blockbuster titles. They\u2019re professional and outstanding; among the best of the best.\n- Building awareness: Creating a game without studio backing is no easy task since it means the marketing efforts fall upon our shoulders and that we don\u2019t have the marketing budgets that larger studios have. Needless to say, marketing is expensive and allocating funds for TV or online ads are unfeasible. To build our audience and generate sales, we need people like YOU! You, the fans who believe in our mission, who are willing to help us see this project to the end. Without you, Project Phoenix would not be possible. So spread the word far and wide!

(photo coming soon)\n All of the above plus a digital double of your own face!\nArmature Pair + Digital Illustration Class\nArmature Pair + 3D Printing Class\nMore pictures coming (Will be posting pictures for each reward)\nHey Kickstarter community! \nI reaaaalllly want to get this cool little figure I made into the hands of retailers, but they won't pay me any attention until I can prove I can manufacture them in large quantities and be able to do so quickly. So what do you think? Can a 3D printed product get into retail stores? \nI believe the answer is yes but first let me tell you about this cool product and then my plan to get there. You're probably familiar with those wooden unisex dolls in craft stores for artists, right?  You know, the ones with those funny looking ball joints? Well, haven't you wished they made them with the proper proportions and range of motion? Yes? Well so did I, and that's what I set off to do. \nAfter many months of design, 3D printing and iteration, and a thorough four month beta phase with over 800 armature shipped around the world. I've finally come up with a design that has been tested and proven and a production and shipping pipeline well established.\nThis figure, has been designed to simply and accurately portray the human anatomical proportion with a range of motion capable of posing it realistically. Unlike the wooden dolls that are currently out in the market, these, are way more accurate and are better suited to meet the needs of artists and, in fact, has already had positive impacts on my own art.\nThrough this kickstarter I'm releasing the new, 2013 version of the design and also a number of new products and enhancements such as quadrupeds, a 1-1 hand armature, various proportional and anatomical variations and more!\nSo why help me out? The thing is, I've been manufacturing these myself with 3D printers and as you can imagine, it's painfully slow. Right now I can produce about 10 of the large armatures a day, which does not including assembly or possible failure-rate (there's good days and bad days).  Consequently, there's little to no hope of getting it into retail storefronts, as they need to be assured they can order 100-200 on a moment's notice.\nGetting this product into retail stores is the only way this armatures will get the exposure it really needs in order to thrive and become the livelihood I need it to be in order to put food on the table.   If I make my goal, I can raise enough money to expand my equipment and include ten (10) 3D printers, With these I'd be able to produce 50 armatures a day! This kind of output will allow me to meet the initial needs of retail stores in addition to online orders.\nIn exchange for your support, I'm offering many of these armatures at a 25% discount (even over %50 if you get the $200 bundle) and even offering some armatures that will never be available through retail OR my website (such as the 5.5\" armature). Meeting this kickstarter goal will allow me to add the additional printers to my arsenal and pay for the materials and shipment of the rewards you pledge on. My time would be unpaid and would constitute my contribution to the campaign. I'll be handling all the printing, assembly, shipping and the package design for retailers.\nPlease support my grassroots attempt to manufacture this product. Even if you're not an artist, any of these rewards would make a great gift for any artist friends you have.\nSpecial Note:\nOnly those that contribute to this campaign will get their armatures in this limited edition color (pearl & crimson). If you prefer the default brown with dark trim, you can opt out of this choice by saying so in the comments (but you can't back out after you do). The pearl color, uses little to no pigmentation and so it is slightly translucent (similar to skin & marble, so it will provide you with more realistic shading when doing your value samples)\nTo learn more about how to use these armatures for illustration, watch the video listed at the top.\nCredits: \nMusic by Mariya Lincoln & DjembeDJ\nFilmed by Kevin Harris\nNote: I Photoshoped away the background because it had a nasty texture to it", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI launched a crowd-funding campaign to release a Beta version of this product late last year with over 800 armatures ordered: (http://www.indiegogo.com/armature9)\n\nI was very thorough and transparent with my fulfillment of orders by providing this public spreadsheet to all contributors so they could track my progress:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArJsKv5h1IsCdFJCN2QyUUh5N1lselJCWURwVjQxQ1E&usp=sharing\n\n\nAnd I learned a TON! I faced a number of unexpected issues and learned how to resolve them. As a consequence, I established a sustainable and efficient production and assembly pipeline. Am in the process of solidifying a relationship with a filament supplier. Found an excellent technician to help me with repair issues. Resolved a number of design problems based on feedback I got from customers. Registered with a bulk mailing service and learned how to assemble and package the armatures efficiently. I learned an incredible amount about manufacturing with 3D printers in general and how to get consistent repeatable and non-brittle results. \n\nIn short, I've really crossed my t's and dotted my i's so that I could launch this much larger campaign. So I see very little risk to you, the contributor. I'm sure, however, I will continue to learn new things, once, and if, you help me get my foot in the door of retailers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Important: Last Update for Armature Nine", "update_content": "Happy new year everyone!

Last year, I launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the publication of Cucumber Quest's first printed book. The project was a tremendous success, and with the aid of over 1,000 backers, I was able to print a very lovely book and work full-time on webcomic updates for six months.\n(Book One is available in the shop, but you can also receive it as part of certain reward tiers this time around!)\nOne year since the previous Kickstarter campaign, I've created nearly 200 new pages of Cucumber Quest, and the next chapter of my story is complete and ready to be printed.\nGiant squid monsters! Treacherous caverns! Mobster crabs! These are but a few of the perils awaiting our intrepid(ish) heroes as they set sail for the Ripple Kingdom. Picking up where the first volume left off, Book Two finds our unwilling \"legendary hero,\" Cucumber, separated from his companions after a pretty gnarly shipwreck. Luckily, the cheerful and wise(ish) Princess Nautilus is on his side, so rescuing the kingdom from evil should be a snap! ...Right?\nCucumber Quest's second book will be about 220 full-color pages, featuring \"Chapter 1: Disaster in Paradise\" and the following 42-page interlude, as well as bonus comics and other new material from the website. Just like last year, we're planning to print both a softcover and a hardcover version. \nSince this book is considerably longer than the first volume, it will cost a bit more to print. The printing and shipping costs for a project of this scale will be at least $12,000. Provided we meet our goal, the books will be printed in fall 2013.\nThanks so much for your support!\n____________________\nAbout Rewards:\nWhat's the print set? A collection of six postcard-sized (6\"x4\") prints, each featuring a character from the comic. Last year's print set is shown above.

Head to NeoLucida.com for purchasing options. Or follow us on Twitter and on Facebook for updates\n-----------------------------------------\nLong before Google Glass ... there was the Camera Lucida.\nThe what?\nThe camera lucida.\nIt\u2019s a prism on a stick! For making realistic drawings!\nIt used to be everywhere.\nA portable version hasn\u2019t been manufactured in generations.\nAnd we\u2019re bringing it back.\nReally inexpensively.\nFor artists and art students everywhere.\nWe have designed the NeoLucida: the first portable camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century \u2014 and the lowest-cost commercial camera lucida ever designed. We want to make this remarkable device widely available to students, artists, architects, and anyone who loves to draw from life. But to be clear: our NeoLucida is not just a product, but a provocation. In manufacturing a camera lucida for the 21st century, our aim is to stimulate interest in media archaeology\u2014the tightly interconnected history of visual culture and imaging technologies.\nOur project: the NeoLucida, a camera lucida for the 21st century. Shown here is a working prototype, constructed from a combination of mass-manufactured and custom-machined parts.\nWhat is this \"NeoLucida\"?\nThe NeoLucida is a drawing aid that allows you to trace what you see. Our device is the first portable, authentic camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century\u2014but we like to think of it as a disruption to widespread assumptions about art-making and art history. Our design is lightweight (9oz., or 0.25kg), sturdy, compact enough to fit in a handbag, highly adjustable, totally non-electronic, and released with a liberal open-source hardware license. It's also the least-expensive camera lucida ever manufactured. If you enjoy drawing from life, or if you're interested in experiencing for yourself how the Old Masters could possibly have created such accurate, lifelike drawings\u2014then the NeoLucida is for you. \nLeft: Our NeoLucida, $40. Right: An antique Camera Lucida (c.1900), about $350 on eBay. Owing to modern innovations such as adjustable gooseneck, the NeoLucida has a considerably simpler design.\nSome background history. \nBeginning in the early 17th century, artists routinely used optical aids to help them create realistic drawings. Lenses and mirrors were the \"cutting edge technology\" of their day (and sometimes, the trade secret) for making life-like images. In 1807, Sir William Hyde Wollaston invented the Camera Lucida\u2014and brought life-drawing to a whole new level. Wollaston's device was simple: a prism on an adjustable stand. When an artist looks down through the prism, they see the world in front of them, plus their hand on the page, combined in perfect superimposition. \nIn short, a camera lucida allows you to trace what you see. And it does so in full daylight; there's no need for a dark shroud or box, as with a Camera Obscura. And that is the magic of the camera lucida: it's portable, easy to use, and\u2014with a little practice\u2014you just copy the world onto your page with a confident hand. \nBy the mid-1800s, camera lucidas were everywhere. Indeed, the device is so effective in assisting accurate life-drawing that, according to the controversial Hockney-Falco hypothesis, it's now believed that many of the most admired drawings of the 19th Century, such as the Neoclassical portraits of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, could only have been made with a camera lucida. This becomes astonishingly clear if you try one\u2014an experience we hope to share with as many people as possible, through this Kickstarter.\n(If you'd like to learn more about how the Old Masters likely used optical technologies to create their work, check out David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge, or this terrific BBC documentary (at YouTube) about his research.)\nThe NeoLucida setup: clamp your NeoLucida to a table or drawing board. Place your subject in front, with your paper on the table below the prism. Simply look down into the prism to start drawing.\nPlace your eye close to the prism, looking straight down at the prism's exposed edge, to see a perfect blend of your hand and the scene in front of you.\nOur prototype in action. Here's an unaltered photograph taken through the NeoLucida's eyepiece. The world in front of you is superimposed onto your paper. Just trace what you see!\nNow try this experiment. Go to a group of fine-art students. Find the ones who claim to adore the \"Old Masters\"\u2014and ask them if they\u2019ve ever tried, or even heard of, a camera lucida. We'll bet they haven't (or that they've confused it with the camera obscura). Perhaps it's because a different \"camera\"\u2014the photographic film camera\u2014revolutionized image-making in the intervening century. Once photography became accessible to all, previously common drawing tools like the camera lucida were almost entirely forgotten\u2014and the Old Masters who used them were increasingly believed to have possessed supernatural drawing powers. \nIt hasn't helped that portable camera lucidas have become so rare and costly that most students will never have the chance to try one\u2014not even in an art school. Authentic camera lucidas have become curiosities and fetish objects for antiquarians and professionals, typically costing $300-$500 on eBay. But it's a marvellously simple, useful device\u2014it shouldn't be so exotic!\nSo, why are you doing this? We both have a lot of students who've come to believe that being able to draw photo-realistically is the most important thing. We both love realistic drawing, but not necessarily the way it\u2019s usually taught\u2014which often ignores the tightly-intertwined relationship between drawing and imaging technologies. In particular, art students are encouraged to draw photo-realistically, in the manner of the Old Masters, but without the proper tools for doing so. So we're producing the NeoLucida as a provocation, not as a business, to help get this discussion started. We hope the NeoLucida will prompt new questions about the relationship of art and technology\u2014and potentially even disrupt business-as-usual in the classroom. Most importantly, we genuinely believe that using a camera lucida will profoundly change how people see, how they draw, and how they think about art. \nPortraits by Pablo, created with an antique camera lucida (c.1900, left), and the NeoLucida (right).\nOur Plan.\nWait: aren't there modern, competing products?\nWe wouldn't be doing this if there were any modern-day camera lucidas that met our criteria for easy portability, low cost, and authentic optical design. Unfortunately, there aren't. For example, the LUCID-Art costs $200, weighs four times as much as the NeoLucida, and can't fit in a handbag. Likewise, the LUCI costs more than twice as much as ours; it's bulky, and difficult to adjust. And because the LUCI uses a mirror instead of a prism, you have to draw everything upside-down! (With ours, you draw right-side-up.) Amazingly, these are the only camera lucidas currently being manufactured today\u2014and neither uses the elegant and compact optical design employed throughout the 19th century.\nDesign and Production.\nWe know that for a young artist to even consider experimenting with a camera lucida, it has to be inexpensive. So we\u2019ve designed the NeoLucida to consist almost entirely of prefabricated parts made in China (such as the clamp, prism, and flexible gooseneck mount), and available through business-to-business marketplaces like Alibaba. The only custom pieces (in the optics mount) have been designed by our expert friends at StandardRobot, a Pittsburgh-based mechatronics studio, and will be machined right here in the U.S.A. For both international and domestic parts, we\u2019ve already received multiple bids from different suppliers, and have factored the costs of shipping and customs into our reckoning. \nOur design is complete. We've learned a ton about the Chinese component marketplace. We\u2019ve made and tested several working prototypes, and we're ready to fufill our dream of getting inexpensive camera lucidas into the hands of lots of people. But to do this at all, we have to meet our suppliers\u2019 minimum order requirements\u2014usually, depending on the component, at least 500 pieces. If we can raise 500 orders, then our dream can be your reality! The NeoLucidas themselves will be assembled at Golan\u2019s studio in Pittsburgh, with the assistance of some careful students.\nThis is a Limited Run of Open Source Hardware.\nOur first batch of NeoLucidas will also be our only batch\u2014because, as we\u2019ve explained, we\u2019re doing this as a fun intervention, not to start a business. Once we\u2019ve finished distributing the NeoLucidas, we will publish our designs, CAD files, and all of our supplier data with a liberal Creative Commons and Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) license, so that anyone who wishes can continue the project (including, potentially, commercially). Our design and other manufacturing information will appear on NeoLucida.com, Instructables, Scribd, and other appropriate sites. We hope others will be inspired to pick up where we leave off!\nYour own NeoLucida. \nIf you support our project at the $40 level or higher, you'll get one NeoLucida in a draw-string pouch, plus instructions on using and caring for your device. The cost of shipping (within the US) is included.\nSo how is your NeoLucida \u201cprism-on-a-stick\u201d manufactured? We use a silvered prism, optimized for optical clarity, carefully encased in a custom anodized aluminum mount. The prism is supported by a highly adjustable gooseneck arm and a sturdy metal clamp. We even use a 1/4\u201d-20 threaded bolt as the connection between the gooseneck arm and the prism holder\u2014so your NeoLucida arm can easily double as a standard camera mount. All this is hand-assembled in Pittsburgh before being carefully packaged and sent off to you. Open it up and start drawing right away!\nBut there's more. Beyond just making a device for your use, we really want to see what you draw with your NeoLucida. In some ways, this is the true heart of our project. That\u2019s why every recipient of a NeoLucida will also receive a postage-prepaid blank postcard. And a NeoLucida pencil, too. Make a drawing with your NeoLucida, pop the card in the mail, and your drawing may end up in a published collection of NeoLucida drawings!\nCan I get more than one? Unfortunately not, per Kickstarter's \"Single Serving rule\" for rewards in the Product Design category. If, however, you're interested in classroom packs or other wholesale arrangements, please contact us privately. \nBacked by Primary Research.  \nSo, how are we qualified to do this, and why are we confident? We're both art professors and have spent the bulk of our careers using both modern and historical imaging technologies. Sure, most artists have used digital cameras\u2014but we've logged tons of hours with concave mirrors, large biconvex lenses, camera obscuras and camera lucidas.\nSelections from Pablo Garcia's personal collection of vintage camera lucidas.\nPablo using one of his antique camera lucidas, Iceland, 2010.\nExamples of Pablo's camera lucida drawings, 2010.\nPablo has spent a dozen years drawing with his camera lucida. Since acquiring his first one in 2001, he has also amassed one of the world's largest collections of primary and secondary research into the technology and history of this device. Pablo's collection includes many of the most important books, patents, articles, schematics, and contemporary accounts of the camera lucida. \nPossibly the best evidence that we're qualified to conduct this project is Pablo\u2019s personal collection of antique camera lucidas. Over the course of a decade, he has acquired the best examples of original camera lucidas throughout history. In his collection are devices from 1820, 1840, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1930, and several versions sold as children's drawing aids from the 1940s through the 1960s. This collection is one of the most complete primary resources on the technology around\u2014and served as the research foundation for our design of the NeoLucida.\nWho are we?\nPablo Garcia and Golan Levin are university art professors and new-media artists, with a strong shared interest in the history and poetics of imaging technologies.\nPablo Garcia (@prgarc) is Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

We are not only leveraging the Chinese factory system, with its standard parts ready for shipping, but also small, American design and fabrication companies with proven track records. This gives us the best of both worlds, allowing us to combine inexpensive components with custom components where appropriate.\n\nShould manufacturing issues arise, we have several options for local fabrication companies in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Finding alternate sources for the custom parts is not as difficult as it was ten years ago. These digitally-driven fabrication methods are now common industry standards. \n\nIn addition, we have both spent decades providing technical solutions to creative problems. Pablo was trained as an architect and designer and has spent over a decade working with digital fabrication equipment. Golan is a new media artist who has created and deployed robust, technically sophisticated installations all over the world. We are counting on that experience to provide both solid logistical planning and readiness to solve problems as they occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL: One week in, and new Rewards to help students draw!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL is here!", "update_content": "The Mid-2014 NeoLucida Pre-Order: through May 31\nIt's back!

Since its launch in April of 2011, I\u2019ve completed two chapters of the story, and now I\u2019d like to compile them into a printed book.\n\nCucumber Quest, unsurprisingly, is about a young boy named Cucumber. He\u2019s just been accepted to the school of his dreams, but since everyone around him thinks his dreams are kind of lame, he and his little sister, Almond, must instead embark on a quest to save the world. You know\u2014ancient evil, legendary sword, all of that stuff. It\u2019s a lighthearted, RPG-inspired adventure suitable for all ages, and you can read it for yourself here!\n\nThis will be the first time Cucumber Quest is collected in print format, with both a softcover and limited edition hardcover version. At about 160 full-color pages, the books will include the Prologue and Chapter 0, along with bonus comics and extra material. \n\nThe manufacturing and shipping costs for an endeavor like this will be roughly $9,750, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ll need your help. If you\u2019re interested in giving your support, please take a look at the list of incentives available. If we meet our goal, the books will be printed by fall 2012, so you can even preorder one if you\u2019d like. \nAnd\u2026that\u2019s about it! Thanks so much for your help!\n____________________\nAbout Limited Rewards:\nFor a pledge of $250 or higher, you'll receive one of the following digital commissions with a subject of your choosing: a head portrait (as part of the $250 reward,) a full-body portrait (as part of the $325 reward,) or a complete illustration (as part of the $500 and $1000 rewards.)\n\nAs part of the $1000 reward, you'll receive a lovingly-crafted paper cutout illustration featuring the Cucumber Quest character of your choice.

See details in the 'updates' section above!\nUPDATE#2: Album cover now up-- scroll down to see \nUPDATE#3:  Playable demo up!  Check out the 'updates' section.\nSide scrolling, arcade shooter action!\nHey everyone, my name is Leo (developing as Arachnid), and I'm a student earning my BFA in Illustration. A fair portion of college life is sitting through long lectures, so what better to do than doodle?  One day, after filling up all the margins in my notes, I said, \"Hey, I could make a game out of these!\"  \nAnd so it was.  College-Ruled Universe is a side-scrolling space-ship shooter, an homage to the old days of arcade gaming.  The game's graphics are entirely hand drawn with ballpoint pen on college-ruled notebook paper, thus the name.  With your help, we can turn this from just a concept to a mobile game phenomenon!  \nThe Project\nThe idea sprouted in November 2011, and ever since, I've been using every ounce of spare time to sketch up new ships, locations, and enemies.  Fast forward to mid January 2012.  I've got most of the artwork needed for the game drawn, scanned, and prepped.  But it's still missing some important factors: Programming and sound design.  \nThat's where you come in.  There's no way we could get premium sound design, a killer soundtrack, and flawless programming without you.  Your contribution turns this project from a dream to a reality.\nArtwork\nThis game is held together visually by a style derived from ink on paper.   Everyone doodles on something, right?  \nThe player can customize their ship, choosing from an array of weapons/armor...\n...To end up with something that looks like this:\nGameplay Mechanics\nThe bulk of the game is fashioned in the classic, shooter genre.  However, when the player gets to a new planet, they can get out of their ship and explore!  Players search for parts on these desolate worlds, and use them to upgrade and customize their ships.  You will need to upgrade to survive.\nThe boss battles will be designed in a cinematic fashion, mixing scripted events with gameplay, and requiring the player have full focus on the boss.  \nSound Design\nThe music (as you've heard in the video) is done by Doc Prop (Proper Productions), a local artist and friend of mine.  If you want to check out more of his work, just head over to  his soundcloud page!  Doc is doing some experimenting with sounds for the game, and coming up with a really slick sounding, spacey ambience.\nTechnical\nI've been working with Flash for over 8 years, so I figured this was a good platform to build the game in.  Especially since the latest version allows for direct export from AS 3.0 into files that can run on a number of devices, including android, iPhone, and iPad.  The demo you see above is animated in flash, and all the assets are directly usable for the game build.  \nA programmer will be hired with KS funding to create an AS 3.0 build of the game that is specialized for Android devices.  Later on, if we want to move to other devices, the switch-over should be pretty minimal, since the original build is in Flash.\nRewards\nCurious about the rewards?  Can't blame you!\nPrints:  The prints are all done on a high quality cardstock paper, with professional quality industrial printing at 300dpi.  They are various scenes utilizing artwork from the game, designed specifically to look totally badass hanging on your wall.   Example:\nUSB: Print stuff is great, but so is electronic.  The USB stick will contain the full resolution PDF containing all 28 pages of the artbook, the soundtrack of the game with cover art, AND the Flash build of the game, completely playable right on your computer.  Seems too good to be true?  WELL IT'S TRUE SO DEAL WITH IT.\nArtbook The College-Ruled Universe Artbook will be 28 semigloss pages of artwork from the game, all immaculately laid out for your viewing pleasure.  8.5\"x11\" landscape bound.  Color cover, b/w interior. Interior examples below:\nCustom Drawings:  For the heavy hitters out there.  The custom drawing is just what it sounds like:  an original sketch, ballpoint on acid-free sketchbook paper, just for you. \nOriginal Artwork:   This is the original piece of artwork that got scanned in and used for the game.  You get THE original.  Framed.    If the game becomes famous, you'll have a piece of mobile game history!  (and I'll probably see it on eBay)\nPoster:  Five feet of beautiful layout, printed on vinyl. preview: \nYour Designs in the game: It's just what it sounds like.  You draw something up on lined paper, and we'll place it into the game in a fitting way.  (If you have a really goofy / dark / eccentric style, we'll emphasize that)  I really don't want you to worry about 'what if I can't draw' because I think anyone's doodles are fun to look at!  So have at it.\nThat about covers it.   Thanks for reading!  And I really hope you like what you see, and to those of you who contributed, a special thanks.
