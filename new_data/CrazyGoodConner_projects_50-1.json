To ensure best-practices as far as fulfillment is concerned, we ask that you read this VERY CAREFULLY before ordering.\nDIGITAL DOWNLOADS\nDigital files are sent out 24 hours after we receive our funding, which is typically 14-17 days after the last day of the campaign. These are e-mailed to the address on file and are valid for 7 days. Any extension of this is subjective.\nWe will not be mailing out links after 31 days.\nNo questions asked, no extensions past this point.\nTo ensure that you receive the necessary e-mails that contain these links, DO NOT block, filter, or unsubscribe ICONIC COMICS, KAMEN AMERICA, WETRANSFER, or ORANGEDOX.\nNew to this year is a tracking function that we have backstage that allows us to see download activity based on the e-mail addresses that the link is sent to. We reserve the right to terminate any current or future download ability based on unusual spikes in downloads coming from certain e-mail address.

Should this happen, please file a complaint with your local UPS / USPS / FEDEX provider.\nWe are not responsible for missing parcels after 3 months from the day they are sent out: that is when tracking information is no longer available to us, and it becomes the customer's word against our fulfillment that a package was not sent. Please read our fulfillment policies very carefully so that there is no confusion later on.\nWe also cannot guarantee the sending of products 3 months after the last package is sent out. Part of our on-time delivery is that customers are responsible for filling out their surveys in a timely manner. We cannot hold on to parcels on behalf of extremely late readers: at some point, we liquidate our stock to make room for new books. While we try to accommodate late surveys, we cannot guarantee either the quality of the book sent or that there will be books available at the time the survey is completed.

The story is a buddy comedy created by the New York-based writing duo Brian VanHooker and Steve Quistagaard, who have been best friends and writing partners for 20 years. Most recently, Brian and Steve filmed a pilot named \"The Tramp\" starring John O'Hurley (Seinfeld, Family Feud, The National Dog Show) that won a number of awards on the festival circuit. Brian is also a staff writer at MEL Magazine and hosts a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles podcast named \"Turtle Tracks.\" \nBrian VanHooker (left) and Steve Quistgaard (right) on the set of \"The Tramp\" starring John O'Hurley (rear) in 2018.\nOf everything Brian and Steve have ever worked on though, nothing is as personal to them as \"Barnum & Elwood\" a story about two pals in pursuit of their dreams.\nThe story begins in 1930s America, where Barnum \u2014 an ill-tempered, alcoholic con-man from New York \u2014 has just inherited a farm in rural Virginia from his dead uncle. On the farm he discovers Elwood, a friendly, na\u00efve goat who mysteriously has the ability to talk.  \nPage 2 of issue #1\nIn short order, Barnum decides that Elwood is his ticket to success, so he hits the road with Elwood, exploiting the goat any way he can. Over time, they grow to love each other and become best friends.\nPage 5 of issue #1\nOriginally conceived of as an animated series, Brian & Steve have since decided that \"Barnum & Elwood\" would be best suited as a comic book, and they hired professional artist Beejay Hawn help make that happen.  Beejay's credits include Jim Lawson's \"Dragonfly\" and she was the #38 variant cover artist for the #100th issue of IDW's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.  For Barnum & Elwood, Beejay redesigned the characters to look better than ever and she has already completed issue #1. \nHere's where the Kickstarter comes in.\nWe are asking for $4,000 to print issue #1 and to finish and print issue #2. Most of the money, about $2500, is going to Beejay for her services, as she's drawing, inking and lettering a 20-page comic and doing a variety of covers. Another $1000 is for printing both issues with Comic Well Spring and the remaining money is for shipping, Kickstarter fees and everything else. \nThe multi-talented Beejay Hawn, who will be penciling all of issues #1 and #2 as well as inking, lettering and coloring the colors.\nIssue #1 \u2014 which is already completed \u2014 is the story of how Barnum and Elwood meet on the farm. Excited by his new discovery, Barnum drags Elwood to Richmond, Virginia and they get a job as Harry Houdini's opening act. \nIssue #1 with Kickstarter exclusive cover.\nIssue #2 \u2014 which is written and has completed layouts \u2014 is about Barnum's latest get-rich-quick scheme, when he decides to open a celebrity cruise line with Elwood as the main attraction. In the story, the duo tear down the old barn on the farm and fashion it into the \"Goat Boat\" (a shoddily build ship with a goat head on it).  From there, they set sail down the James River and have a crazy, swashbuckling, high-seas adventure.\nIssue #2 with Kickstarter exclusive cover.\nThe Reward Tiers\nThe most basic reward tier is for $20, where you'll receive both issues #1 and #2 with their exclusive Kickstarter covers as well as some bonus items, which include \"Barnum & Elwood\" stickers, a digital copy of issue #1 when the Kickstarter closes and a \"Thank you\" in the back of both issues.\nIn the next tier, you pay $40 and get four comics: the Kickstarter covers for issues #1 and #2, as well as the retail cover for each.  This also includes the bonus items.\nThe $100 tier is where things get exciting. In addition to the Kickstarter versions of the issues #1 and #2 and the bonus items, you'll receive a personal cameo in issue #2. Beejay Hawn is a professional caricature artist, and at this level, she will draw you into issue #2. When Barnum & Elwood set sail on the Goat Boat, YOU will be on that boat!\nThen there's the top tier for $250. Here you'll receive four comics \u2014 just like the $40 tier, along with the bonus items \u2014 but in this level you'll receive a SPEAKING CAMEO in issue #2!\nAdd-Ons\nThere will also be some awesome add-ons that you can buy, including an Elwood T-shirt and sketch covers done by Beejay Hawn!\nWe Need Your Support!\nThis Kickstarter will be running for the entire month of May, 2021 and we need help seeing this project to fruition! Over the past several years, Brian VanHooker and Steve Quistgaard have poured their hearts and souls into these two characters and they've got big plans for them going forward, including dozens more adventures planned. It all starts right here though, with this Kickstarter and your support, so please, spread the word about this Kickstarter, tell your friends and get yourself some copies of issues #1 and #2. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, set sail upon the Goat Boat yourself with a cameo tier!\n\nThank you for your time and support.

I started writing screenplays back in 2008 and had some immediate interest from Hollywood producers and one horror project was actually rushed into production!  Blood N'Bullets aka BnB was the third screenplay that I wrote and was the second in the Supernatural Western genre but unlike my previous scripts which has more male dominated roles, I wanted the BnB story to focus on strong and charismatic female characters which were not often seen in so many of the Western stories of the past.  The BnB screenplay has been optioned three times in the past by Hollywood producers, and I hope after this project is published, it will once again be a sought after property!  \n\nEarly promotional art for BnB screenplay from 2010\nI started with a new original character, \"Bloody\" Mary Masterson, a gun for hire with a deadly reputation and a quick temper to make her a force to be reckoned with.  Mary is accompanied by her dog Hamlet and she's known to quote Shakespeare to her faithful companion while out on the trail.  Mary is a loner and doesn't much care for towns, but she has come to town to visit her brother Holden who has recently remarried after his first wife died...but therein lies a serious problem....as Holden has married a Native American named Blackbird and neither Mary nor the rest of the town is too keen on Holden taking  Blackbird as his new wife! \nMary and Blackbird may have to learn to set their differences aside when all Hell Breaks Loose in this sleepy town after mysterious strangers arrive from Europe with a lust for blood and taste for vengeance!   \nBnB #1 is the first installment of a two part graphic novel written by me and brought to life by Silvano Beltramo of Italy drawing the interior of the book, and returning Loco Hero colorist Sean Callahan bringing the project into the world of color as well Es Kay in Australia putting words to paper as the Letterer!  This all-star team did a fantastic job under my art direction and has put together a truly stellar graphic novel I'm sure you will enjoy!\n\"Bloody\" Mary Masterson and early comics development.\nIn 2015 I started working with artists to bring projects like BnB and Loco Hero to life, and like many projects there were pitfalls and artists who didn't work out which caused long delays in art being turned in.  The good news is that in those subsequent years I grew as a writer and publisher, and Kickstarter became THE place for Indie publishers to showcase their creations.  For those not familiar with my previous project Loco Hero which launched April of 2020, we won \"Cover of the Year\" and were Runner-Up for both Indie Publisher of the Year and Indie Character of the Year for the 2020 Independent Creator Awards which was a great honor.   I also was managing these new self-publishing projects while delivering my own cover art assignments for Lady Death, GI:JOE, TMNT, Vampirella and a slate of Officially Licensed Fine Art prints for The Mandalorian!  Talk about getting no sleep....but no complaints, it's been a great year artistically speaking!!\n\nThanks to some industry friends Kevin Guillotte and Richard Boom, a great team was brought together to make BnB a feast for the eyes as well as the mind!  The image below showcases some of the killer art and storytelling skills of Silvano Beltramo! \nA beauty to behold even in black and white...\nAs the pages flooded in from a very inspired Silvano, the colorist from Loco Hero Sean Callahan from here in Colorado, brought these pages to life with his unique and vibrant colors and lastly a new letterer for the project Es Kay from Australia really dropped the hammer and brought the whole project home to the finish line!  By the time this campaign launches, ALL pages will be drawn, colored and lettered and there should be no delays in sending this Graphic Novel with Moore BITE than most to the printer!  As with the previous Loco Hero campaign, we will be offering a variety of covers from the Art Core team who worked on and in the book (myself included) and covers will be available in both trade dress (with logo) and virgin (without logo/text). \nFORMAT: 48 pgs full color!\n\nStandard Edition covers by our ART CORE team including writer/creator/artist Monte Moore\n\n\nNew Campaigns mean some new art from some of the industry hottest and most respected artists as well!  This Campaign features Rock Star Variant covers from Stephen B. Scott, Jason Metcalf and Marat Mychaels and depending on how the campaign does, there may be even Moore mystery covers revealed during the Kickstarter! \nRock Star Variant Covers from some of the industry's favorite artists!\n\n\nBelow you can see some of the Holofoil cover options to feed those hungry collectors who like some Moore rare bling in their comics collection!\n\nStunning and highly collectable covers printed in Holofoil are Collector Favorites!\n\nPhilanthropy\nMuch like my previous campaigns, I have chosen to share some of the successes of this campaign with a worthy cause or organization. On our previous campaign for Loco Hero we raised several thousand dollars for Operation Second Chance for our US Veterans in need and since this campaign for BnB is a Western themed project I have chosen the Native American Heritage Association to receive the lion's share of the proceeds from the Giving Moore reward tier where backers will receive a signed version of the \"Nature's Kingdom\" art shown below, this item can also be over-pledged as an 'add-on' so simply add $20 to your pledge to also receive this fine art print. \n\"Nature's Kingdom\" print to benefit the Native American Heritage Association.\n\nRewards\nChoose your rewards from the right side of the screen at all support levels!  We have digital versions of the book as well as physical copies of Blood N' Bullets in regular and limited edition holofoil cover varieties, with variant covers from some of the best in the industry. Every backer of a physical tier will also receive a free digital copy of Blood N'Bullets!   Cover art prints are available as well as original art pieces, custom framed prints and Moore!  Since new cover art is sure to be added during the campaign, it isn't necessary to choose which cover you want right now when ordering the Standard (ArtCore) Edition covers, the Rockstar Edition Covers, Cover Art Prints and bundles including those. You will be given the opportunity, during the survey at the end of the campaign, to select exactly which covers you want for your pledge, even if those were not announced at the time of your pledge! If you would like an additional item or items over and above your selected reward tier and already chosen add-ons, you will be able to select those items during the survey period at the end of the campaign as well, or you can 'over-pledge' now to have a buffer in case any new items become available that you miss.\nReward tiers that have limited availability, like the Holofoil editions, custom framed metal prints, one-of-a kind copies, original art, and commissions are NOT available to be add-ons at any point during the campaign, either at the point of pledge, or through the survey. Be sure that if you are wanting one of these that you make that tier your your primary pledge. \n\"Dark Spirits\" Original Art by Monte Moore\nPresenting the Pearl Linen Edition Comics. These comics feature a pearlescent coating and a textured cover. This is a new process that we have never used for any of our books before, and they are truly stunning!  We have chosen 6 different covers to be represented in this style and have limited the offering to a total of 100 comics per each cover. 25 full sets have been reserved for the \"Fresh Linens\" tier, 25 full sets will be included in the Full House tier level, and the remaining 50 copies of each of this books are available as add-ons in the add-on section. \nPearl Linen covers for the true collector featuring several M3 covers in this tier!\n\nPearl Linen Edition Texture Detail\nStretch Goals\nWe were told on our last campaign that we had some of the Absolute BEST Stretch goal swag that included dog tags, cool art, stickers and Moore so in this campaign our Western themed stretch goals will be no different!  All backers who back a pledge level and receive physically shipped rewards (non-digital) will also receive all of the cool swag below, so the Moore the campaign raises the Moore cool stuff you will get, so please share share and share some Moore when it comes to social media! \nMoore Stretch Goal Items for all backers receiving physically shipping reward tiers (non-digital)\n\n\n\n\n Would you like to know Moore?  (Starship Troopers reference oh yeah! ) \nMonte Michael Moore - Project Creator\nI  have been a professional illustrator and full time artist in the  gaming, comics, pin-up and entertainment industries for nearly 30 years.   Ever since I was 16 I knew I wanted to be an artist, but never in my  wildest dreams did I think I would have the career I have enjoyed thus  far.  I've seen my Art Heroes turn into friends and mentors who are  artistic greats and now who consider me a peer.  After earning a  Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design/Illustration from Colorado State  University, I attended my first Comic-Con International in San Diego  with some friends which self-published our first comic book in 1993.   After that I started freelancing for other indie publishers and getting  my own work marketed to new industries like gaming and attending my  first GenCon.  As an avid gamer since the early 80's and a fan of  comics, I knew I had found the right place for my art.  I've gotten a  reputation as one of the hardest working artists in the industry, always  striving to make my art better, to never miss deadlines, to be  available to fans and collectors and to work with new clients.  My first  art book was published when I was 25, and after Winning the World  Fantasy Art Show in 1998 and 2001 for Best Black and White Art, I knew I  was on the right track.  Although my art was rejected by many clients  early on...I never gave up, it only fueled my determination.  Eventually  every single client and magazine that rejected me...finally accepted  and hired me.  Now my work can be seen on great properties and magazines  such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, Star Trek, Dungeons and Dragons,  Playboy, The U.S. Marine Corps, Coors, Harley-Davidson and many others.   I've enjoyed working for clients on movie posters, role-playing games,  collectable card games (like Magic: The Gathering), video games, novel  covers, and have even become recognized as one of the top custom  painters in the motorcycle industry, one of my own personal passions.   I've also had the opportunity to design over 80 unique fantasy and  gothic themed sculptures which are marketed all over the world. Since  2014 I've been working with the fine folks of Coffin Comics to create a cadre of Lady Death covers that have been wildly supported by their  tremendous fan base.  More recently I've branched into writing for the  film industry, and thus far have written 10 screenplays, sold 5 script  options and had 2 feature films already produced.  Although it is  difficult to become proficient at so many disciplines, I personally find  it more rewarding to be working on so many projects, rather than only  becoming known for one look or style like many artists today.  During an  average work week for me I might paint a 10 foot wall mural, create a  private commission, paint a movie poster or design an R2-D2 folding camp  chair while later building a website or designing a sculpture.  It  takes a lot of time and dedication to create this artwork and promote it  by traveling the world and staying connected on social media. Staying  in communication with my supportive fans is very important to me as they  provide me the opportunity to create the artwork that I love to bring  to life.  Thanks for checking out the Blood N'Bullets campaign, I hope  you are able to help bring this project to life!  \n\n Sincerely Monte M.

Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image. Copy, paste, and post them on your own social accounts to help spread the word. It's as simple as that! \n4. CHECK IN WITH YOUR FELLOW MSTIES.  We don't want you to pressure anyone, but we do hope you'll check in to make sure they know about this Kickstarter.  And when you do, be sure to remind them that pledging even a $1 token pledge will still help us unlock more Challenge Goals, Bonus Rewards, and get them weekly updates all the way through the production of Season 13!\n5. JOIN OUR \"VIRTUAL STREET TEAM.\" If you've got a little extra time, and want to make sure we reach our final goal, there are more specific ways to volunteer and help. If you want to get specific \"assignments\" to help us #MakeMoreMST3K, you can sign up to be part of our elite volunteer team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we learned last time, there are always risks with Kickstarter... and the world is a little crazier right now than usual.

Gab usually does character designs, cover illustrations, but sometimes he also does fan art, comics, and even card games.  He really loves to read comics, play classic video games.

McLain is happily married with two amazing kids and two crazy dogs. He is an established musician and has been in the music industry for over twenty seven years as well as working in the comic industry for over thirteen years.

He is best known as an editor, having worked on dozens of titles for companies such as Antarctic Press, Markosia, and Scout Comics.\nWes says:\n\"I've written for, and created several titles, as well as done editing for most of my nearly 20 year comic career. However, I'm often viewed as \"just a colorist.\"\n\nWhile I'm extremely proud of my coloring role, and the many opportunities I've been granted because of it, there is so much more in me that I am striving to get out.\n\nSo with Sasquanaut and my comic imprint Cosmic Roots Studio, I am investing in myself as a creator (with your help) to cut my own path through the jungle and prove to myself and the rest of the world that I am more than \"just a colorist.\"\n\nAnd with THIS story I feel UNLIMITED.\n\nSasquanaut needed to be much more flexible in a way that my previous stories were not. Sasquanaut allows me to seamlessly crisscross genres at the turn of a page and never feels out of place. \n\nAs long as the reader can accept that Bigfoot is flying through space, which is no more absurd than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turles, then I can take the story in ANY direction that appeals to me. \n\nSasquanaut's  zany adventures in space keeps me, and hopefully YOU dear reader, entertained and always guessing what comes next.\"\n\nKickstarter has proven to be an amazing venue for getting new creative ideas that could potentially never be realized without you and the Kickstarter platform.\n\nCrowd funding is an amazing opportunity for YOU the potential fans to directly engage with a creator in a way that has never been provided before.\n\nYou have the power to make the products you want come to life.\n\nYOU get to decide that. You decide what products we offer are worth your hard earned money, and that is a privilege that I do not take for granted.\n\nTo prove that you can trust me with your hard earned money I can point to the two previous campaigns that were successfully funded and delivered early.\n\nThis issue, just like the last four campaigns, is 95% complete before this page has gone live.  You are not paying to produce this comic, it is already done. The only remaining work is to proofread and finalize the lettering.\n\nThere is no risk that this book won't come out.\n\nThe only potential risks are the lingering effects of the global pandemic we have been facing and that may have on the production schedule.\n\nBecause of that, I have tried to plan some extra time into my production and fulfillment schedule to account for any potential backlog or delays at the printer who has been closed or operating in a limited capacity like most other businesses in the country.\n\nThere is a very good likelihood that everything will proceed as it regularly would prior to the COVID-19 crisis, and if that is the case fulfillment should be done faster than scheduled.\n\nI pride myself on my communication and professionalism, and your trust in me is not taken lightly.  You can see on my past three campaigns I have made regular updates detailing the status and progress on every step of the campaign.\n\nAnd I'm taking it even further this time.  Every Monday night, join me on Twitch as I continue to produce and create Sasquanaut right before you eyes one page at a time.  Join the conversation about the creative process and ask any questions on how to make a comic and know without a doubt that your money is being put to work.\n\nThank you for checking out my project. \nThank you for showing an interest in something that I have spent years putting together, and thank you most especially if you've pledged on this campaign on any of my previous campaigns.  You are making my dreams come true and I cannot express how much this means.\n\nWe are in an amazing new golden age for independent and self published comics, and it is driven by  wonderful people like you who support passion projects, like this one. \n\nAgain thank you.\n\nVolume 1 of Savage Sasquanaut is 6 issues long. The first 4 Issues have so far been met with universal praise, and I've worked relentlessly to create comics of impeccable quality for your enjoyment.\n\nThis series is the beginning of what I hope will be so much more, and I cannot wait to share them all with you.  This is happening because of you, thank you.\n\nAlso thanks to Dark Fantasy Studio and Humble Bundle for allowing me to purchase the right to use such a dope song. Also thanks to Fiverr.com for hooking up the Cosmic Roots Studio logo animation.\n\nPLEASE review the different REWARD PACKAGES and SELECT the one you like, and complete your pre-order for the best new sci-fi hero you've never heard of.\n\nPLEASE SHARE THIS PROJECT WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSAVAGE SASQUANAUT #5 (Wes Hartman - My Fifth Kickstarter Campaign) As a Kickstarter supporter myself, I know what it means to give your hard earned money to new and unknown projects. I have made every effort to minimize the risk to you, the backer. This includes having the issue 100% completed before you even see this page. At my own expense I have paid and received ALL the art from Gab Santos for the entire 6 issues of volume 1. When the campaign successfully ends, with your help, the files will be loaded to the printer when the funding comes in, digital rewards can be sent upon receiving completed surveys, and coloring and lettering can continue on all remaining issues. Issues 1 through 4 Kickstarter campaigns and fulfillment went as smoothly as I could possibly hope for, and so far I have received universal praise on the quality and timeliness of the projects. That's not to say I didn't learn a few things that I believe will better assist in completing and shipping all rewards to everyone. I love this book and I want everyone who takes part of this campaign to love this book as much as I and have a completely satisfied experience on Kickstarter with me and Gab. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message me and I will do my absolute best to make this project as rewarding as possible.

My name is Reese Roper. I was, and am currently- the singer for the band Five Iron Frenzy. Maybe you've heard of us? Probably not. That's okay, because this has very little to do with that. Only that you need to know, that in almost 30 years of recoding vocals, guitars, pianos, and other instruments- having countless iterations of home studios, and having recorded in several world-renowned studios myself- what I have realized is that it is extremely expensive to get a really cool, good-sounding, mic. I want that to change. The technology for microphones has not really deviated much in the last 60 years, and yet \"high-end\" boutique microphones still cost anywhere from $5000 to $15,000! The materials used are really still the same in all of these microphones, with very little difference in schematics, or production.\n\nWhat I am offering- is something cooler. Mechanically similar to the Neumann U87, coated in a laboratory-grade, porcelain, powder-coating to make it prettier and more durable. Multi-Pattern, and a decibel reduction switches make this a truly versatile tool for any studio. It comes with a large GOLD-PLATED diaphragm to prevent corrosion, and a LIFETIME WARRANTY. It comes in a custom wood box that you will want to display in your studio with pride. It looks like a Storm-trooper made a baby with a Light-saber.

In second grade I discovered my love of drawing when my teacher gave me an old, 1940s book about drawing cartoons. That book set the course for years of drawing at home and doodling in the margins of my assignments at school. My world turned green forever when I found the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Growing up with the cartoon, my mind began to race with characters and stories of my own. I dreamed of someday putting pencil to paper to share my years of imagination with the world. Now is my time, and it feels like I\u2019ve stepped into a time machine.

Refugees from a war-stricken planet, the riptoadz hope to find a new home where they can start a new life. They aren't looking for trouble but they won't run away from it either. They pack quite an intergalactic PUNCH when their backs are to the wall. As you\u2019ll soon discover, there\u2019s more than meets the eye when it comes to these tadpolez.\nMeanwhile, species throughout the universe are noticing an alarming number of their citizens disappearing mysteriously. As the Riptoadz journey through space, they\u2019ll tangle with the galaxy's most sinister space pirates, Red Beard and his pack of menacing robo hounds. Will they be able to stop his heinous, intergalactic reign of terror? Will they find a new home? Will they survive at all? Back our campaign to help the intergalactic revolution and learn their fate!\n\n\n\n The Intergalactic Creators \nMy name is Matthew Holland. I\u2019m the father of two wonderful kids, who I work full-time to support. In my few moments of down time, I love to draw, ink and sculpt my life away. I have teamed up Manu' Silva to bring new life to The Intergalactic Riptoadz.\nEmanuel Silva, known in the art world as Manu Silva, is a Brazilian artist rising in popularity among TMNT, Predator and Venom fans for his detailed style inspired by legendary artists like Todd McFarlane, Alex Ross, Greg Capullo and J. Scott Campbell. Other inspirations include Mike Deodato Jr, Gabrielle Dell\u2019Otto, Adi Granov and classic greats such as Jack Kirby, Walter Simonson and George P\u00e9rez.\nWith our powers combined, T I R and the galaxy will never be the same!\n\nCover B by Manu Silva\n\n Our Intergalactic mission\nOur Intergalactic mission\nThe mission of this project is to increase awareness of human trafficking, shedding light on a dark scourge that has plagued the human race for centuries. Too many lives have been stolen, too many atrocities perpetrated \u2026 all for the sake of human greed and depravity. As we raise awareness, we push toward a future where the darkness of human trafficking fades away. \nPage ? by Manu Silva (wormz)\n\n\n\nFor the campaign...\nWe\u2019re planning 32 action packed pages of awesomeness plus we\u2018re offering special variant covers, as well as signature options. We have also called on comic book artist, Frank Fosco (TMNT UL) and Jason Flowers (Bounty Bullfrog) to help our quest by offering variant covers that will be out of this world! There will be a limited number of original art sketch cards available. There are awesome pin-ups, stickers, posters by some awesome artists and bonus material that will be unlocked as stretch goals are met.  We want to put as much intergalactic swag in your hands as possible. We just need your support to make it happen!\nBe the one and join the intergalactic revolution!\n\nCover art by Manu Silva\n Our intergalactic budget  \nThe funds will be allocated appropriately to cover the many costs of publishing a comic book of intergalactic proportion. Artist commissions and materials, publishing costs and massive amounts of time don\u2019t just happen by magic. I know, I already asked; apparently, it\u2019s a lot of hard work. And don\u2019t forget the Intergalactic Federation will want their taxes and fees. With your support we will pay their bounty and help the Riptoadz bring balance to the universe! \n\nCover art by Manu Silva\n\nJoin us for Intergalactic dominance over all tyrants and bullies! \nCover B b&w by Manu Silva\n\n\n\nOriginal concept art by Matthew Holland\nOriginal concept art by Matthew Holland\nPin up art\n\nConcept by creator Matthew Holland\nConcept art by creator Matthew Holland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAY TUNED FOR MORE AWESOME INTERGALACTIC UPDATES!!!\nWe have some really awesome villains, heroes and spin-off stories that will be ahead in future doses!!\nA special intergalactic thank you to Chris Gage, Emanuel Silva and Wes Roberts.

If you supported the previous color Gold Bricks, thank you very much, and we hope you support this campaign too. With a load of great standalone and continuity pickup stories, this collection makes a great jumping-on point for any new readers, as well as awesome reading for longtime fans. THESE ISSUES HAVE NEVER BEEN COLLECTED INTO ONE VOLUME BEFORE. Between its black-and-white and full-color issues, Gold Digger is now approaching the 300-issue mark and is going strong!\nIf you're not familiar with us, my name is Joeming Dunn, and I run Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1984. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like Gold Digger and Ninja High School. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this Kickstarter program to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators.\nOver the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is Fred Perry's ingenious title, Gold Digger, which Fred describes as a mixture of Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy. The idea for Gold Digger was first conceived during Fred's tour of duty in the first Gulf War, and it debuted in Antarctic Press's anthology comic, Mangazine, in 1991. A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on Gold Digger.\nOver the past years, we have released other Color Gold Bricks as Kickstarter projects. We are now releasing the eighth Color Gold Brick, which features issues 226 through 250 of the Gold Digger series. (This is actually the 10th Gold Brick. More on that below.) If you haven't seen or read Gold Digger, this is your chance to enjoy one of the best and longest-running ongoing series in comics. Like the other Bricks, this one lets new readers join in easily, so you don't have to be shy!\nThe two earliest Brick volumes, Gold Brick 1 and Gold Brick 2, were black and white. Then Fred began his color series, so Bricks 3-6 were printed in color. Gold Brick 3 was originally printed in limited quantities, and Fred's only reference copy became thoroughly destroyed from years of constant use. Kickstarter was used to make this out-of-print edition available again as Color Brick 1. By this time, the original stock of Brick 4 had sold out as well, so we offered a new printing of that through Kickstarter as Color Brick 2.  However, the original Bricks 5 and 6 were still in stock at the time, so we skipped ahead to produce Gold Brick 7 (Color Brick 5), collecting material not previously available in this format, and have continued the sequence from there. (We know this can still be confusing, so we have a numbering guide at the bottom of this page.)\nSince the original printings of Gold Bricks 5 and 6 have since sold out, we'll eventually go back to reprint these other volumes to match the new Kickstarter printings' format. We want everyone to have nice editions. For now, however, in addition to reasons already mentioned, many backers in previous campaigns have asked if we could skip ahead, since they had already purchased the earlier editions. Skipping ahead allows these backers to have a nice, new volume for their shelves. At the same time, we also help backers who missed the earlier Brick offerings way back in the day to catch up via the reprints.\nYou can actually read the color series up through issue #99 online at http://antarcticpresslibrary.com/ and see what you've been missing.\n\nWhat are we going to do with the Campaign money?\nPlain and simple, we're going to print and ship the Gold Digger Color Gold Brick 8.\nThe Color Gold Brick is over 600 pages in FULL COLOR. Printing the actual books is the biggest single expense. The first print run of a typical Gold Brick is quite expensive, as most printers require a minimum run to make it cost-effective. We are thus using Kickstarter to assist us with those costs. If the amount seems high, you must remember that we are printing at least a thousand copies of a 600+ page book. Another cost is shipping: First we will have to ship the books from the printer to our offices, and once we get them, send copies to all our supporters and distributors. Several thousand pounds of books represents a significant shipping expense.\nHere is a breakdown of our expenses.\nPrinting: $12,500 (which includes hard and softcover)\nShipping: $3,000 (Sending a 600-page book is costly, especially overseas.  The cost for shipping just one copy overseas is now around $34.)\nFees: $1500 (Kickstarter takes their fees off the top)\nHandling/Supplies: $1500 (We have to pay for boxes and pay people to pack those boxes.)\nThat does not include cost for sending the large PDF files to all the supporters and other miscellaneous costs.\nThose basic expenses total $18,500.\nSo what do you get?\nThe brick is 6 x 9 inches and will contain issues 226 through 250 of the Gold Digger series. You can see the covers to all 25 issues below.\n\nREWARDS\nHere are the rewards we are offering. Some of you may ask why there are not any sketch editions with these rewards as in previous campaigns. Without going into details, Fred is a very busy man and has taken on more responsibilities, both family- and work-wise. At this time, we did not want to burden him with any further work. We hope you understand.\nADD-ONS\nWe hope to print other Gold Bricks, both earlier ones as they sell out and new ones never before collected. As you know, this volume will reprint 25 issues of the color series, but there are over 200 issues of Gold Digger, and this printing of 600+ pages only covers about 10% of the entire run. Many of the early issues are the ones that are most desperately out of print. Being a small, independent publisher, we are forced to try to keep our cost margins as narrow as possible, and the end result is many of our books sell out quickly and become unavailable. Hopefully, we can use this campaign to help us keep all of our books in print. This is especially important with Gold Digger, since new readers discover the comic every day. We hope to be able to include other items as push goals, which may include getting other Bricks out to you.\nNUMBERING GUIDE\nGold Brick #1 (B/W #1) - The first Gold Brick, which collects the first 25 issues of the black-and-white regular series. (Not offered on Kickstarter.)\nGold Brick #2 (B/W #2) - The second Gold Brick, which collects issues #26 \u2013 50 of the black-and-white regular series. (Not offered on Kickstarter.)\nGold Brick #3 (COLOR BRICK #1) - The third Gold Brick, the first to collect the COLOR Gold Digger series issues #1 \u2013 25. (New Printing on Kickstarter ended on January 1, 2014.)\nGold Brick #4 (COLOR BRICK #2) - The fourth Gold Brick, but the second to collect the COLOR Gold Digger series, containing issues #26 \u2013 50. (New Printing on Kickstarter ended on May 16, 2014.)\nGold Brick #5 (COLOR BRICK #3) The fifth Gold Brick, collects issues #51 \u2013 #75 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. Currently sold out.  New printing planned for a future campaign, but not yet scheduled.\nGold Brick #6 (COLOR BRICK #4) The sixth Gold Brick, collects issues #76 \u2013 #100 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. Currently sold out.  New printing planned for a future campaign, but not yet scheduled.\nGold Brick #7 (COLOR BRICK #5) The seventh Gold Brick, collects issues #101 \u2013 #125 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. (First Printing! Kickstarter project ended on December 12, 2014.)\nGold Brick #8 (COLOR BRICK #6) The eighth Gold Brick, collects issues #126 \u2013 #150 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. As of color issue #150, we integrated the 50 black-and-white issues into the numbering to emphasize Fred's landmark achievement.  The 150th color issue was therefore published as Gold Digger #200, and the issue numbering proceeds from that point. (First Printing! Kickstarter project ended on August 2, 2016.)\nGold Brick #9 (COLOR BRICK #7) The ninth Gold Brick, collects issues #201 \u2013 #225 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. (First Printing! Kickstarter project ended on May 15, 2017.)\nGOLD BRICK #10 (COLOR BRICK #8) The tenth Gold Brick, collects issues #226- #250. NEVER PRINTED BEFORE AND NOW AVAILABLE ON KICKSTARTER.\nGOLD DIGGER- Publication History- In the beginning, there was an issue of Mangazine, which introduced Gold Digger to the world, and the issue was good. Then there was a 4 issue mini-series that got this joint a poppin'. Lo, there came the regular Gold Digger (Black and White) issues #1-50. Then, when mankind was ready and their fingers grew tired of newsprint stains, Fred Perry and Antarctic Press begat Gold Digger (Color) issues #1-149 on the glossy paper. Many years passed while readers enjoyed those amazing issues, and the world was ready for re-numberification. Thus spake Fred Perry: There shall be a number, and the number shall be #150\u2014no, WAIT!\u2014it shall be... #200, and all the Gold Digger numbering was reintegrated. 50+150=200.  And the world rejoiced, and the numbering has continued ever since! (So, why didn't we include the 4-issue mini-series in the reintegrated numbering? That needed some SPECIAL treatment: GOLD DIGGER: REMASTERED BOOK ONE.  But that is a different tale.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks inherent in any project. This project has very few risks; the book is already done, and all we just need to do is raise the funds, pay the printer, and get it made. Our biggest risk is that we won't get the funding, and then the book won't be made. We have been printing and releasing books for close to 30 years, so we have a good relationship with our printer and do not anticipate any hiccups. There is always the risk that we won't be able to get the books in on time due to a variety of factors, but again, we do not anticipate that sort of problem. We believe in full disclosure and we will make sure to keep you all updated on the progress of the book and all the incentives. As you can see we have had positive responses to all our previous campaigns and have had no difficulty fulfilling our obligations. The printer we are using for this project is the same one that we have dealt with for many years so we do not anticipate any printing issues.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Gold Brick #10 PDF Reward", "descp": "Get the PDF of Color Gold Brick 8 (Gold Brick X), 600+ pages!

Following the   adventures of Jeremy Feeple who is suddenly being chased by a ninja named Itchy-Koo and an alien princess named Asrial in the town of   Quagmire. Later his younger brother Ricky would pick up the mantel. For 175 issues it is one of the longest running OEL(Original English  Language) manga to exist and has  influenced many. So much so that fans  and readers began to submit  stories based on the NINJA HIGH SCHOOL  characters and story situations.  This lead the creator of NINJA HIGH  SCHOOL, BEN DUNN, to begin to  collect these stories into annuals or  YEARBOOKS. Thus began a 20 year  tradition.\nNow for the first time ever, these stories are being collected in  what  will hopefully be a series to collect all the various stories that  take  place in the NINJA HIGH SCHOOL universe. Inside this collection are   the talents of many fans and readers. Some who have gone on to have   incredible comic careers.\nThis is a must for any NINJA HIGH SCHOOL or manga fan.\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\nAs with any crowd funding campaign there are risks involved with the production and delivery of the rewards.

Please click HERE to go to the page, and please keep sharing the news by sharing the link: https://bit.ly/simoneandajaxgogo\nFun! The world needs more fun these days, and \"Simone & Ajax\" are back in 4 all-new, wacky adventures. The collection, titled \"Lemmings and Tigers and Bears! Oh, My!,\" is available in both print and digital editions, brought to you by Eisner and Inkwell-award winner and Hugo and Harvey-nominee creator/writer/artist, me, Andrew Pepoy. With over 30 years in comics, you may know me better for my work on Fables, The Simpsons, The X-Men, Red Sonja, Doctor Who, Archie, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many more comics for DC, Marvel, IDW, Dark Horse, Archie, and others. However, my favorite thing I've ever done is my own creation, \"The Adventures of Simone and Ajax.\" Simone, a fun-loving, 20-something girl, and her best pal, Ajax, a small, green dinosaur, first appeared 30 years ago and have since appeared in many comics and been nominated for the Harvey Award for Special Award for Humor. My true comics love is Simone & Ajax. I'm very excited to make new tales of them, and I'm asking for your help to do that. Described by a reviewer as \"...like the best issues of Cerebus, and a mood that harkens Bone,\" and by a reader as \"...the look of an Archie comic but the sensibilities of a Marx Brothers movie,\" in this 128-page book there will be tales of pirates... \n...the Old West...\n ... vampires and werewolves, and the always popular \"hardboiled\" Ajax, Private Eye...\nThe covers for digital issues #3 and #4\n ... plus lots of lemmings! \n Of the book's 128 pages, over 100 pages will be new comics, along with a collection of other Simone & Ajax artwork, such as covers and Christmas cards, some never seen by the general public, all wrapped in a new cover. As of the launch date, all the new comics are written and thumbnailed, about 60% are drawn, and over 50 pages are colored, with digital colors supplied by the colorist of the previous series, Jason Millet (Archie vs Predator). While a few images are here on this page (and I'll be adding more as finished), I want you to have a better idea what you're getting, so you can read previews of some of the stories at the Simone & Ajax webpage by clicking HERE. \n I need your help to get us over the fun-ish line, so I can pay Jason (He has mouths to feed!), pay for printing, and get it out to you connoisseurs of fine and fun comics. Thank you in advance for your support in any form. A message of support is wonderful! I really need help getting the word out, so sharing this on Facebook or other social media among your friends and even the enemies you think would like it would be a huge help. But the most direct way you can support me and my comics making is to pledge! I have a number of levels and rewards for you to choose from. I know times are tough for many, so anything will be greatly appreciated. Want to send a buck or two to just support the cause? Thank you! Want the digital edition? Thank you! Or get the standard paperback? Thank you! There are also Mystery Boxes! Every box will contain the new book, a variety of other books/comics/etc. that I love, and some kind of art drawn by me, with one person getting a published pin-up worth $200. \nLeft: Just some of the books and comics I have set aside for the Mystery Boxes. Right: Some of the roughs, sketches, and art that will be in every Mystery Box.\n There are art rewards, where you can get a drawing of a character of your choice or even the original, hand-drawn art for one of the covers of the 4 digital issues. I have never sold a piece of published Simone & Ajax art in all the 30 years of the series, so this is a very rare chance to get not only Simone & Ajax art, but a cover at that! \n Or want art of dinosaurs of a different kind? I have art from my recent Dinosaucers mini-series, and you can choose from a random interior page or a specific cover.  \nExamples of interior \"Dinosaucers\" pages by Andrew Pepoy, sent randomly, available as rewards.\n And now new Art Rewards added! My last two \"Archie\" covers! My last \"Doctor Who\" cover and \"Katy Keene\" pin-up! \"Die Kitty Die\" Pages pencilled and inked by me! And more!\nWant a more personal experience? I'm offering one-on-one, via video,  portfolio reviews, where I'll go over your work with you and try to help you to be a better artist. Or if you're in the Chicago area, or willing to travel here, let's have lunch and talk comics or whatever! Want to get a combination of rewards not listed here? Just message me, and let's see what we can make happen. All cover art purchases and some other art purchases get their books with a signature and doodle (see reward descriptions). If you wish to add a signature or signature/doodle to a physical reward level that doesn't already include that, you now have the option to add-on those after you choose your reward. The add-on option will appear, and you may add the signature for an additional $5 or signature and doodle for $10. I'll deliver to you the 4 digital issue downloads along the way, so you have the fun comics to read while waiting for the finished book. The 1st issue is done, so I hope to have that PDF to you about a month after the campaign ends and another issue roughly each month after that.\nIf we meet our first goal, I have several stretch goals in mind. The first couple will help get you a better book (upgrade to hardcover for all physical backers at no extra cost to you!) and then some other extras and bonuses, like prints, stickers, and more! I also have some surprises during the campaign for what I'm calling incentive goals, so let's see what fun extras we can do by meeting and beating the goal.\nIf you have any questions at all, I'm here to answer them because I want you to feel good about choosing to help me. I know I'm asking something of all of you, to put your faith in me and in a book you can't yet get your hands on, but I hope my 30 years of reliably making comics will help you trust me to finish and get this to you as soon as possible. We all know the world needs more fun, so I thank you in advance for helping me bring some jokes, silliness, lemmings (lots of lemmings!), and adventure to you and others. Simone & Ajax thank you, too! \nAndrew Pepoy has worked for U.S., Canadian, British, and French publishers on hundreds of comics on such characters and titles as The Simpsons, Fables, Batman, The X-Men, Iron Man, Star Wars, Wallace & Gromit, Scooby Doo, Betty & Veronica, Lanfeust, Uncle Scrooge, and many more over the last 30 years. In 2000 Andrew redesigned Little Orphan Annie and drew the newspaper strip for the next year, and in 2005 he brought his knack for retro glamour with a modern twist to writing and drawing a revival of the classic Archie Comics character, Katy Keene. Since 1990 he has written and drawn many stories of his own Harvey Award-nominated creation, The Adventures of Simone & Ajax, which has been collected in book form by IDW and Andrew's own imprint, Spicy Tomato Studios. Nominated several times, Andrew won an Eisner Award in 2009 and has also won an Inkwell Award and been nominated for the Harvey and Hugo Awards. He lives in Chicago. His recent work includes drawing a Dinosaucers mini-series for Lion Forge, inking the 50th Anniversary graphic novel adaptation of the The Beatles' Yellow Submarine for Titan, inking various Simpsons comics for Bongo Comics, art for MAD Magazine, a run as guest artist on the Dick Tracy newspaper comic strip, inking and drawing Die Kitty Die for Astrocomics, and drawing covers for Doctor Who, Archie vs. Predator II, Red Sonja, Lady Death, and other titles.\nJason Millet (project colorist) is an illustrator, storyboard artist, and comic artist. He has provided storyboards and concept art for films and television for NBC-Universal, Sony, Disney, Fox, HBO, and Amazon among others. He has also produced a wide range of artwork for a long list of advertising clientele and publishers. He resides in Chicago with his lovely wife and daughter.

They crashed on what appeared to be prehistoric earth. We quickly learned that this is no ordinary world. With no memory of who they are or where they came from, they must travel through this magical place full of mysteries and threats. Almost 10 years later, the adventure continues. Follow our 3 heros as they journey through different worlds, fighting new threats while trying to discover the truth about who they are and how to get home. \n\nHere\u2019s a little sneak of one of the page\u2019s.\nWe are very excited to bring you our first book in the bew Dragonfly series. \nAlmost 2 years ago I acquired the IP from turtle legend Jim Lawson. Now we have a team full of great talent. Chris Vance is doing all the art for Dragonfly. I knew from day one I had to bring Chris on board. Once I had the artist down I needed a colorist. Ive alway loved Beejay Hawns art. So I asked her to join the team. With Chris\u2019 art and Beejay colors, you\u2019re going to get a beautiful book. Dragonfly #1 is going to be 24 pages in full color.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to add on covers. * click on \u201cmanage pledge\u201d click \u201cchange pledge\u201d adjust the amount.

She can take on a bolt of lightning, end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and finally land herself in a bizarre jungle adventure.  Welcome to The Way-Out Life of Riley, where she confronts them all in the goofiest and most heroic, Riley sort of way. \nOne of the many promotional sketches by Jeff Shultz\nJeffs pencils from an upcoming story\n\n\n\n WHO WE ARE: THE CREATORS \nJeff Shultz is well known for his incredible volume of work on Archie\u2019s Betty and Veronica, along with others, including Peanuts, Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry.\nRich Maurizio has been involved with an assortment of classic characters, including Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, Animaniacs and Underdog, as well as producing comics based on classic TV shows: The Munsters, I Dream of Jeannie and Mister Magoo\u2019s Christmas Carol.\nBoth Jeff and Rich realized they wanted to develop their own creator owned projects. Jeff said \u201cI have these ten pages of a story I did about a girl named Riley. Rich looked at the pages, thought they were great, and said \u201d Okay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll share the writing and art. Jeff does pencils and Rich will do most of the inks.\nWith both being huge fans of the silver age teen humor books, we thought the best way to approach this was to write the series in that style\nWe wanted to take the characters on unusual adventures. We're writing our stories where the characters could be old-time detectives in one story, and in the next be something from mythology. \nWe then brought on Glenn Whitmore to color the covers and stories. Glenn has contributed colors to DC\u2019s Superman and the infamous Death of Superman series, along with Archie, Super Suckers and others for Sitcomics, and Die Kitty Die for Astro Comics. \nOUR CAST OF CHARACTERS\n OUR GOAL  \nOur goal is to produce the series through the imprint Funny Book Institute (FBI) and then compile the first three 32 pg issues into a trade paperback with an all new story.  We believe we can  meet and surpass this realistic goal, with remaining funds put towards covering production costs and funding of the book. We'll be introducing some exciting stretch goals once we meet our initial objective. \n We intend on launching another campaign for the Way Out Life of Riley after the first issue. We\u2019ll keep producing Riley books and other creative titles as long as we meet our goals.\nCONTRIBUTOR \nAnd speaking of being a  contributor, you will receive a book along with some incredible perks, including original Archie covers from Jeff\u2019s personal collection. We\u2019ll be doing limited art pieces, sketch covers, signed editions, and will offer a stunning set of Space Girl prints signed by Jeff. We are firm believers in all ages comics, and we love and believe that there can be all forms of genres in this industry.  \nSet of two very familiar space girls by Jeff Shultz. These two prints measure 11 x 17 and come signed. This is one of the many perks for this campaign.\nArt by Jeff Shultz\nOriginal art covers signed and illustrated by Jeff Shultz for the low price of $200 each.\n          Covers listed in rewards  Betty &  Archie, Pizza Delivery\n.  \n   Covers listed in rewards Betty Running, Jughead bowling.\nArt by Rich Maurizio\nWAYS YOU CAN HELP\nIf you can\u2019t make a contribution, please share this campaign on social media and let people know about our venture. \nThank you and let the fun begin!\nWERE FUNDED!!!! THANK YOU ONTO STRETCH GOALS\nOur 5K stretch goal: a stunning print of ? and Riley for everyone and it will ship with the book. The print will be signed by both Jeff and Rich.

Dave Garcia  and Monica Sharp here, and welcome to our \u201cThe Chronicles of Panda Khan: Chapter 1\" campaign. \nTwo years ago, our friend, artist Mickey Clausen of San Diego, suggested it was time to bring back our sf/fantasy Panda Khan series, only this time as full color comics. He volunteered to re-ink all the issues (and remove all the zip a tone), computer color them and re-letter them, so we happily agreed. \nWhile doing all this work, Mickey put us together with his good friend Jon Bryans over at Gaelstone Media, and after signing with them, we now have a Panda Khan Animated cartoon in development. Visit Panda Khan the Animated Series page on Facebook for more info.       \n So, with the renewed interest in Panda Khan, and because many of you might have missed our original black and white \u201cThe Chronicles of Panda Khan\u201d series from back in the mid 80\u2019s, we wanted to make sure you had a chance at grabbing a copy of this exciting series for yourselves only this time in FULL COLOR.\nWhat you get in Chapter 1 ...\nThe story opens with geneticists manning a research station on the distant planet Da Tu in charge of repopulating Earth Colonies with endangered and extinct animals, long absent on the planet Earth. But this one outpost is led by scientists who have taken their assignment a few steps further. P'an Ku, the project director, is teaching his panda bears sign language. And his rival, Shibo, has diabolical plans for all the animals being cloned and restored. The AI computer has developed a personality as a minor deity and is teaching the pandas mythology while building his own underground hive worker army.\nTo celebrate the return of Panda Khan to comics we are reprinting the original black and white series from 1986, in FULL COLOR. Chapter One will be a 48 page graphic novel, reprinting the 1st issue of Panda Khan and will also contain an 8 page story, \u201cDragon's Hide\u201d, of a young Panda Khan, which was originally printed as a back up story in \u201cUsagi Yojimbo #21\" published in 1990.\nAs a special bonus we have added an 8 page origin story of an all new ARCH NEMESIS for Panda Khan. This will be his 1st appearance in the Panda Khan universe. You will be able to get a first glimpse of his new ARCH NEMESIS when we reveal two \"Virgin\" covers, one by Dave Garcia and one by Mickey Clausen.\nUPDATE: for those ordering a physical copy of the new trade, please choose which of the following prints you want: https://www.facebook.com/originalpandakhan/posts/1597120927124246\n Creative Team...      \n DAVE GARCIA has been the Co-creator, artist, and cover artist on Panda Khan since its inception.

But with the arrival of Dr. Ashley Reese things change. Patient 27 begins to remember who he once was in what seems like another life. But there is more to Patient 27 than anyone knows, he is incredibly strong and nothing seems to bale to harm him. Together Dr. Reese and Patient 27 begin to unlock the doors to his dark past and soon discover some secrets should stay hidden. \nChapter Two: The Chase\nPatient 27 (Tim) and Reese begin a quest to discover his true identity. Before too long they are caught in the crosshairs of Watts and the agents of Project Sampson. Separated, Reese learns the dark truth about Tim from his former student Marco. Tim\u2019s superhuman endurance and strength come from an experiment to save his life, but that salvation cost Tim everything.\nChapter Three: The Final Chapter\nWith the release of From Blood: Chapter Three the story is now complete. This third issue contains an epic climax that sees Patient 27 finally facing death. Dr. Reese has fallen in love with this mysterious man, but time is running out to tell him as Project Sampson is bearing down on them. Marco finally reveals the secret he\u2019s been hiding all these years, he has much to atone for \u2026 if he can live long enough to do so.\n The Collection\nTogether all three chapters of From Blood clock in at just over 70 pages of non stop action and intrigue. This series was created by James Whynot & Zach Bassett with a story by Whynot, Bassett and Martin Pierro. The pencils for this epic series were provided by Zach Bassett with inks by James Whynot and Kenneth Leinaar and colors by Victorino Muyo Jr.\nAll three issues are available in this Kickstarter campaign, with their standard covers and their highly limited Blood Foil covers. If you have already purchased Chapter One & Two there are tiers for you just to get that final chapter.\nStretch Goals\nThank you to everyone who backed this project and got us fully funded in 5 days! It is so greatly appreciated. Without hesitation we set the first Stretch Goal at $1,800 \u2026 and quickly passed that, so now everyone who pledged for a \"physical reward\" (anything non-digital) will receive a brand new From Blood Bookmark. featuring the awesome cover artwork from Chapter Three. \n Our next Stretch Goal was at the $2,000 level and is a very special reward indeed. Zach Bassett (writer/artist) and Martin Pierro (writer) will sit down and record an Audio Commentary for the entire series - three chapter = three commentaries. They will go step by step explaining their choices for each major turn in the story, giving a behind the scenes look at the creative process. This bonus reward has been unlocked.\n Our third Stretch Goal will be unlocked if/when we cross the $2,500 mark and this one will add value to the third and final chapter of From Blood. We will add more pages to that third chapter in the form of an art gallery featuring never before seen artwork from and inspired by this epic series. But this will only happen if the campaign passes the $2,500 mark. \n \"A WILD ADVENTURE\" - Travis Gibb\nComic book author (Broke Down and 4 Dead Bodies) Travis Gibb recently reviewed issues 1 & 2 of From Blood saying that  \"the book is a wild adventure, if you like old school action star movies ... this is the book for you.\" -  Read his full review by clicking -HERE!\nTake a peak behind the cover of Chapter Three ...\nFrom Blood: Chapter Three - Pages 13 & 14\nAs with the previous issues, at the launch of this Kickstarter all of the production work is finished for this final chapter. Meaning once this campaign is complete we will send the files off to the printer and quickly get the final product delivered to you. Both the Chapter One campaign and the Chapter Two campaign were fulfilled on schedule, this campaign will be no different.\nPLAY\n\nThe Team  \nNEW REWARD TIER FOR RETAILERS! \nAs the campaign is nearing its end we are offering an incredible deal for our retailer friends. You can score 15 sets of this incredible series before it is available through any other distribution channel. We\u2019re talking a $195 retail value at half of the cover price - $97.00. We are offering these sets to retailers at pretty much what the printing cost is, to do what we can to support our struggling retailer partners as they are finally able to welcome customers back into their stores. To show our support, we will aggressively promote any retailer that backs at this reward tier through our social media outlets to try and drive as much business as we can through their doors. As an added bonus if any comic store in the state of Florida backs this project at this reward tier - writer/publisher Martin Pierro will come and do a signing in that shop.\nThe Rewards", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the THIRD issue of From Blood that we are funding through Kickstarter, the first two were both successes and delivered to all the backers right on schedule.

I then found out that direct donations of funds from a Kickstarter are against their rules. Ugh! https://www.kickstarter.com/rules. I'd still very much like to help though, so instead I'll be putting links on the Tinto Press website to the CDP COVID Response Fund. Anyone making a donation will get a 30% discount on books from the Tinto store. Thanks for your understanding.\nThis Kickstarter will go towards covering the cost of print production. With your support, we can make this a successful venture and continue to provide quality comics with depth, meaning, and value!\nTinto Press is a Denver-based publisher of independent comics and graphic novels. We\u2019re interested in literary comics with an eye to good storytelling and a focus on reality-based genres. If you haven't heard of Tinto Press books, you can check them out at https://TintoPress.com. \nSo let me tell you about the new line of books we\u2019re funding with this Kickstarter.\nThe Cats of Ostia Antica by Julian Brier \nDownload the FREE sampler here, and see the animated cover here.\nThe Cats of Ostia Antica\nAn old Italian fellow\u2019s fantastic journey to the afterlife as he\u2019s escorted by spirits that take the form of cats. This is a silent comic; that is, it has no word balloons or captions yet it manages to tell the story with extreme clarity and really heightens the spooky quality. It\u2019s 110 pages of full-color spectacle and the scale and grandeur of the images grow with each panel. \n Goiter#5 by Josh Pettinger\nDownload the FREE sampler here. and see the Animated cover here.\nGoiter #5\nThis book is perfect for Tinto Press and I\u2019m really excited to be bringing it to you. It\u2019s quirky, incredibly unique, and the stories and art are great. Josh is a master at making the ordinary seem weird and uncomfortable as well as funny. If you enjoy books from artists like Seth, Box Brown or Chris Ware, you\u2019re going to love this book. It\u2019s a 36-page comic we\u2019re putting out there in the hopes that we can produce it as a regular, ongoing series.\n So, Buttons #11 by Jonathan Baylis\nSo, Buttons #11 This an example of an earlier issue.\nthis is an example from an earlier issue\nthis is an example from an earlier issue\nFollowing in the footsteps of Harvey Pekar, Jonathan writes comics about real life that are both funny and relatable. This ongoing series carves out soulful slices of his reality and remarks compellingly on bits of culture, Also in the spirit of Pekar, he\u2019s employed some great artists to bring his stories to life: Fred Hembeck, T.J. Kirsch, and Summer Pierre just to name a few.\n The HairPair by Charlie LaGreca Velasco \nThe Hair Pair\nCharlie is a seasoned comics professional who has worked for major companies like DC, Nicolodean, and Lego. Hair Pair is the hit kids comic he created for Disney Adventures Magazine and will be collected here for the first time. It\u2019s two hamsters, working it out in their habitrail world. The cute factor is off the charts on this one and there\u2019s a Bert and Ernie quality to it that\u2019s fun for adults as well as kids. If you\u2019re familiar with Charlie\u2019s work, or you\u2019re into adorable fuzzy animals, you don\u2019t want to miss out on this one. It's currently 48 pages of full color with the potential for more content when we hit our goals.\nDowntown: A Portrait of the Denver Skyline, by Karl Christian Krumpholz\n Download the FREE sampler here, and see the animated cover here.\nDowntown (Not Final Cover)\nKarl creates visually stunning documentation of life in the big city with his ongoing comic, 30 Miles of Crazy.

Home to some of the most interesting and historically significant architecture in the US, Karl has interpreted the Mile-High structures, in his own inimitable style and with a detail and personality that reflect his intense interest in urban landscape.

We'll meet the forces that abducted her, and we'll see the part they played in her past! And of course, there's plenty of action...and romance! If you like science fiction, you'll love our new series! If if you DON'T love science fiction, we think you'll love it!\n\nCheck out J Bone's beautiful cover for our trade!\nBut of course, many of Kitty's old crowd returns! Little Satan, Derek, Katty, and of course everyone's favorite kid corpse, Dippy the Dead Kid are back! We'll see Kitty trying to get back to Earth, but there are forces in the galaxy trying to get rid of her. And the same forces on Earth that want to see the end of Kitty too. How will Kitty survive battling the UNIVERSE? She's a survivor, but this is ridiculous!! \nAfter 3 successful DKD series, we are determined to keep the fun going! And we think this is the most fun series yet! And we are still inspired to have a series that reminds us of the fun comics we liked to read as kids.  She's survived her earthly enemies and even the afterlife! What forces in the Universe will try and bring her down?  Well, there's more fun and satire than ever!  Our kickstarter backers have been a close knit family to us, and we value your input too!  We hope we can count on our very loyal and generous fans to make this the best DKD series ever!\nWe hope to follow the basic model of our first three series,  with a four issue storyline that we will initially release as individual PDF issues. As before, each individual issue will feature twenty pages of original story and art plus fashion pages, funny ad pages, pin-ups, variant covers and other added material. We will be handling a lot of the writing and drawing ourselves but much of this additional material will be completed by some of our talented friends and colleagues in the comic industry. Later, these issues will be collected into one softcover trade paperback and as per our last campaigns. Our goal is to collect enough funding to be able to make the softcover trade into a hardcover with a dust jacket.We've been lucky enough to achieve this goal in all 3 of our previous campaigns!\nOnce again, we are planning on a number of stretch goals to make this project better and better. We are hoping to add bonus material such as an additional exclusive story by the Andrew Pepoy, and beautiful spreads  by the awesome J Bone. J. Bone will also be handling the art for our trade collection ! We'll also be featuring the talents of Glenn Whitmore , Scott Mcrae and Bill Golliher too! In addition to these fun additions, we've got some really cool stuff planned! If other goals are met, we hope to do a JETTA : the Space Girl one-shot, that would be available digitally and in print! We'll also be \"adding on\" extras along the way, that you can add to your pledge . \n\n\nA main stretch goal will be a beautiful slipcase that holds the first 3 DKD hardcovers. You can order the whole triology with the slipcase, or if you already own the first 3 books, you can just order the slipcase separately. It's a great way to display your DKD books on your shelf. \nThis beautiful slipcase will be available if we hit our 35k goal! It holds the first 3 hardcover editions!\n\nThroughout the campaign, we'll be  listing all kinds of cool things you can add to your rewards.

The reception to our first Die Kitty Die book has been hugely successful even being picked up in comic shops to expand our audience. We'd like to point out to everyone that despite this great good fortune, producing Kitty still falls to us. We still produce the series through our own imprint, Astrocomix. We creatively control everything. This is what brings us to Kickstarter. We can't do it alone. As you might imagine producing four complete issues of original story and art takes a lot of manpower and resources. We have our impressively talented team of inkers, letterers, colorists and others that we must hire and pay. We also have other costs such as printing, shipping and many other miscellaneous expenses that we need to cover ourselves. In fact, this time we'll be hiring outside fulfillment, so that the packages are sent out without delay so you get them promptly. We can't do this without the very generous help of our very kind and loyal fans and supporters. We were deeply appreciative and touched by the phenomenal amount of support we were shown throughout our first campaign and even afterwards. Making an independent creator-owned and driven project like Die Kitty Die has been our dream since long before either of us ever got into this business. We couldn't make that dream happen without your help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "SINGLE PDF REWARD", "descp": "SINGLE PDF REWARD: Get a PDF of issue #1 of 4 from the \"DIE KITTY DIE: STARSTRUCK!\" collected trade", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "FOUR PDF REWARD", "descp": "FOUR PDF REWARD: Get all 4 issues that will comprise DIE KITTY DIE: STARSTRUCK's collected trade IN PDF FORMAT.

For years he has kept silent \u2026 a hulking indestructible mountain of a man, but after a visit from Doctor Reese ... the door has been opened and all hell breaks loose. This first chapter sets the stage and ramps up the action as the mysterious Patient 27 goes on a rampage through the Grove Mental hospital. Together Doctor Reese and 27 will face death in the epic climax of the first chapter.\nNOW the From Blood story continues \u2026\nEscaping the Grove Mental Institute was only the beginning for Patient 27. Separated from Doctor Reese, 27 is taken in by a sinister group looking to exploit his strength and invulnerability. But Doctor Reese is not alone, she encounters a mysterious man from 27s past \u2026 who just might hold the key to his future. It\u2019s an action packed race towards destiny in this exciting second chapter. \nWe are seeking funding for From Blood Chapter Two a 24 page comic written by Zach Bassett, myself and James Whynot with art by Zach and inks by Kenneth Leinaar. Rounding out the creative is E.T. Dollman on letters and Victorino Mendoza Muyo Jr. providing the colors.\nIf you missed out on chapter one \u2026 we have reward tiers to get you caught up on all of the action.

Or a racist?\nAnd, if somebody stopped you, what would that make them? \nHey everyone! R. Alan here, giving you the low-down on Anguish Garden, and what we're trying to do with this campaign. Hopefully, you dug our video. It's a good intro to our story, but here's the basics:\nWHAT IT IS:\nA Western, set in the near future, told in 70 pages. \nIt will be printed as a soft-cover book. This is book 1 of 3.\nWritten by R. Alan, featuring layout art by Kevin Caron, pencil/ink art by Dailen Ogden, and coloring by Sarah Menzel Trapl.\n\nWHAT IT'S ABOUT:\nAfter a failed alien invasion, Zola tracks people infected by an incurable virus, and sends them to a quarantine called Anguish Garden. But when a war veteran sabotages her efforts, Zola has to find out why.\nYou can read a free 7 page preview HERE, or by clicking the picture below.\n In this story, we're exploring a character who believes she's doing something heroic. She's trying to save healthy humans, so she hunts \"infected\" people who show no symptoms, based solely on the word of government-appointed doctors. \nThis is similar to some people raised within White supremacy, who believe that most other human beings are a threat that they need to be saved from. \nABOUT ME:\nI wrote a graphic novel called The Burning Metronome, and I write a weekly newspaper comic called What'd I Miss? \nI'm a professor for Regis University's Creative Writing MFA Program, teaching graphic novel writing. \nI host a podcast, focusing on unheard voices in the geek world, called Mother F**ker In A Cape.\nMY GOALS:\nTO PAY 3 ARTISTS FOR 7 MONTHS OF WORK\nTO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL BOOK\nPRINT IT\nDISTRIBUTE IT\nPrinting 1000 of these books will cost about $8000. The remaining amount is to pay 3 artists for 7 months of work, and to cover expenses associated with finishing & distributing the book (Kickstarter fees, shipping, taxes, rewards, etc.).\nWHAT WE NEED FROM YOU:\nMake a pledge.\nShare this Kickstarter, and encourage your friends to pledge.\nEnjoy your rewards!\n====================================================\nNow I'm going to tell you why this book is important to me:\nI read a book, Rising Out of Hatred: The Awakening of a Former White Nationalist, which was about a young man's journey out of White supremacy. I've often said that when it comes to \"isms\" (racism, sexism, ageism), they all come from one of two things:\n1. A failure to see the other person's humanity\n2. A refusal to see the other person's humanity\nFor people who refuse, they've made a choice, and probably can't be reached. But for people who are simply  failing, art can be a powerful way to learn about others' humanity.\nIn this story, I wanted to explore what it's like for a person who thinks they're doing the right thing - protecting their family and the people around them. What would it be like to discover that your own biases and prejudices are making YOU the monster - that you've imagined these threats and hurt people because of it?\nThat's the story underneath the story, so to speak. \nOn the exterior, Zola's just a bad-ass with a pistol, who enforces the law, so that's going to make for some exciting action moments. You'll see one of those in the 7 page preview that we've finished.\nSo, despite the heavy underlying themes, this is made to be a fun read, and I'm thrilled about the artists who are working with me on it. You can learn more about them in the 3 minute video!\nThank you so much,\nR.

I've done many Kickstarters and I've tried to give my backers something new and better each time. With this one though, I really am offering a thing that I never have done previously. \nIt's color. Recently, I tried to sit down and figure out how many pages of comic art that I've done in my career. The best, closest I could come up with is somewhere around 6000 pages. In that body of work, only a very, very few pages were published in color and certainly nothing within the past 20-25 years. \nAnyhow, these 2 comics are my first color self-published works. The coloring in these books is petty amazing, and has been in process for the past 2 years- in preparation for this campaign. The colorist, Dmitry Bobrovnik, I owe a huge debt of gratitude, for actually sticking with and finishing all 240 pages of art and doing it all on spec. Now it's time to get him paid. \nLet me introduce you to the members of The Box City Wallops.\nThis is an early cover image for the TPB. I'm not gonna use this one- I've decided on something different.\nWayne is the big brother, and the muscle of the group. He has a serious nature, and some people might even call him moody, yet there is a side to him that enjoys one-liners and sarcastic quips. His abilities include smashing and crushing, stomping, etc.\nNext is middle sister Nola Root. Tough, stern- she is the product of her military training. Her preferred weapon is a sword yet she is proficient in all manner of weaponry as well as various martial arts and hand to hand combat. She struggles occasionally in her new role as protector and her past continues to haunt her.\nLast- baby brother Zaso. A technical genius, his favorite tool is the mysterious N-Box, a device he himself constructed. With the appearance of a cell phone, the N-Box has a multitude of capabilities, many of which are known only to its creator.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Wallops are not \"exposure enhanced\" superheroes, or individuals who have gotten their powers through artificial means, as is the norm in the world of this comic. Rather they are of an alien race where all DNA is mixed naturally within the mother, to produce offspring of varying physical characteristics and abilities. This race is known as the Mergenetix- or Merge. In this race, what is normal and expected is that siblings will share no (or very little) likeness to one another.\nPresently on Earth, the Wallops have the role as guardians and defenders of Box City and its residents. In the scenario I have put forth in this comic, teams of superheroes are hired and compensated for their services. Also- cities have one dedicated team that represents that particular market. Modeled loosely after sports teams one could think of it as that- however there is no inter-team league or competition between teams. For example in this first story arc we have our guys- The Box City Wallops and the neighboring city's Miracle City Killocrats.\nThe Book(s).\nThe Box City Wallops actually began life in 2016, and was originally a self-published, Kickstarter exclusive, black and white comic. There were 2 issues (1 and 2) and for those of you that backed that campaign, those same 2 issues are reprinted in this volume, although of course now in color. At that time, my intention was to print all the issues singly, but when that didn't work out I reevaluated my idea and decided that a color trade paperback would be the way to go. \nTo be clear, there will be 2 books I'm making available here. The first book will be the trade paperback. It will be 210 pages and will combine the first 7 issues of The Box City Wallops in one volume. \nCover image for the BCW trade paperback.\nThe second book presented here will be a 48 page bonus story- The Happiness Creature. Also color, this bonus comic will be available with 5 covers created exclusively for this project and offered only here. Please be aware here that I consider my cover the main cover and in addition to that there will also be the 4 variants- total 5. \nMy cover for the 48 page solo color comic.\nShawn McManus's variant cover for the solo book- awesome!\nThe beautiful and sexy Nola Root is figured prominently on Mike Dooney's variant cover- wow!\nThe amazing Kevin Eastman contributed this dark and striking variant cover. Colors by Steve Lavigne.\nLast but not Least, the super-talented Ben Bishop contributed this cheery and upbeat cover image of the Wallops enjoying the company of the Happiness Creature.\n4 randomly selected pages from the solo 48 page issue offered with this Kickstarter- THE HAPPINESS CREATURE. Colors by Dmitry Bobrovnik.\nOriginal Art Rewards\nOriginal art 01: Box City Wallops group shot. The drawing measures 12w x 11h inches.\nOriginal art 02: Wallops jumping group shot. The image measures 14w x 17h inches.\nOriginal art 03: This image was the original to BCW number 1. It was printed (along with issue 2) in a previous Kickstarter. The art measures 13w x 16h inches.\nOriginal art 04: This was going to be the cover for this campaign's solo issue- The Happiness Creature. Obviously, I changed my mind and went with something else. It measures 11w x 15.5h inches.\nOriginal art 05: This was going to be a cover- like an Ultimate cover. I change my mind often when I do covers, and that was the case here. The image measures 17w x 11.25h inches.\nOriginal art 06: Once again, a cover that was not used. Still, a cool drawing showing the Wallops in action. Please know that this is drawn on 2 separate sheets and is not one continuous image (note the line). The art is 10w x. 15h inches (x2).\nOriginal art 07: I don't recall what I did this for other than the fun of drawing my characters. The image measures 17w x 14h inches.\nOriginal art 08: Another wacky drawing, but this one's got a motorcycle in it so it makes it extra cool IMO. The art measures 17w x 14h inches.\nOriginal art 09: I love this image- I don't know quite why but sometimes when you finish a drawing it speaks to you in a special way, and this one does for me. It is also the cover image for the trade paperback offered here. I'm gonna price it crazy for those reasons. It measures 10.5w x 15.5h inches.\n As is my usual practice when I do a Kickstarter, the art is all done. The files for the colored pages have just been sent to me a few days ago and they are awesome, so that part is done as well. There should be no long delays waiting for the hard work to be finished- only the period it takes to wrap up the pre-production and the time to actually get it printed. In my hope that the campaign will be successful, I've begun designing the interiors of the book and trying to get all my ducks in a row. Again, if you decide to help fund this project, please know that it won't be a long wait between the close of the campaign and when I can get books in people's hands. \nComics are the most perfect form of storytelling- combining words and sequential art. They are not just for nerds and geeks and kids. They are totally legit and I'm an extremely lucky person to have worked in this field for so long. Thanks for checking out my campaign and I appreciate your support. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my sixth Kickstarter campaign. I'm a little different than some folks running Kickstarters, in that I always already have the work done and everything basically ready to go, once the campaign is over.

Exclusive cover by Billy Tucci\nBLACK FRIDAY SPECIAL - REMARKED NOIR PRINT!\nKickstarter Exclusive Cover - SHI: Return of the Warrior!!!!!!!\nThere I was\u2026 \nArmed with a portfolio holding the very pages in this book and storming the floor of the 1993 Comic Con International in San Diego\u2026\nI was anxious.  I knew no one, but even though my heart was pounding through my chest at this \u201cone shot\u201d at comic book fame, I held a strong conviction that I could somehow scratch out a living in this fantastically creative industry.  Like many a budding cartoonist at this biggest of all conventions, I stood in long lines and when it was my turn to show my wares, opened my book hoping the bored and hung-over editor would awake from his stupor and look up at me wide-eyed like he\u2019d just made a great discovery\u2026  And offer me a job. \nSTRETCH GOALS!!!\n  (Please note: Stretch goals are distributed per backer)\nProblem was, that aside from Lady Death creator, Brian Pulido (who graciously offered me a pin up), no one was interested.  From the \u201cBig Two\u201d all the way down to the smallest of publishers, all turned me down -- every single one of them.  To say I was heartbroken would be a callous understatement, but I was undeterred.  I remember thinking to myself, on that long flight back home to New York, about a life of illustrating licensing products, or even going back to designing children\u2019s wear.  Perhaps I could go back to the National Guard.   Either way, I had to do something as I was incredibly broke and way behind in my rent.\nI put on my Sony \u201cdiscman\u201d (remember those?) and removed the portfolio from the aircraft\u2019s overheadstorage bin.  Listening to Kitaro\u2019s Kojiki, (which was the soundtrack I crafted up the \u201cWay of the Warrior\u201d story arc) I began thumbing through the book, critiquing each and every panel and determining which pages were good and which had to be redone.  My mindset was one of defiance as my train of thought was  \u201cI\u2019m not going to forget these pages and come back in six months with new material\u201d like I had been instructed by the editors.  I will keep them, improve upon them and move forward with \u201cmy story\u201d\u2026 the story of Ana Ishikawa and her monogatari titled, \u201cShi.\u201d  I was going to self-publish comic books.\nBilly Tucci - Creator\nAnd that, pretty much, is how it all started.  Of course the next six months were utterly painful, but so exciting, as I delved into researching - just how in the hell does one \u201cself-publish?\u201d  This was before the internet, so I hit every library, read every book and bothered every retailer who would speak to me, trying to figure out just how to do this.  All the while, I worked freelance design by day and sharpened the Shi pages by night.   I \u201cemployed\u201d two great friends, co-writer Peter Gutierrez and designer Barry Orkin, with my ever-suffering wife (then ever-suffering girlfriend), Deborah to refine the script and define the artwork.  There was much aggravation, missteps, late hours and fear \u2013 at one point I almost sold half the creation to a pair of predatory business \u201cpartners\u201d, but that\u2019s a story for a different day.  There were also triumphs -- none so gratifying as March 23, 1994 \u2013 the day, \u201cShi \u2013 The Way of the Warrior #1\u201d shipped to comic shops across North America and Europe, making the anxious drama that seemed to daunt its creation every step of the way all well worth it.\nAs they say, from that day forward, things have never been the same.  And it\u2019s all because of my friends, family, retailers and most of all, you \u2013 the reader.  Especially those of you who, for some reason or another, chose my book among hundreds that day in 1994, and for that I am forever grateful.  \nSHI: Way of the Warrior #1, 1994\nSo join us for the first new Shi graphic novel in 15 years  ...  A story in which a comic book character has grown up in real time. ..

Ana is divorced from her husband, disgraced NYPD detective Peter DeNyse and now lives a peaceful, quiet existence raising their teenage daughter Hotaru.\nTeenager Hotaru Ishikawa and her mother, Ana\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior\nMost importantly, her warrior days far behind her\u2026\nBut that all changes when Dr. YOU (a character that will be named after one of our backers via a special pledge level) brings the terrifying news that Masahiro Arashi has escaped from a New York City Mental Institution. Her former antagonist, now suffering from dementia has regressed back to his younger more violent self and is vengefully obsessed with the one person responsible for his incarcerated existence\u2026 Ana Ishikawa!\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior page\nManhattan is once again gripped in fear as a series of gruesome copycat Shi Killings resurface \u2013 with the order of victims proving ever closer to Ana. A desperate Ana must now, alongside Dr. You, seek out and stop Arashi before he can fulfill his murderous destiny\u2026 a destiny whose road ends with her own daughter Hotaru.\nThe maddened Masahiro Arashi\nAs Doctor You and Ana get ever closer, he confesses to her of Arashi\u2019s twisted and dangerous obsession with the young Ana\u2019s secret warrior persona, SHI, the living embodiment of death.\nWorse still, the maddened Arashi is convinced that everyone: nurses, orderlies, janitors and especially the man treating him is in love with the lithe mistress of the underworld (Yomi). \nDr. \"You\" (to be named by one of our backers!)\nAna is mortified that the doctor is fully aware that she is indeed a murderess and knows that if ever exposed would rightly be the end of her world. But You assures her secret is safe and even though his own life is in danger, he promises to take it (due to both professional and personal reasons) \u201cto the grave.\u201d\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior\nBut the grave just might be waiting for them all. For Ana will realize that measured acumen only goes so far in protecting those you love and, once again, the lioness within Ana will resurface to take up her trusted naginata, transform the hunted into the hunter, and unsheathe\u2026 The Return of the Warrior.\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior\nIn Return of the Warrior, Shi creator Billy Tucci is joined by co-writer Steven Peros, co-artist Ricardo Silva, colorist HI-FI Colour Design, designer Mindy Lopkin and superstar cover artists Amanda Conner, Paul Mounts, Wes Hartman, Conny Valentina and Mike Renzine. \nOur Troops\nSpecial Guest Cover Artists!\nCover by Amanda Conner\nAnd as a very special bonus the legendary George Perez (colored by Wes Hartman) has gracefully come out of retirement to provide one last and unforgettably beautiful Shi cover. \nCover by George Perez\nPure Line Art Editions\nConny Valentina Cover Art\nGeorge Perez Original Cover Artwork for Shi: Return of the Warrior\nBilly Tucci's ORIGINAL AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #301 HOMAGE COVER ARTWORK!\nWith tons of fun reward levels for you to become the hero!!!!!\nChallenge Coins!\nSHI-Shirt\nCover by Mike Renzine", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are so grateful to the OUTSTANDING fans Shi has had these last 25 years and are so very appreciative of how patiently you all waited for the next chapter in the saga.

No one knows his real name \u2026 no one knows what secrets he\u2019s forgotten about. The only thing the staff knows is that he is an invincible monster to be avoided at all costs. After Patient 27 lashes out in a violent rage, Doctor Reese a new psychologist has a break through \u2026 then all hell breaks loose.\nTogether, Patient 27 and Doctor Reese begin a quest to unlock the secrets of the past and to understand why he seems to be indestructible. It\u2019s a race across the country as they try to stay one step ahead of the men looking to turn 27 into a weapon, but can 27 ever be more? It\u2019s an action packed voyage of discovery that you won\u2019t want to put down. \n Originally conceived as a black & white mini-series, From Blood is now a full color, perfect bound graphic novel, and we need your help bringing it to the world. Everyone has been working hard to get this book finished and with your support we can reward our team for their hard work and of course pay to print it.\nTake a peek behind the cover ...\n We are offering three different versions of the From Blood graphic novel to readers and collectors as well as a special version just for retailers and resellers.\n The \u201cEarly Backer Cover\u201d was only be available for the first 24 hours of the campaign, the \u201cStandard Cover\u201d is the \u201copen edition\u201d and the\u201cBlood Foil Cover\u201d will be limited to a print run of 60 units, maximum.\nOrder 25 or more units and a special edition of the From Blood Graphic Novel will be produced exclusively for your store! It will feature a Larry Watts cover with your store\u2019s logo printed on our main character\u2019s shirt. We will promote the books being available at your retail location through our website and social media accounts. These books will only ship to confirmed physical business addresses.\nThe From Blood Creative Team\n Almost Complete\nAt the launch of this Kickstarter, the Graphic Novel is nearly complete with all the writing, pencils, lettering and covers complete. Victor Muyo Jr. is more than just about halfway through adding his colors to the project. Meaning we are very close to having a deliverable product.  \nThe Rewards\n Just Added Reward Tier: The Cosmic Sampler includes digital samples of four of our books! This digital reward will be added to ALL backers who pledge $6.00 or more.\n The Money\nWe are running this campaign very tight to keep the reward tiers reasonable. The printing of the book will be a massive cost for us, so that is where the bulk of the funds will go. The rest of the money is going to pay the colorist who is diligently working to complete the project on time. Any other moneys raised will go to the original creative team and possibly help start funding the next project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the third project we are funding through Kickstarter, and the first two were both successfully funded and delivered.

It's a full-color, standard-size (6.625\" x 10.25\") floppy comic.  The first issue had 20 pages of story. Issue 2 and beyond will have 22 pages of story.\nFor this campaign, you'll be helping to fund the production of the artwork and first print run for Issue 2. Issue 1 is already complete. \nIt's set in a world similar to Roddenberry's Star Trek, but this ain't your granddaddy's Trek. There's action and adventure, set in a complex and realistic universe, with a three-dimensional characters who are solving mysteries while trying to uphold democracy and preserve peace in our small corner of the Milky Way. \nYou can expect a mix of salty humor, West Wing-esque debates, fast-paced adventure and confrontations with deadly enemies. The world is built out with diverse cultures and a rich history, but more than anything, it's the characters who will hook you in. They're so much fun to write \u2014 even I want to see what happens next.  \nThere are depictions of graphic violence and a few naughty words. No nudity. Recommended for ages 16 and older.\nIf you're just joining us, you can catch up easily by backing at a level that includes a digital or physical copy of Issue 1. \nThings you will learn in Issue 2: Saras has a party trick.  The enemy will be revealed. You'll get to know a bit more of the world, and more of the main characters will be introduced.\nOur story follows the crew of an insignificant fleet ship called the OAA Redstone, crewed by misfits in the space-based society known as the Orion Arm Authority, which has been at war with a savage alien superpower called the Ajex Imperium for nearly 30 years.  \nA jaded reporter (also an alien refugee trying to earn her Orion citizenship) named Saras Vedi gets embedded on the Redstone after an attack sets in motion an investigation into a new threat to the space-faring republic. \nOver time, she learns the ship is crewed by members of marginalized alien species trying to earn their Orion citizenship, not unlike herself. Reluctant to take the assignment at first, she soon learns the uniqueness of the ship\u2019s crew is its greatest strength. \nMeanwhile, the crew tries to figure out the origins of a mysterious human child. And looming in deep space is a legendary danger that could threaten to destroy both Orion and the Ajex.\nIssue 2 picks up right where the first issue left off, and continues the first six-issue arc \"All Roads.\" \nSaras fights to protect those who can't protect themselves, and a new enemy is revealed. Readers will also be introduced to new characters who serve aboard the Redstone.\nBACK EARLY: Backers who pledge within the first 48 hours will receive an exclusive patch! \nHere are the first few pages of Issue 1.  \nI'm Ryan Lessard, the creator and writer of the series. A longtime resident of Manchester, New Hampshire (shout out to my home store Double Midnight Comics!), I've been a local reporter for several years, and one time I got an award for investigative journalism. This is my first comic book. So far, I've written the first six-issue arc and I have outlined the next two arcs as well. And that's just the beginning! There are lots of surprises coming and I'm excited to share them with you. \nJethro Morales is the penciler and inker. He's a professional artist who has done work for major Dynamite titles and several other indie projects. He also has the voice of an angel. Check out some of his work at jetzun.deviantart.com. He lives in Manila, Philippines\nDash Martin is the colorist and a fantastic artist in his own right, having worked on several titles including some work for Marvel. You can check out his work at dashmartin.com. He partners often with Chris Campana (who is making the variant cover for SENTINEL #2) on books like First World, The Adventures of Parker Reef and Campana's latest book Chosen, which has a  Kickstarter here.

Over the next year we have six Gladstone\u2019s School for World Conquerors one-shots planned by guest creative teams. If these are successful, then we expect to do more. \nThe Gladstone\u2019s one-shots are going to be printed in the United States which will give us a faster turnaround and delivery time.  While the Hardcover books from China are beautiful, the wait from printing overseas has been holding us up.\nWe need to get Gladstone\u2019s out more regularly to our audience.\nOnce the first round of one-shots are printed, our strategy will be to hire more popular creative teams that already have a built-in audience to draw attention to our series and to build up our readership numbers. \nIf you are new to the Gladstone\u2019s School for World Conquerors Universe you can sign up for our mailing list and download a digital copy of our first 200 page graphic novel titled \u2018Super-Villainy 101. \nThe Kid Nefarious One-Shot is 32 pages and is written by Ryan Schrodt, illustrated by Matthew Weldon, colored by Rodrigo Aviles and lettered by Patrick Brosseau. The book is finished and ready to go to the printer. \nKID NEFARIOUS ONE-SHOT DESCRIPTION:\nAfter a failed test, Kid Nefarious is threatened with expulsion and given a second chance from Headmaster Ironsides.\nKid Nefarious must now embark on a wondrous quest he never signed up for...\nAs a Superhero and the protector of the halcyon city of Sunnybrook. \nKID NEFARIOUS ONE-SHOT PREVIEW PAGES:\nREWARD ITEMS TO GET NOW:\nKid Nefarious One-Shot\nGladstone's School for World Conquerors Volume 1 Hardcover\nGladstone's School for World Conquerors Volume 2 Hardcover\nGladstone's School for World Conquerors Book 3 Hardcover\nGladstone's School for World Conquerors 3 Book Set (Slipcase availability limited only while supplies last).\nTHE THREE BOOK SET:\nAbout Gladstone's School for World Conquerors:\nGladstone\u2019s School for World Conquerors is a Young Adult Graphic Novel series by Armand Villavert & Mark Smith about a top-secret academy for the children of the world's greatest Super Villains to learn their trade.\nEver wondered if Super Villains go to school? Ah, you assumed they were born with their special skills. Think again, in Gladstone\u2019s School for World Conquerors we find ourselves amidst the pinnacle of higher learning for the next generation of villains and masterminds honing their craft.\nThe school curriculum includes the usual suspects of \u201cpublic speaking\u201d and \u201cbiology and chemistry,\u201d and yet that\u2019s only superficial child\u2019s play. Classes like \u201cunleash your hypnotic potential\u201d, \u201cintergalactic battle strategy\u201d, and \u201cancient relics, spells & mystical arts\u201d are added stressors for straight-A students like Kid Nefarious and Mummy Girl.\nMock battles are unleashed to test their skills with the latest tools of the trade such as \u201corbs of tranquility\u201d or \u201cgrim reaper\u2019s breath.\u201d\nJoin Kid Nefarious, Mummy Girl, Martian Jones, The Speed Spectre, Ghost Girl, Man O' War, and the infamous Skull brothers unearth the School's and their parent's hidden past.\nPraise for Gladstone's:\n\"Mark Andrew Smith and Armand Villavert\u2019s tween superhero ongoing stood out as the kind of title Marvel or DC wish they had, but would never be possible at the Big Two. A superhero dramedy set at a school for aspiring supervillains, the series is founded on the concept that the ongoing war between heroes and villains is faked, putting a new spin on the parent-as-supervillain metaphor.\nThe students are waking up to the reality of their world, and the reader discovers with them, learning the dense mythology of Smith\u2019s story while experiencing the thrill of Villavert\u2019s kinetic artwork. Best of all, Gladstone\u2019s is a title appropriate for all readers, with characters that look and sound like kids, but a plot that any superhero fan can appreciate.\" - AV CLUB\n\"Mark Andrew Smith\u2019s tween-supervillain team is similar to the Runaways in that each member is pulled from a different corner of the superhero genre: a mummy, ghost, alien, etc. Smith\u2019s story puts a new spin on the super-school concept that has already been tried in films like Sky High and Zoom. Armand Villavert\u2019s sleek artwork would translate well to computer animation, and Smith\u2019s clearly defined yet whimsical cast makes Gladstone\u2019s a great fit for a studio like Pixar. The chance of a creator-owned superhero team launching a big-budget animated feature is slim, but if The Walking Dead can become the highest-rated show on cable, there\u2019s always hope.\" - AV CLUB\nMore Praise for Gladstone's:\nSmith\u2019s writing is fast-paced and warm, his characters rich enough to resonate with all ages of reader, and the character design and outsider edge of surreality recalls Peter Milligan\u2018s X-Statix, and likewise Villavert\u2019s pen explores the same subverted pop-art style of Mike Allred, albeit with the stylised touch of a Saturday morning cartoon.\" - Sci Fi Now\nAnd even more Praise for Gladstone's: \n\"We've been championing Gladstone's by Mark Andrew Smith and Armand Villavert since issue #1, but the last couple of issues have seen the series hit an early stride. In this installment, Smith plays with an enticingly fun and interesting take on superhero comics, challenging the notion of a hero's constant victory of his nemesis and how that would affect a child that is being educated in the ways of villainy.\nWatching Kid Nefarious and friends discover their parents losing over and over again in the pages of comic books (which are banned from Gladstone's, for these obvious reasons) is amazing. Gladstone's never talks down to kids and remains all-ages accessible. Better yet, they just might learn something about the tropes of superhero comics in the process.\nGladstone's continues to impress, so if you've been neglecting this series for some oddball reason, it's time to stop doing so. You're missing out, and everyone's going to make fun of you for it.\" - IGN", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Hardcover books are printed.

Get GLAD with this new two volume collection of rarely seen art by two of their greatest illustrators done outside their work at Mad magazine. The books are a treasure trove of rare humor comics mostly unseen for over 30 years from the pages of Mad's #1 competitor, Cracked magazine. They are curated by two folks with Cracked bona fides, Mark Arnold, author of the definitive two volume history of the magazine If You're Cracked, You're Happy!, and Mort Todd, the former Editor-in-Chief of the magazine during one of its most creative periods.\nThe comics presented are from the 1950s and 1960s during the title's early years and while John Severin and Jack Davis were at the top of their game as creators. There are TV and movie parodies, tons of celebrities, along with satire on current events, trends and culture of the era.\nMark Arnold provides an informative introduction to The Comedy of John Severin and comics historian Bhob Stewart, author of The Life and Legend of Wallace Wood, has an in-depth overview of the career of the artist in The Comedy of Jack Davis. Both books feature an afterword by Mort Todd reflecting on Severin, Davis and the magazine's legacy. The Comedy of John Severin is a 108 page volume and The Comedy of Jack Davis is 104 pages, all in glorious vintage black & white!\nThe books feature a gorgeous array of their work, showcasing the many mediums they work in, from pen and ink, wash, guoache, duoshade paper, zipatone and color paintings as they applied it to tweaking a variety of amusing topics.\nREWARDS\nTo help supplement publishing and distribution of these volumes (available in print and digital), other rewards are offered to those who support this project.

We're all very passionate about this project, about telling this story of Shane Bookman, and your help means the world to us. Aside from contributing, anything you can do to help us spread the word on social media \u2013 posting on Facebook, Tweeting, and reaching out to like-minded collectors will help us make this project a reality.\n\nIn a lot of ways, for all its darkness, DRAWING BLOOD is a love-letter to a life in comics, and comics themselves. We can't wait for you to read VOLUME 2. We promise to keep you updated throughout the campaign, on Kickstarter, in update emails to our supporters, and through social media. And you can always check up on what's going on here: www.facebook.com/drawingbloodcomic or follow any of the team on Twitter.\n\nThanks for reading and thanks for your support!

I've got a lot to tell you. \n\nSorry for the long silence, and for the delays in getting you your comics. We appreciate your incredible patience with us.\n\nI don\u2019t want to turn this update into one long apology, but I also know that no one reading this update has had the 2020 they expected to have, and that goes for your DRAWING BLOOD team as well. We\u2019ve all been through a lot, and it\u2019s not quite over yet. On top of the plague, the effect it had on the comics\u2019 industry, the election chaos\u2026 we keep getting served up extra heartaches. Just last week, Kevin\u2019s friend and comics legend Richard Corben passed away. The hits keep on coming\u2026 and we\u2019re all human here. This stuff slows us down and gets in our way, even as it breaks our hearts.\n\nAs you know, or have guessed, the Year of the Plague has cancelled all comic conventions, and that\u2019s a big source of income, especially for artists. (People, sadly, have less interest in buying sketches from writers. Crazy, right?) Because of that, all of our plans for this year got scrambled and scrubbed\u2026 and as you might imagine, that had an impact on our schedules\u2026 and our finances.\n\nSo Drawing Blood has sometimes had to wait for a bit while we work on other things, to replace that lost income. At least some of the other stuff we\u2019ve been working on is pretty awesome\u2026 more on that at the end of the update.\n\nSweeping all that tragedy aside\u2026 this is where we\u2019re at right now. The Plague Year has thrown everything into chaos. But the work IS getting done.\n\nI\u2019ve wrapped up all the scripts for Drawing Blood: Volume Two, and Ben isn\u2019t too far behind me. He\u2019s done all the finals on Chapter 5, some on 6, and all the roughs on 7.

He goes to school and works in the Livery with his Uncle Jim, the only family he has left since his mother's death several years earlier. Rusty has a crush on a local girl named Abigail and he is a target of bullies, due to his red hair and awkward ways. \nMore than anything, the teenager idolizes Wild Bill Hickok and wants to follow in the famous gunman's footsteps, performing as a trick shot artist in traveling shows when he gets older. When Rusty meets his idol, Wild Bill takes an instant shine to the lad.\nThe next day, Wild Bill calls Rusty to the saloon to talk. Rusty arrives just in time to see Jack McCall gun down his hero. Overcome with grief, Rusty calls out the murderer in an effort to avenge his idol but fails miserably.\nLater that day, the ghost of Wild Bill appears to Rusty to say how much he appreciated his attempt at taking out McCall. The spirit cowboy vows to teach Rusty how to be a gunslinger so they can finish what he started and take down McCall to get justice for his murder.\nThis 55-page western is written by Scott Young, penciled by Fernando Ruiz, inked by Kim DeMulder and features a cover by Tom Mandrake!

He has spent the last 15+ years working with the biggest and best talent at Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Aspen, Dynamite, etc. and has had his work featured in TV, film, and video games.  Some of his previous creations and credits include Moon Streak, Sky Sharks, Gears & Bones, Pirates vs. Ninjas, and more.\nGAB SANTOS -  John Gabriel Santos \u201cGabouwness\u201d is an Illustrator and Character Concept Artist who was born and raised in Manila, Philippines.  Ever since he was a kid he loved to create his own little paper games. That is why when Digital Art was introduced to him in college he realized that he really wanted to pursue art as a career even though his degree is in Information Technology. Gab usually does character designs, cover illustrations, but sometimes he also does fan art, comics, and even card games.  He really loves to read comics, play classic video games like Pokemon, and card games like Magic the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, Hearthstone and more. Those are his biggest influences.  He is fond of making robot designs and mechanical/sci-fi/fantasy/apocalyptic themed illustrations because he finds it cool to draw what the world would look like in the future. He said that art is what he loves to do and that is why he works hard to improve, not only for himself, for the people that love and support him every day. \n****UPDATE!

I scoured the internet for month for a story, a comic, a novel, cartoon, game, ANYTHING about bigfoot in space because that idea excited me in a way like Star Wars and X-Men did for me as a kid. I needed to read, no to EXPERIENCE this story. But I couldn't find it anywhere and I was bummed about it. That is until I FINALLY realized (slower than I'd like to admit) that this was the comic I've been born to create! Somebody needs to tell the story of bigfoot in space. The ultimate outcast, hunted his whole life in the forests of Earth now finds himself lost in space, that's too rich of an idea to pass up. \nI've spent most of my youth growing up living in the worlds others have created because as a kid who often felt out of place, comics like the X-Men really resonated, Elric of Melnibone was transformative, Star Trek was this utopia where everyone belonged, and Star Wars was just cool.  Even with all the powers, costumes, strange worlds and settings the characters and emotions always struck a chord with me in ways non genre fiction never has and when I felt alone these stories helped me connect and understand that there were others out there like me. \nNow I think this zany tale of bigfoot lost in space can provide for others, as well as myself, an immense universe full of limitless potential for joy and exciting and fun stories like all those that I have always have and still enjoy.\"\nWhat's a bigfoot article without tabloid style newspaper?\nBecause I wanted to star in a super awkward video! (sarcasm)\nI am coming to Kickstarter to raise funds for a large print run of Savage Sasquanaut #1, at least 1,000 copies.\nThe first issue is 100% completed and ready to go to print, and to further prove how invested I am in Sasquanaut, the scripts were written and Gab has already completed penciling and inking issues 2-6. \nKickstarter has proven to be an amazing venue for getting new creative ideas into as many hands as possible, and I would love your support to bring this story to life.\nCost Breakdown\nWhy participate in the Kickstarter, why not wait until it is in stores?\nThere are exclusive benefits available only to those who support this campaign, notably the Kickstarter exclusive Paolo Pantalena variant cover and the sweet hard enamel pin.  \nWhile 1,000 copies sounds like a lot, it's pretty small, and with Kickstarter pre-orders and convention appearances it will sell out!  I also cannot promise that the book will be in a store near you and pre-ordering here through Kickstarter is the best way to absolutely guarantee you will receive your copy.\nWhat happens if you exceed your goal?\nIf more funds are raised than requested first things first I will use extra money to make this issue and rewards even better with the planned stretch goals like increasing the page count to include the origin story of Sasquanaut drawn by international superstar artist Tyler Kirkham.  \n***Check out this FREE preview of issue 1 right now!

This is happening because of you, thank you.   \nIf you have not already, PLEASE review the different reward packages and SELECT which one you would like to purchase and complete your pre-order for the best new sci-fi hero you've never heard of.\nAND PLEASE SHARE THIS PROJECT WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY!\nOne of the potential stretch goals is including in the issue the Sasquanaut origin story drawn by superstar artist TYLER KIRKHAM\n After we hit our initial funding goal of $5500, I have started planning a few follow up stretch goals that can be unlocked, one of them is adding in this 3 page origin story that Tyler Kirkham (Spider-Man, Action Comics, Deathstroke, and more).\nAt $6,000 funding every physical reward will include this extra mini-print postcard!\nClick the image to sign up for the newsletter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSAVAGE SASQUANAUT #1 (Wes Hartman - My First Kickstarter Campaign)\n\nBefore launching this campaign I have made every effort to minimize any risk to the backer as I know, as a Kickstarter supporter myself, what it means to ask you to support a new project with your hard earned money.\n\nPart of this effort was to make sure that the first issue is 100% completed, and to emphasize how serious this is, all line art for the remaining 5 issues has also been completed by Gab Santos. \n\nWhen the campaign successfully ends, with your help, the files can be loaded to the printer when the funding comes in, digital rewards can be sent upon receiving completed surveys, and coloring and lettering can continue on all subsequent issues.\n\nI have been in touch with several printers and have chosen to use Color Vision for the first issue upon the campaigns completion.\n\nI have assisted and been associated with other Kickstarter campaigns before, but this is my first campaign that I am running and I have made every effort to learn and prepare myself for this endeavor from discussing and surrounding myself with peers who have been successful in running campaigns as well as attending The ComixLaunch Course for creating successful Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nI love this book and I want everyone who takes part of this campaign to love this book as much as I and have a completely satisfied experience on Kickstarter with me and Gab, so as soon as issue 2 is completed we can offer it to you as well.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message me and I will do my absolute best to make this project as rewarding as possible.\n\nThank you for your time and your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "#1) Thank you!", "descp": "Get a campaign exclusive digital desktop wallpaper featuring characters from Savage Sasquanaut and a heartfelt thank you for helping make this a reality!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "#2) Digital copy", "descp": "Get a downloadable, HD resolution, DRM-Free PDF of Savage Sasquanaut #1, featuring 24 stunning illustrated pages.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital pdf", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["44 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "#3) Digital Duo Edition", "descp": "Get a downloadable, HD resolution, DRM-Free PDF of Savage Sasquanaut #1, featuring 24 stunning full color illustrated pages.\nAlso included is a digital copy of the black and white ARTIST EDITION HD resolution, DRM-Free PDF of Savage Sasquanaut #1.

The amazing part was, because of Kickstarter and the crowdfunding structure, so many of you helped shape what the story actually became, lots of you, and your CATS, were actually IN the book. I didn\u2019t want to just make my comics alone... \nI wanted to make them with all of you. \u2665\nWith your support, through Kickstarter pre-order pledges and social media shares, I\u2019ll be able to once again, hunker down to draw, print, self-publish and ship out this epic 200 plus page sequel, THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2. \nCheck out all the awesome rewards and ways that you can not only get the book, but be a part of it, by being one of the very first to help make THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 a reality.\nHere are some of my favorite...\n See all the guest artist originals and prints HERE.\nI\u2019ll never be able to adequately thank you all enough for once again helping me to tell this story, but I CAN use your enthusiasm, and support to make the best damn book I\u2019m capable of and deliver it directly to you, the ones who showed up to the party early and made the whole thing possible.\nTo add...\n\u25ca AGGREGATE ISSUE #0  --- Increase pledge by $10 USA / $20 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 1 --- Increase pledge by $25 USA / $45 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca ISSUE #0 & BOOK 1 DIGITAL PDFS --- Increase pledge by $10 EVERYWHERE.\n\u25ca ADDITIONAL AGGREGATE BOOK 2 --- Increase pledge by $25 USA / $45 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 2  CHRIS JOHNSON COVER --- Increase pledge by $40 USA / $60 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 2 MATEUS SANTOLOUCO COVER --- Increase pledge by $40 USA / $60 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 2 KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE COVER --- Increase pledge by $50 USA / $70 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca ANY PRINT --- Increase pledge by $10 USA / $20 EVERYWHERE ELSE PER PRINT.\n\u25ca A SHIRT --- Increase pledge by $30 USA / $40 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca A PUZZLE --- Increase pledge by $50 USA / $60 EVERYWHERE ELSE PER PUZZLE.\n\u25ca A MINI FIGURE --- Increase pledge by $90 EVERYWHERE.\n\u25ca MP3 SOUNDTRACK --- Increase pledge by $10 EVERYWHERE.\n\u25ca KEVIN EASTMAN METAL PRINT --- Increase pledge by $20 USA / $40 EVERYWHERE ELSE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is technically my 4th Kickstarter, my 1st being THE AGGREGATE, my 2nd, (although it wasn\u2019t under my name) DRAWING BLOOD, and my 3rd, NATHAN THE CAVEMAN. I am very responsive to messages, comments and questions and will make myself available to answer any concerns whenever they arise.\n \nDEADLINE: \nI believe I\u2019ve given myself a realistic amount of time to draw over 200 pages, hire a colorist, put the book together, print, and ship the book and all rewards. I greatly underestimated the budget and timeline on THE AGGREGATE BOOK 1, but still found a way to bring it to life. With BOOK 2 I\u2019m being careful to not do that again, and to be realistic with the time and money these books take to make. That being said, sometimes unexpected things happen, and I am very appreciative of backers that understand those situations. I was lucky to have had zero complaints from AGGREGATE BOOK 1 supporters, as they understood I was working on the book every single day. I promise to NEVER leave anyone in the dark as to what\u2019s going on with the progress of the project. If something comes up, you will be well in the loop. This estimated deadline of March 2021, of course doesn\u2019t factor in the addition of any possible unlocked stretch goals like added pages, variant covers, or AGGREGATE APPENDAGES, which of course could potentially extend the workload.\n \nPRINTING: \nOver the last several years, I\u2019ve developed a great relationship with an amazing printer right here in the USA, who I\u2019ve used many times now, with a mind blowing quick turnaround. Once the book is completed, I have no doubts about the quality of the printed final product.\n \nSHIPPING: \nShipping is going up every single day in different areas, and the rules are always changing. I\u2019ll be shipping books media mail when possible to keep the domestic prices as low as possible. Unfortunately media mail is not an option for international packages. Here is the cold hard (sad) truth. A single copy of this book will weigh at least 2 lbs. The minimum cost for a single book to go first class outside the USA is $23, 2 books is $48, and 3 books is now priority at $68! So my shipping costs are real. I lost a lot on previous campaigns by underestimating shipping costs and am trying really hard not to do that again. I want to make the book available to all you international supporters though, so the option is available for almost every reward tier, but I felt I needed to let you know that the high shipping costs are the actual prices.\n \nPlease feel free to reach out to me with any questions you may have. I take crowdfunding very seriously and would never risk ruining my reputation on a project I didn\u2019t believe in or didn\u2019t 100% think was possible to fulfill. \n \nThank you for being a part of THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 and making it possible for self publishing creators like me to JUST MAKE COMICS and deliver them direct to the readers with a platform like Kickstarter.\n \n-Ben Bishop\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 - DIGITAL.", "descp": "\u25ca THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 digital pdf.\nINCLUDES:\nTHE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 - DIGITAL.\nYOUR NAME IN THE BOOK.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2.", "descp": "\u25ca THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 signed.\n\u25ca WANT TO ADD BOOK 2 TO YOUR PLEDGE?

The factors that keep me churning out art and new content is my deep love of the medium and the fans that continue to support me. \nDRAGONFLY\nSo- I want to talk about some of this aforementioned new content that I have for you here. The first thing that I want to delve into is Dragonfly. Dragonfly is a book that I first published in 2013. A volume was released then using this platform, Kickstarter, as a funding vehicle. Some of you perhaps have that book. Following that, I wrote a second and a third book (neither published) and I abandoned the project with the art only partially done on book 3. \nThe first Dragonfly book has a new \"repaired\" scene.\n\nA few months ago, a fan reached out to me and asked what was up with Dragonfly. I explained that it was unfinished and that I hoped to maybe get back to it someday. That conversation got me thinking however that I should finish the book and wrap up the first story arc, at least. I finished the inking on book 3 and wrote a new conclusion to the first storyline. That collection is what you will find here- books 1, 2, 3 and 4. \nJohn takes a shot in the second Dragonfly book.\nSo it's interesting, to me at least. Here is a book that began life 6 years ago, and then lay dormant up until very recently. If you pick this trade paperback, and look at it, everything from book 3, page 10 backwards, is from 2013 or thereabouts and everything beyond that page is new. Don't worry- the art is pretty cohesive, I think, and I can only pick out a few subtle differences myself- I just think it's neat that something could find life again after all that time. \nDragonfly 3 is them in the world of giant insects.\nWhat is the book about? It's about these characters who find themselves in world with dinosaurs. Each of them are unable to recall anything about their pasts, and one of the overall concepts of the series is their struggle with that. Who are we?- what is real?- what manipulates us? Beyond that backdrop I wanted Dragonfly to be an adventure comic because that's what I love, so there's a lot of action to move the story along and be entertaining hopefully. Last, and somewhat oddly, even to me, was that the book ended up being a little bit about faith \nYa gotta buy the book to find out what's going on here.\nThe physical book itself is smaller than standard comic book size- with a final printed size of 6 x 9 inches. It will be a trade paperback, square bound with a softcover and contain 158 pages total of story and black and white art and a final page count of 168 pages. I will leave the back cover blank to allow for original sketches. \nThe cover to the Dragonfly trade paperback.\n OK- let's move on. \nHELLRIDE\nI began the process of writing and drawing Hellride last fall. I was going through kind of a rough period then, and out of that came this story. \nSo yeah, Hellride is about a journey. The ride that the main character is on, is the ride that all share as we travel from birth to death. All of us struggle- we all have trials and we all must face obstacles and there are times when things tend to become overwhelming. Sometimes our stubbornness gets us through, other times it's our determination. Life is not easy, nor is it fair. Accepting these things and finding the strength to go on- that's the story of this book.\nDespite this and the sometimes way that darkness appears to prevail, occasionally a light is offered, or reveals itself. I've been there, and I know it happens. Ultimately, that's the message that I'm trying to get across here in this story. It's about strength and hope, and how the two go together. \nOK- enough of the serious stuff, let's talk about the actual book. I remember that when I used to work for the Ninja Turtles, one of my bosses would talk about how he hated black panel borders. I suppose that affected me because up until now, I've never done a book with them. This may seem to be a minor thing to most people, but artistically- this book is kind of a watershed work for me.\nAs well as the border thing, this book uses tons of full page bleeds. Once again, totally new to me and, I think, sets Hellride apart from other comics in my portfolio. Also- mostly from a visual standpoint, I've really made an effort to try different techniques and approaches with the layouts and page designs. I know, I know- it's just a comic but I really made an effort to make it interesting, or at least memorable. \nHellride is going to be a smaller format comic. The physical book will measure 6 x 8 inches. The final page count of the comic will be 68 pages. \nHellride cover.\nSTRETCH GOAL\nIf I can break the $6,000.00 mark I will include a signed Dragonfly print. It will be full color and measure an unobtrusive 8.5 x 11 inches. \nThe print will automatically be included in all reward levels that include either physical book ($15.00 and up). \nThe Dragonfly stretch goal print.\nHellride original art reward 1 image. Art measures 9 1/2 x 12 5/8 inches.\nHellride original art pack 2 image. Art measures 11 1/4 x 15 1/8 inches.\nDragonfly original art reward 1.

On the DFLY book, the back cover is blank- the intention being there, that it is open and available for sketches. This, early on, I explained to the printer what my needs were (I needed to be able to ink on this thing) and they replied that the cover coating was required- in order to protect the ink on the front. What they would do though, is dilute or through some process lessen the amount of coating in order to allow me to sketch on the back with no problem. When the books got here, the first thing I did was to play around with a few experimental drawings. It wasn't as I hoped- my pens smeared and the ink wouldn\u2019t dry- no good. Luckily, my art markers (colors) worked fine and they seemed to dry and I\u2019m happy with that- cause if they didn\u2019t that would've been bad.

It turns ugly fast when they uncover the truth: there's a monster terrorizing the campground. \nTwo Comics for Twice the Thrills \nHere's what you can expect when you back the two latest issues from the House of Fear series:\nTwo complete, stand-alone stories. \n68 pages of spooky thrills.\nScares suitable for kids 7 and older.* \nOffset printing for the best quality.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy envelopes for added protection.\nEach issue features bonus pages not to be collected elsewhere. \n*Note: The themes and action in these issues are suitable for all ages, but the level of dialog might slow down early readers who are just beginning to read on their own. Otherwise I would label these as \"all ages.\"\nYou'll Enjoy These Comics...Guaranteed! \nIf you back the printed version and dislike the comics for any reason, return them for a refund (minus shipping fees).\nHorror Talk Review of Teeth! \nCheck out the review of House of Fear: Teeth on HorrorTalk.\nFortress of Dorkness Review!\nCheck out the Beyond the Big Two video review by Christian Villarreal and The Fortress of Dorkness.\nJust Announced: The Dark Horse Collected Edition\nIn May 2019, Dark Horse Comics is publishing a collected volume of House of Fear comics. The book will feature five complete spooky stories. That's 144-pages of kids vs. monsters.\nHow Scary Are these Comics? \nI don't expect anyone to have nightmares from an issue of House of Fear. These stories are intended for kids, and while they have scary elements, they're closer to action/adventure stories than true horror. My goal with these comics is to let kids test their fears through fiction, and to do so in a fun, exciting way.\nThat's not to say that these are totally calm and peaceful either. With each issue, I try to add a scene that gives the story an edge. I want young readers to be so thrilled, that they want to come back for more. \nHouse of Fear in Schools\nIn addition to writing comics for kids, I also enjoy talking to students about how comics are made and how stories shape our lives... even crazy monster stories. For the last two years, I've traveled to local schools to talk about creating comics. It never ceases to amaze me how excited kids get when they realize that someone actually writes and draws comics, and that they can do it, too.\nBut you can't talk about comics without handing out a copy when you're done, right? That's why, every time I step into a classroom, I bring a stack of House of Fear comics to hand out to the students. Doing so solidifies the discussion in their minds, and (hopefully) keeps them motivated to try creating their own comic.\nWith every comic purchased during this Kickstarter campaign, I'll print an extra copy to hand out to a student in one of my sessions in 2019. I've even created a Classroom Ambassador reward tier for those interested in supplying a stack of comics for an entire classroom. \nMeet the Creators\nOur two new House of Fear comics were brought to you by a team of talented, passionate creators...\nJames Powell - The Writer - Creator of House of Fear, James has written and edited comics for various publishers, including Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics, and Red Stylo Media. He is currently wrapping up his first novel for middle grade readers, tentatively titled, Santa's Claws. \nJethro Morales - The Penciler - Jethro started in comics back in 2009 and has been working his way up in line with the big league artists and has solidified his skills along the way by taking on popular titles like Vampirella, Dejah Thoris, and Green Hornet. And now here on House of Fear!\nMike Erandio - The Inker -  A comic veteran who\u2019s been in the local comic scene in the Philippines since the 80s, Mike now works alongside Jethro as inker for the House of Fear series. He brings a decade of honed inking skills.\nJames Hislope - Boyle Intro/Afterword Artist - James is an illustrator, cartoonist, and caricature artist who also happens to have a knack for drawing comics.\nJosh Jensen - The Colorist - Living colors from Tokyo, Japan. Josh is the colorist for all six issues of House of Fear. Check him out on Twitter.\nMatt Krotzer - The Designer and Letterer - Matt gives voices to characters and sound to action. His stellar lettering work has been seen in the pages of Image, Dark Horse, and many fine independent comics around the world.\nYou can find more information about previous House of Fear issues and their creators by checking out the previous Kickstarter campaigns:  The Curse of Cottonwood Ct. and The Grumpledowns Gang and the Case of the Mail-Order Shoggoths. \nPreview Pages \nBelow are the first 8 pages from House of Fear: Teeth. Want more? Check out the 9-page preview of House of Fear: Dead Lake.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI'm coming to Kickstarter to raise funds for an offset print run of 1000 copies for each of theses two issues. Printing offset means buying in bulk, which is costly, but doing so ensures the highest quality possible. It also reduces my costs per issue, which helps turn a profit at conventions or with online sales. Increased profits means I get to make more comics! \nBy using Kickstarter, I also can reach more people than I could by any other means. I want to get these comics into as many hands as possible so kids around the world can discover the joy of testing their fears through fiction.\nWhere do the Funds Go?  \nThe funds we earn through Kickstarter will be used to print the comics ($3500), ship the rewards to backers ($2000), and pay Kickstarter ($500) for hosting the campaign.  \nAny extra money earned from the campaign will help pay for future issues of House of Fear.\nThe Rewards\nWill You Help Us Continue Making Comics for Kids?  \nIt's simple: I want to make comics and get them to as many kids as I possibly can. I can't do that without the support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out my latest project. Please back the campaign and help me continue making exciting, action-packed comics for kids. \nWith gratitude, James and the entire House of Fear team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done everything I can to minimize risk for backers.

Book 3 is lettered by Patrick Brosseau and colored by Jessie Lam. \nClocking in at 200 pages and utilizing the original graphic novel format, Gladstone's 3 is the very definition of a page turner with a hundred page battle royale fight sequence.\nThat's right! A hundred page battle royale!  \nThis volume of Gladstone's School for World Conquerors is a love letter to Manga where we take our characters out onto the open road, ramp up the speed, and see just how fast they can go. \nBook 3 follows our band of Villains on their Cosmic Quest as they come across Scorpio Kane and his band of mercenary villains. On this adventure they're joined by new recruits 'the Speed Specter' and 'Man O' War.' \nGladstone\u2019s School for World Conquerors is a Young Adult Graphic Novel series by Armand Villavert & Mark Smith about a top-secret academy for the children of the world's greatest Super Villains to learn their trade.\nEver wondered if Super Villains go to school? Ah, you assumed they were born with their special skills. Think again, in Gladstone\u2019s School for World Conquerors we find ourselves amidst the pinnacle of higher learning for the next generation of villains and masterminds honing their craft.\nThe school curriculum includes the usual suspects of \u201cpublic speaking\u201d and \u201cbiology and chemistry,\u201d and yet that\u2019s only superficial child\u2019s play. Classes like \u201cunleash your hypnotic potential\u201d, \u201cintergalactic battle strategy\u201d, and \u201cancient relics, spells & mystical arts\u201d are added stressors for straight-A students like Kid Nefarious and Mummy Girl.\nMock battles are unleashed to test their skills with the latest tools of the trade such as \u201corbs of tranquility\u201d or \u201cgrim reaper\u2019s breath.\u201d\nJoin Kid Nefarious, Mummy Girl, Martian Jones, The Speed Spectre, Ghost Girl, Man O' War, and the infamous Skull brothers unearth the School's and their parent's hidden past.\nGladstone's School for World Conquerors is co-created and co-owned by Armand Villavert & Mark Andrew Smith.\nGLADSTONE'S SCHOOL FOR WORLD CONQUERORS 1 & 2 HARDCOVERS\nOWN THE THREE BOOK GLADSTONE'S SCHOOL FOR WORLD CONQUERORS SET TODAY!!!\nPICK UP 'THE NEW BRIGHTON ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY' 1 & 2 AS WELL AND SUPPORT GLADSTONE'S SCHOOL FOR WORLD CONQUERORS\nBuy the New Brighton Archeological Society Today!!!\n Featuring new teammates the Speed Spectre and Man 'O War. \nWhat is this Kickstarting?\nThis Kickstarter is to pay for the printing costs of Gladstone's School for World Conquerors Book 3 in Hardcover format.\nWhat is the plan for delivery?\nWe have book 3 laid out for production. This Kickstarter is to print Gladstone's School for World Conquerors 3 in Hardcover format. \nGladstone's School for World Conquerors Books 1 and 2 are already printed in beautiful Hardcover format as well as New Brighton Archeological Society 1 and 2.\nIt should be about a four month wait for backers. The books will take about two months to be printed in China. A month and a half for freight to the US. About two weeks to arrive in Amazon's inventory, and another two weeks to ship out to backers.\nSee what people are saying about Gladstone's School for World Conquerors!!!\n\"Smith\u2019s writing is fast-paced and warm, his characters rich enough to resonate with all ages of reader, and the character design and outsider edge of surreality recalls Peter Milligan\u2018s X-Statix, and likewise Villavert\u2019s pen explores the same subverted pop-art style of Mike Allred, albeit with the stylised touch of a Saturday morning cartoon.\" - Sci Fi Now\n\"We've been championing Gladstone's by Mark Andrew Smith and Armand Villavert since issue #1, but the last couple of issues have seen the series hit an early stride. In this installment, Smith plays with an enticingly fun and interesting take on superhero comics, challenging the notion of a hero's constant victory of his nemesis and how that would affect a child that is being educated in the ways of villainy.\nWatching Kid Nefarious and friends discover their parents losing over and over again in the pages of comic books (which are banned from Gladstone's, for these obvious reasons) is amazing. Gladstone's never talks down to kids and remains all-ages accessible. Better yet, they just might learn something about the tropes of superhero comics in the process.\nGladstone's continues to impress, so if you've been neglecting this series for some oddball reason, it's time to stop doing so. You're missing out, and everyone's going to make fun of you for it.\" - IGN\n\"Mark Andrew Smith and Armand Villavert\u2019s tween superhero ongoing stood out as the kind of title Marvel or DC wish they had, but would never be possible at the Big Two. A superhero dramedy set at a school for aspiring supervillains, the series is founded on the concept that the ongoing war between heroes and villains is faked, putting a new spin on the parent-as-supervillain metaphor.\nThe students are waking up to the reality of their world, and the reader discovers with them, learning the dense mythology of Smith\u2019s story while experiencing the thrill of Villavert\u2019s kinetic artwork. Best of all, Gladstone\u2019s is a title appropriate for all readers, with characters that look and sound like kids, but a plot that any superhero fan can appreciate.\" - AV CLUB\n\"Mark Andrew Smith\u2019s tween-supervillain team is similar to the Runaways in that each member is pulled from a different corner of the superhero genre: a mummy, ghost, alien, etc. Smith\u2019s story puts a new spin on the super-school concept that has already been tried in films like Sky High and Zoom. Armand Villavert\u2019s sleek artwork would translate well to computer animation, and Smith\u2019s clearly defined yet whimsical cast makes Gladstone\u2019s a great fit for a studio like Pixar. The chance of a creator-owned superhero team launching a big-budget animated feature is slim, but if The Walking Dead can become the highest-rated show on cable, there\u2019s always hope.\" - AV CLUB\nART FROM 'GLADSTONE'S SCHOOL FOR WORLD CONQUERORS: SCORPIO KANE' illustrated by Armand Villavert with colors by Jessie Lam.\nPlease take a moment to share 'Gladstone's School for World Conquerors' with your friends on Facebook and Twitter by clicking the 'Like' & 'Tweet' buttons above.\nBy sharing 'Gladstone's' you're helping us to educate the public about the project and helping us to get one step closer to our quest of 'world domination.'\n'Gladstone's School for World Conquerors' TM & (C) Armand Villavert & Mark Andrew Smith.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGladstone's School for World Conquerors 1 and 2 are printed.

Or were you the girl sporting the checkered dress at prom, hoping the DJ would play any song you could skank to? Maybe you were you the preppy kid that didn't quite fit in with the metal heads or the gangsta' wannabes, who finally heard a catchy upbeat on the college radio station and had to learn what this style was? Or were you the younger sibling that was filled with sadness when the 90s were over and the third wave ska bands you wanted to see live were no longer touring!\nWell, if this is you, we are making your movie! \nThis documentary aims to tell the story of how the genre of ska evolved from its original form in Jamaica in the 60s, through two-tone in Europe in the 80s, into an entirely new sound in the 90s and became wildly popular all around the world for a brief moment in music history. You'll hear the stories from the early years of some of the most well loved bands including No Doubt, Fishbone, The Toasters, Let's Go Bowling, Operation Ivy, and Skankin' Pickle, as well as how the rise to fame occurred for the radio success stories The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish, and Save Ferris! \nWe are traveling around the world, interviewing the bands, promoters, record label executives, fans, and others who participated in building the ska scene in the 90s. This documentary showcases the DIY nature and challenges of the scene all over the world and relives how the push into the spotlight changed everything for these previously obscure bands and the genre in general. Making this film in a similar DIY, independent manner feels fitting given the nature of how the ska scene grew in popularity from its underground roots over the years. \nOur goal is to tell this story as accurately as possible from as many points of view as possible. Ska in the 90s had a very different culture and scene in New York as compared to Orange County, or Tokyo for that matter!\nThank you so much for getting us past $75k\nWho's in it?\nWe still have a long way to go to finish this movie, but here are some of the bands we've interviewed members of so far:\nReel Big Fish\nLess Than Jake\nNo Doubt\nSave Ferris\nHepcat\nGoldfinger\nThe Aquabats\nThe Mad Caddies  \nFishbone  \nSublime  \nKemuri\nBuck-O-Nine\nThe Toasters\nDance Hall Crashers\nLet's Go Bowling\nThe Pietasters\nSkankin' Pickle\nMU330\nTazy Phillipz (the Ska Parade)\nThe Skatalites\nSpring Heeled Jack\nSuicide Machines\nMustard Plug\nThe Porkers\nThe Hippos\nBig D and the Kids Table\nVoodoo Glow Skulls\nFive Iron Frenzy\nRX Bandits\nThe Specials\nTokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra\nand more...\nWe need your help!\nBeing passionate fans ourselves, we are attempting to make this film in a DIY manner, and as such, we have no big studio support or any real private funding whatsoever. Until now we have been self-financing this project and have run out of funds to complete the movie in the way we feel it needs to be completed. That's where you come in, because we have heard your voice and you love ska! You want these stories to be told! \nYour support, large or small, will go a long way towards getting this movie out into the world!\nWant to do more to help?\nShare this page now on facebook, instagram and twitter with the hashtags #skamovie and #pickitup.\nThe Rewards:\nWe have a lot of the standard fare for a Kickstarter movie... You can get a digital copy, or a BluRay copy of the film, Your name in the credits, buttons, stickers, t-shirts, even exclusive posters being drawn (Image coming soon!) by the incredible Steve Vance (Less Than Jake's \"Hello Rockview\", Mystery Science Theater 3000)...  All kinds of goodies.  \nWe will also be releasing some LIMITED REWARDS of signed memorabilia from some of the bands involved and other cool RARE ska stuff, like the 1996 Less Than Jake promo stickers that were all claimed in the first weekend!

He has directed several award-winning short films and, after the success of his previous feature documentary, Here's to Life: The Story of the Refreshments, Taylor is returning to the ska world to help bring these stories to the masses.  \nProducer - Rei Mastrogiovanni has been playing ska music for over 20 years.  Since 2005 he has been working in Japan in music and television.  Aside from his solo projects and bands in Japan, he has worked with American ska legend Angelo Moore (Fishbone), Mexican ska giants Maskatesta, and Japanese female pop-ska group Oreskaband.\nAssociate Producer - Jason Hockney Zeimet is a walking \u201c3rd Wave Ska Encyclopedia\u201d who has worked on several music-related documentaries including \u201cNo New Kinda Story: The Story Of Tooth & Nail Records\u201d & MxPx\u2019s \u201cBest Life Series\u201d. His favorite ska record is Slapstick \u201cLookit.\u201d He owns a nearly-infinite number of Ska records on Vinyl, & is a feature writer for Modern-Vinyl.com.\nAssociate Producer - Leanor (AKA \"Jeff the girl\") Ortega Till has been a female pioneer in the Ska Punk community for over 20 years! As the saxophone player for Denver, CO's Five Iron Frenzy she was the only female on the acclaimed 'Ska Against Racism' tour during the height of the third wave ska movement. In addition to being a multi-talented musician, writer, & charismatic interviewer, her connections in the ska community have proved invaluable to the production of this movie.\nWriter - Heather Augustyn literally wrote the book on ska.  In fact, several books on ska, all available at skabook.com\nCinematographer - Noah Mucci has an uncanny ability to recognize story and react to it quickly with a cinematic eye. His recent work on ICARUS (Academy Award Winner: Best Documentary 2017, Emmy nominated) is just one example of that.\nA Note From The Director:\nSka is what got me into playing music. Music is what got me into making videos, which led to films. Now film making has brought me back to ska.  Playing in ska bands throughout the years has taken me around the world and introduced me to some of the most amazing people and most of my lifelong friends.  \nFor some people ska (especially from the '90s) is viewed as silly or novelty music, but for me it means a lot. As cliche as it may sound, growing up as a band geek, discovering ska music changed my life. Which is a story I've now heard from countless other people both musicians and fans.  Even when \"The Impression That I Get\" hit the mainstream and was in heavy rotation on VH1 it always seemed like ska music was for the outsiders, the geeks, and the weirdos.  Like it was music that was just for us.  Which is part of why so many people still love it today.  \nSo far, making this movie has been an amazing experience! I hope that when the movie comes out and you get to hear these stories that we have been gathering it will give you a whole new appreciation for the music and the bands that meant so much to so many of us!\nSincerely,\n-Taylor \nPick It Up!

Click both links below to see the latest updates and add-ons for our FINAL DAY!!!!\nhttps://kck.st/2spzHbM\nhttps://kck.st/2xEkZm0\nThis year's FREE COMIC BOOK DAY edition of DKD leads up to this new series!\nKitty Ravencraft returns!  The last time we saw her, her new comic book series was a huge success and she was once again the talk of the comic shops! Kitty's sleazy publisher managed to get a Hollywood film deal based on her series, but she soon found herself in danger once again! So much so, that she gets shot and killed by a mystery killer! Who would do this? And why? The story continued in this year's Free Comic Book Day special, \"DKD: I Love You to Death!\" In that book, we see Kitty move on to the great beyond, with a bit of a snag. Will she end up in Heaven or Hell ? And that's where this series begins! \nA lot of Kitty's old crowd returns! Little Satan, Derek, and of course everyone's favorite kid corpse, Dippy the Dead Kid will be back. And there's new faces like Big Debra and God herself! We'll see Kitty go on trial, taking a visit to Heaven AND Hell... then going on a mission from God to seek out her killer! And when you see who her killer is, you will be SHOCKED! But where will she end up? And what will happen to her killer? Find out in the wackiest, funniest Kitty story yet!\nDan's \"Angelic\" cover for issue #1\nFernando's \"Devilish\" cover for issue #1\nAfter 2 successful DKD series, we are more committed than ever to put out good, fun comics! We want to surpass each series by kicking it up a notch in terms of story and art. And we are still inspired to have a series that reminds us of the fun comics we liked to read as kids. Comics that you don't have to buy 72 issues of a multi-story arc to enjoy! Now we enter a new realm of storytelling as she enters the afterlife! And there's more fun and satire the ever!  Our kickstarter fans have been a close knit family to us, and we value your input too!  We hope we can count on our very loyal and generous fans to make this the best DKD series ever!\nWe hope to follow the basic model of our first two series,  with a four issue storyline that we will initially release as individual PDF issues. As before, each individual issue will feature twenty pages of original story and art plus fashion pages, funny ad pages, pin-ups, variant covers and other added material. We will be handling the bulk of the writing and drawing ourselves but much of this additional material may be completed by some of our talented friends and colleagues in the comic industry. Later, these issues will be collected into one softcover trade paperback and as per our last campaign, our goal is to collect enough funding to be able to make the softcover trade into a hardcover with a dust jacket.\nDan's cover to #2 is a bit handsy\nA \"bewitching\" cover for issue #3\nOnce again, we are planning on a number of stretch goals to make this project better and better. We are hoping to add bonus material such as an additional exclusive story by the one and only Gisele Lagace,  and beautiful spreads  by the awesome J Bone. In addition to these fun additions, we've got some really cool stuff planned! If other goals are met, we hope to do a Die Kitty Die HALLOWEEN special and a DIE KITTY DIE COLORING BOOK .And our ultimate goal is to do a Kitty figurine! Fingers crossed!\nWe'll also be \"adding on\" extras along the way, that you can add to your pledge . Our first add-on are the 2 previous hardcover editions of \"DIE KITTY DIE\". Then we'll be adding on things like prints, books, original artwork and other goodies. And there is a little instruction graphic below, explaining how to add on to your pledge.\nFernando's Fiery Cover for issue #2\nFernando's Cover for issue #3\nAn interior page by Fernando!\nAn interior page by Dan !\nKitty will look so pretty sitting on your shelf!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince our first incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign 3 years ago, Die Kitty Die has enjoyed a lot of good luck. The reception to our first Die Kitty Die book has been hugely successful , and DKD has been picked up by Chapterhouse Comics to be published in single issues and distributed to retailers world wide!\n\nWe'd like to point out to everyone that despite this great good fortune, producing Kitty still falls to us. We still produce the series through our own imprint, Astrocomix. We creatively control everything. This is what brings us to Kickstarter. We can't do it alone. As you might imagine producing four complete issues of original story and art takes a lot of manpower and resources. We have our impressively talented team of inkers, letterers, colorists and others that we must hire and pay. We also have other costs such as printing, shipping and many other miscellaneous expenses that we need to cover ourselves. We can't do this without the very generous help of our very kind and loyal fans and supporters. We were deeply appreciative and touched by the phenomenal amount of support we were shown throughout our first campaign and even afterwards. Making an independent creator-owned and driven project like Die Kitty Die has been our dream since long before either of us ever got into this business. We couldn't make that dream happen without your help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "SINGLE PDF REWARD", "descp": "SINGLE PDF REWARD: Get a PDF of issue #1 of 4 from the \"DIE KITTY DIE: Heaven & Hell collected trade\".", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "FOUR PDF REWARD", "descp": "FOUR PDF REWARD: Get all 4 issues that will comprise DIE KITTY DIE: Heaven & Hell's collected trade IN PDF FORMAT.

Included in the pages we'll have self-checks and evaluations to ensure everyone knows how to Define the Line for themselves and others.\nsimplyHR LLC, cofounders, Tina Todd and Nikki Larchar, have over 15 years of experience helping business owners go through the process of investigating harassment claims. Inspired by real-life accounts, \"Define the Line\" will highlight some of the most frequent and common types of harassment in the workplace. \nWith 1 in 3 women ages 18 - 34 reporting that they have experienced workplace harassment, traditional training methods aren't working. \nWith 6 different scenarios within \"Define the Line\" readers will be witnesses to harassment in varying levels of severity. Each scenario will show:\nHow we naturally respond to harassment (freeze up, ignore it, etc), \nHow we can be confident and define the line when it's crossed, and\nWhat co-workers (our greatest heroes) can do to help create workplaces that are safe and secure for everyone. \nEmployees and harassers come in different shapes, sizes, and genders. We are working with Moriah Hummer the comic book artist for Flat Track Furies to create characters that showcase just how wonderfully diverse our workplaces are. \nHuman Resource gurus, Nikki Larchar and Tina Todd, guide readers through the scenarios and provide best practice information throughout in order to help employees understand what next steps they should take.  \nHuman Resources guides: Nikki and Tina\n\"Define the Line\" will not only be a way to educate employees and employers but will also empower individuals to work together to create workplaces and organizations that are free from harassment. \nIt was a dark and stormy night... Okay, it was a slightly above average Tuesday, and we were sipping on margaritas, because as some well-informed person on the internet somewhere once said, \"no good story every started with having a salad.\"  \nAs the second round of margaritas made their way to our table, we began brainstorming about how we could make harassment training more interesting. And then, something fascinating happened. Stories of each of our own individual experiences with harassment started to emerge.  \nUnsolicited storytelling started to happen EVERYWHERE. As we met with other business owners, community members, and friends, we began to hear their narratives. Their stories ranged in level of severity, but all had a common thread. There weren't any resources to help educate on what to DO if you're harassed or if you see someone else being harassed. \nAnd we were like... wait, WHAT?  \nBeing the HR nerds that we are, we began doing research. Like LOTS of research. And you know what we found out? There aren't very many studies on harassment training (interesting...). The few studies that have been done had some fascinating insights: \nAnd alas, the Comic Book idea was born! With so many tools and resources being offered in only a digital format, there is something magical about having a physical book. Something that you can flip through, that you can go back to as a reference, and that's different from the rest of the training, online modules, and videos that we are constantly bombarded with. Something you can refer to not only in a work setting but anywhere! ANY TIME!\nWe need your help to print the first 500 copies and pay our wonderful artist Moriah Hummer!\nBudget for Define the Line\n 1.  The \"Define the Line\" Comic Book\nSix varying scenarios will bring to life different workplaces, relationships, and characters. Within each scenario we'll show:\na situation and how we naturally respond (freeze up, awkward laugh, ignore), \nthen we'll rewind the scene to see how we can define the line when it's crossed, and \nwe'll rewind one more time to see how we as co-workers can step in and define the line for others.\n2. \"I Define the Line\" stickers\nStickers are great for showing off how awesome you are. \nConcept art of Define the Line sticker\n3. Define the Line Harassment Workbook\nIncludes everything you need to roll out Define the Line as your sexual harassment training within your organization. What you'll get in the digital workbook:\nTrainers Handbook - outlines best practices for training, provides you with guiding questions for discussions, 5-minute opening activities, and 10-30 minute enrichment activities,\nEvaluations and Group Checks - to ensure that everyone understands and is ready to define the line,\nHarassment Investigation Kit - Investigation checklist (to keep you organized), Workplace Grievance and Complaint Form, Workplace Investigation Interview Questions (what to ask the accuser, witnesses and accused), and the Workplace Investigation Final Decision Document.\n4.  Name on the  \"We Help Define the Line\" Page\nYour name (or business name) included on the inside of the comic book for all to see. (Bragging rights included). (**below is a concept art created by Nikki, it will most certainly look MUCH better once Moriah puts it together for us)\nConcept art - will be much cooler when Moriah does it ;)\n5. Company Logo or Business Name as a Sponsor\nYour business name or company logo prominently showcased on the back cover as a sponsor of \"Define the Line.\" (Bragging rights included!)\nWe are so excited to announce our partnership with SAVA. If you have experienced harassment in the workplace or sexual assault, SAVA provides resources, support groups, and a toll-free crisis hotline.\nWe're collecting real stories of workplace harassment to help us better identify what types of harassment happen most frequently and to help us create realistic and impactful scenarios. Submit your story anonymously by clicking the button below.\nHello there! We are Tina Todd PHR-CA, SHRM-CP and Nikki Larchar SHRM-CP co-founders of simplyHR LLC. Nice to meet you!\nOuttakes - DIY photo shoot one week after starting simplyHR\nWe started simplyHR a human resources consulting firm dedicated to educating small businesses on the employee rules and regulations that impact their business in August of 2016. We are the definition of a bootstrapped start-up, which means we have yet to take out any loans or grants to operate our business. \nWhile creating simplyHR Basics - A handbook for employers (now available as an online resource) and with each creation of a customized Employee Handbook we've come to understand the value of setting deadlines, getting feedback, the power of revision, and that a detailed timeline can move any project along.\nOur goal at simplyHR has always been to find ways to make Human Resources simple, easy and FUN. With a collective 15+ years of experience working in Human Resources, we are no strangers to the boring, cheesy, down-right painful-to-watch harassment training videos and online modules. \nDefine the Line will be the tool we wish we had when we were conducting workplace harassment training.\nWe are excited to empower organizations to create safe a secure workplaces for everyone.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Define the Line\" is our first attempt at creating a comic book.

As we chased after this important milestone it was only fair to celebrate it in style:\n\nThe Redhead will ride again... see you all in the Fall!\nWHO IS THE REDHEAD?\nSURVIVOR. GUNSLINGER. CURSE CHASER.\nWelcome to The Few and Cursed's 5th Kickstarter.\nFIFTH KICKSTARTER?\nYes, Fabiano Neves and myself (Felipe Cagno) started working on The Few and Cursed back in 2016 and we've always relied on Kickstarter to find an audience for the indie series.\nSo far we've released The Crows of Mana'Olana Parts I - III and the spin-off anthology book Chronicles of The Few and Cursed.\nWe're now looking for your support to print The Crows of Mana'Olana Part 4 and to continue growing our fan base.\n\nTELL ME MORE THEN, WHAT IS THE FEW AND CURSED?\nSure thing! The Few and Cursed is a creator-owned comic book series about people trying to survive a world where most of the water was just gone overnight in a mysterious apocalyptic event.\nSeventy years of pain, suffering and sorrow has gone by and whatever morality mankind had is no more. The world has become a wicked place where the weak doesn\u2019t stand a chance. What little water left is now a commodity used as currency, giving the Devil one heck of a post-apocalyptic playground for his creatures, minions and curses.\nBut for every darkness there is also always light - and among the few and cursed are those willing to fight to bring balance to the lands: the Curse Chasers.\nNICE, THAT'S COOL. SO THE REDHEAD IS--\n--a Curse Chaser, right.\nPeople have opened up to evil curses and the supernatural to survive this wretched world and it's the Redhead's job to go from town to town putting an end to them.\n WAIT, EVIL CURSES? SUPERNATURAL?\nYep, monsters, legends, demons, folklore, etc. The supernatural. The world is full of it and that simply won't do. Chief among cursed creatures are The Crows of Mana'Olana.\nCROWS OF WHERE?\nMana'Olana - a small town in the Honolulu Mountains region (what was once Hawaii). That's where the bedtime story about giant Crows that kidnap children in the silent of night comes from. Oh and while they are taking the kids, they also shred the grown-ups to pieces.\nThe Crows are not very friendly... they are quite scary actually and exactly the sort of folklore Red loves to investigate and stop it.\nThe Few and Cursed is the ideal book for any Western, Adventure or Supernatural fan!\nTHAT SOUNDS AWESOME! AND HOW MANY ISSUES ARE PLANNED?\nThe Crows of Mana'Olana story will be told in six (6) issues - each with 32 fully colored pages in standard comic book format 6'625 x 10'25.\nThe first three have already been published thanks to the amazing support of many of you guys and we plan on kickstarting the final three in 2018 - starting with this one.\nThe Few and Cursed: Crows of Mana'Olana - Parts 1 thru 3\nA quick synopsis for newcomers:\nIssue #1 introduces the Redhead to readers as we get to see her chase a local Indian myth, the Tsilkali, a giant snake preying on the small town of Mountain Ville, California.\nIn Issue #2 we follow the Redhead to the border of San Andreas and see her first meeting with a 94-year old survivor of The Reaping, Jebediah Younger. They team up to cross the Pacific after the Crows of Mana\u2019Olana and learn how real they really are\u2026 and how dangerous.\nIn the next installment of the series, Issue #3, the Redhead and Jebediah finally make it to Mana\u2019Olana. In a flashback story, readers will experience firsthand what the Redhead is truly capable of.\nLast but not least, Issue #4 features the very first big battle with the Crows in Mana'Olana. We also go deeper in Red's fatherly relationship with Jebediah and unravel some of his background.\nTHOSE SNIPPETS WERE GREAT BUT HOW ABOUT SOME REAL PREVIEWS FROM EVERY ISSUE?\nYou guys rule here and your wish is my command ;)\nSample pages from issue #1\nSample pages from issue #2\nSample pages from issue #3\nSample pages from issue #4\nWe are about 2/3 into the production of issue #4 meaning there will be a quick turnaround for the delivery \\o/\nWHAT ABOUT THE CHRONICLES OF THE FEW AND CURSED? WHAT IS THAT?\nGood question! The Chronicles of The Few and Cursed is an anthology featuring short stories by top artists set in the same universe.\nThe book collects 8 stories - including two new Redhead tales - for a total of 96 fully colored pages and was produced both in softcover format and hardcover (more details below!)\nWith Chronicles we were able to explore the four corners of the world and how different cultures deal with the lack of water.\nVisit a Persian city overtaken by horrifying Daevas, raid a tomb in Egypt after the Eye of Horus and get lost in a shark cemetery in the Australian outback.\nSample pages from The Chronicles of The Few and Cursed\nMeet the team of artists behind Chronicles:\nLuke Ross, Luis Guerrero, Pedro Mauro, Marco Lesko, Jos\u00e9 Luis, Andrew Dalhouse, Arthur Medeiros, Tiago Barsa, Geraldo Borges, Vinicius Townsend, Felipe Watanabe, Nat\u00e1lia Marques, Sam Hart, Wesllei Manoel, Adriano Di Benedetto, Walter Pax & Marcio Menyz.\nThe world of The Few and Cursed goes a lot further than the Old West!\nALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.

I have a background in film making, got my Master's degree at Chapman University and wrote and directed my first feature-length film in 2012, A Bullet With No Name.\nMy first comic book series was The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand epic adventure. It was an adaptation of a feature screenplay I wrote while at Chapman and working at producing companies like Arad Pictures, Weed Road and Misher Films.\nTrying a different approach to comics, I came up with the short narrative challenge \"321\": comic book stories with 3 pages, 2 characters and 1 twist ending. The 321: Fast Comics series was kickstarted right here in 2015, and featured stories from every genre you can think of with a myriad of top-name artists attached to them.\nOn top of The Few and Cursed I also have another creator-owned series in the works, Classified, a spy thriller. Earlier this year I completed two original graphic novels. Too Good to Be True is a dramedy about a wannabe comic book artist that meets his inspirational Hollywood crush.\nChoices: A Hero's Tale is a graphic novel about a young guy that wants to be the world's first real superhero. It's inspired by the comics from the 50s and 60s when superheroes were just fun.\nRecently I also got the opportunity of writing a Planet of the Apes short story for comic book app Madefire and Fox. Last but not least I'm currently working on the sci-fi drama Adagio which was the recipient's of a prestigious grant in Brazil in 2017.\nFABIANO NEVES - Artist\nProfessionally working as an artist since he was nineteen years old, Fabiano was first published in the US in 2000 with Xena Warrior Princess. He then went on to work for Marvel, DC, Dark Horse and Dynamite among other publishers.\nA talented colorist as well, Fabiano has done both interior pages and covers for Xena, Marvel Zombies, Red Sonja, Robocop, JLA\u2019s Vibe and Constantine among many other titles. The Few and Cursed represents Fabiano\u2019s first creator-owned project.\nDINEI RIBEIRO, TIAGO BARSA & MARCIO MENYZ - Colorists\nOur amazing team of colorists has met tremendous success at Marvel, DC Comics, Dynamite, Zenescope, Boom and other publishers.\nDinei Ribeiro - currently working with Ed Benes at DC on titles like Harley Quinn, Green Lantern and Trinity (Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman) - heads the team by overseeing art direction and color palettes while tackling as many pages as his schedule allows it.\nMarcio Menyz has been working steady at Marvel on books like X-Men Gold, Luke Cage and others while also coloring Frank Cho's Skybourne for Boom.\nWith us since issue #3 is newcomer Tiago Barsa. He's been our main guy and has been surprising us with every page he carefully crafts it. His credits include work for Ape Entertainment and Ed Benes Studio.\nDEYVISON MANES - Letterer\nOne of the best letterers in Brazil, Deyvison has built an impressive body of work over the past couple of years and is slowly tackling more and more titles for the US comic market.\nHe's been with The Few and Cursed since the beginning and has also done every other book Felipe Cagno ever published. He is also a crafty writer and has his own creator-owned sci-fi book - Justi\u00e7a Sideral.\nTHAT'S ONE HECK OF A TEAM! WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE PIN-UPS I'VE SEEN AROUND THE WEB AND HERE TOO, WHAT'S UP WITH THOSE?\nPin-Up by Stjepan Sejic & Clonerh\nBecause we've used Kickstarter to fund past issues and had some awesome support to always go well beyond our initial goal, we were always able to include a Gallery of Guest Artists where we commission some amazing names to share their version of the Redhead.\nAs issue #4 has already been successfully crowdfunded in Brazil, I'm happy to announce our line-up of Guest Artists:\nRoc Upchurch\nStjepan Sejic & Clonerh (pictured above)\nMauro Fodra\nFelipe Marchioni & Luis GUerrero\nBetsy Peterschmidt\nFrom left to right: Felipe Marchioni & Luis Guerrero, Mauro Fodra, Roc Upchurch\nEVERYTHING SOUNDS GOOD! WHAT ABOUT YOUR BUDGET AND SHIPPING, CARE TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THEM?\nFabiano and I are all about 100% transparency and we believe you deserve to know where your money is going to.\nAll of the money raised by Kickstarter will be used towards four things: Production, Printing, Shipping and Fees.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of our costs:\n- Production - $4,227.00\n- Printing - $2,733.00\n- Shipping - $2,500.00 (rough estimate based on previous campaigns)\n- Shipping supplies - $300.00\n- Fees (10% Kickstarter) - $1,072.23\n- Other costs including travel, ISBN code, etc - $962.34\nTotal - $11,794.57\nAny additional funding over our goal will first cover whatever is left from the above and all the extras like collectible cards, pin-ups, magnets, etc and production of future books of The Few and Cursed saga.\nI'm also substantially raising our shipping supplies budget to give our Shipping process yet another upgrade.\nWe already pack and mail our rewards using hard cardboard photo mailers plus dust-free clear plastic bags and comic book sized card-boards.\n*** For higher tiers or packages with extra books we will use Easy-Fold Mailers and bubble wrap:\n*** We also ship our prints using thick cardboard mailer tubes:\nOur primary goal is to entertain you and release the series entirely through Kickstarter. It all starts with YOU and YOUR support so thanks so much for sticking with us.\nIf you have any questions or inquiries please send me a message or shoot an e-mail at cagno100@gmail.com\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CHECKING US OUT AND HOPEFULLY PLEDGING \\o/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my 8th Kickstarter campaign, 20th crowdfunding if you count my experience with a similar platform in Brazil, and by now I can say I have a pretty good handle of what to expect prior, during and after a lengthy campaign.\n\nI love crowdfunding, it's an excellent opportunity to get in direct touch with readers and fans. If you have any criticism, feedback or question, I'm always around whether it's through Kickstarter's inbox or at cagno100@gmail.com\n\nI'd like to point out the book is pretty much done, all that is left is to ready the print files and actually go to print. By the time this Kickstarter is done the book will already have been released in Brazil.\n\nWe might need some extra time to produce the extra items unlocked through Stretch Goals but other than that, we're good to go!\n\nThe delivery schedule shouldn't suffer any delays except due to extraordinary circumstances (like monsoon season in Asia or being held up in customs, yeah, it could happen).\n\nMy biggest challenge is always shipping. I'm always looking for ways to make your packages arrive as safely as possible and in a timely manner. It's not easy... I've actually made friends with my local post-office dealing with such a difficult logistic but I feel I've made improvements and there is always room for growth.\n\nFor this campaign I plan on streamlining the logistics for some of our higher-end reward tiers offering prints instead of original art. Everything will be ready for shipping by July 2018.\n\nAll in all I'm glad you are here and thanks so much for backing!\n\nBest!\nFelipe\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "***RETURNING PASSENGERS***", "descp": "Looking for a digital copy of the comic only?\nWe got you covered!\nINCLUDES:\nPDF download of issue #4 only\nYour name in the \"Thank You\" section of the comic", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["152 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "***DIGITAL NEWCOMERS***", "descp": "DIGITAL BUNDLE\nLooking for all four issues in digital format?

Design and you can add an additional $12 to your pledge.\n\"Magical By Nature!\" 1.5x1.5 inches Cosmic Cupcake Chaos, along with many of my other series deal with magical girls so I wanted to represent that through this pin. By nature, we're all magical.\nAt $1300 I will unlock the Bite Me! Design and you can add an additional $12 to your pledge.\n\"Bite Me!\" 1.5x1.5 inches\nIn my comic \"Ah Heck!!

Have WE got a fun-filled, insanity-driven comic book for YOU!\n   That's right, it's called \"The Filbert Factor,\" and it is one ridiculous ride directly into the heart of Crazy Town! \"The Filbert Factor\" is a full-color, 32-page comic book, and the brainchild of creator and writer Mike Wolfer. Set in the town of Turtleview, Filbert and his friends Cashew and Hazel are just ordinary 4th graders, but in this first outing, they'll find themselves thrust into the center of a real-life disaster movie when the Meowstorm, a gigantic storm filled with furious felines, rolls into town!\n  Now, here's the backstory about why we're here on Kickstarter looking to fund the book through your generous donations: You see, American Mythology Productions had this plan, to create a new comic series that would appeal to kids, adults, and everyone in between; a sarcastic, irreverent snapshot of what it's really like to be a kid. Mike Wolfer got right to work creating the characters and story, Disney animator Adrian Ropp designed the leads, and artist Horacio Domingues, colorist Jeremy Kahn, and letterer Natalie Jane got to work on the interiors. \n  Then we had a real brainstorm: Let's see if we can get the first issue approved as an official entry in the 2018 Free Comic Book Day event, thus reaching hundreds of thousands of potential readers and introducing them to the incredible characters we've created. Well, the Free Comic Book Day committee said, \"Bah. We're not interested.\" Dang. So we listed the book in the distributor catalog, sure that retailers and comics readers would see \"The Filbert Factor\" as the next big thing that we feel that it is and order lots and lots of copies. And their response was, \"Bah. We're not interested.\" Double-dang. So, the only way to show the world what we have and pay all of the bills associated with getting this piece of comic mayhem printed and into peoples hands is to turn to Kickstarter... And YOU!\n   What we're offering to you, the backer, are a bunch of super-cool, Filbert-related goods that are sure to be collector's items, beginning with the books themselves:\n   As we mentioned, the orders for the book were low... Really low... So we're giving you the opportunity to pick up not only the Kickstarter Edition of THE FILBERT FACTOR #1, but also the two cover variants that are going to be on sale in very small amounts in only the coolest, smartest, hippest comic book stores in the world (and if your local comic shop carries the book this coming May, tell them that we love them).\n  But you'll be getting more than just comic books when you become a backer. Oh, SO much more. So let's look at the backer levels, shall we?\n  First up, the good, ol', reliable Digital Level...\nOnly $5? What a steal!\n   Next, the good, ol' physical copy...\nPhysical book also good for rolling up and swatting flies.\n For the real collectors out there, you'll be interested in the next level...\n   Oooh... What do we have here? More comics, and rare ones at that!\n SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT FIRST ISSUES COLLECTOR'S SETS: Many of these books are nearly sold out, so quantities of the exact cover variants shown above are in limited supply. We'll most likely have enough books on-hand to fill backer orders, but please be aware that the exact cover variants that you receive may vary, based on demand.\nNow, how do we make this even more ridiculous, and give you the opportunity to share with the world your twisted sense of humor?\n(T-shirt probably looks better on the male model than it will on you or I.)\n   But if you're really dedicated to making the nutty Filbert Factor dream a reality, feast your eyes on this collection of craziness...\n    Next up: Original art!\n    Yep, you can get a Mike Wolfer original pencil drawing on a 5.5\" x 8.5\" plate, which will be autographed and have Filbert saying something insulting to you, because what's more fun than that?!\n  Which leads us to the ULTIMATE REWARD- YOU get to \"meet\" FILBERT!\n   You won't find an opportunity like this very often! Backers of this Ultimate Level will find themselves transformed into an animal by artist Adrian Ropp, and drawn into a one-page strip that will appear in THE FILBERT FACTOR #1! Talk about bragging rights! Naturally, you'll need to provide us with a clear photo of yourself, but wow- Imagine what ridiculousness you might be facing in the world of THE FILBERT FACTOR!\n  Stretch Goals\n  You can bet your life that there's going to be Stretch Goals! In fact, Miss Natalie Jane (letterer extraordinaire) will be hand-crafting a little something for our first Stretch Goal, but we'll save that surprise for later.\n  In closing, thank you all for checking out our campaign, and we hope that you'll be intrigued enough to help us fund this really fun project. We can guarantee you that if you're a fan of classic & modern comics, classic & modern cartoons, and classic & modern humor, then you're going to love THE FILBERT FACTOR, and we just can't wait to share this book with everyone! \n  And this just in: Follow Filbert on Twitter @FilbertFactor!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk involved with this campaign is the distinct possibility that after you read this first issue, you're going to be hounding us for the next one, so the risk will be all ours.

With this goal met we'd like to offer a unique stretch goal. Here's what we propose:\nBefore the close of the Kickstarter on April 20, if we raise $25,000, everyone who has pledged on the campaign will receive a FREE download of No Substitute: The RAW original tracks as recorded in 1991 and 1993. These tracks will contain both electric and acoustic guitars, plus all the lead and background vocals where they were added. (It will also contain a number of lead solos that were replaced by Steve on the \"produced\" tracks.) These are the tracks that we all listened to back in September of 2017 that spurred us on to want to finish this project.\nAdditionally, if we make the $30,000 by the Kickstarter closing date we will offer a FREE CD of the RAW No Substitute tracks (in addition to the download) to anyone who has pledged a minimum of $25 (before shipping). The track order of the RAW album be according to date recorded - which is very different from the official No Substitute release. The track order for RAW is as follows (from 1991): \"Rebel Rock,\" \"History Comes Back,\" \"Light of Freedom,\" \"Outside in the Distance,\" \"Surround Me,\" \"Let Me See Your Hands,\" \"No Substitute.\" (From 1993): \"Devotion,\" \"The Kids Cry,\" 1,000 Mile,\" \"Give our hearts,\" \"Revolution of Love.\"\nWhatever happens, we can't thank you enough for getting us to our goal, and past it. We are putting finishing touches on the recording and art as we speak, and God willing, plan to turn masters over to Lo-Fidelity Records for Vinyl and CD manufacturing within the month of May. The campaign ends on Friday night at midnight (central), so share the campaign link and let's see how far we can take this together!\nhttp://bit.ly/TheAltarBoysKickstarter\n~ The Altar Boys / No Substitute ~\nExpect the unexpected?\u201d \u201cWith God, all things are possible?\u201d Well, ya, of course!\nBut come on! A new release from The Altar Boys in 2018? What? How? That\u2019s crazy! And The Altar Boys are inclined to say: \u201cExactly, we're totally surprised ourselves!\u201d\nHere's the backstory: In 1991 and early 1993, Mike Stand made a series of smart and passionate recordings for a future, brand-new Altar Boys project titled, \u201cNo Substitute.\u201d Try as they may, however, the band was never able to release this record. Sadly, it was all but abandoned and thrown on the \u201cscrap heap.\u201d\nFast forward to the fall of 2017.\nUpon the urging of both fans and friends, these recordings were revisited. What was surprisingly discovered was a perfect \u201ctime capsule\u201d that remarkably preserved both the urgency, music, and message of The Altar Boys - as it was, intact, from way back when.\nThis discovery did not happen in a vacuum. Instead, the focal point of this journey finds God temporarily taking something near and dear away from Mike, yet all the while giving him something back with strict marching orders: \u201cTo finish what you started!\u201d\nNow, some 25 years later, what was deemed impossible has miraculously happened...\nWith YOUR help, The Altar Boys will release their long-awaited 6th album: \u201cNo Substitute.\u201d The band genuinely believed it was over, but \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the Rebel Rock message of faith and hope, sent to this world of Rebel Rock Souls.\u201d And so it is, because, as it was then - and now! - there\u2019s \u201cNo Substitute.\u201d\n\nYou have questions - we have answers!\nIs Kickstarter a store? ~ No! For those unfamiliar with Kickstarter ~ this is an \"all or nothing\" fundraising platform.  You pledge the level that you want, and if we make our financial goal ($20,000) we use those pledged funds to finish our record ~ and then you get whatever it is you've pledged for!  If we don't make the fundraising goal, your cards aren't charged and the album goes back into limbo.\n\nWho is playing on this record? ~ The Altar Boys circa 1991/1993 are on this recording, and the record features original guitars and vocals recorded during those years.  The band was/is Mike Stand, Jeff Crandall, Steve Pannier and Mark Robertson.\nThe Altar Boys (1991/1993)\nWhat formats are being offered in the Kickstarter? ~ We are offering Downloads, CDs, and limited edition 180g Vinyl in this campaign. \n\nHow many songs are on the album? ~ There are 12 songs we are hoping to release on download and CD.  10 songs will be on the vinyl (with all 12 on the accompanying download.)\n\nWhat kind/size of T-Shirts are being used in the campaign? ~ Our manufacturer will use BLACK pre-shrunk, 100% cotton, heavyweight Fruit Of The Loom shirts in mens sizes Small through 5XL. We will also produce the design on \"Ladies Cut\" t-shirts in sizes X-Small through 2XL.\nNo Substitute T-Shirt Concept\nIf we meet the goal, how long will it be before you get my album? ~\nAugust 2018 is the projected shipping date. This could change based on manufacturing times, unforeseen delays, etc. This is a projected date - not carved in stone.\n\nWhere can I get more info on this project? ~ The band did a Facebook Live Q&A session and explained the whole project.

Here's what we propose:\n\nBefore the close of the Kickstarter on April 20, if we raise $25,000, everyone who has pledged on the campaign will receive a FREE download of No Substitute: The RAW original tracks as recorded in 1991 and 1993. These tracks will contain both electric and acoustic guitars, plus all the lead and background vocals where they were added. (It will also contain a number of lead solos that were replaced by Steve on the \"produced\" tracks.)  These are the tracks that we all listened to back in September of 2017 that spurred us on to want to finish this project.\n\nAdditionally, if we make the by the Kickstarter closing date we will offer a of the tracks (in addition to the download) to anyone who has pledged a . The track order of the album be according to date recorded - which is very different from the official release. The track order for is as follows (from 1991): \"Rebel Rock,\" \"History Comes Back,\" \"Light of Freedom,\" \"Outside in the Distance,\" \"Surround Me,\" \"Let Me See Your Hands,\" \"No Substitute.\" (From 1993): \"Devotion,\" \"The Kids Cry,\" 1,000 Mile,\" \"Give our hearts,\" \"Revolution of Love.\"\n\nWhatever happens, we can't thank you enough for getting us to our goal, and past it.  We are putting finishing touches on the recording and art as we speak, and God willing, plan to turn masters over to Lo-Fidelity Records for Vinyl and CD manufacturing within the month of May.

At the same time, because our team is small, we will be all hands on deck to fulfill these perks/pledges. Time is valuable\u2014 but we will deliver. We\u2019ve run our own webstore for the last five years, and have experience in organizing and shipping out the perks/pledges in this campaign. However, it\u2019s one thing to say it, it\u2019s another to do it and we will need our full team on hand to not leave people hanging that help us. The main risk involved is the cost of this whole endeavor. There are costs from everything to recording, design, vinyl pressing, t-shirt printing, shipping, personnel, and marketing the record once it is complete. These bills add up quick. We have to make a real budget and allocate it correctly to our needs. The priority will be to delivering what we promise, and the remainder will be used for marketing upon release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "No Perk Pledge", "descp": "Pledge any amount you want and get a virtual high five!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["17 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 11 or more", "title": "Digital Download of The New Record", "descp": "Digital download of the new record.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download of New Album", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["346 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "CD of New Album", "descp": "Campaign Exclusive.
