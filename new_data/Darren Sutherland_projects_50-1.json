Tunnel through the land as The Great Underground Duchy. Infiltrate the hands of your opponents with the Corvid Conspiracy. And, with two additional maps, new and experienced players have never had so many ways to explore Root!   \nIn the fall of 2017, we brought Root to Kickstarter. With your support, we expanded the scope of the game, offering new factions and improvements to the game\u2019s components. It has been an immense privilege and a pleasure to bring Root to market, and we couldn\u2019t have done it without you all. \nShortly after the game\u2019s release, we began to see eager players and designers produce new content for the game. We understood the impulse\u2014even as we had moved to other projects, everyone in the office continued thinking about Root and working on new content for the game on their own.  \nIn the winter, Patrick pitched his concept for a new expansion: two new factions and two new maps, built to expand the possible faction configurations and offer totally new styles of play. Patrick handed the design to Nick Brachmann and Cole Wehrle for final development and, after months of work, the game is ready to share.\nWith this Kickstarter, we want to raise funds to print the new expansion and another large run of existing Root products. In the past, we\u2019ve always done our best to take care of our Kickstarter backers. Root: The Underworld Expansion will be no different. Backers who pledge at a level that includes the new expansion will also get a set of custom Vagabond meeples, a set of resin clearing markers, and an alternative deck (The Exiles and Partisans) for free!  \nIn addition, we\u2019ve got a new set of automated factions built in collaboration with Benjamin Schmauss and his Better Bot Project. And, for our returning backers, we have a full set of new faction boards with the rules updates from the third printing. If you'd like to play with these alterations without buying the replacement boards, you can find the update kit on our website. \nRoot is a fully asymmetric strategy board game designed by Cole Wehrle, lavishly illustrated by Kyle Ferrin, and brought to life by the team at Leder Games. First released in the summer of 2018, Root was the next chapter in our exploration of truly asymmetric game design. Like our previous title, Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different way to win. Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. With creatures and cunning, you'll rule a fantastic forest kingdom in the ultimate asymmetric game of adventure and war. \nIn Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability. \nOver the past year, Root has inspired players around the world. Just check out this amazing video tribute from Boris Ignjatovic and Sanja Ignjatovic. \nThe Corvid Conspiracy ransoms the hands of their opponents by filling them with their agents. Using these agents, the Corvids can trigger insidious plots and advance their own agenda. But as each plot comes to fruition, their hideout must move to a different forest in the Woodland before their great conspiracy is unmasked!   \nFor generations the Duchy extended its reach through the caverns below the great woods. Now, newly elected lords in the Duchy's Parliament have raised a call to explore the lands above. Armies have been mustered and new tunnels prepared for the coming struggle. The creatures of the woods will soon learn to fear the great power beneath their feet.\nThe struggle for dominance continues in the great mountains to the northeast of the Woodland. Fight for control of the narrow mountain pass or dig new tunnels to the great mountain caverns.   \nThe conflict moves west to the homeland of the Riverfolk! Battle for control over the great lake by skillfully managing the ancient riverboat.

Now, with designer Hisashi Hayashi, we bring you the brand new two player experience set in Meiji Era Japan, Yokohama Duel.\nAs before, we are offering up this brand new game is a Kickstarter Exclusive Deluxified\u2122 edition, with upgraded components that are certain to add to the enjoyment of the game.\nIn Yokohama Duel, you and your opponent are merchants in Yokohama, trying to succeed in your business ventures which will gain you prestige. You need to fulfill various goals, which involving amassing copper, silk, tea and seafood, mastering foreign technology, and building shop houses and trading houses. To achieve these goals, you need to run around the streets of Yokohama and gain benefits from the various districts. Also, it may be a wise strategy to employ foreign agents to your side to aid your cause. It is a contest to decide which player can deploy their subordinates the most successfully to become the best merchant in Yokohama!\nYou may notice that the components for the Deluxified\u2122 version of Yokohama Duel are already improved and are not dependent upon Stretch Goals to be upgraded. We are loading up Yokohama Duel with top of the line additions from the get go so all of our backers don't have to worry if they are going to get a full Deluxified\u2122 game with their pledge - they will! - and as the campaign continues, we have several additions in mind that will make the Deluxified\u2122 version even better! \nLook below for the comparison of the Retail version to the Deluxe to see how these components will be upgraded!\nTasty Minstrel Games is of the opinion that amazing games should also look amazing while you are playing them. This is why we offer an upgraded version of our releases when we have a Kickstarter campaign. Ever since we first undertook this process, with the game Orleans, the Deluxified\u2122 versions of our games have proven to be fan favorites, and we think that our Deluxe version of Yokohama Duel will continue this amazing tradition that some of our other games like Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done and Yokohama helped forge.\nThe additional cost for the Deluxified\u2122 version of Yokohama Duel matches our cost to make and deliver it to you, the backer, with no additional profit. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some for convention sales in Limited Quantity. Backing this Kickstarter at the Deluxified\u2122 level is the only way that you can guarantee yourself a Deluxe copy of Yokohama Duel.\nClick on the banner above to read the rules!\nPlease note, these are the original translated rules. They are being reworked by our development team for clarification purposes. \nReprinting Deluxified\u2122 Yokohama!?!  WHY?\nDuring the Orleans Deluxe Kickstarter project, we promised never to print the deluxe version of the game again. After seeing the disappointment of those who missed the opportunity to get Orleans Deluxe, we updated our pledge on Yokohama to allow for that possibility. We didn't expect to produce the Deluxified\u2122 version more than once, but we left the door open just in case we changed our mind.\nWe only make Deluxified\u2122 games through crowdfunding. This approach allows us to cover the additional cost of Deluxified\u2122 components and provide an excellent value to all, while looking forward to the continued growth of our hobby and audience.\nIt pains us to watch people new to the hobby, or new to Kickstarter, miss out on Deluxified\u2122 games. In order to address that, we have decided to open the vault, so to speak. When we feel that the time is right, we will offer select Deluxified\u2122 games through a new crowdfunding project. We do not expect that every Deluxified\u2122 game will come back to Kickstarter, but it feels good to know that we can support our Deluxified\u2122 brand with crowdfunded reprints when necessary.\nAnd for those of you who own a copy of the retail version of Yokohama, we are offering up an upgrade pack that will give you the extra components you need to upgrade your play experience without having to purchase a whole new game!\nPeople have come to expect a premium experience when choosing to support a Deluxified\u2122 TMG game. Yokohama Duel will follow our high quality shipping standard of being bubble wrapped inside a custom fitted box to ensure maximum safety when being shipped to you.. This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy.   \nWhat does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of the above countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places. This is done so that you get your game the earliest we are able to get it to you!  \nFriendly Local Game Stores are an invaluable part of this hobby that we love, and we appreciate everything they do to bring value to the industry. We want to support them in any way we can. \n The $121 pledge level grants you as a retailer an invitation to the Crowdox pledge manager where you can purchase Yokohama Duel Deluxe in case quantities (e.g. 4, 8, or 12). The $121 will be applied towards your final purchase at checkout. \nRetailers are required to finalize their checkout no later than August of 2019. However, you must complete the survey through Crowdox promptly once the survey goes live. This will allow TMG to properly determine how many to manufacture.\nRetailers must have a US based address. If you live outside of the US, please determine a US base address for your freight forwarder. If you haven't done so in the past, you are required to provide TMG with proof of being a retailer. \nAll of us here at TMG realize that a good relationship between publisher and backer during a crowdfunding campaign is paramount for it to be a success. It is our goal to make sure that the communication in the Kickstarter projects run by Tasty Minstrel Games will be among the most active and connected to be found on the crowd funding platform.      \nTo achieve this, TMG will do the following:  \nFor the first 7 days of the campaign, we will post updates at least once every 72 business hours. In addition, during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on weekdays), the comments page will be monitored for questions and those will be answered by the TMG Staff.\nAfter the first 7 days, while the campaign is live, we will update the campaign at least once a week. The comments page will continue to be checked on a regular basis (but not continuously monitored) every day and questions will be answered at those times.  \nAfter the campaign has concluded, any questions about the campaign should be directed through normal TMG support lines, or through direct message on Kickstarter. Updates will be sent whenever new, pertinent information about the campaign can be relayed to backers. If 30 days go by without new, pertinent information, a quick \"all is well\" update will be posted to maintain communication with our backers.  \nAfter the games have been sent to our backers, and fulfillment has been completed, we will consider the campaign to be concluded, and any further communication would need to go through our normal email support lines. \nIt is our mission and our intent that with these guidelines, our backers will enjoy an unprecedented level of connection to the campaign, ensuring a satisfying experience from the beginning of the campaign to the day that the game is delivered to them, and beyond.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

Over 100,000 words of branching story scripts provide many different paths to your goal as well as several different endings to your adventures!\nClick!\n                                                                    click!\n                           click!\n                               click\n                                                   \"The Tainted Grail is easily my most anticipated solo / co-op Kickstarter of the year!

After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience!\nAnd even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling.\nYour characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards.\nRegardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go!\nYou will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike.\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle.\nTo overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting.\nTainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story.\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner.\nCreated by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\nAt Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world.  \nWe also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay.

Since it sold out several years ago, we have received countless inquiries about when it would be coming back, and original copies of the game currently sell for nearly $300 on the aftermarket. From our perspective, it seems demand for a new edition has reached critical mass, and it\u2019s time to reprint. But is it? You decide!\nThis Kickstarter campaign has been created to fund a newly printed, second edition of the LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL] board game. As it is impossible for us to gauge the true demand for the game, speculating on a reprint and distributing it through traditional channels is too risky and could result in a warehouse full of product. So, we\u2019ve turned to Kickstarter to determine the actual demand for a reprint with the express mission of fulfilling orders for backers of this campaign. Thus, the product will not be produced unless we hit our funding goal.\nTo keep things streamlined and deliver the new edition as quickly as possible, no stretch goals or add-ons will be offered through this Kickstarter. \n\u201cThere is no Subterra Bravo.\u201d\nLEVEL 7 is a sinister science fiction setting where nefarious conspiracies conceal the government\u2019s collaboration deep within an underground research facility with an unspeakable alien menace. Officially, the top-secret military base doesn\u2019t exist. There is no record of it: no blueprints, no photographs, no credible accounts. Rumors persist, but no one has ever found it. And those who have dared to look have disappeared\u2026\n\u201cTheir greatest weapon is fear. Yours is an assault rifle.\u201d\nNow overrun with swarms of monstrous genetic creations led by their nefarious alien overseers, the underground facility of Subterra Bravo is the epicenter of an unfathomable government conspiracy\u2014one that must be kept secret at all costs. To cover up the truth, the shadowy agency in charge of the operation has initiated the Omega Protocol, dispatching an elite team of commandos to retake Subterra Bravo and eradicate all evidence of the sinister creatures within. But the threat these creatures and their alien overlords pose may be far greater than anyone can possibly imagine.\nLEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL] is a semi-cooperative tactical miniatures game for 2\u20136 players. In it, a fire team of highly trained commandos sent by an unspecified department within the U.S. government attempts to pacify the situation at Subterra Bravo and the sinister swarms of inhuman creatures that have overtaken the facility. Up to five players take on the role of commandos while one player acts as the overseer and takes control of the creatures inhabiting Subterra Bravo with the goal of ensuring the human intruders know true terror before they meet their grisly fate.\nDuring the game, commandos clash with the overseer\u2019s creatures, and dice rolls determine the results of the conflict. In addition, both the commandos and the overseer manage a resource called adrenaline. Commandos use adrenaline to perform heroic actions; the overseer uses adrenaline to fortify his forces. Careful management of adrenaline is key to winning the game.\nBefore each game, players select one of the missions included in the mission guide. Each mission presents the players with specific objectives they need to complete to win the game and describes the Crisis Point at which each mission becomes more difficult. The commandos will either win or lose as a team while the overseer wins or loses as an individual.\nThe game can also be played as a campaign in which players play each of the nine missions contained in the mission guide sequentially to experience the epic story of LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL]. \nThe EXTREME PREJUDICE expansion and this Kickstarter\u2019s bonus content add new creatures, characters, missions, and game cards to continue your adrenaline-fueled adventure!\nRULEBOOK DOWNLOAD LINK\nDownload the full *First Edition* rules for LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL] here (second edition rules coming soon):\n First Edition Rulebook Download \nTOP TEN GAMES OF 2013\n\u2014Tom Vasel\nTOP TEN SCI-FI GAMES\n\u2014Dice Tower\n\u201cWELL DONE, PRIVATEER PRESS, FOR GIVING DUNGEON CRAWLERS A SHOT OF ADRENALINE.\u201d\n\u2014The Esoteric Order of Gamers\n\u201cEXCEPTIONAL DEPTH AND STRATEGY\u2026LOOKS AMAZING WITH EXCELLENT ART AND SCADS OF MINIATURES\u201d\n\u2014Drake\u2019s Flames\n\u201cANY FAN OF THIS PARTICULAR GENRE IS GOING TO BE QUITE IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE DESIGN.\u201d\n           \u2014Nohighscores.com\n (Included in the Known Enemy, New Operator, and Fully Loaded Reward Tiers)\nTo celebrate the second edition of LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL], we\u2019ve added a new exclusive Commander figure, available only through this Kickstarter, as well as new game cards, room tiles, tokens, and an exclusive white die that can be used with the all-new mission content.

Go to robots.management for the most up-to-date print & play files, release information, and more! \nInhuman Conditions is a five-minute, two-player game of surreal interrogation and conversational judo, set in the heart of a chilling bureaucracy.\nEach game has one Investigator and one Suspect. Armed only with two stamps and a topic of conversation, the Investigator must figure out whether the Suspect is a Human or a Robot.\nRobots must answer the Investigator's questions without arousing suspicion, but are hampered by some specific malfunction in their ability to converse. They must be clever, guiding the conversation in subtle ways without getting caught.\nHumans may speak freely, but may find this freedom as much curse as gift. There are no right or wrong answers, only suspicious and innocuous ones, and one slip of the tongue could land Humans and Robots alike in the Bureau's Invasive Confirmation Unit. There, alongside Investigators who make improper determinations, they will await further testing ...\nCurrent box sketch\nInhuman Conditions is designed by Tommy Maranges (Secret Hitler, Philosophy Bro) and Cory O'Brien (Myths Retold, Monster Prom) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Secret Hitler, Letter Tycoon).\n In each game of Inhuman Conditions, there are two players: one Suspect and one Investigator. The players agree on a theme for the round, and the Investigator is given a series of question prompts related to that theme. Then the Suspect is randomly assigned an identity as either a Human or a Robot. Sometimes Robots are peaceful, and other times they're violent; but their weaknesses always cluster around the chosen theme being investigated.\nRobot catalyzers determine whether the Suspect is Human or Robot.\nAdditionally, the players agree on a penalty that will be face up on the table. Robot Suspects must perform the penalty if they violate their constraint or if they cannot finish their checklist; humans never have a reason to perform the penalty, and should avoid performing it accidentally.\nFinally, the Suspect chooses a Suspect Note, which is a roleplaying prompt that helps the Suspect develop a character for the round.\nThe Investigator always has the same two goals, which go hand in hand: \n Ensure all Human Suspects are properly identified as HUMAN\nAND\nEnsure all Robot Suspects are identified as ROBOT and safely detained. \nThe Investigator loses if the Suspect is incorrectly identified, or if they are killed during the course of their duties by a Violent Robot. \nAll Suspects, robots and humans alike, share one common, overriding objective: Convince the Investigator that you are a human. Any Suspect who is identified as a robot (whether or not that identification is correct) loses. Additionally, robots will have some programming which they must obey. Patient Robots must obey a constraint on their abilities or pay a penalty; Violent Robots must complete a checklist and then kill the Investigator.\nAt any point in the five minutes, the Investigator may declare the Suspect a Robot and order additional testing; a Violent Robot must complete its checklist before this can happen. If, however, at the end of five minutes, the Investigator believes the Suspect is a Human, the Suspect is free to go.\nInvestigators and Human Suspects win and lose together; Robot Suspects only win if they can fool the Investigator.\nIn Inhuman Conditions, nothing happens outside the conversation. there are no cards to count, no votes to track. The conversation is the event. Words don't explain or obscure your decisions; the words are the decisions. It's not just that everything you say can and will be used against you; it's also that there's nothing else you can rely on to defend yourself.\nHide your true nature from the inquisitive Bureau.\nAs a Patient Robot, conceal your true nature. Answer the investigator's questions, avoid certain behaviors, and outlast the Bureau's curiosity.\nPatient Robots must carefully conceal their weakness.\nPeaceful Robots must survive the entire round. For five tense minutes, find new ways to answer questions without arousing suspicion. Discover cleverness you didn't know you were capable of. Volunteer just enough information to throw the Investigator off the scent, without appearing uncooperative.\nAs a Violent Robot, go on the offensive, fulfilling a checklist of items during the conversation so you can kill the Investigator.\nViolent Robots must press the offensive.\nViolent Robots are on the offensive. Find the right opportunities to take control, move your goals forward, and fulfill your objective. Violent robots are more talkative than normal, and you must resist the impulse to strike too early without leaving everything for the very end.\nAs a Human, you must thread the needle. You have nothing to hide, but this works against you as often as it helps. If you're too talkative, the Investigator might think you're trying to kill them; not talkative enough, and the Investigator might wonder if you're hiding a constraint.\nBut remember, the goal is not to give correct answers (there are no correct answers!) but to give answers that don't seem suspicious to the Investigator, no matter how bizarre the character you've created is.\nAs an Investigator, your job is to tell the difference between these three roles. You'll ask pointed questions to expose robotic weaknesses in your Suspect, questions like\n\u201cWhat lie do you tell most often?\u201d\n\u201cWhere, physically, do you feel joy?\u201d\n\u201cWhen was the last time you saw your father cry?\u201d \nLines of Inquiry are provided to help Investigators, but where you take them is up to you.\nOr devise your own questions, improvising on the theme of the round. Watch carefully for behavioral clues: \"Why does he keep talking about dogs?\u201d, \u201cDid they rhyme those two words on purpose?\u201d, and \u201cIs she avoiding discussing her past because it\u2019s painful, or because she doesn\u2019t have one?\u201d\nLearn to focus on what's important, and trust your instincts. You'll encounter Suspects of all kinds, and telling the difference requires the right mix of intuition and knowledge. Sooner or later, everyone passes through the Bureau.\nInhuman Conditions combines the suspense and thrills of social deduction with the possibility and challenge of roleplaying games.\nEach Suspect chooses two cards\u2014the Robot Catalyzer, which determines whether they're Human or Robot, is private. The Suspect Note, which determines the role the Suspect must play, is public.\nSuspect Notes provide the beginnings of a character. Players decide how far to take it.\nIn games like Secret Hitler and Avalon, some event happens, and then players use conversation to make sense of that event.\nIn Inhuman Conditions, every Suspect, no matter what the Robot Catalyzer actually says, must convince the Investigator that they're Human, and the conversation is the only tool the Suspect has. The only way to convince the Investigator that you're Human... is to act convincingly like a human.\nOne of our favorite things about Inhuman Conditions is how playtesters enjoyed re-living the games they just played, hearing the perspective of others and sharing highlights from their inner monologue.\nAs with other social deduction games, players love talking about clues they noticed or strategies they tried. Investigators commiserate with Robots, bemoaning the one thing they wish they had followed up on, or proudly describing the small clues they caught. When Humans win, they celebrate with the Investigators who certified them; when Humans lose, they debate with the Investigator over whose fault it really was that they both lost.  \nBut they also love talking about the characters they created. It's unlike anything we've seen in any other social deduction game we've played. Playtesters consistently stayed late to re-live games and compliment each other on both clever maneuvers and hilarious or chilling characters. We still hear stories from our earliest playtests, and we can't wait to hear the stories from the games you play.\nBecause each round of Inhuman Conditions is only five minutes, players cycle in and out quickly. That means you don't need to decide between playing a game and hanging out. \nWe set out to create a social deduction game for two players, but through playtesting we discovered that the game is entertaining for more than just the two people involved in the interrogation. Inhuman Conditions to be as much fun to watch as it is to play. Playtesters often stayed late, swapping stories and complimenting clever maneuvers or twists that they had witnessed in other playtesters.   \nInhuman Conditions can be played on a quiet night in with a single friend, or at a bigger game night.  \nThe complete contents of the box.

But actually getting the game out into the world is going to be a big undertaking. We want to create a unique experience for players, and part of that is about the components. The stamps, the forms, the box, and the Investigator\u2019s badge all add to the atmosphere, which informs gameplay.

However, only a single player can win. As your coalition becomes powerful, former allies will turn to espionage and political subterfuge in an effort to secure their personal dominance.\nFor as long as I've been thinking about game design, I've wanted to do a game about European Empires in central Asia. This fifty-year cold war between the Russian and British Empires is sometimes called \"The Great Game.\" It's filled with compelling people from all walks of life and is set against a fascinating backdrop of espionage and empire-building. Think about it like a Victorian James Bond. Cool, right?\nWell, as I learned more about the period and about the study of history itself, it was clear that my first impressions were badly mistaken. The drama and romance of the period hid untold volumes of colonial violence. The imperialist policies put in place around the world at this time were unconscionable even by the measure of their own time. This was plainly not a good setting for the adventurous romp I had in mind.\nBut, as I dug further into the period, I started discovering another story, far more interesting than the tale of two European powers jockeying for position on the frontiers of their empires. The collapse of Durrani power in Afghanistan, which I had always understood as a secondary event, was actually the central drama of this place at this time. Though the Europeans played a critical role in the events that ensued, they are better understood as supporting characters in a dynastic struggle that lasted over a generation.\nWith this design, I hoped to reverse the standard tropes about games about empire and direct player's attention towards those struggling to pick up the pieces of their fallen order and build something new. Of course, one shouldn't romanticize them as well. Dost Mohammad was a ruthless and efficient ruler who viewed the British and Russian interests less as fearsome invaders than as regional rivals. He believed (correctly) that he could outlast and out-compete his foes. At its core, Pax Pamir is a game about finding sovereignty in an age of expanding global empires. It's also a game about trying to read and to understand complex geopolitical situations.\nIn preparing the game, I've done my best to consult a wide range of sources. The most important single document that informed this design was Fayz\u0307 Muh\u0323ammad Ka\u0304tib Haza\u0304rah's Sira\u0304j al-tawa\u0304ri\u0304kh. Written nearly two generations after the conflict, the Sira\u0304j al-tawa\u0304ri\u0304kh was the culmination of nearly twenty years of research and unparalleled access to primary documents (many of which are now lost). I also relied upon a wide range of secondary works ranging from popular histories such William Dalrymple's Return of a King to scholarly monographs such as Christine Noelle's State and Tribe in Nineteenth Century Afghanistan. A full bibliography and reading guide will be included with the rules.\nThe nineteenth century has cast a very long shadow over our own moment, and I hope this game, in its small way, offers new perspectives on complicated problems.\nBottom Shelf Board Games has produced a wonderful overview of the new edition that can be seen here.\nNote: The copy of the game featured in this edition uses an old version of the map and prototype components.\nThough Pax Pamir presents players with difficult strategic decisions that reward experienced and thoughtful players, the core of the game is simple. Most turns, players will purchase from a central marketplace.   \nAfter buying cards from the market, players can play them on their personal row of cards (called a Court). Playing cards like this will add new units into play, such as armies, roads, tribes, and spies. Each of these types of units has their own special utility.\nAdditionally, when a player expands their court, they gain access  to new actions which you can use to disrupt the game state. But, be careful, powerful cards on your court will attract the attention of enemy spies!\nPlayers score victory points by developing positions of influence in dominant coalitions. Influence can be gained by offering gifts to their supports, wooing patriots, and betraying high-value targets with your spies.\nHowever, too much infighting will likely prevent a coalition from achieving dominance. If no alliance can secure victory, personal power will be all that matters.\nPax Pamir: Second Edition can be played with one to five players. The game presents very different challenges at each player count.\nWith two or three players, Pax Pamir: Second Edition is a sharp affair, prone to sudden-death victories (in this way more like the first edition). The four and five player games tend to be longer, often extending until nearly every card has been bought. Larger games usually emphasize partnerships and player-to-player synergy, whereas the smaller games emphasize combo-building and diplomatic flexibility.\nIn the solo game, players will square off against an automated opponent. This opponent may be adjusted to be used in the two player game as well. Games with the automated opponent emphasize risk management and a deep knowledge of the game\u2019s core systems.\nThe rulebook for Pax Pamir: Second Edition can be found here. The solo rules are not yet included. Outside of that, the current rule set is complete, but has not yet been finalized. The final rule book will also include design essays, a bibliography, and a reading guide on the period.\nIn terms of components, this new edition improves on every element.\nIn terms of design, the second edition of Pax Pamir has offered me a chance to put into practice the many lessons I've learned over the past few years. I have done my best to simplify and streamline the rules of the game without compromising the game's strategic difficulty or interactivity.\nI have written about the changes of the edition at length here and here. But, briefly, they can be described as follows:\nThough these changes may seem small, fans of the first edition will quickly realize that Pax Pamir: Second Edition is very much its own game. \nI think that the differences can be best described as a shifting of priorities. At its core, the first edition focused on a player's ability to read and navigate an exceptionally difficult to track game-state. The shifting alliances between the players were a secondary concern. In contrast, the second edition elevates those player alliances to the fore. If you are interested in a further breakdown between the two editions, I'd encourage you to read Dan Thurot's excellent preview of the new edition. It can be found here. If you'd like a second opinion, check out Alex Singh's written preview here.\nIn short, though the rules are dramatically shorter and the design itself has been streamlined, Pax Pamir: Second Edition should not be mistaken for a light Pax game. While the new design is easier to teach, I think it remains a difficult game to master.\nIf we are able to raise sufficient funds on Kickstarter, Pax Pamir: Second Edition will be published by a new company, Wehrlegig Games. Our objective is simple: publish beautiful games with historical themes that treat their subjects and their players seriously. These are games that make arguments and encourage discussion. They don't shy away from difficult subjects.\nBecause we know the audience for such games is limited, in order to make sure we produce games up to our standards we have decided to rely on a direct sales model. The vast majority of all copies produced will be sent to Kickstarter backers. Hopefully we will be able to produce some additional copies which we will sell directly and to some retailers (MSRP $75). However, there are no plans to have this edition of the game enter regular distribution channels. This means we can spend many more resources on the game's physical production without having to worry about retail viability.\nCole Wehrle is a published writer and game designer who currently serves as a staff designer at Leder Games in Saint Paul. Before working in the board game industry, Cole earned his PhD at the University of Texas. His research concerned the ways that the British Empire influenced narrative structure in the nineteenth century novel. He has presented at conferences all over the world and taught classes on a wide range of subjects, from Classical Rhetoric to American Postmodernism. He is perhaps best known for his historical board games (An Infamous Traffic and John Company) and for his recent design, Root.\nDrew Wehrle is the older of Cole's two younger brothers. He has helped Cole develop every game he has ever designed. During the development of the first edition of Pax Pamir, Drew lived with Cole in Austin, Texas and was instrumental in preparing the game for publication. Drew will be handling all of the business and operational elements of Wehrlegig Games, as well as assisting in game development. He currently lives in Chicago where he is the School Programs Coordinator at the Chicago Botanical Garden. \nTravis Hill is a freelance board game rulebook editor, coffee connoisseur, corgi wrangler, and public high school educator. He co-hosts Low Player Count, a discussion-based podcast on 1-2 player board games. You can find all of his work here. After working on John Company last year, he is thrilled to work with Cole on yet another project.\nLily Zhu is a published writer on games who studied nineteenth century science and the British Empire as well as the digital humanities at the University of Texas at Austin. She and Cole hosted a brief podcast on games and politics while working together at the Digital Writing and Research Lab. Lily will be coordinating marketing strategy and customer service for Wehrlegig Games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production of Pax Pamir: Second Edition is a passion project for all involved. Cole, Drew, Travis, and Lily all are employed elsewhere, and work on this production will be limited mostly to evenings and weekends (and, for Cole, very early mornings). If the labor this project requires exceeds the amount of time we have allocated for it, we will not hesitate to hire help.\n\nCole and Drew will be overseeing the bulk of the project. Over the past year we've developed partnerships with folks around the gaming industry, and we have contingencies in place for every element of the project's production and fulfillment. This is the fifth game Cole will have shepherded through the development and manufacturing process.\n\nAt this point, Pax Pamir: Second Edition has been in active development for six months and all principal design is complete. Over the next few months, Drew and Cole and their playtesting teams will continue to fine-tune the deck balance and make small alterations. We will also oversee the completion of automated opponent for the solo and two-player variant games. We have built a lot of padding into our schedule to absorb any development delays.\n\nIn terms of the physical production, all of the artwork has been assembled and the vast majority of the game's graphic design is complete. Certain funding goals will demand additional graphic design work, but time has been allocated for these goals and built into the schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "FOR RETAILERS.

The book pays tribute to the amazing pixel art, product design and graphic design associated with this iconic 8-bit system. The book is officially licensed by SEGA and is the first book of this kind to be released for the Master System, ever.\nThe full range of visual compendium books\nThis will be the sixth visual compendium from Bitmap Books. Previous titles in the series on the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, ZX Spectrum, NES/Famicom and SNES/Super Famicom have all been met with critical acclaim, most notably with the ZX Spectrum book, which won gold at the 2016 Roses UK Design Awards.\nAs the name suggests, within each compendium the visuals are the main focus, with 200-word soundbites of text accompanying each game spread. This may be a quote from the game\u2019s original developer or artist, a review from a well known journalist, or even a fan recounting their favourite gaming memories. Within each book you'll also find a series of larger features and interviews with developers and artists, ensuring a great mix of visuals and words. Overall, each these books contains around 60,000 words and hundreds of iconic images; each one is a perfect coffee-table art book.\nAll of our books are produced by graphic designer Sam Dyer. Hundreds of man hours are spent making sure each and every page looks as good as it possibly can; colours are impeccably balanced and the presentation is perfect. The best printers and binders are used and little extra touches are added here and there to make each book a beautiful thing to own, read and collect. As standard, all books now come shrink-wrapped.\nBackground \u80cc\u666f\nThe Master System was originally released as the SEGA Mark III in Japan in 1985, and was a direct competitor to Nintendo's Famicom home console. Despite an impressive library of SEGA arcade conversions - such as Space Harrier, After Burner, Out Run and Enduro Racer - the Mark III couldn't match the popularity of the Famicom, even though it possessed superior hardware and featured some great ideas, such as the 'My Card' format \u2013 a credit card-sized alternative to cartridges that were smaller in capacity but more affordable.\nIn 1986, SEGA rebranded the Mark III as the Master System and launched it in North America. Visually similar to the Mark III, the Master System was clad in a black and red colour scheme and came bundled with the arcade classic Hang-On and the light gun shooter, Safari Hunt. Sadly, the story was very much the same as it was in Japan; the Nintendo Entertainment System had such a stranglehold on the video game market in North America that the Master System failed to gain serious traction and ultimately lost out to its 8-bit nemesis.\nFast-forward to 1987 and the Master System launched in Europe to huge success. Territories such as the UK were very computer-oriented at the time and Nintendo had yet to make serious inroads in the region; the result was that uptake on the Master System was huge, thanks to the affordable price tag and promise of an 'arcade experience in your home'. The Master System was no stranger to a wealth of weird and wonderful peripherals throughout its lifespan. These included items such as a pair of 3D glasses, a handlebar controller for racing games, the iconic 'Light Phaser' and the trackball Sports Pad.\nThe console also saw success in other countries, most notably Brazil, where it has a very loyal fanbase and is still manufactured and sold to this day. This presence in Brazil has been driven by the company Tectoy, which published notable games throughout the '90s such as Baku Baku Animal, Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat 3.\nWhile it's fair to say that the Master System didn't have the most successful lifespan when compared to contemporary rivals but historically it remains vitally important to SEGA's development as a company, and the release of its most successful home console, the 16-bit Genesis/Mega Drive. The Master System gave SEGA valuable experience of converting their arcade games for home consoles, and this became the foundation for the astonishing worldwide success that was to come just a few years later. The library of games on the Master System is modest in volume, but packed full of quality and home to some of video gaming's most iconic franchises, such as Alex Kidd, Fantasy Zone, Shinobi and Phantasy Star.\nThe book \u76ee\u6a19\u306e\u672c\nSEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium measures 170mm x 230mm and will be printed lithographically to the highest standards. This ensures that colours in the book are really vibrant and pages have a high-quality, luxurious feel to them. As standard, all visual compendiums now come with a spot varnished cover and a spot varnished protective dust jacket. The binding is 'thread sewn' which means that the book can lie flat so the imagery can be fully enjoyed. The binding does not use glue which can crack over time and result in loose pages. Thread sewn binding is the best available.\nSEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium will be available in softcover and hardback editions, both 364 pages long. The page count will grow if more stretch goals are hit. Our previous two books on the NES and SNES ended up having well over 500 pages! Most stretch goal bonuses - such as additional pages, slipcase and gatefold pages - will apply to both the softcover and hardback editions.\nSEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium is being created by an experienced and talented team of writers, designers and artists. Sam Dyer is overseeing all design and the overall art direction and project management. Steve Jarratt (Total!/Edge/Sega Power) is overseeing all copy and is the book\u2019s editor. Damien McFerran (Nintendo Life/Eurogamer) is in charge of writing the features and facilitating developer interviews. Craig Stevenson is creating a suite of bespoke pixel artworks that will be used throughout the book, emulating the Master System pixel style and palette.\nContent \u5185\u5bb9\nWe're delighted to announce that SEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium will include a foreword written by Mark Cerny \u2013 programmer, game designer and most recently the Lead System Architect of the Sony PlayStation 4. Mark's career snowballed in 1984 when he designed Marble Madness at Atari. He then went on to work for SEGA in Japan, where he was involved in the launch of the Master System. While there, Mark designed the innovative 3D glasses, created original titles such as Missile Defense 3-D and handled some excellent ports such as California Games and Shanghai. We've also been lucky to interview Mark for the book and will go into detail regarding his time at SEGA, and his memories of the Master System.\nThe book then provides an overview of the creation of the Master System and sets the scene for what is to come. This section is a mixture of words, images and pull-out quotes.\nFor roughly half of the book, each spread features an image of a game accompanied by a 200-word review/critique. In total, more than 100 games across the various regions will be included. Due to licensing restrictions, not every single game for the SEGA Master System will be able to be included, but rest assured, we will be doing everything we can to gain the necessary permissions to ensure that the most famous games make the cut.\nAlso featured in the book will be a series of features written by Damien McFerran (Nintendo Life/Eurogamer), covering topics such as arcade conversions, the groundbreaking 3D glasses and the console's amazing success in Brazil. These feature sections will be a great contrast to the visual game spreads and will contain around 3,000 words each.\nWe will also interviewing a selection of key individuals that worked with the Master System. As it currently stands, the interviewees include Mark Cerny and current SEGA employees Mutsuhiro Fujii (planner of Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier), Takashi Shoji (a programmer in the Master System era) and Rieko Kodama (designer and artist of Phantasy Star and Alex Kidd). These interviews will provide a unique look into the development of games and life at SEGA in the mid-'90s.\nAs with the other books in the compendium series, we will once again be photographing a wide range of systems and peripherals. All the key hardware will be photographed and presented in a beautiful way, showcasing the iconic product design that became SEGA's trademark during this era. For the photography, we have been lucky to work with a very dedicated Master System collector (@segacollect) who has kindly gave us access to his impressive collection.\nThe book will also showcase the very best box art for the SEGA Master System, covering all regions. The Japanese box art had a very different look to the western designs and used a metallic gold border instead of the famous black and white, grid-style background. Each box art will be accompanied by a 200 word critique.\nOne of the things that made the Master System so unique were the 3D glasses peripheral. Designed by Mark Cerny, these glasses were incredibly advanced for the time and used shutter technology that has most recently been used by television companies manufacturing their own 3D specs, some 30 years later! Each book will come with a free set of 3D glasses and there will be a section of games with a '3D effect' applied to them. This effect isn't an exact replica of how the actual SEGA 3D glasses worked, but it will at least give you a taste of what it would have been like seeing these games on your TV back in the '80s.\nContributors \u8ca2\u732e\u8005\nSo far, we have a handful of contributors who will be writing in the book, and as the project develops, many more will be added. These contributors, more often than not, were the actual people that made the games, so they can offer some great anecdotal stories and insight that won't be found elsewhere. Also on board to write game reviews will be past and present game journalists such as Julian Rignall (Mean Machines Sega), Steve Jarratt (Total!, Edge, Sega Power) and Andy Smith (Sega Power).\nThroughout SEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium, we will once again be working with John Szczepaniak \u2013 author of The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers Volumes 1, 2 and most recently 3. John has incredibly supportive of our work and we\u2019ve come to an agreement where we can use his interview content in the book. This is great news as we now have access to interviews with some truly legendary Japanese developers.\nOccasionally, it will not be possible to quote the original development team, so in these instances, we will be using text from existing interviews which is completely standard practice and all sources will be credited appropriately. We would like to thanks the great folks at shmuplations.com who we've worked with to gather some great translated Japanese interviews.\nPerks \u7279\u5178\nThis campaign features a selection of unique rewards that will hopefully appeal to SEGA fans. These range from unique box art postcards to the chance to own your own spread in the book and review a game of your own choice.\nBox art postcards (over pledge by \u00a35 to add to your pledge)\nWe've created two sets of postcard packs that can be added to your existing pledge or can be pledged for as their own tier. The first set features iconic imagery seen on the Western box art and the second set feature images from the Japanese boxes. These postcards are printed lithographically to very high standards and are then presented in a protective sleeve. They are not cheap digital prints; they are printed on high-quality uncoated paper stock.\nBlueprint poster (over pledge by \u00a315 to add to your pledge)\nHere's a unique chance to own a technical drawing of the Master System. This illustration is based on drawings from SEGA and would look great on the wall of any SEGA fan's gaming den. The poster is A2 (594mm x 420mm) and comes rolled (not folded) in a heavy-duty poster tube.\nClose-ups of the A2 blueprint poster\nBitmap Books t-shirt featuring Alex Kidd (over pledge by \u00a320 to add to your pledge)\nHere's a chance to own an official Bitmap Books t-shirt featuring Alex Kidd. Each t-shirt comes in its own polybag. Sizes available are as follows: Small - 35/37\" // Medium - 38/40\" // Large - 41/43\" // Extra Large - 46/48\" // Extra Extra Large - 50/52\". \nPlease note that you'll be asked in the backer survey (sent once campaign ends) to supply your required size.\nHave your own spread\nSomething we do throughout all our visual compendiums is to invite backers to pick their favourite game to be featured in the book. The backers get to write their own 200-word review for the spread. This is a unique opportunity to have your name in print and, in your own words, talk about your memories and thoughts on a particular game. However, please note that you will need to supply a list of five games in order of preference, and your words will be professionally edited to suit the style and tone of the book.\nStretch goals \u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c1\u30b4\u30fc\nIf the book goes past its \u00a350,000 target, we\u2019ve devised a series of stretch goals that will happen if the below amounts are reached. Basically, the more funding we get, the better the book will be for you!\nIn total, 8 gatefold spreads and loads more pages will be added to the book if the stretch goals are met. Gatefold pages (as used in our previous NES and SNES books) are additional fold-out pages which mean that you can effectively have four pages in a row. These are ideal for showing a beautiful game level map!\nGatefold spread showcasing a level map\nWe will also be adding bookmark ribbons and special Pantone ink upgrades into the stretch goals. The two bookmark ribbons will be red and blue to match the Master System logo and will only be included on the hardback. Pantone inks are essentially a much more vibrant ink option. In previous books we've introduced special Pantone golds, silvers and fluorescents. Is this book, we're proposing to upgrade the blue and red (from Master System logo) to Pantone.\nColour-matched bookmark ribbons (hardback only)\nAt \u00a3100,000 the book will come in a printed heavy-board slipcase. Those who have seen our NES and SNES books will be familiar with this style of heavy-duty slipcase. The slipcase will be applied to both the softcover and hardback editions.\nHeavy-duty slipcase\nFurther stretch goals will be dependant on the success of the campaign and will be announced in due-course. Essentially, the more the campaign raises, the better the book will become.\nBudgets \u4e88\u7b97\nDue to the associated costs with licensing deals such as royalty payments, the campaign target for this campaign has been set to \u00a350,000. This is the minimum required to deliver the proposed 300 page book. A large proportion of the budget goes on print and an even higher amount of tracked shipping. What's left goes on making sure the people who've worked on the book are paid appropriately and the various other printed items. Anything over the minimum \u00a350,000 will be reflected in the stretch goals such as adding pages, special print techniques and the slipcase for example.\nTimings \u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\nBased on the Kickstarter campaign finishing at the end of July, The books will be delivered in February 2019. The PDF (that everyone gets) will be delivered in November 2018.\nThis may seem like a long way off but I've built in plenty of time for the official sign-off from SEGA. So this may be sooner if the process is faster.\nShipping \u767a\u9001\nAll books will be sent tracked. You will receive a tracking number as soon as fulfilment starts. We have tried to keep shipping to minimum \u2013 the UK is \u00a32, Europe in \u00a37 and Rest of World is \u00a310. These prices are heavily subsidised by Bitmap Books to keep costs as low as possible for you. We use a professional fulfilment house for all pick and pack. This minimises any issues that occasionally come up with Kickstarter fulfilment. I will be working with the fulfilment house to devise the best packaging solution. All books will be shipped in a protective book wrap, have hard plastic corner protectors and then be inserted into a waterproof poly bag. The feedback we consistently hear is how well our books are backed.\nPlease note that you will incur NO customs charges for importing the book. Books are zero rated and we clearly declare the contents and low value on the fascia to avoid charges.\nPartners \u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\nWe are delighted to be working some key partners throughout the campaign and I wanted an opportunity to say thanks for their help and support.\nA special thanks to GamesYouLoved who have been major supporter of me and my books.

Be afraid. Be very, very afraid....\nBack for another bite is this reprint campaign for Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition, and the undead are just drooling to meet you. Arm yourself with a weapon or three, grab plenty of supplies, and go, guns blazing, into the chaos!\nNew to Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition are three fantastic, tension-packed Expansion Packs to aid you in your fight against the unrelenting horde of Zeds!\nNOTE: The reprint of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition includes all original gameplay stretch goals except for No Brains Mode (the rules can be downloaded for free here and the game mat for free here!). There are no stretch goals for the expansions, as we decided to include everything from the very beginning!\n   \"Why Dawn of the Zeds has stayed in my collection...\" - A review and testimonial on BGG.\nThings are far from good in Farmingdale. Some kind of virus or poison is turning ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. You must lead citizens and emerging heroes to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, attempt to coordinate the discovery of a cure, and preserve as much of the area and as many of its inhabitants as possible. There's no time to lose\u2026.  \nDawn of the Zeds: Third Edition is a cooperative States of Siege\u2122 board game for 1-5 players that plays in 90-120 minutes. Your heroes must defend Farmingdale and its five outlying villages from the encroaching horrors. These heroes are supported by civilians (some armed, some heroic) and what little outside help is forthcoming. You must prevent the Zeds incursion from reaching the town center or causing so much chaos around Farmingdale that the government abandons it (and you)!\nThere's a whole world to experience for players new to the apocalyptic city of Farmingdale. For players who have experienced Dawn of the Zeds in previous editions, there are plenty of new things to discover as well.\n1-5 players\nCo-op, solitaire, and versus game play\nSix expanding levels of game play\nHeroes with unique abilities\nTruly cinematic game play experience\nCheck out how Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition plays in our Peek & Play video below!\nYou can take a look at the Basic Game Rulebook here, the Level Up! Rulebook here, the Farmingdale Dossier here, the A to Zeds Book here, and the Set Up and Epilogue Book here!\nCheck out the playlist of introductory videos from our Zeds Enthusiast, Lines Hutter, who gives a great in-depth tutorial on the game.\nThe first Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition Expansion Pack features 4 new characters (3 heroes and 1 heroic civilians), who are stepping forward, ready to confront the Zeds.\nCheck out their Dossier page here (NOTE: This is a late beta version. This document is complete, but layout, proofing, and small corrections are being finalized)!\nThe second Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition Expansion Pack features 13 new Outbreak! (blue) Level Event and Fate cards, broadening the narrative and gameplay excitement. Zeds are learning to move in new and unexpected ways, catching the citizens of Farmingdale unaware and, at times, unprepared. \nIn addition, a new hero has arrived. No one knows what \u201cBouncing\u201d Betty Bolivar is fighting for, but what they do know is the single-minded destruction she is capable of.\nCheck out her Dossier here (NOTE: This is a late beta version. This document is complete, but layout, proofing, and small corrections are being finalized)!\nThe third Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition Expansion Pack features two new game systems. In the first, Refugees are more helpful than ever as they bring with them Rumors about incredibly useful items for the ongoing battle. All 16 Rumor chits provide heroes with special goodies or abilities when discovered. \nThe second game system features two trains operating from the town's rail junction, providing heroes with new modes of transportation and unique strategic pieces on the chessboard at the Battle for Farmingdale.\nYou can read the rules about the new game systems here (NOTE: This is a late beta version. This document is complete, but layout, proofing, and small corrections are being finalized)!\nIn Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition, it is the cards that drive the story. There are several types of cards, each with a unique function.\nEach Hero card lists that Hero's unique gameplay abilities and backstory. The mix of Heroes dictates your strategy for defeating the oncoming Zed horde!\nEvent cards narrate and illustrate the game\u2019s story, manage some of the game\u2019s AI (artificial intelligence), and create those wonderful/dreadful moments that can only happen during a zombie apocalypse.\nFate cards add even more variations to the game's story (sometimes for good, sometimes... not). Fate cards also trigger unique plot twists, which must be dealt with before resuming the struggle to save Farmingdale.\nReference cards provide quick information about several types of units; Research cards allow the possibility of discovering the cure to Z.E.D. and the innovative Super Weapon; Heroic Civilians are Civilians with special abilities.\nPlease note! If you want multiple copies of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition or the Expansion Packs, they will be available in a pledge manager after the campaign has been completed.\nThe initial launch of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition was much more successful than we anticipated. It is presently sold out in most places and commanding impressive prices on the secondary market! To follow that up, we have three whole new expansions for those who already own and enjoy Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition.\nAnd if you missed the base game, this campaign is your chance to reserve your copy and also get the new Expansion Packs at the same time!\nShipping will be charged through a pledge manager after the campaign ends while the games are in transit from the printer.\nWe are working with Ship Naked to get the best possible shipping rates for everyone. Essentially, this is done through shipping zones. The shipping zone that you live in determines how much shipping you will pay. This is much cheaper for you than if we were to ship everything from our office in Irvine, CA and allows us to provide discounts that we would not be able to provide otherwise.\nIf you receive additional charges for receiving your package, please send us a message here on Kickstarter or to info[at]victorypointgames[dot]com and include a copy of your customs receipt. We will reimburse you via our pledge manager or Paypal.\nPlease note that the following list is for estimated shipping rates for 1 copy of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition (estimated shipping weight 6 pounds), 1 set of three expansion packs (estimated shipping weight under 1 pound), and one of each (base game + expansion pack set):\nPlease be aware that the list above are estimated shipping rates. We will do everything we can to aggressively pursue the lowest shipping rates for everyone.\nThe following licensors have partnered with us and will be publishing Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition:\nFrosted Games German language version: Preorder here\nMaldito Games Spanish language version: Preorder here \nNote that these publishers will have their own terms of service.\nRefund Policy:\n100% refund is available within 14 calendar days of the end of the campaign.\n90% refund is available before production begins (10% is retained due to non-refundable Kickstarter fees).\nNo refunds are available once our fulfillment service begins preparing your shipment.\nReplacement Policy:\nWe are happy to replace missing or damaged components. Please send us photos of the damage, your mailing address, and we will ship you a replacement at no cost to you. We can only provide replacement pieces as long as a title remains active in our store. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date that the pledge was delivered.\nYou may return new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a refund. You will be responsible for shipping the item back to us. Upon receipt of the undamaged item, we will provide a 90% refund.\nKickstarter Terms and Conditions\nBy pledging to our project, you acknowledge that the the final appearance, materials, etc. of the rewards are subject to change.\nShipping is charged through a pledge manager when the product is finally assembled and en route to fulfillment depots. You will be notified of this through a Kickstarter update. If you do not confirm and update your pledge (with a final address, shipping costs, etc.) within 8 weeks of being notified that shipping is due, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. Unconfirmed pledges and payments cause significant logistics problems and create other long term issues.\nWhen you confirm and finalize your pledge through our pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility ends when we ship the order to the address you have provided. Although as mentioned elsewhere here, we will reimburse you for any extra charges you pay to receive your package.\nAny pledges that are finalized after the 8-week deadline will likely be shipped from the United States and may incur increased shipping costs for this reason. In addition, significant delays in finalizing pledges may result in increased shipping costs if shipping rates have gone up in the meantime.\nPlease do not pledge if you do not agree to these terms.\nWe Follow Kickstarter's Community Guidelines\nWe love being able to present our projects on Kickstarter and to work with the enthusiastic backers in this community! We strictly adhere to the Kickstarter Community Guidelines. If you violate these guidelines by behaving abusively or spamming, we will refund you in full and cancel your pledge without notice. We want to thank the 99.9% of our backers who provide a positive, respectful, and lively dialogue on our projects!\nBulk Orders\nAnyone who would like to place a bulk order, such as retailers or distributors, should contact us directly at info[at]victorypointgames[dot]com or through Kickstarter and we will be happy to work with you to get you set up with whatever you need. Proof of business authenticity will be required.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the nature of out-of-house printing, it can be difficult to pinpoint a time when a finished project will be printed and delivered to you.

Allow us to run you through the story so far...\nEscape the Dark Castle is a simple, fantasy adventure game with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling and player cooperation \u2013 perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 30 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.      \nPlayers take the roles of prisoners on a quest to Escape the Dark Castle, and must work together to overcome its many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card. \nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete challenges. \nThe goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nAfter our first campaign in 2017, we released Escape the Dark Castle along with the first expansion, Adventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight. Now we're back with a selection of new expansions and add-ons to further expand and deepen your adventures. \nThis game has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn.

Players will now encounter event cards in the item deck which trigger the arrival of one of the Companions. Each Companion has a unique mixture of traits and a special ability. They are powerful allies but their presence may be fleeting, so prisoners must choose carefully how and when to call on them. \nIn the most confined, twisting passageways; in the vaulted eaves of the highest towers; in the fetid air drawn sharply into your panicked lungs \u2013 there will you find his creation.

As they explore the labyrinthine castle passages, players can now encounter Carriers, plague-infected lunatics bent on spreading the disease.

The Death Knight himself, legendary swordsman and the one they call \u2018Lord of Decay\u2019, has risen to prominence. The weak and the mindless flock to his banner, twisted by his dark influence into powerful, feral fanatics. They say he sends curses to crawl into the souls of the weary. Beware the curses, prisoner. Beware the Death Knight\u2026\nContains: \n1 Boss - The Death Knight himself\n15 Chapter Cards - We won't spoil them for you\n3 New Characters - Each especially powerful in one trait\n3 Character Dice - Representing the skills of each new prisoner\n5 Curse Cards - With devious effects to thwart your progress\n1 Cult Dice - Pray you won't need to roll it...\nCard Sleeves\nClear card sleeves specially produced to protect your Escape the Dark Castle collection.\nThere are sleeves for both sizes of Escape the Dark Castle cards: A6 (large) and A8 (small).

He faded from consciousness...\"\nThis is a printed, perfect bound softback book, and includes a free PDF version.Tales from the Dark is designed to fit perfectly into the Collectors Box.\nThe Death Book - \u00a38.00\nAdd a new narrative dimension to your games with The Death Book.\nThis crumbling old tomb contains a contextual 'death scene' for every chapter card in the game - at least, those which are capable of killing a prisoner, and of the bosses too.\n\nNo matter which chapter card finishes you off, you'll be able to flip to the corresponding section of The Death Book and read out all the gory details of your demise. What better way to end a game of Escape the Dark Castle?\n\n\nExcerpt:\n\"You fall to the ground exhausted and delirious. There was no heroic battle, no valiant climax - just too much strain on a body and mind not fit to bear it. Eventually you rise, weak and jabbering with madness, destined to wander the castle in a state of physical and mental ruin, unrecognisable to any who once knew you...\"\nThis is a printed, perfect bound softback book, and includes a free PDF version. The Death Book is designed to fit perfectly into the Collectors Box.\nOriginal Soundtrack - \u00a35.00\nWhether you prefer your atmospheric dungeon-synth on cassette or MP3, you simply haven't played Escape the Dark Castle until you've played it to this!\n\nThis atmospheric soundtrack was specially composed by Escape the Dark Castle co-designer and illustrator Alex Crispin to perfectly accompany gameplay. \n(not final design)\nContains: \nOver 45 mins of atmospheric music on limited edition Cassette, and the MP3 files to download. \nBecome a Prisoner - \u00a365.00\nBack by popular demand, our incredible game artist Alex Crispin will hand draw your exclusive prisoner portrait, fully playable using the dice of whichever core game character you choose to become. \n\nWill you be the Abbot, Tailor, Mason? Choose from any prisoner released to date. Imagine the satisfaction when you Escape the Dark Castle personally!\nHow it works: \nPick the character you'd like to become, then send us a photo of yourself which meets our guidelines. You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item. \nOur \u00a325k funding goal will cover the print run and associated logistical costs of this ambitious campaign. But, if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer you the following freebies and upgrades: \n(All stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP)\nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the Escape the Dark Castle Original Soundtrack MP3 files to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the new and improved Tales from the Dark book PDF file to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get The Death Book PDF file to download free of charge.\nNaturally, the sleeves will be high quality regardless, but what we\u2019d really love to do is upgrade them from the standard material to a matt finish. \nOur books will be a classy production, but if we reach this level of funding it will open up some more luxurious options and finishes to make the print editions of Both Tales from the Dark and The Death Book that little bit more special. \n At this level of funding we'd like to replace the Health Tracker cubes in the Collector's Box with something more thematic. Little skulls perhaps...\nThe Collectors Box includes a 'first player' card we refer to as the 'torch'. Given the chance, we'd like to upgrade this to an object as standard. \nIf you thought the Golden Axe was legendary, wait until you see what is perhaps the most influential relic the gaming world has even known - The Living Stone! We'll add this item card and its custom dice to the Collector's Box as standard. \nEscape the Dark Castle lends itself well to a tasteful companion app, to track health and play the soundtrack to augment the play experience. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. While the best way to experience Escape the Dark Castle will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny the idea of making a digital version has massive appeal. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign.\nAfter an impeccable performance handling our first campaign, we'll once again be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care.  \nWe are EU, USA, and AU friendly, ensuring backers in these locations will pay no extra customs charges beyond the shipping cost itself.\nPlease note: For deliveries outside of these locations, check the rules and regulations on importing goods to your region before you pledge.  \nThe following base level shipping costs will be charged based on your location and pledge level:\nPlease note: Ordering add-ons may increase your shipping charge above the price shown below. You final shipping total will be calculated in Backerit at the end of the campaign, and any excess must be paid before shipping can take place. \nAre you a journalist or content creator?

It takes 1* to 5 players and plays in 20 to 25 minutes per player (average time of +/- 90').\n* During this campaign we decided to include a solo version.\nChina, 1570. China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. The Emperor has inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. Realising the depth of chaos his father\u2019s long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father. \nThe country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. However, the Longqing Emperor tried to eradicate corruption as much as he could, by simply having it officially prohibited, and punishable by death.\nThis measure seemed successful at first, but as we all know, it is not so simple to keep perfect control over one's \u201cloyal\u201d subjects. At the imperial court, the highest officials would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, and instead of simply accepting money, a new custom saw the light of day: the exchange of gifts.\nPlayers take on the role of noble families and will need to offer gifts using an innovative card placement mechanism thus bribing the Officials of the Forbidden City to perform certain tasks for them. Whoever proves to be most \"influential\" will receive the honour of an audition with the Emperor in the Palace of Heavenly Purity.\nG\u00f9go\u0304ng is played in 4 rounds, symbolised by 4 Days. Each Day consists of 3 Phases:  \nThe Morning Phase, where players prepare the game for the coming Day.  \nThe Day Phase, where players perform multiple actions.  \nThe Evening Phase, where players check if they have successfully matched cards in their discard pile with the Destiny Dice.\nWhen it's your turn in the Day Phase, you exchange a gift card on the board with a card of higher value from your hand.\nAlternatively, you can also pay two Servants in order to exchange a gift card \u2026\n\u2026 OR discard another card of equal or lower value: \nWhen playing the right card a player may perform two actions: the action depicted on your card and the action of the chosen location.\nPlayers can choose between 7 different actions: \nTHE PALACE OF HEAVENLY PURITY: Progress towards the Palace of Heavenly Purity and reach an Audience with the Emperor before the end of the 4th Day. \nTRAVEL:  Send your Traveller to cities throughout China to collect taxes for the Longqing Emperor, which come in all shapes and sizes.\nTHE GREAT WALL: Participate in the construction of the Great Wall of China. This will allow you to take part in the Intrigue Benefits and potentially gain VPs and move your Envoy towards the Palace of Heavenly Purity.\nJADE: Buy precious Jade stones to score VPs at the end of the game.\nINTRIGUE: Climb up on the Intrigue track, which counts as a tie-breaker for all comparisons with your opponents in the game. Or you can gain one of the Intrigue Benefits whenever you help to complete the Great Wall.\nDECREES: Gain special Decree advantages during the entire game and/or VPs.\nTHE GRAND CANAL: Send your Servants on a journey on the Grand Canal, to trade with people outside of Beijing. This will grant you all sorts of permanent rewards. \nAt the end of the 4th Day, players receive additional VPs according to their achievements. The player with the most Victory points at the end of the game is declared the most influential Chinese Family and wins the game.\nBut watch out! Players who don\u2019t manage to get their Envoy into the Palace of Heavenly Purity by the end of the game, won\u2019t be eligible to win the game.\nA link to the video can be found here.\nTo subscribe to our newsletter, go to our website and subscribe at the footer of the page.\nThe rulebook of The Forbidden City can be downloaded by clicking on the banner of your language:  \n  Podcast by BOARD GAME CLOSET - Fragment of episode 43:\nItalian Review by Geek.Pizza\nFrench Review by Le Labo des Jeux\nGerman Review by Brettspiel Heroes:\nGame Brewer aims at publishing games of high quality in both gameplay as well as components. Because the highest grade of quality for components is not always feasible when one keeps the recommended retail price in mind, we decided to offer our Deluxe version of the Forbidden City through Kickstarter.\nTo be able to produce an edition with upgraded components, we need your support! \nIf our project gets funded, the number of Deluxe versions made will be limited to the ones ordered through this campaign with some additional ones for replacements and sales at conventions.\nThe Deluxe version may appear in a board game store if a retailer buys it in this campaign. After this campaign, the Deluxe version will not be sold through our regular distribution channels. \nThe only way to be sure you can get a Deluxe copy is to back this Kickstarter campaign. Of course, there will be a retail version as well which will have the best quality of components possible whilst retaining a reasonable price when it hits the shelves of your board game store.\nShipping costs will be added in the CrowdOx plegde manager after the Kickstarter campaign.\nWe do our best to keep shipping costs as low as possible. Below prices include the protection and packing of your game by ourselves or by fulfilment centers at various locations in Europe, the USA and Australia.\nFor the European Union, USA, Canada, China, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, the shipping prices include all duty, taxes and VAT (if applicable). For other countries, extra duty or taxes may apply at delivery, depending on your country's regulations.\nWe provide 2 FREE PICKUP possibilities:\nPICKUP at Spiel '18 in Essen, Germany\nPICKUP at games store \"de Kolonisten\", Turnhout, Belgium\nGroup pledges:\nFor Group Deal 2 (12 games), multiply the shipping cost for 6 games by 2. \nFor Group Deal 3 (18 games), multiply the shipping cost for 6 games by 3.\n We invite retailers to register themselves on our website: https://www.gamebrewer.com/partners/retailers/\nAfter approval of your retailer account, and when this project is funded, you'll be able to pledge both the Standard and Deluxe edition on our website.\nPlease note that after this campaign, the Deluxe edition will NOT be sold through our regular distribution channels anymore. This is your only chance to pre-order the Deluxe edition. \nGame Brewer is a Belgian publisher, dedicated to carefully brewing great board games, that are beautifully illustrated and feature top-notch quality components. Pixie Queen, Chimera Station and Castellum were previously released. Gentes will follow soon, and with this project, we hope The Forbidden City will too.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th Kickstarter. Pixie Queen and Chimera Station (euro edition) have been succesfully delivered. The production of Gentes (campaign lead by Tasty Minstrel Games) will commence very soon.\nIt\u2019s our intension to send all games to our backers in October 2018 and introduce it to the rest of the world at Spiel \u201918 in Essen, the final weekend of October. We\u2019ve made all necessary arrangements with the manufacturer to accomplish this. \nNevertheless it\u2019s always possible that we\u2019ll meet unexpected delays, especially with a very thight schedule like this. Therefore, please note that the delivery time is only an estimate.\nDue to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions, especially outside of Europe, may receive their game later than October 2018.\nIf you chose Spiel '18 in Essen as pickup point, and due to unexpected delays, we can't deliver your reward there, this will be our policy: \nWe may decide to send you the game to your address for free.\nIn all other case, we will offer you these solutions to choose from:\n- Another pickup point on a later date;\n- You pay an extra shipping fee and we send you the game to your address;\n- We refund the total amount of your pledge, including all fees (Kickstarter, paypal...)\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nThis project is being funded in EURO and any refunds processed will be in EURO for the exact amount received in EURO, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nAfter this campaign we\u2019ll use a pledge manager, in which you\u2019ll be asked to confirm your pledge.

You and up to 3 friends play the roles of the surviving leaders and must defeat the armies of Vesh over a series of 7 stories. Each story offers a unique puzzle and has optional objectives depending on how long you want to play.\nThe game features full character customisation, worker management, board exploration, roleplaying-style quests and strategic combat designed for replayability. Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThis Kickstarter adds four new World Packs to The City of Kings allowing you to pick and choose the new content you want to have:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma  \nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nSide Quest Pack 1\nHero Pack\nEach Character Pack contains 2 new playable heroes with advanced skills, a new 3 story adventure, and more terrifying creature abilities creating new puzzles for you to solve. \nThe Side Quest Pack tells you more about the world by adding 50 new side quests to The City of Kings, introducing the new \"Get To\" and \"Build\" quests to the game.\nThe Hero Pack adds 6 miniatures to The City of Kings, so you can replace your hero standees with beautifully sculpted miniatures.\nFor those of you who already own The City of Kings, an Upgrade Pack will be sent to anyone selecting the \"Create your own\" or \"World Packs\" tiers containing free copies of the updated Rulebook and Quick Reference booklets.\nDigital versions will also be made available shortly after the campaign for anyone who would like them.\nIn addition to new content for The City of Kings, during this Kickstarter we are offering our new standalone game, Vadoran Gardens for the very first time!

Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\n12 Scenarios\nThe 12 scenarios provide quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go  \nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.  \nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\n Creatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love. \nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes.

Old V\u2019Sheel, the High Priestess of the Vadoran Gardens is retiring, and maybe one of you will take her place. Go out into the gardens, study her lessons in Life, Nature, and Wisdom to prove yourself worthy of such an honor.  \nVadoran Gardens is a standalone competitive card-drafting and tile-laying card game, set in The City of Kings universe. Players take it in turns to play cards while trying to connect similar tasks such as feeding animals, watering flowers and cleaning relics, as they try and complete the lessons set by Old V'Sheel.\nVadoran Gardens is played over 10 rounds, in each round you will be set a lesson restricting the cards you can play.  \nOn your turn, you will pick up the card you selected on your previous turn (or during setup if it\u2019s the first round), and then place 1 card in front of you.\nThe first card you play will be placed on the table, every following card you play must overlap the last column of the previously played card. The card does not have to overlap all 3 squares in the last column, but it does have to overlap at least 1, giving you 5 options each turn.\nAs you explore the gardens, you will want to connect areas of grass, soil and water to score points and avoid the sand. You will need to connect animals, flowers and statues in specific ways to complete achievements while trying to return lost animals, pendants and tools to their homes.\nOnce you have played a card, you will then need to place your Player Token on the card you want for the next round, this decides both the card you get and turn order for the next round. You will always know what cards you have available for this round and the next, along with what restrictions will be in place, so forward planning is essential.\nYou can download a draft version of the rulebook here.\nIf you would like to get both Vadoran Gardens and The City of Kings then please select the appropriate tier for The City of Kings content you would like, and increase your pledge by \u00a317. You can do this when you select your reward by manually increasing the amount shown by \u00a317, and at the end of the Kickstarter we will ask you to confirm the \u00a317 is for Vadoran Gardens. \nShipping for Vadoran Gardens will be free, when added to any The City of Kings or World Pack rewards.\n You can read the full article by Creaking Shelves here.\n All shipping is EU, America, Canada and Australia friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Brazil due to their customs regulations.

We will be running more playtests as the Kickstarter campaign runs, but we expect any further changes to be minor. \n\nArtwork\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few tokens and bits of graphic design to finish off for the expansions but otherwise we are good to go. \n\nMiniatures\nThis will be the first time we include miniatures in our campaign, but we have chosen to work with the same company that is used by CMON to produce their miniatures and are confident the end result will be amazing.\n\nEditing\nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now is copy editing and proof readings of all the new content and rule updates to make sure we catch as many spelling mistakes as possible. We\u2019ve allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nManufacturing\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in the first print and we are confident in their ability to manufacture a great second print.\n\nShipping\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during the first campaign, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other. There were a few minor issues which we have learned from and are confident our fulfilment partners will deliver on time.\n\nFinal words\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The City of Kings was an incredible journey, we all learned a lot and I hope you will join me in this next stage of the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Follow along with updates and take part in The School of Games!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["611 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Create your own", "descp": "If you would like a custom selection of World Packs, addons and Vadoran Gardens then this tier is for you!\nUse the \u201cFull Customisation\u201d menu on the campaign page to choose your items, add up the total and pledge here.\nShipping will be added after the campaign based on the shipping prices shown at the bottom of the page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["227 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a317 or more", "title": "Vadoran Gardens", "descp": "One copy of Vadoran Gardens.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Vadoran Gardens", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["168 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a367.50\nAll the new content for The City of Kings, for those who already own the game!\nINCLUDES:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\nSecond print upgrade pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,374 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "The City of Kings", "descp": "MSRP: \u00a375\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["182 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3155\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter and all Deluxe upgrades!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["175 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3109 or more", "title": "The City of Kings & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3142.50\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3145 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3222.50\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter, all Deluxe upgrades and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,301 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Chapter 2 complete", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nIt is time for us to wrap up the campaign, by now everyone should have received their games and I want to thank you all for the incredible journey that has been Ancient Allies and Vadoran Gardens.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

Extra room is provided in the center section should you desire to sleeve the cards.\nThe wood establishment platforms conjure the look of an old western storefront. Since each platform is stained and laser cut, the wood grain and color will be slightly unique in each copy of the game. The platforms are laser cut in the negative space, so each letter and design comes outwards.\nThe ten wooden dice each use custom designs instead of standard dots. Each colored dice corresponds to a gun in the game and has different values depending on the gun. Each die is colored and engraved.\n Nine wooden stars act as the pawns in the game.\n The dice and stars come in a faux leather bag.\nThe 9 characters are based on people who actually lived in or visited Deadwood in 1876. Character biographies are included in the rule book. Each character card is colored on the front, and black and white on the back.\nThe 20 Safe cards are designed to look like genuine safes from the 1870's.\nEach of the 50 Deadwood cards contains a gun on top and a special item on the bottom.\nIn Deadwood 1876 you\u2019ll use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!\nNote: The video above gives a brief overview of rules. Strategy tips, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, card descriptions, and character biographies are all included in the game rule book. We currently have rules available to view in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch on our website. You can also view the contents of this page in Chinese.\nValuable items are hidden behind each Safe. You won't know which Safes have been shuffled in, so every round will play out differently.\nEach player always has 4 Deadwood cards in their hand. You'll get to play one card from your hand each turn, and then it will be replaced from the deck.\nEach card can either be used as the gun listed on top, or the special item listed on the bottom. The Holster lets you help out teammates, the Stetson lets you view hidden Safes, the Horse lets you abandon your team for a different one, and the Duster lets you improve your hand of cards.\nThe more powerful guns, such as the Messenger, have higher values on its dice, whereas worse guns, such as the Pepperbox, have lower values and zeros on its dice.  For shootouts you'll need to manage your hand and decide when to use a powerful gun and when to gamble with your weaker guns.\nEach player takes on the identity of one of nine people who actually roamed the streets of Deadwood.\nA game in progress.\nThis game requires teamwork, but also actively punishes you if you play too nice. That balance makes every round insane. - Sam J.\nMix strategy with the best and the worst of the Wild West, and you get Deadwood. - Charlotte C.\nThe strategy never gets old and I consistently find myself playing with new options every single game. -Spencer H.\nBackstabbing has never been so much fun. This game keeps you on your toes. It is not one you can play half-heartedly. -Abigail S.\nThe more I play Deadwood, the less likely I am to trust other players. When I trust them too much, they take my gold and shoot me with a gun they stole from me. I always regret it. -Patti S.\nIntrigues of Deadwood 1876 video from Beasts of War.\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\nMechanics\nDeadwood is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best Deadwood cards and Badges to hunt down Gold for their team, they\u2019ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates in the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Showdown Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight, they\u2019re probably plotting to use your Gold to reach the Final Showdown and then destroy you! There may come a point when you need to attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\nTheme\nWhen we were searching for the city for the 3rd Volume in the Dark Cities Series, we fell in love with Deadwood almost immediately upon learning about it. Large deposits of gold were discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota in late 1875. Word quickly spread about the gold and the town of Deadwood was born almost overnight in early 1876. It soon reached a population of 5,000 miners, gamblers, prostitutes, outlaws, and businessmen. Lawlessness was prevalent as people flocked to the town to find (or steal) their share of the gold. Deadwood quickly became an infamous western town where old west legends lived and died.\nThe book has a raised UV effect so that all designs and logos pop out from the cover and spine.\nDesign\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players into the world of the wild wild west! We used wood and leather textures with our components, old west Victorian charm with our book and character cards, and cards that look like antiqued metal Safes built by the \"Facade Safe & Lock Co\" similar to Safes from the time period. The goal of our design is to take you and your friends deep into the raucous, chaotic, exciting world of Deadwood, South Dakota in its prime. You can view time-lapse videos of Sarah illustrating Molly Johnson, Solomon Star, Seth Bullock, Kitty Leroy, and the Holster.\nWe've already made many \"premium\" choices for the game (wooden platforms instead of cardboard, faux leather bag instead of plastic, wooden star tokens instead of standard pawns, faux book instead of standard box, etc.), because we believe in publishing awesome games regardless of funding amounts. But if we reach the following milestones, we'll be able to make Deadwood 1876 even better!\nNote: Some of these upgrades will be exclusive to the 1st Edition of Deadwood 1876. Backing on Kickstarter is the only way to guarantee that all upgrades listed above will be included in your copy of the game.\nWe've been working hard on logistics all year and for this campaign we're very pleased to offer free US shipping at all reward levels, and low international shipping rates. We are also using fulfillment companies around the world so that you won't be charged extra customs fees. If you are mistakenly charged customs fees when the games arrive, just let us know and we'll pay you back. (For EU backers, we will be shipping games from Germany so you won't have extra customs fees)\nBecause of cheaper shipping, we\u2019re happy to be selling Deadwood 1876 at prices that are even cheaper than the early bird levels of our previous two Kickstarter projects!\nDeadwood 1876 is Volume 3 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. \nVolume 1: Tortuga 1667 (Published 2017 thanks to Kickstarter!). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website. Tortuga was recently nominated as the best party game of 2017 by Board Game Geek!\nVolume 2: Salem 1692 (Published as \"Salem\" in 2015 thanks to Kickstarter! Second edition published as \"Salem 1692\" in 2017). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website.\nBoth of our released games have sold over 20,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 4, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! See Add-Ons section below for details.\nIf your pledge includes at least one copy of Deadwood 1876 then you can add an unlimited amount of Tortuga 1667, Salem 1692, or extra copies of Deadwood 1876 to your pledge! Just add the indicated amounts below to your pledge amount without changing your reward level. After the campaign we'll send out a survey where you'll select which games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section or shoot us a message.\nYour shipping cost does not increase at all regardless of your location or the amount of add-ons you order. You will receive all add-on items at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery October 2018).\n Examples:\nYou are outside the US and want 2 copies of each game. Select the $43 reward level and pledge $129 ($43 two-copies reward level + $6 reward level int'l shipping + $40 two add-ons of Salem + $40 two add-ons of Tortuga).\nYou are in the US and want 6 copies of Deadwood, 1 copy of Salem, and 10 copies of Tortuga. Select the $110 reward level and pledge $300 ($110 six-copies reward level  + $20 Salem add-on + $170 Tortuga large group add-on). \nIf you want Deadwood and Salem, Deadwood and Tortuga, or one of each game, we have reward levels available for those options.\nOur illustrator Sarah Keele wants to turn you into a Dark Cities character! During the campaign Sarah is offering a limited number of discounted custom portraits in her shop! We will then turn this portrait into a card that you'll be able to use during game play in your copy of Deadwood 1876!\nCustom Character Cards are also available in her shop for Tortuga 1667 and Salem 1692. Discounts are also available in her shop during the campaign for other art from the game.\nFollow her instagram for other giveaways and discounts.\nWe will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account on April 10th using the CrowdOx pledge manager system. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey at this link anytime after April 10th: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/travishancock/deadwood-1876-a-safe-robbing-game-of-teamwork-and\nGame creation and graphic design is by Facade Games, owned and operated by Travis and Holly Hancock (and our little cheerleader Margo).

Follow her beautiful artwork on instagram.\nPhotography was by Jes Childress. See more of her pictures at her website. \nA huge thank you to the hundreds of hours put in by our many play-testers. This game would not exist without your ideas, feedback, and criticisms. Thank you!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem. We had another great experience with the launch of our second game, Tortuga 1667. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the very 1st edition of the game, the lowest shipping costs we can offer, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We also take your feedback into account before launching production. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! We will do everything in our power to achieve on-time delivery, and we will reach out concerning any unforeseen circumstances. Our first two projects, Salem and Tortuga 1667, were delivered on time to backers as promised. \n\nSalem: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior at the same time as my first kickstarters.

It's up to you to decide what to do with the goods: Keep the cargo, trade it away or sell it!

You'll need help from another captain to clear the transaction. Hopefully the other captain decides to help you launder the money, but beware, they could just as easily call the fuzz!\nAssist: Every ship needs starside assistance from time to time. Working as a tow-ship isn't glamorous, but it can help pay the bills!\nBOOM! It takes a special kind of captain to load a bomb onto their ship. You'll be given a target, but no one's going to stop you from detonating your munitions whenever you see fit!

The primary risks involved are:\n\n-Manufacturing Delays: I have worked with our manufacturing company PandaGM on my previous projects. They are a well known and reputable manufacturer. I will work with PandaGM to minimize manufacturing delays, which are often caused by incorrect file preparation for printing, or coloration issues. Since this is my fourth project I am confident we will overcome any unforeseen manufacturing issues with minimal delays.\n\n-Manufacturing Defects: Panda GM has a 99% guaranteed defect free rate for their products. However, they also account for the 1% of defects by sending me replacement parts. Should you have any issues with your copy, simply let me know and I'll get you replacement parts as soon as possible!\n\n-Shipping Delays: There is always the possibility of shipping delays - I hope to minimize these by having a solid logistics plan in place.

Did you miss your chance to play it when the original edition was available? Did you play a friend's copy and can't understand why it ever went out of print? Did you play your own copy into ragged pieces like we did? Whichever one of those is true, or if this is your first look at the game, welcome to the campaign! It is a dream come true for us to bring this game from Jarratt Gray and Carl de Visser back to gamers everywhere!\nEndeavor: Age of Sail is a strategy board game set in the historic Age of Sail. Starting out in the crowded hub of Europe, you must struggle to dominate at home while sending ships to the closed regions of the world... and be ready to seize control when they open up! You'll compete to grow the most successful empire through a smooth combination of:\narea control (capture key cities and the routes that join them!)\nresource collection (get the assets to build your empire!)\nengine-building (construct the buildings to power your strategy!)\naction management (use your population and trade tokens wisely!)\nThe elegant gameplay is driven by five different actions (Occupy, Ship, Draw, Attack, and Payment), and five different attributes (Industry, Wealth, Culture, Influence, and Glory):\nThe way you build, combine, and manage those elements creates your empire. Your challenge will be to navigate the maps of the world as they unfold, and write the history books so that the Age of Sail describes your victory!\nFor a detailed description of gameplay, see the How to Play section below. \n      Endeavor: Age of Sail preserves everything about the original edition that you know and love. The satisfying pacing which begins briskly but grows richer and deeper with every turn, the always-interesting breadth of the choices available to you, that feeling of the world unfolding as the game progresses, it's all still there. And it's all driven by that surprisingly lean ruleset which draws its complexity from the interactions and tensions that it creates. So how did we improve on this? Let's take a look:\nExploits are the major new gameplay addition unique to Endeavor: Age of Sail. Sure you can play the game without them (and for your first play you probably should), but once you play with them you'll never go back!\nIn each game you'll deal out three random Exploits (or choose three you enjoy playing with). Like the regions of the world, Exploits are locked at the start of the game. Each Exploit is a historical event from the era that is related to two of the regions on the board. When both of those regions are opened during the game, that Exploit becomes unlocked, and players may now begin interacting with its unique mechanisms and scoring opportunities.\nFor example, the Spanish Main Exploit is related to North America and South America. When those regions open up, that means that the Spanish Main is now occurring in the story of our game. Players may now use the Exploit's actions to Fortify their cities using the provided tokens (making them costlier for foes to attack), and once they've fortified, can trigger a powerful mid-round payment of workers back home! In addition, a new scoring opportunity opens up. Amazing! \nEach Exploit comes with its own immersive new abilities and strategic possibilities, and the game includes all of the special components that are needed to carry them out. This exciting variety of possible Exploit combinations means that every game will drive player interest towards different regions of the world, and create new pathways to victory even for seasoned veterans!\nPlayers command major seafaring empires during the historical Age of Sail. You have your own player mat, where you track your empire\u2019s attributes, construct buildings that permit you actions in the game, and gather Asset cards to build your attributes and gain Glory!\nEach round, you\u2019ll construct one building (based on your Industry level), gain population (based on your Culture level), pay workers to free up buildings (based on your Wealth level), take actions, then manage your cards (based on your Influence level).\nAt the start of the game, player actions are mostly limited to interacting with Europe; using your population to activate your own buildings, you\u2019ll draw Asset cards to increase your abilities, and occupy Cities to gain their Glory and assets, and to control the valuable links between them.\nSoon enough, you\u2019ll construct buildings that permit ship actions, and this allows you to reach out to the closed regions of the world. By shipping to a region, you can begin drawing cards from that region; when its shipping track is filled up, the valuable Governor card is awarded and the region becomes open. An open region\u2019s Cities and links can be competed over just like Europe\u2019s.\nEventually players will run out of room to expand, and if you\u2019ve built buildings with attack actions, you\u2019ll be able to engage in combat. Drive your opponents from the cities they\u2019ve claimed, to deny them the city\u2019s Glory points and to break up their network of profitable trade routes!\nOnce seven rounds have passed, the game comes to an end and scores are tallied. You\u2019ll earn Glory for:\nHow well you\u2019ve improved your four attributes (Industry, Culture, Wealth, and Influence)\nThe Cities you occupy and the links you control\nGlory symbols on your cards and buildings\nSpecial scoring opportunities from this game\u2019s Exploits\nThe player whose empire has accumulated the most Glory wins! \n           Tom's Playthrough\n Tom's Final Thoughts\n       ...plus glowing praise for the original edition of Endeavor:\n\"A very elegant design with easy to grasp, easy to teach mechanisms. Rich choices of actions on a rapidly evolving world map. No randomness beyond initial setup. Plenty of strategy and tactics packed into a 75 minute play time window. A definite 10 after repeat playings. Bravo!\"\n~Thorwolf (bgg user)\n\"A fantastic game - just the perfect level of depth for non-gamers to grasp reasonably well, but plenty of room for strategizing as well! Well done to the designers! So many paths to victory - and each so beautifully balanced.\"\n~superbgg (bgg user)\n\"I was surprised at how simple Endeavor is. It looks so thinky and complex, but the game play is actually quite easy. What sets it apart is the uniqueness of its mechanics and how it covers its historical theme in a way that is much more complete and accurate than most games with the \"Age of Discovery\" theme.

Created by the same design team who brought you the Zombicide series, under the supervision of Eric Lang, HATE combines the gruesome artwork of Adrian Smith with exquisitely sculpted miniatures to immerse you in a universe of cruel survival by any means.\nTake control of your tribe and lead them in battle against your opponents. Each battle pits two tribes controlled by different players, clashing against each other to achieve objectives, massacre the enemy, and reap rewards from blood and land. As the Chronicle unfolds, players engage each other in numerous clashes in an effort to defend or conquer territories, trying to be the ultimate Tyrant and rule the wastes of the world. While the HATE core box initially allowed for up to 4 players to fight through a Chronicle together, more tribes have since been unlocked allowing the game to expand to up to 6 players. Explore the 4 original core Tribes here: Um'Gra, Um'Rak, Um'Kator, and Um'Cal.  \n  Find out more about these Optional Buys in these links: The Mother Prophecy, Tribe of Vore Nash, Tribe of Um'Tull, Tribe of Sarrassa, Battlegrounds of HATE, HATE Art Book, 3D Plastic Plateaus, 3D Plastic Huts, 3D Plastic Trees, Red Dice.\nThe Tyrant - Only a worthy tribe will be led by this legend, all others will cower under his hateful gaze.\nEach battle in the Chronicle has consequences, not only in terms of the control of the land, but also in the tribes that fight for it. Killing your opponent in merciless fashion and reaping all that which the land has to give increases your tribe's Hate and Resources. These then allow your warriors to gain new skills, turning them into ever more formidable killers as the Chronicle progresses. You will also be able to bolster your village, giving your tribe extra abilities and features to use in both short and long term. However, dismemberment and death may also be your fate in the battlefield, and you will also need to carry the burden of that in your struggle for power. \nTribe of Um'Gra - Blood-frenzied maniacs, their recklessness is their greatest strength, though it can often be their weakness.\n  The world of HATE is brutal, and is recommended for mature audiences only. The art of the game depicts acts of extreme violence, as well as nudity. To survive and thrive in this barren wasteland, you'll need to embrace the savagery of not only massacring your enemies, but taking innocents captive, torturing them, and even feasting off their flesh. You've been warned, this is not a world for the faint of heart!\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Gra.\nEach tribe is composed of 11 characters: 2 Youngbloods, 6 Warriors, 1 Shaman, 1 Champion, and 1 towering Prince. (The last belong to the Varn, a \"higher\" lineage of men, who grew monstrous as the ages passed, by feeding on the lesser kind.) Each of these have different stats and starting skills, offering their own tactical choices in battle.\nThe Character cards show your tribe's initial skills and stats.\n  Tribe of Um'Rak - Hive minded, they move as one, to strike like a horde.\nEach tribe also counts on their own unique deck of 8 Tribe cards that they can employ at different points of the battle, usually by spending gathered Savagery tokens. These cards reinforce each tribe's individual nature by offering powerful bonuses and abilities to outmaneuver your enemies.\nTribe cards can often turn the tide of battle.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Rak.\nWhen a player challenges another to battle, they choose among 10 different scenarios to play, depending upon how close they are to conquering the heart of the land. Each scenario contains a different terrain setup, as well as different objectives the attacker and defender must accomplish in order to be victorious, and different rewards they may gain from that.\nTribe of Um'Kator - Jacks of all trades, they are relentless and always prepared for changes in the tide of battle.\nBattles are fast and furious, taking around 40 minutes to play. Players maneuver and activate their characters around the board to crush their enemies and reap rewards. Ganging up on an opponent is a sure way to bring them down, or hinder their attacks. Use terrain to your advantage, holding the high ground to dominate your foes. Pillage huts you find to steal their resources or capture any innocents hiding within (being careful of possible ambushes), and harvest withering trees for the meager resources they may yield.\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Kator.\nIf you happen be knocked out in battle, though, you had better pray your allies keep your limp body safe so you may live to fight another day. If you're carried off by the enemy, a fate worse than death awaits you (usually followed by death). At the end of a battle, captives are dragged to the villages, where the sadistic choice of whether to torture them to death (to gain Hate) or kill and cook them (to gain Resources) is made.\nTribe of Um'Cal - Fearless berserkers, they leave a trail of blood where they go, even if some of it is their own.\nAt the end of each battle, all Hate and Resources gained by each tribe is tallied in the Chronicle sheet. Every few of these gathered unlocks a milestone, which allows you to upgrade your tribe in several different ways. Resource milestones help you upgrade your village. Your tribe's Village sheet shows the buildings you have, and the ones you can build, as well as upgrade. The more you upgrade your village, the more resourceful your tribe becomes. The Forge offers you several Feats of Savagery that can be activated during a battle by spending Savagery tokens to gain different bonuses. The Hall of Heroes allows you to conscript Mercenaries to your tribe, the Training Grounds allow your characters to learn extra skills, and the Shaman's Hut gives you more control over your Tribe cards. At the end of each battle, you may use your Chiurgeon to heal your warrior's scars, and the bigger your Oven and Torture Pit are, the more enemies you can cook or torture!\nVillage Sheet.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Cal.\nMeanwhile, Hate milestones allow you to choose Upgrade cards to add to your characters (those that have proven worthy in battle). These dozens of transparent cards contain a myriad of different skills for you to choose, including 6 of them which are exclusive to your tribe. The character cards are all protected by plastic sleeves, allowing you to simply slide the Upgrade card on top of them. Each character may have up to 4 different skills, becoming a legendary fighter. But be careful, such legends can still be killed and erased from the Chronicle.\nAdding an Upgrade to a Warrior.\n  Mercenaries come in all shapes and sizes, with varied abilities. They have their own goals, but you can force them to join your tribe!\nBeing wounded in battle can have drastic consequences. Any characters knocked down on the battlefield (those lucky enough not to have been dragged off and roasted) must make a roll to determine their fate. They may come out of it unscathed, or suffer a tragic death, but more often than not they'll go on carrying a scar to remind them of their failures. These can range from a mental debilitation, to a gouged eye or torn off limb, with the penalties associated with that. Scars are added to characters similarly to Upgrades, possibly cancelling a skill the warrior possessed!\nAdding a Scar to a Warrior.\n  The Mercenary figures, and the imposing Tyrant.\nOnce the Chronicle is over, how much Hate and Resources you accumulated, as well as the strength of the territories you conquered, will determine who becomes the Tyrant that rules the world, while their enemies cower under their merciless feet!\nExample of an epic battle between 4 Tribes!\nUPDATE: With the Stretch Goals unlocking an extra board and extra components, the game will also allow players to use a set of Optional Rules that introduce, at certain points of the Chronicle, massive battles involving more than 2 players. Form alliances in 2x1 or 2x2 battles, or go crazy in a free-for-all slaughterfest!\nDue to its violent, adult content, we have decided to make it so the entire HATE board game is Kickstarter Exclusive (or other crowdfunding platforms). This means the core box and any of its ancillaries can only be acquired through Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms, and will not be made available to stores through normal distribution channels. Limited quantities will be available to retailers who want to make a Retail Pledge to this campaign (see below), but if you're interested in HATE, this campaign is the only guaranteed place to get it.\nThe HATE miniatures are 32mm scale. However, the Princes and other members of the higher race are gigantic figures standing about 75mm tall! The pictures shown in the campaign are of resin copies, while the figures that will come in the game will be high-quality pvc plastic.\nOn the left is a resin figure, and on the right a first test sample of the plastic figure. As you can see, the detail already holds very well, even with improvements still being done to the mold.\nGame Components:\nAt the start of the campaign, the HATE core box includes:\n51 Highly Detailed Miniatures\n1 Game Board\n30 Terrain Tiles\nOver 100 Cardboard Tokens\n32 Tribe Cards\n51 Figure Cards\n88 Transparent Upgrade/Scar Cards\n44 Plastic Card Sleeves\n6 Custom Dice\n13 Counter Bases\n5 Scenario Dashboards\n1 Village Sheet Pad\n1 Chronicle Sheet Pad\n1 Rulebook\n  WIP RULEBOOK - Please note this is not the final version of the rules.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\n                                                                                            Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $60-$70 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $80 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n $35 to Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n $60-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n  To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE. Keep in mind this will be the only chance for retailers to grab some copies of this game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 29th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is January 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, and Massive Darkness. The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde are on their way to backers.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: wave 2 of Zombicide: Green Horde, and A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of HATE.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features.

And we need YOU to help make #HipHopHistory!\nThis will be the third major anthology produced by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings that tells the story of a defining era of music \u201cof, by and for the people,\u201d following the Anthology of American Folk Music and Jazz: The Smithsonian Anthology. It will also serve as an extension of the objects and stories of hip-hop already displayed in the galleries of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, offering perspective on the African American experience and its impact on American culture. The Anthology will be a tool for education as it explores hip-hop\u2019s evolution and global influence.\nDesign subject to change.\nCreating something this ambitious is not easy. The Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap will be the first collection of its kind to include music from all the major labels as well as dozens of independent record labels.\nWe want to bring the Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap to as many people as we can, and we want to make it as affordable as possible once it is available. But the costs of production, research, and licensing are high. That\u2019s where you come in. We need YOU to help make this project a reality.\nMore than 120 tracks on 9 CDs;   \nA 300-page book with 10 essays, extensive track-by-track liner notes, and never-before-published images;   \nA 9th Wonder Digital Remix based on Smithsonian Folkways' catalogue, available exclusively from the Smithsonian through this Kickstarter;\nA Free Digital Album download from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings!\nThe box set will include a 300-page book with extensive liner notes, essays, photos, plus 9 CDs with over 120 tracks. Design subject to change.\nThe Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap will illustrate different social and political trends within the genre, such as police brutality, feminism, and Afrocentrism. It will explore these themes through music from old school pioneers like the Sugarhill Gang and Roxanne Shant\u00e9 to artists of today like Kanye West and Nicki Minaj \u2014 and four decades\u2019 worth of essential names in between.\nThe track list is still being finalized \u2014 a major reason why we need your support! \nThe Anthology was developed by the Smithsonian in collaboration with an advisory board comprised of members of the hip-hop community including artists Chuck D, MC Lyte, Questlove and 9th Wonder; industry veterans Bill Adler and Bill Stephney; author, journalist and music critic Jeff Chang; and university scholars and authors Adam Bradley (University of Colorado, Boulder), Cheryl Keyes (UCLA) and Mark Anthony Neal (Duke).  \nThe committee reached out to more than 50 artists, scholars, DJs, photographers, filmmakers and other members of the hip-hop community for their input into the track list and final package.  \nCey Adams, artist and founding creative director of Def Jam, designed the Anthology.\nThe Anthology is currently planned for release in December 2018. A successful Kickstarter will help us stay on schedule! Backers will also be the first to receive the Anthology, plus receive rewards that won\u2019t be available anywhere else. \nBack and side view.

This includes albums from the African American Legacy Series, a multi-year collaboration with the National Museum of African American History and Culture that explores the rich African American musical and oral heritage in the United States. \nBackers of the project at higher levels get even more bundled with their Anthology, including a cling-on decal of the box set cover art designed by Cey Adams, illustrated hip-hop trading cards, and a subscription to Smithsonian magazine.\nReward designs subject to change. 9th wonder by Chris Charles.

Each print is signed by the photographer and is a limited edition artwork, 15\" x 17\" in size.\nJanette Beckman moved to New York City in 1983 and was drawn to the underground hip-hop scene.

Further, if a cause beyond the Smithsonian's control requires rescheduling or cancellation of an experience, the Smithsonian is not responsible for any additional travel or other costs a backer may incur in order to participate at the new time.

In fact, the Smithsonian was founded 171 years ago by a private donation to the United States government! Federal appropriations provide the foundation of the Smithsonian's operating budget and support core functions \u2013 safeguarding our collections, building operations and maintenance as well as staffing. However, we rely on private donations of all sizes to support many of our priorities, including research, educational outreach and special projects.\nIn other words, your support will make the Anthology possible. By backing the project, you will help the Smithsonian tell the powerful story of hip-hop and its place in American culture. You will truly be the reason it is brought to life \u2013 and we'll keep you involved as we create, design, produce and ship it to homes, including yours!\nYour Pledge Helps Support the Smithsonian\nThe Smithsonian Institution is a nonprofit organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  Depending on your level of support for the project, a portion of your payment may be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

We are dedicated to supporting cultural diversity and increased understanding among peoples through the documentation, preservation, and dissemination of sound. Our collection consists of more than 3,000 albums and 43,000 tracks along with videos, playlists, podcasts, lesson plans for teachers, and Smithsonian Folkways Magazine.\nWe believe that musical and cultural diversity contributes to the vitality and quality of life throughout the world.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game. Nothing else comes close to touching it in terms of its raw, epic scope, ambition and design.\u201d\nRichard Ham \u2013 Rahdo Runs Through\n\"I have over 50 hours of gameplay logged with 7th Continent and I feel like I have just scratched the surface. This is easily the best game of the year, and one of the best I have ever played in my life.\"\nLance Myxter \u2013 Undead Viking\nPlay solo or in a team of up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set-up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure in a single game.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where \u201cyou are the hero\u201d that thrilled so many of us in our childhood.\nNo dice rolls! Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page\n2. On the next screen, click on the \u201cChange your pledge\u201d blue button\n3.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\n \nIf you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys).\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats?\nAfter 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings.

Each player uses their deck of cards to perform up to two actions per round. Actions range from colonization to naval movement, to battle, with most activity centered in Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Players may also purchase additional cards to bolster their decks and provide them with more choices. There are also Strategy cards that players can purchase to give them additional advantages. \nInspired by A Few Acres of Snow, this game features several new elements, including navies and naval battles, cavalry superiority, mercenaries, field battles, sieges, manpower, strategy cards, random events, turn based scoring, bribery and tactical bonuses. The name of the game is based on a quote from a Carthaginian commander, who claimed at the outbreak of hostilities that the Carthaginian control of the seas was such that the Romans would not even dare wash their hands in the sea.\nThe game is played over the course of several turns, up to a maximum of twelve. At the end of each turn, players resolve random events, collect income and score victory points. There are several paths to victory, from simply having the highest score at the end of the game, to capturing the opposing player's capital.\nFor a copy of the version 1.1 rules click here.

When both of those happen then Knight Works, LLC will receive the funds within 14 days of the project end date. At that point, we will begin working with the manufacturer to produce the expansion. Based on previous estimates it will take approximately nine months to receive the game. Once we have the game a survey will be sent out through the Kickstarter website to collect shipping addresses.\nAdditional Copies? - Backers are more than welcome to add one additional copy of Hands in the Sea to the $50 \"General\" pledge reward (or) an additional Upgrade Pack to that $20 reward. All you have to do is add the additional cost of the reward to the appropriate pledge and we will cover the extra shipping cost! (NOTE: You may only add a maximum of 1 additional copy of each specific item and both items must go to the same address. Once again, we are unable to ship more than two games, or Upgrade Packs, per backer. If you are looking for additional copies of the game please check out our \"5 Copies Bundle\" reward.) If you have any questions, or need more than two copies, please send me a private message on Kickstarter.\nRetailers - If you are a retailer and interested in purchasing Knight Works products please contact me to discuss additional discounts. (Note: You will need to provide proof of your physical or online store.)\nShipping? - The cost for shipping has drastically risen over the past few years. To ensure the future success of Knight Works, I can no longer offer free shipping to US backers. The cost for shipping packages overseas has sky rocketed but Knight Works is absorbing a small portion of those costs.\nFor anyone interested, the \"5 Copies Bundle\" reward offers groups of backers to combine their pledge for free shipping to limited areas.\nPlease refer to the chart below for specific shipping information.\n  We started developing board games back in 1999, but it was not until the introduction of Kickstarter that we were able to mass produce games. We have many titles designed, play tested and ready to go. The number one issue in getting those games produced is the high cost to manufacture board and card games. With your help, we can bring several fun, high quality, and thematic games to players across the world.\n100% of the money we gather from Kickstarter will be used to pay for printing costs or the making/delivering of pledge rewards (art, shipping, etc.) If we raise significantly more, the extra funds will go into a larger print run, bringing the cost of the games down, and in upgrading the already existing pledge rewards.\nPlease check out our Facebook page and click \"Like\" on our page at www.facebook.com/knightworksgames.

Thanks to your continued support since then, we've released sixteen great books about classic video games, and we've got so much more planned for the future. \nFor Season 4, we're offering five all-new books by six all-new writers. This time around, every book this season shares one thing in common: unprecedented access to people who made these games. In our first ever Creator Access Edition, you'll meet a diverse group of creators and characters, including:\nFinal Fantasy legend Hironobu Sakaguchi\nMark Turmell's team behind NBA Jam, including announcer Tim Kitzrow\nKnights of the Old Republic Lead Designer James Ohlen and Senior Writer Drew Karpyshyn\nYacht Club Games, the entire team behind Shovel Knight\nthe team behind Postal, and infamous video game film director Uwe Boll\nWe hope you\u2019ll subscribe to Season 4 and join us as we explore these fascinating games.\nFor Season 4, we've enlisted designer Cory Schmitz to give our covers an updated aesthetic that will look great on your shelf alongside all of our previous titles.

With a groundbreaking job system that combined the usual character classes like knights, thieves, and mages with offbeat classes such as chemists, dancers, and bards, the game appeared to be a shoo-in for North American distribution. But the game was dubbed \"too hardcore\" for a Western audience and was swapped out with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, a simplistic new game tailor-made for Americans.  \nThat didn't stop a teenage Chris Kohler from tracking down Final Fantasy V. The young RPG fan got a Japanese copy of the game, used it to teach himself Japanese, and with the help of some internet companions created the first-ever comprehensive English-language FAQ of the game. As the internet narrowed the cultural gap between the East and West more each year, the game was eventually translated into English for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and iOS. \nFans in the West finally got to learn what all the fuss was about. Now the acclaimed author of Power-Up and an editor at Kotaku, Kohler is revisiting the game that started his career in games journalism. Based on new, original interviews with Final Fantasy V's director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, as well as previously untranslated interviews with the rest of the development team, Kohler's book weaves history and criticism to examine one of the Final Fantasy series's greatest and most overlooked titles.\nRead an early excerpt at Kotaku and listen to the author talk about the game on this recent episode of Retronauts.\nChris Kohler is the author of Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life, and the founding editor of Game|Life, the Webby-nominated video game section of WIRED. He is currently Features Editor of Kotaku, and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. \nShovel Knight by David L. Craddock\nIn 2014, Yacht Club Games released its very first game, Shovel Knight, a joyful 2D platformer that wears its NES influences on its sleeve. This unlikely pastiche of 8-bit inspirations manages to emulate the look, feel, and even the technical limitations of nostalgic titles like Mega Man, Zelda II, and Castlevania III\u2014imbued with a contemporary sense of humor and self-awareness. But how is a fundamentally retro game created in the modern era? And what do the games of the past have to teach today's game designers?  \nBased on extensive original interviews with the entire Yacht Club Games team, writer David L. Craddock unearths the story of five game developers who worked so well together while at WayForward Games that they decided to start their own studio. From the high highs of Shovel Knight's groundbreaking Kickstarter to the low lows of its unexpectedly lengthy development, Boss Fight presents a new master class in how a great game gets made. Get ready to steel your shovel and dig into this fascinating oral history. For Shovelry!\nDavid L. Craddock lives with his wife and business partner in Ohio. He is the author of Stay Awhile and Listen, a three-part series that chronicles the history of World of WarCraft developer Blizzard Entertainment and Diablo/Diablo II developer Blizzard North; Break Out: How the Apple II Launched the PC Gaming Revolution by Schiffer Publishing; and HERITAGE, a young adult fantasy novel. Connect with David on Twitter or Facebook.\nNBA Jam by Reyan Ali\nWhen NBA Jam dunked its way into arcades in 1993, players discovered just how fun basketball can be when freed from rules, refs, and gravity itself. But just a few years after Midway's billion-dollar hit conquered the world, Midway, home version publisher Acclaim, and even video arcades themselves fell off the map. How did a simple two-on-two basketball game become MVP of the arcade, and how did this champ lose its title?  \nJournalist Reyan Ali dives deep into the saga, tracking the people and decisions that shaped the series. You'll get to know mischievous Jam architect Mark Turmell, go inside Midway's Chicago office where hungry young talent tapped into cutting-edge tech, and explore the sequels, spin-offs, and tributes that came in the game's wake.\nBuilt out of exhaustive research and original interviews with a star-studded cast -- including Turmell and his original development team, iconic commentator Tim Kitzrow, developers and executives at Midway and Acclaim alike, secret characters George Clinton and DJ Jazzy Jeff, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, Doom co-creator John Romero, and 1990s NBA demigods Glen Rice and Shaq -- Ali's NBA Jam returns you to an era when coin-op was king.\nFollow Reyan's progress on Twitter at @nbajambook.\nReyan Ali is a writer from Columbus, Ohio. He\u2019s been published by Wired, Rolling Stone, Spin, The Atlantic, Pacific Standard, and alt-weekly papers across the country. Born in Dallas, he grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, where he soaked up 1990s NBA action almost exclusively through trading cards, Beckett Basketball back issues, and NBA Jam: Tournament Edition on the Sega Mega Drive. His first writing gig was contributing to the Mortal Kombat Netherealm (MKNe), a fan site long lost to time. At MKNe in 2000, he scored his very first interview: GamePro editor Dan Elektro. Over a decade later, he interviewed Elektro once more -- this time for NBA Jam, his first book. \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic by Alex Kane\nSet in an even longer time ago in a galaxy far, far away, BioWare's 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic wowed Jedi and Sith Lords alike with its compelling characters, lightsaber customization, complex morality choices, and one of the greatest plot twists in video game history. Among the droids and blasters, the game delves into themes like choice, free will, and the construction of identity and memory.\nFeaturing brand new interviews with Lead Designer James Ohlen and Senior Writer Drew Karpyshyn, game critic Alex Kane's book unveils how this classic game was made, analyzes KotOR's worldview through the lens of philosophy, mythology, and the ethics of war, and investigates how the game borrows techniques from contemporary films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Whether you align with the light or the dark side, you're invited to dive into this fun and thoughtful exploration of the most beloved Star Wars game of all time.\nYou can read an early excerpt of the book here.\nAlex Kane is a freelance journalist and critic based in west-central Illinois. His work has appeared in Glixel, Kill Screen, the website of Rolling Stone, StarWars.com, and elsewhere.\nPostal by Brock Wilbur & Nathan Rabin\nIn 1997, game studio Running with Scissors released its debut title, Postal, an isometric shooter aimed at shocking an imagined pearl-clutching public. The game focused on a disgruntled \"Postal Dude\" whose goal is to murder as many people as possible. It was crass, gory, and dumb\u2014all of which might have been forgivable if the game had been any fun to play.  \nPostal gained enough notoriety from riding the wave of public outrage to warrant a sequel. And DLC. And a remake. And, perhaps most surprising of all, a Golden-Raspberry-winning feature film adaptation directed by the infamous Uwe Boll.  \nIn this thoughtful and hilarious tag-team performance, comedian Brock Wilbur & media critic Nathan Rabin mine the fascinatingly troubled game and film for what each can tell us about shock culture & mass shootings, interviewing the Scissors team and even Boll himself for answers. Like it or not, Postal is the franchise that won't die\u2014no matter how many molotov cocktails you throw at it.\nBrock Wilbur is a writer and comedian from Kansas who now lives in Los Angeles. He lives with his wife Vivian and their cat, Cat. He is the author of a forthcoming book about growing up with a adopted Bosnian brother, and an investigative journalism piece where he exposes a cult that has haunted the east coast since the late 70s.\nNathan Rabin is the former head writer of The A.V Club and a staff writer for The Dissolve as well as the author of six books, including The Big Rewind (Scribner), My World of Flops (Scribner), Weird Al: The Book (with Al Yankovic) (Abrams) and most recently 7 Days in Ohio and Kanye & Trump for his own imprint, Declan Haven Books. He is also the proprietor, owner and editor-in-chief of his own website, Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place. He lives in Decatur, Georgia with his wife, dog Ghostface Killah, and son Declan.\nEach campaign, backers get a chance to decide the subject of one of our upcoming books. Thanks to our supporters, we've published fan-selected books on Chrono Trigger and Shadow of the Colossus, and last season's choice Final Fantasy VI is planned for future release. Now it's time for you to pick the next fan-selected Boss Fight Book.\nWhen you back the campaign, hit the comments section and name the game you most want to read a book about. Then, in the final week of the campaign, we're going to tally all the games mentioned and create a shortlist of 3-4 finalists, and you can vote once more on the finalists. From there, we'll put out a call for book pitches about that particular game, and choose the author who we think will write the best book.\nMay the best game win!\n  Since the series launch, Boss Fight Books has been written up in top-tier publications. Check out a small sample of our reviews for last season's books:\nOn Super Mario Bros. 3 (named one of author Dennis Cooper's Favorite Nonfiction Books of 2016): \"Super Mario Bros. 3 is worth a look, especially if that mustachioed plumber holds a place of reverence in your own nostalgic heart.\" - ZAM\nOn Mega Man 3: \"This is a fantastic book for anyone who is interested in the history of Mega Man, Nintendo in general, video game design, the Japanese gaming industry, nostalgia, and excellent writing.\" - E.C. Myers\nOn Soft & Cuddly: \"[...] a love note to all things grungy and bootleg, to everyone who managed to succeed despite standing in their own way.\" - Heavy Feather Review\nOn Kingdom Hearts II: \"[I]t's Alexa's own personal story and attachment to the game's questions [...] that make up the hardest-hitting points of her critiques and analyses over the series. If this is the start to a new age of discussion over the series, I welcome it with an open heart.\" - Kingdom Hearts Insider\nYou can check out our Press page for more coverage, and read some reviews at Goodreads and Amazon.\nTry before you buy!
