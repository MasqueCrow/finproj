[{"backer": "Olivia Dunlap", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In this cooperative arena combat board game for 1-4 players set in an open world, it\u2019s not you who dictates the flow of battle, but the monster you hunt \u2014 and every monster is wildly different.\nPick your hunter based on their unique weapon and playstyle. Select which iconic monster you\u2019ll be hunting across the wilds. Track the beast in a choose-your-own-adventure quest, avoiding pitfalls and gathering bonus resources. Then plunge into adrenaline-fuelled combat where teamwork, positioning, and stamina are key, targeting the loot you need for the weapons you want \u2014 without getting crushed!\nThe more monsters you slay, the better the weapons you can craft, the bigger the monsters you can hunt\nThese massive beasts will roll, bite, body slam, spit poison, submerge you in sludge, and even charge across the board to pin you in a corner, pushing your party members out of the way and forcing everyone to reposition in the process.\nHunt down more information about: Great Sword, Dual Blades, Bow, Sword & Shield\nHunt down more information about: Great Jagras, Tobi-Kadachi, Anjanath, Rathalos\nHunt down information on: Charge Blade, Switch Axe, Insect Glaive, Heavy Bowgun\nHunt down information on: Barroth, Pukei-Pukei, Jyuratados, Diablos, Black Diablos\n Hunt down more information about: Kulu-Ya-Ku\nHunt down more information on: Long Sword Hunter, Hammer Hunter, Gunlance Hunter, Light Bowgun Hunter, Lance Hunter, Hunting Horn Hunter\nKeep an eye on the updates.

Steamforged Games retains the right to sell these in the pledge manager and on the Steamforged website, as well as during conventions and as part of special promotions.\nIt\u2019s time to journey to an uncharted land, because the Astera basecamp needs YOU.\nBecome a hunter of the Fifth Fleet to track down and slay the fearsome monsters roaming the New World. Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts!\nBattle massive monsters in a wild open world.\nWith two complete core sets, playable standalone or together, you can embark on quests in two distinct habitats teeming with native beasts. \nAs you gain more experience, the monsters get tougher. Every beast has three difficulty levels to challenge your skills. Successfully slay a 4-star monster, and you\u2019ll win your campaign!\nWant a one-shot monster fight without the tracking? \nArena quests let you hunt any monster, at any difficulty level, using any hunters, right away. Simply equip your hunters with the recommended loadout and dive headfirst into the fight!\nExplore the lush Ancient Forest...\n\n...the arid Wildspire Waste...\n...or combine sets to expand your world!\nPlay with any combination of hunters and hunt any combination of monsters during your campaign. Because hunters can make equipment from other sets, combining sets opens up a whole new world of weapons and armour for your hunters to craft.\nFind out how the core sets combine\n\n\nBecause hunters are defined by their weapons, every hunter is a different way to play. Where the great sword hunter trades movement for raw strength, commanding respect with its incredible stopping power, the dual blades hunter favours swift strikes and mobility \u2014 dashing in with a flurry of blows before dodging to safety.\nSome video game weapons come with extra special features, like the charge blade and insect glaive. To really squeeze the juice from that Divineapple in the board game, those hunters come with special rules.\nThe monsters you hunt will determine which loot you earn and what weapons you can craft to help on your next quest. So, you\u2019ll need to decide together where to follow the Scoutflies next. \nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a monster, track them through the lush Ancient Forest or arid Wildspire Waste using the choose-your-own-adventure quest book.\nImmerse yourself in the New World, gathering resources, avoiding health-sapping pitfalls, and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment.\nJust like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. The tracks you discover will determine what state you find the monster in, and which special attack is added to their deck.\nEnjoy the beauty of the landscape as you climb trees, scale cliffs, and explore caves for bonus resources \u2014 but don\u2019t get too distracted. Every quest has a time limit. As you hunt, you\u2019ll discard time cards, giving you less time to take down the beast when you eventually track it down...\nDiscover more about the Gathering Phase\nIt\u2019s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these! Every monster is a boss, and every boss is a unique challenge, with different ways of moving, different attack styles, and special rules that will trigger during battle to change things up.\nMonsters dictate the flow of battle, deciding who to target and even taking the first turn.\nLuckily, the more experience you gain, the better you\u2019ll get at predicting the monster\u2019s next move. As you learn their \u2018tells\u2019, the clues on the back of every behaviour card will give you a bigger hint at what\u2019s coming next.\nOnce the monster has made their move, it\u2019s your chance to react! Because these are wild beasts you\u2019re fighting, you won\u2019t always have the same opportunity to act before the monster moves again. \nYou\u2019ll need to decide who\u2019s best placed to attack, who needs to sharpen their weapon, and who needs to get the heck out of the way before the beast strikes again...\nDiscover more on Monster Behaviour\nYour position matters. Monsters have four arcs for their behaviours and their body parts: front, left, right, and rear. Where you\u2019re standing determines whether you\u2019ll get hit, but also what parts you can target.\nBreaking parts can trigger rules that change monster behaviour and earn bonus loot for your whole party, which you can use to craft upgraded weapons for taking on tougher beasts.\nWhen you\u2019re taking on a monster, three things are vital to success: positioning, teamwork, and managing your cards.\nThere are no dice in combat. Instead, combat is controlled by cards which you\u2019ll use to create combos, meaning you\u2019ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina.\nBecause attack cards can also be used for movement and dodging attacks, which also uses stamina slots, you\u2019ll need to make strategic choices about when to play cards and when to keep your board clear.\nKeep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!\nDiscover more on How Hunters Work\n Craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles, swapping cards into your deck to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks.\nChecking potential rewards is key to choosing your next monster quest. Some equipment offers elemental damage and resistance which could help you in a future hunt.\nBecause everything you craft stays in your inventory, switch equipment between quests to give you the best chance against the next beast!\nYou\u2019ll start with a unique attack deck based on your hunter\u2019s weapon and upgrade options you can craft from bone and ore. The more monster loot you claim, the better your weapon choices become!\nDiscover more on Upgrading Your Hunter\nLike the video game, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game is a campaign game. Over multiple sessions, you\u2019ll face tougher monsters, upgrading your hunter and equipment as you go.\nThe more monsters you slay, the better the weapons you can craft, the bigger the monsters you can hunt \u2014 until you\u2019re ready to take on a 4-star monster and win your campaign!\nWith 25 campaign days to spend (more if you're playing with combined sets), you'll need to make strategic choices about which monster to hunt and when. \nWill you hunt tougher versions of the same monster to craft all the weapons you can? Or try a fresh challenge?\nAfter a heart-pounding hunt, you may want to kick back and relax. Spend a few campaign days at HQ visiting the Smithy to craft new equipment, petting the Poogie, and enjoying a meal whipped up by the Meowscular Chef!\nHow Hunters Work\nTracking Monsters\nMonster Behaviour\nUpgrading Your Hunter\nArena Quests \n Combining the Core Sets\n   We\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs. Depending on where you are in the world, your rewards will be sent to you from our hub in either the UK, USA, Netherlands, China, or Australia.\nBelow are rough estimate costs for shipping a Core pledge. The prices shown are best estimates based on current rates but please be aware that global shipping prices are currently very volatile due to COVID-19 and Brexit. Once the campaign is finished and you\u2019ve confirmed your address and any add-ons, your accurate shipping cost will be calculated in the pledge manager.\n\n\n\nSadly, due to customs, import laws, and other restrictions, Steamforged is unable to ship pledge rewards to these locations (see point 10 of terms).\nBecause of the size of the package, we\u2019re also unable to ship to P.O. Boxes.\nKeep in mind that any pledges confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from our UK hub at a later date. For non-UK backers, this will likely increase shipping costs.\nFor the regions listed as \u2018friendly shipping\u2019, we cover any VAT or sales tax charges. So, those are accounted for in the pledge price and shipping estimations. \nBackers in other regions will be liable for any VAT or sales taxes which may be applied in their own countries. There will be no extra costs for VAT charged in the pledge manager.\nBelow is a rough schedule of when you can expect key things to happen once the campaign ends. This schedule should give you an idea of when your payment card will be charged, and when shipping is likely to begin. Because circumstances are different from project to project, this timeline is estimated based on our experience.\n We want to get your rewards into your hands as soon as possible. Because of the potential for unexpected effects on planning and production schedules, there\u2019s a chance you might not get your rewards before the game is available at retail. We\u2019ve packed the core pledge with value for money and Kickstarter exclusives to compensate for any potential delays.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nPlease read the project creator\u2019s Terms before proceeding.

Throughout the game, you\u2019ll improve your magical abilities and learn new spells by exploring the world and talking to your friends.\nStory Mode progresses through various areas of the city, cleaning up different \u201chot spots\u201d where transdimensional spirits have accidentally crossed over.\nOutside of Story Mode, there will be additional game modes -- Time Attack and Score Attack will be available for those up for the challenge. For anyone wanting a chill experience (perhaps to help wind down for the evening), Endless Mode will be available as well!\nBhyg Mode will also be available! It's a local-versus mode where you can compete with up to seven other friends (eight players total) on a wonderfully chaotic shared board!\nThere\u2019s more to life than work, though, and Samar and their friends will have opportunities to hang out, chat, and bond! Depending on who you visit and when, you\u2019ll be able to develop a deeper relationship; plan a pizza party together, go to a concert\u2026 maybe even smooch! \nAs Samar\u2019s bonds with her friends grow deeper you\u2019ll unlock unique dialogue, spells, and items. You\u2019ll also be able to decorate Samar\u2019s bedroom using those trinkets and keepsakes, and each of these will provide different boons to your match-3 strategy, in addition to making Samar\u2019s room feel like home!\nSpirit Swap\u2019s world is inspired by the devs\u2019 love for their Lebanese roots, lo-fi and wired technology, and the 90\u2019s colorful aesthetic with a sprinkle of demonic vaporwave.\nSamar is a young witch working the spirit-swapping night shift in the eastern outskirts of Demashq. A recent spike in spirits crossing over from another dimension breaks the chill atmosphere of their night shift. With her trusty FamiliarZ by her side, she sets off into the city to find out what\u2019s happened. With the popular band, 5SOME, scheduled to kick off their big comeback tour in Demashq, Samar needs to work quickly before the city is overrun with stans and spirits alike....not to mention, they've got a pizza party to plan, and romance to pursue!\nSpirit Swap takes place in Demashq, a coastal city inspired by the Levantine cities of our own world, Damascus and Beirut.\nThe game follows Samar as they make their way from their home right outside the city, by the nearby forest, into the sprawling coastal city of Demashq where they meet their friends.\none of Samar's possible paths through Demashq\nIt reflects the Levant\u2019s general topography, nature, architecture and climate (middle eastern Mediterranean) as well as cultural references, vibrancy, and visual cues.\nA setting seldom explored in games outside the lens of orientalism, and almost never by people from that part of the world themselves.\nSpirit Swap\u2019s in-world magic draws on two main things: plants and community. Plants and nature are the source of all magic and humans when banded together act as amplifiers and users. The world is one parallel to ours where plant magic was democratized around the turn of the millenia instead of wireless communication. Magic and tech have become deeply intertwined.\nIn a world where magic is at everyone\u2019s fingertips, everyone needs a helping hand. For witches and demons alike, Familiars serve that purpose.\nIn the past, summoning a Familiar was a lengthy process.  Charting the constellations, preparing the ritual, and massive energy drain directly following the manifestation of an individual\u2019s soul became less popular in modern times.  Yet, the need for a Familiar\u2019s assistance and companionship did not.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFamiliarZ were created to solve the problem; tech-assisted miniature devices that allow anyone to manifest a Familiar without the expense of magical energy required to sustain it.  With casings ranging from fashionable keychains to portable cassette players, witches and demons choose personalized ways to interact with their Familiar without having to reveal to the public any aspect of their inner selves.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFor press interested in covering our Kickstarter, here are some screenshots and promo material to get you started!\nOur soundtrack and sound design are created by Meltycanon and eyelovebrandon. The audio team is led by Rejon Taylor-Foster.\nFor Spirit Swap, the soundtrack was inspired by the music our team is currently drawn to: lofi hip-hop. We wanted to create a game, and soundtrack, that you truly could relax to!\nPlease keep in mind: the reward images are mock-ups and WIPs, and the final products may look different.

(Animated gif)\nDiscover a colorful sandbox open-world where you can farm wondrous plants, craft tools and shelter, harness the elements, and shape the land around you.\n\nPlay your own way - be clever, be creative or even be mischievous. Befriend strange beasts, dodge dangerous surprises, gather resources, and explore unique biomes to uncover the Secret of the TerraBeast.\nAstor gifts a Mighty Beast their favorite treat.\nYou play as an Astor, a special OddFauna, whose biological imperative is to seek out TerraSeeds. You will have to form a symbiotic bond with your living world, your TerraBeast to discover the TerraSeed's location. Will you seek out the TerraSeed? That is up to you. \nThe world is filled with OddFauna for you to meet.  Chat with them and get to know them. Give them their favorite treats to show you care. Earn their trust and you will receive items, recipes, or maybe even a new party member. Befriending a beast boosts your abilities and making a true friend will grant you a wearable pin which unlocks a new ability.\nMany Beasts are friendly... if you know how to interact with them. Entice them with a special treat, help them to build a shelter, or even ask them to join you on an adventure!\nBeware the beasts that come out at night! And watch out for the ones that may hide in bushes.\n\n\nTiny and gentle, the Sproutling help tend to the Terrabeast and are vital to a thriving ecosystem.\nTransform your TerraBeast into your own adventure paradise. Your Terraform ability allows you to sculpt the ground like clay. Shape the landscape to fit your adventuring needs; create rivers and lakes to play in, raise mountains to gain a better view or create fields to farm your favorite treats. \nSculpt the Landscape like Clay!\nGo even further and alter the temperature, soil quality, and water level of biomes. Create a frozen desert, flooded forest, or arid grasslands.\n\nYour choices have an impact on the other OddFauna. Ovoks love forests, Logurs need lots of water, and Trico's love it hot! Create a new habitat and new OddFauna will migrate and create a cozy home for themselves. \nYour growing ability allows you to craft astounding plants.  You have control over how they are shaped which grants you the freedom to use them for shelter, food, infrastructure, or just their beauty. \nEach crop has a season in which it can be grown. You will need a crop strategy to ensure that you have enough food and resources for the whole year. Being prepared for the start of the growing season will give you a head start on exploring!\n\nCreate your own unique flora by combining different seeds. Cross-pollinate to yield more fruit, improve quality, or to change the color of your plants.\nHandfuls of berries, huge delicious fruit, yummy earth roots, and many more!\nGather and grow resources and craft them into handy items for your adventures.  Craft tools, sandbox toys, shelters, and accessories to adorn yourself.\nBuilding a shelter not only replenishes your energy, but it also protects you from the creatures that lurk in the dark.\nEverything in the world abides by the rules of nature. You can interact with everything you see in the world. Burn with fire or replenish with water, it is your choice. Experiment with different combinations of elements to make new discoveries.\nBurn with fire & freeze with ice\nEvery action you take has an impact on the world. It is up to you to decide how to treat your world. You may choose to go on a fire-wielding rampage and burn down entire biomes. If you want to remedy your actions, you'll have to get your paws dirty and plant a new forest.\n\nAllowing your TerraBeast to become unhealthy will present some tough challenges. Blight will begin to appear, spread, and destroy everything it touches. As weather events intensify, you\u2019ll face lightning super storms, raging wildfires, and choking sandstorms, just to name a few!\nA healthy TerraBeast will grow larger each season. This unlocks new areas for you to explore. New OddFauna, biomes, and crops will become available as the world grows larger. The outer rings of a fully mature TerraBeast have been known to be home to Legendary Beasts.\nAstor, Trico & Mo are off to explore a newly grown forest.\nYour home, a giant majestic TerraBeast\nYour world is a massive living beast, called a TerraBeast. They have a very long lifespan. It's rumored they can live for millennia. Their backs are covered with a thick coat of organic material. It's a fertile land, an ideal place for life to take root. It's common for TerraBeast's organic carapace to form blight and attract unhealthy creatures. They rely upon Astors to help keep them healthy. It is unknown how TerraBeasts spawn-- it's believed that Astors may play a role.\n\nThe world of the Terrabeast is procedurally generated and will be different each time you begin a new adventure. As the world grows, your actions help to shape it. If you maintain a healthy TerraBeast, the new biomes that grow will be fertile and healthy. Do you want to create more forests? Plant lots of trees and new biomes will be forests too.\n\nThe world is divided into different biome types, Grasslands, Forest, Mountains, Desert, and many more! Each Biome attracts different OddFauna and has specific needs to remain healthy. \nOddFauna thrive in their favorite biomes.\n\n\nGame Development Plan\nThe game is currently in Pre-Alpha and being developed for PC and will be released on Steam as an Early Access Game. (Wishlist Today!) Early Access will allow us to get it into player hands, get their feedback and have the time to use that feedback to shape the game. We are looking to our community of players to help us make the game as awesome as it can be. \n\nWe are making Alpha & Beta Access available as reward tiers. If you want to get your paws on the game as early as possible back at those levels! Alpha and Beta members have access to special discord servers that we will be reaching out to for feedback. Alpha and Beta backers will be able to vote on certain game decisions and help steer the development of the game.\n\nIf the Kickstarter gets funded, it will allow us to port the game to the Nintendo Switch! We will be able to buy Switch dev kits and ensure the game will perform amazingly on the console. I am incredibly excited at the prospect of developing for my favorite console. It will be a lot of work, but with your support, we will make it happen. OddFauna promises to be amazing on Switch! The Switch version of the game is available as an add-on item and with an estimated delivery date of Q1 2023.\nWe are a husband and wife team. Emma is the Creative mastermind behind OddFauna. She has been creating the cast of characters for years now. A few years ago we started talking more and more about how great a video game would be in her world. Last year, Cliff quit his AAA game development job to make it a reality! We finally are able to expand this awesome universe, and it is such a privilege to get to partner together on this creative journey.\nOur little family\nEverything in the game is hand-sculpted by Emma. This gives the world a very unique style. They are then hand-painted by Emma and handed off to Cliff. Cliff Photoscans them cleans up the models. The animation style and the hand-crafted nature of the models gives the world a stop-motion type of feel, which we love.\nCheck out our updates for more on our process!!!\nHow a character gets created.\nWe've been developing OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast full-time now for a year, self-funding the project entirely with our life savings. For 2 people we have come a long way in a short amount of time. We are approximately 50% of the way through development. While we've made a lot of progress, there is still a lot of work to do. In order to continue to work and retain creative control, we need to ask for your help. We\u2019re also hoping to build a community of passionate backers who want to be involved with the process of development. With your help, we believe we can build the best version of OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast that we possibly can!\n\n\"OddFauna is such a unique and beautifully handcrafted game, made by an indie developer who actively engages with their audience!\" - Tiny Tay (Discord)\nThe vast majority of our budget goes directly into making the gameplay amazing, the visuals beautiful, and the sound gorgeous. We will expand to get assistance with the music and audio and be able to hire help for community management, QA, and marketing.\n\nOddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast is a true passion project of ours, and we've made a lot of financial sacrifices to get this far. We'll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter isn't funded, but the game will be bigger and better if we meet our fundraising goals!\n\nExclusive TerraBeast Hard Enamel Pin\nA limited edition colorway exclusive to the Kickstarter. This hefty little friend measures 2\" wide in hard enamel with shiny gold metal. We\u2019re working with Alchemy Pins, whose products are beautifully made, with a very high attention to detail.\n\nExclusive TerraBeast Bandana\n22\" 100% cotton bandana with Emma's original TerraBeast design. Ice dyed and screen printed right here in Seattle by Ink Knife Press. Because of the nature of the dye, each one will be unique, making them extra special!\n\n\nExclusive \"Ride\" Collector Statue.\nDesigned by Emma, produced by Level 52 Studios. This limited edition high end collectible is a Kickstarter Exclusive.  3D scanned from Emma\u2019s original sculptures, these statues will measure 8\" and will be cast in Polystone. Packaged in a collectors box, they will come numbered and signed, with a certificate of authenticity.\n\nSurprise Creature Painting!\nThese are original creature concept painting by Emma.

There are only 30 different character paintings up for grabs and they will be shipped out blind box style.

Sculpture can measure up to 11\" and can have the same level of detail and complexity as the Kelpie and Hoarfrost Beast seen here.\nLegendary Beasts - Kelpie and Hoarfrost Beast\n\nOur Environmental Commitment\nAs we grow, we plan on donating and partnering with different organizations that are working towards rebuilding healthy ecosystems. Our first step is partnering with Eden Reforestation Projects. They hire local communities to plant a variety of native tree species in deforested areas. We will plant 1 tree per copy of the game sold.\n\n\nVideo BG Music : \"5 minutes pleasure\" by Hiroki Kikuta.

Here are our plans to deal with these risks.\n\nFinancial risk: We are confident that this amount of funding will allow us to deliver a solid game that meets our goals. We have put a great deal of our own funds into the development so far. It was important to us to put our own money into the project first and get the game to a solid place before reaching out for support. We will continue to fund the game if the Kickstarter is not successful, but it will not be as big and polished as we are hoping.\n\nSchedule risk: Our timeline is short, especially with only two of us working on the game. We have been meticulous about keeping the game in scope. To make sure we hit our goal, we have a roadmap that extends beyond shipping. A successful Kickstarter will allow us to hire experts to help in areas like music, community management, etc. This will allow us to focus on what we do best: making the game.\n\nGameplay : With just two people it can be challenging to make any game. Proper scope, experience, and passion is the key. With your support we will make OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast an amazing experience.

The Deep South breeds its black boys hard, then there\u2019s JAY. He sticks out for all the wrong reasons. He\u2019s dark-skinned, quiet and skinny; and likes to wear flowers in his hair.\nThe opposite of his masculine and charismatic older brother, JACOB. Their differences peak at the community pool where swaggering manhood is on full display. Jay is reserved as he struggles to embody his brother\u2019s carefree confidence.\nUntil he gets help from JUSTIN, a charming, light-skinned boy from the neighborhood. Their new friendship is tested, however, when an unspoken truth dares to surface.\n\n\nTerrance Daye, photographed by Alexy Kim\nMy name is Terrance Daye, the director of Pritty: The Animation. In 2019 I completed -Ship: A Visual Poem, an award-winning short film that significantly impacted my film career. For all of its success, however, I felt dissatisfied with filmmaking. Every day, the world seemed to grow more hateful and unjust. I asked myself, \u201cWhat is the point of art-making if we\u2019re all saying the same things and nothing is changing?\u201d\nThen I remembered a 300-page unpublished manuscript by the name of Pritty that was shared with me by a close friend and soon-to-be collaborator: Keith F. Miller, Jr. I remember being floored by the audacity of Keith\u2019s words. His complex depiction of black men coming of age was the very hope I now needed.\nThere are too few stories that simply feature black boys at play, discovering their full humanity and vulnerability\u2014and learning to heal because of it. I longed for my own work to engage more intentionally in this practice. I changed my perspective on filmmaking and committed to bringing a new question to the big screen: \u201cWhat would it mean to visualize the softer, more intimate sides of black men without fear of consequence?\u201d\nWith renewed vision and a devoted team by my side, I set about bringing Pritty to life. Visualizing this world and now getting to animate it has given me permission to hope again. It has been one of the highlights of my year and has taught me that filmmaking is just another form of dreaming. The world may be chaotic now. But it won\u2019t always be. Black lives may exist on the cusp of constant peril now. But somewhere there must be joy and laughter. The media can\u2019t imagine this for us. But we can imagine it for ourselves. Can\u2019t we?\n\n\n\nWe originally planned to make Pritty as a live-action short film, but when our shoot got canceled due to COVID-19 we weren\u2019t ready to give up. Through animation, we found a new way to bring Pritty to life!\nAnimation is a medium that is full of imagination and dreaming, and with Pritty, we are actively allowing ourselves to imagine what it looks like for black and brown boys to be free. Choosing to make animation our new medium felt like a natural fit to capture these dreams, hopes, and imaginations for our future world.\nWe turned to Japanese animation director, Hayao Miyazaki, to inspire the lush landscapes and naturalism that we wanted to exude through Pritty. His work became one of our largest sources of inspiration. But for all its beauty, we never saw ourselves represented in his worlds. Bring Hayao Miyazaki To The Hood became our new motto. Our hoods, our communities, our spaces with their subtleties and nuances are worthy of occupying the center. This animation is a reminder of that.\nOur animation direction includes lush, romantic landscapes, textured ambient sounds, and distinctly black character designs that create a sense of immersive realism through traditional 2D Animation - an immersive Black reality that we rarely see depicted in animation.\nWe are partnering with Powerhouse Animation Studios in TX for our animation production. Powerhouse Animation Studios is a full-service creative agency that we are very excited to have bring our rough animatic to life and later, with your help, our full animated short! \n\nCharacter Designs from Pritty: The Animation\n\n\n Writer/Director - Terrance Daye \nTerrance Daye - Photographed by Alexey Kim & Illustration by Jarren Simmons\nTerrance Daye is an award-winning poet and filmmaker from Long Island, New York. His creative work reimagines traditional representations of black masculinity and male identity and invests strongly in destigmatizing mental illness within the black community. Terrance received his Bachelor\u2019s degree from Morehouse College and his Master\u2019s in Fine Arts in filmmaking at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Terrance is a two-time Spike Lee Production Fund recipient, a 2018 Sundance Ignite Fellow, the recipient of the 2020 NewFest Film Festival Emerging Black LGBTQ+ Filmmaker Award and the 2020 Outfest Film Festival Programming Award for Emerging Talent. His most recent film project -Ship: A Visual Poem was awarded a Short Film Jury Award for U.S. Fiction at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. Terrance is currently developing his original hour-long drama, Mandingo, with the 2020 Sundance Episodic Labs. \n\nExecutive Producer & Author of Pritty: The Novel - Keith F. Miller, Jr. \nKeith F.

Miller, Jr. is an award-winning educator, storyteller, artist-researcher, and village-builder/raiser with nearly 10 years of experience in education, spearheading youth arts, leadership, social justice, and community engagement initiatives. Additionally, he is the managing editor and creative director of The Pillow Talk Project, a rapidly growing blog and social movement dedicated to sharing the fearless stories of men--and those who love them--redefining masculinity and rediscovering the healing power of everyday intimate conversations.\nCommitted to supporting the healing, growth, and thriving of boys and young men of color through trauma through narrative change, creative community development, and everyday intimate conversations as activism, Keith travels the country as a National Writing Project Teaching Consultant, a National Afterschool Matters Fellow, and a Forward Promise Fellow for Leaders through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. He also serves as the Executive Producer for the short film, Pritty, based on his unpublished manuscript by the same name.\n\n Producer - Jeremy Truong \nJeremy Truong - Photographed by Alexey Kim & Illustration by Jarren Simmons\nJeremy Truong is a San Francisco transplant working as an LGBT film producer in New York. Attracted to films with socially impactful themes, Jeremy hopes to move the needle on timely and urgent issues by exploring them in subversive ways on screen. His work has screened all over the world including the Sundance Film Festival, SXSW, BFI London, and the Tribeca Film Festival. His first feature film, \u2018Cicada\u2019 was acquired for distribution after a 2020 festival circuit and is currently in development on another feature length LGBT film. Founder of bicoastal production company, \u2018rubbertape\u2019, Jeremy is graduate of NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and is an SFFILM Rainin Grant Recipient.\n\n Producer - Natalie Jasmine Harris \nNatalie Jasmine Harris - Photographed by Murugi Thande & Illustration by Jarren Simmons\nNatalie Jasmine Harris is a filmmaker from Maryland.  As a producer, she is dedicated to uplifting underrepresented narratives about people of color, womxn, and LGBTQ communities. Natalie received her BFA from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in May 2020, where she graduated with Honors and received her department's award for Excellence in Community Service. Passionate about the intersections between filmmaking and social justice, Natalie worked for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Presidential Campaign in 2019 as a Video Intern and recently created a short documentary in collaboration with TIME Magazine and the Biden/Harris campaign. Over the years, she has produced films that have received recognition from The Directors Guild of America, Sundance Ignite, Outfest, Vimeo Staff Pick, Short of the Week, The British Film Institute, and The National Film Festival for Talented Youth (NFFTY).\n\n\nIn pivoting from a live-action short film to animation, we realized that our budget would increase exponentially. However, we believe that the black kids we create this art for are worth the time, the money, and the big asks.\nIn this Kickstarter campaign, we will spend 31 days trying to raise enough funds to reach our first goal of $50,000 and then strive to get as close to our $1.6M budget as possible. While $50,000 is our initial target, we hope to hit our 6 other stretch goals that will allow us to continue the animation process. Each step is vital in getting the film as beautiful, polished, and professional as we imagine it can be; whether that be through this campaign or as we partner with production companies and animation studios to close the gap.\nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created an outline below to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. We're hoping production will begin with Powerhouse Animation Studios in August 2021 and for the animation to be completed by October 2022.\n\n \"When Black Boys Feel They Heal\" - Keith F. Miller, Author of Pritty the novel & Executive Producer of Pritty: The Animation \nToday, few animated queer coming-of-age stories exist for black men. Pritty aims to fill this gap and expand a necessary conversation around what it means to be a black boy coming-of-age in America.\nPritty is a universal but unique story of one teenage boy\u2019s journey through pain and trauma to transformative self-acceptance and healing. It purposely flips the typical narrative arc that audiences have come to expect from queer films where the boy gets bullied and either succumbs or survives. And, instead, pushes against what we\u2019ve been conditioned to consider possible...arriving on the other side of healing, hope, and community.\nThis story was created in response to a startling, ever-present truth: boys and young men of color face innumerable obstacles that prevent them from living long, full, healthy, and productive, emotionally-rich lives. And more than anything these obstacles stand to block young men from feeling.\nWe believe there is a correlation between the limited range of queer black male representation on screen and the staggering number of suicide attempts amongst black male LGBTQ+ youth.\nUnfortunately, most black queer coming-of-age films habitually reproduce traumas onscreen without visualizing futures beyond the \u201ccoming out\u201d experience.\nPritty aims to address this disparity by showcasing black men in an unconventional light. Instead of watching black boys fight, belittle and harm one another; we get to watch them at play, figuring themselves out, making themselves vulnerable and healing in the process.\nVisualizing a world where black boys get to express themselves without consequence models an alternative reality for queer black youth, which present-day narratives don\u2019t even allow them to imagine.\n\n\nWe greatly appreciate any and all support towards this project - be it monetary or otherwise.

Truly tapped the gauge with an idle digit, like its caress might inspire the needle to swing higher.\nThe problem was time. Time, and distance. Your pilot spun in their chair, thumbing down the system map. Three planets within reach, each promising jobs, supplies and opportunities. But there was no time. Or was there?\nLike an answer to their question, a notification: New Message Received. You knew who had sent it, knew what it said. You saw your pilot crack a grin and angle their face to the nearest camera.\n\u201cChoice is yours, chief. Where to next?\u201d\nWe\u2019re Crispy Creative, a diverse indie studio of veteran game devs and industry newcomers alike!\nBetween us we\u2019ve worked at some of the most exciting studios in gaming, from Obsidian to Telltale Games, and on titles including The Outer Worlds, Batman: The Enemy Within, the upcoming Kena: Bridge of Spirits, and more!\nNow we\u2019re ready to strike out on our own and bring our brand new universe to the world.\nWe\u2019ve been working on our new project for a while now, and are super proud to be launching the Kickstarter for our game A Long Journey to an Uncertain End.\nBelow you\u2019ll get an overview of the game itself, a feel for the characters and world and some insight into what we\u2019re hoping to achieve on this project. If you like what you see, we hope you\u2019ll join us on our journey to make our ideas a reality!\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End is a narrative-focused space opera that\u2019ll have you flying around the universe, assembling an unruly crew from an eclectic cast of characters, and taking any job you can to keep one step ahead of your abusive Ex. The twist: you\u2019re not just piloting a ship\u2026you are the ship.\nEvery planet, moon and space station is a valuable source of jobs and precious rewards. Assign crew tasks based on their skills, and help their decisions along the way. If everything pays off you\u2019ll have what you need to escape, and if not...well, you can call in those favors you\u2019ve been saving.\nFly across a unique galaxy, from the dust-bitten badlands of the Rim, to the techno-industrial megacities of the Core\u2026and Beyond.\nRecruit an eclectic crew from a diverse cast of characters with their own stories and varied skill sets.\nExplore planets, moons and space stations as you put distance between you and your abusive ex. Match your crew to jobs and decide their actions along the way. If all else fails, you can always rely on a favor or two.\nManage your resources to keep your crew happy. Boosting between worlds can take its toll, as can failing at jobs. A happy crew is a productive crew\u2026 most of the time.\nEvery crew member has a skill they excel in. And every job has a recommended skill! Line up the right crew with the right job (or don't) to see what the outcomes might be.\nEven if you don't have the perfect skill, having skills that are adjacent, or even opposite can still yield interesting results. And sometimes the most interesting outcomes aren't the most obvious.\nGet to know your crew and they'll reveal hidden talents and expertise that might help you in a pinch. You'll also need to pay attention to the situation and the local giving you the job. They may not always be who they appear...\nMake the right choices though and you can earn some favors to use elsewhere. Get into a pinch on the massive urban world of Matu? That shady trader from Spacer's Folly still owes you one! That grateful wildebug rancher's family ties may stretch further than you think. Best keep an eye out as there are hidden helpers throughout the galaxy...\nIt's not all planet-hopping and job-doing though! Crew need supplies and you need fuel and repairs to stay in tip top shape. Your Ex is always in pursuit so keep an eye on how many days till they catch up!\n\nThe Cast\nThe Ex\n(CW: abusive relationship)\nDue to the immense cognitive fortitude and variety of knowledge required, only a fraction of a fraction of the universe's population could even dream of becoming A.I. Therapist. Unfortunately for you, one of them is currently on your trail - your Ex. Relentless and unwilling to stop until you're back in their care, your ex will expend every resource at their disposal to ensure your return.\nC.O.R.G.I.\nIf you're the captain, then C.O.R.G.I. is your first mate - your Comprehensive Operational Responsive Graphical Interface. While not really a dog in the old-fashioned sense of the word, C.O.R.G.I. does have all the characteristics of zeir organic counterparts: loyal, trusting, and always with your best interest in mind - the rest of the crew being a close second.\nAylah Tress \nThroughout her travels across the 'verse, Aylah has arguably lost more than she ever gained. Luckily, neither age nor travel has dulled her wit, compassion, and disdain of authority. She still believes in the unity of machines and humanity, and keeps the crew and the ship together - either with a sturdy wrench, a stern talking to, or in some instances, both.\nDenholm (Denny) Welker\nAfter life handed him a sack of lemons, Denny came to the conclusion that the best way to survive was his way - one of subterfuge and guile. Turns out he was pretty good at it too, spending his formative years developing his skills without getting bogged down with concepts like \"personal property\" or \"petty theft\". Lemonade will only get you so far.\nMatias Vidala\nAfter an accident during his short-lived career as drag persona \u201cGloria Borealis\u201d (involving a pyrotechnic \u201ccomet tail\u201d, several audience members, and third degree burns), the flamboyant Matias may or may not be on the run and/or doing a revival tour. Although sugary-sweet most of the time, Matias can be quick to sour...\nTruly Dashum\nTruly is one of their system's youngest pilots, and an ace at that. Quietly intense with a subtle flirty streak, Truly is a romantic at heart, collecting small items from their travels to decorate their outfit with.\nZera (Zeke) Hakkimirez\nWith her extra set of bionic arms, Zera, or Zeke as she prefers, is a cyclone of prepping, measuring, and cooking in the galley. Her upbeat demeanor and genuine compassion for others inspires her to speak  truest language of love: food.\n Set thousands of years in the future, in a universe where space flight is mundane, A Long Journey to an Uncertain End takes place in the aftermath of explosive expansion and technological marvel.\nWhen Artificial Intelligence blossomed into sentience, the ensuing symbiosis of humankind and machines allowed for galaxies to be charted and planets terraformed - but sentience came at a cost. It led to A.I. becoming aware of their own existence and purpose, and after horrifying conflicts between creators and creations, an era of prohibition. Machines were expected to return to subservience - a school of thought made manifest by the study and practice of A.I. Therapy.\nEarth is but a distant memory to most - \"home\" no longer refers to a single planet, but a shared universe. It's a time of unity and diversity, with humans from all corners of all galaxies coming together for peace and progress. You, however, as well as your rebellion and escape, still feel the chilling shadow of mistrust sowed centuries ago.\nTumbleweeds bounce over a burnished plateau, the ground here a crust that shimmers in the heat. All is silent...until it isn\u2019t.\nThe new sound begins as a feeling in the gut. Louder it comes, dust rising in a tsunami as the sunlight retreats behind the descending shadow. With a scream, landing gear extends from the incoming vessel and slowly, gently, kisses the ground.\nTouchdown.\nA ramp extends and deposits three figures onto the plain. One looks about, head swivelling like a predator on the hunt.\n\u201cGreat...another skuzzhole.\u201d\n\nA Long Journey wears its inspirations on its sleeve: proudly. Our mission was to meld the vast imagination of French illustrator Moebius to the vibrant sci-fi operas of TV series Firefly and the works of author Becky Chambers.\nWe wanted to create a universe full of the familiar and the unexpected, to put new twists on old formulas and create something truly unique. Whether you're exploring the backwater worlds of the Rim or the megacities of the Core, we\u2019ve done our best to create worlds that are engaging, exciting and new.\n  The Crispy Crew\n Up to this point we\u2019ve been completely self-funded; working on the game when we can to promote a healthy environment for the whole team. We've gotten to the point where we're ready to work on the game full-time!\nWith your help we can devote all our energies to quickly finishing development and shipping the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development is inherently risky.

It features simple, freeform mechanics which are easy to internalize, allowing a greater focus on the story, world and experience and less fiddling with complex rules or remembering intricate systems. It also requires no materials to play: no dice, no character sheets, no cards, nothing! This allows a game of Runt to be portable and be played whenever you're in the mood for a game. \nIt's designed for one shots and short campaigns, but there's no reason it can't be used to host long term experiences with either. Additionally it's a genre and setting agnostic system, so you can play whatever experience you want to explore wherever you want it to happen!\n1) Genre Agnostic!\nRunt is designed to enable the Host (the player running the game) to run a game in any setting or genre. Science fiction, fantasy, true crime, romance and anything else you can think of!It aims not to lock the player to a certain style, tone or theme, but rather lay out simple mechanics and mindset which you can utilize to play whatever style of story you want to experience.\n2) Simple Mechanics!\nRunt's conflict resolution mechanics are designed to be simple and intuitive. They can be internalized and executed on quickly, even for new players. It achieves this with a resolution mechanic called \"Challenges\" which allow conflict to occur but doesn't require players to overthink the situation - just resolve the Challenge quickly and flavourfully and move on!\nThis helps everyone not only get into the game quicker, but to avoid the barriers which may come with learning new systems for new worlds to play in. No need to remember rules around firearm ranges, learning the conditions of a spell, figure out who makes a move and when, or other intimidating mechanics required by some roleplaying games.\n3) Material Free Experience!\nThe basic Runt rules requires no additional peripherals to play the game. This means no writing utensils, no character sheets, and no dice. So long as you have one person Hosting a game and a least one other person to to play it, you can play a game of Runt. \nWhile some sort of tracking tool (paper, notes app, etc.) is usually a good idea for keeping track of details over longer campaigns, in many cases it isn't even required!\nThe Runt Guidebook is a 10 page black and white, printable .pdf that contains all the rules players need to know for running a game in the Runt system, such as:\n Consent Systems - an introduction on how to keep Runt fun for everyone\n Character Creation - including rules for equipment and Unique Abilities your character may have\n Rules on \"Challenges\" - a step-by-step walkthrough of Runt's simple resolution mechanic\n \"How To Host\" - a quick primer on how to get in the mindset of Hosting a game in the Runt system\nRunt is already design-complete and tested! It only requires art and a bit of final proofing before it can be sent to you. \nTo that end, I'm partnering with Toronto-based artist Brennan McNamara who is already creating the art to make Runt's pages even more beautiful!\nThe funding from this campaign will primarily be going towards paying for him to create art for the guidebook, as well as reimbursing me for the labour involved in creating Runt!\n NOTE: ALL STRETCH GOALS WILL BE INCLUDED WITH EVERY TIER OF RUNT!\n$400 [GOAL REACHED]- Printable One-Page .pdf with all the rules on one handy sheet!\n$600 [GOAL REACHED]- Character Sheets templates; templates to track your character details and keep tabs on your wonderful companions!\nWe've hit all the stretch goals and won't be adding any more to keep the project simple.

We should talk is a short-form narrative game that will make you think carefully about the words you choose, coming Summer 2020 to Windows, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. \nIn We should talk, you'll use the sentence spinner to piece together modular sentences in response to the in-game characters. Choose your words carefully to express yourself as you discuss ongoing problems about life and romance with Sam, your in-game partner, over text messages, while also chatting with friends and strangers at your favorite local bar.\nThe combination of words you choose impacts the conversations you have, how genuinely you can connect with your partner, and whether your relationship can survive the night. It's up to you how to respond\u2014depending on how you communicate, you'll see one of 9 possible endings. \nPersonalized Choices: Using the sentence spinner, make choices that connect with you. Countless options abound\u2014be yourself, or role play someone you never thought you could be.\nUnique Characters: Your night at the bar is more interesting thanks to all the unique people you encounter. Find your healthy balance between chatting with your friends and keeping up with the texts from your partner at home. \nDifferent Paths: Your choices drastically affect the way folks respond to you, leading to one of many different paths in each conversation. Will you be accommodating, flirty, stand-offish, or somewhere in-between?\nMultiple endings: Play again and again to find all 9 possible endings. Conclusions aren't based on a specific path or route the way many traditional narrative games branch, but instead the endings are based on the tone your responses express throughout the game. What do your relationships look like at the end of the night?\nRealistic conversations: Experience the emotions that come with real conversations, whether it\u2019s the the joy that comes with teasing a friend, the anxiety that comes with a heavy text message, or the frustration of navigating a touchy conversation with a creep. Express yourself as clearly as you can and hope that your conversational partner understands, though there's always a risk they might interpret your words differently than you intended.\nThe development of We should talk is close to completion, so we're turning to Kickstarter to help our launch be as strong as possible. Our team hoped to present We should talk at a number of global events this spring and summer as we near the game's release, but the pandemic threw a wrench in our plans. We're raising money to help us pay for marketing and promotional efforts post-launch so that we can try to reach more people through digital media. We know this project is important and deserves to be seen by folks who would benefit from its message, and we feel that Kickstarter is the best way to help us make that happen. We plan to use the money we raise to help us advertise through social media, sponsorship, and other available marketing avenues. \nFrancesca, Carol, Jordan & Nobonita\nWe should talk was created by Nobonita Bhowmik, Francesca Carletto-Leon, Jordan Jones-Brewster, Carol Mertz, Kat Aguiar, and Jack Schlesinger\u2014six developers that met as MFA students at the NYU Game Center. Our team came together with the goal of creating a game that challenges traditional transactional romance in games, and collaborated to push relationship-building games forward by expanding the realm of player choice.

If there is enough  interest we will do our best to translate Weaving Tides to even more  languages.\nSome of our biggest influences: The Legend of Zelda Series, Bastion & Tearaway\nWeaving Tides is influenced by a cluster of our combined interests and the things we love, but among our greatest inspirations are the Legend of Zelda series, Bastion and Tearaway. Our takeaways from these games are:\nAn epic adventure filled with challenges like in the Legend of Zelda  \nA beautifully crafted story and lush, vivid environments like in Bastion \nCreative Puzzles and witty interactions with your surroundings like in Tearaway \nAll of the mechanics in Weaving Tides are inspired by textile crafting techniques. The Weaver dragon you ride has a \u201cribbon tail\u201d that flows behind it as you fly. It serves a variety of purposes and is the key to completing the challenges of the woven world.\nUsing the Weaver's ribbon allows you to complete magical stitching patterns, pull down hovering chests, drag heavy rugs, pull open curtains and more. \nSometimes the solution lies hidden somewhere close by, other times you will have to explore the mechanics of the puzzle further in order to solve it. Use your imagination and puzzle-solving skills to overcome these challenges and advance on your journey.\nThe world is filled with secrets and optional puzzles. Find them and your curiosity will be rewarded with new clues revealing the mysteries of the world or useful new items.\nWhile the primary focus of Weaving Tides lies in the narrative, as well as puzzles and exploration, it also offers laid-back, fun combat mechanics. \n Every enemy will require you to adopt a different strategy in order to defeat it.   \n While, for example, the Toothy Yappers have to be flipped onto their backs by resurfacing right beneath them or dashing through them\u2026 \n  ...the moles have to be pulled out of their dens before you can stitch or dash them.\nThe combat in Weaving Tides is challenging, but not overwhelming.  If it turns out to be too easy for you, you will be delighted by the various opt-in modifiers in forms of items which will toughen up your foes.  \nOnce you\u2019ve mastered these skills, explore dungeons to put them to the test! We have three dungeons waiting for you: a forgotten desert temple, a mind tangling forest maze and a dangerous lair which has yet to be unveiled!\nAnd of course at the end of each dungeon a boss is waiting for you! \nExperience a sprawling, strange new world full of adventure and secrets. In this world Tass seems to be the only one of his kind - a human. Accompanied by his foster dad Kilim he sets out to solve the mysteries of his past. But the world he calls home is changing in dark, unexpected ways, and a force that once lay dormant beneath the weave is awakening. \n Weaving Tides is a tale about finding a sense of belonging. The story is told in a light-hearted way sprinkled with charming characters and witty puns, but at its core it is a rich and emotional narrative about family, identity and the blurred lines of morality.\n Travel across the four unique layers of the woven world. Each layer has it\u2019s own culture, aesthetic, puzzles and dangers. This strange world is inhabited by intelligent beings called \"the Mothkin\", moth people with human-like features and a predominantly friendly nature. \nExplore the sun-drenched dunes of the Silken Desert, home to small nomadic villages such as your hometown, Veteri.\nLush, dense & dangerous, the Spun Forests are home to the tribal Mothkin who are strict believers of the great mother Dea.\nThe Mothkin empire is a stronghold of trade and culture. Blessed by a moderate climate the Mothkin of the empire express their love for their land by growing beautiful, well-trimmed gardens.\nSome speak of barren landscapes ravaged by relentless storms and hidden deep beneath the lustrous cities of the empire. Unknown things lurk down there; all we know for certain is they mean us no good.\nThe Weavers are the guardians of the woven world. Even though most Weavers are loners, three of them will join you in your quest and will invite you to ride on their backs. \nEach one of the Weavers behaves slightly different. While Twill has a higher movement speed, Luce can take more hits, for example - but their greatest difference lies in their special stitching abilities. It is up to you to use the Weaver best suited to your current situation, or you could just use whichever Weaver you like best!\nKilim's special move allows him to cover a wide area, perfect for patching up large rips and slowing down groups of enemies.\nTwill spits her ribbon in a straight line and can therefore precisely remove single threats without having to move into dangerous zones herself. \nWhen Luce\u2019s special move is unleashed he rushes forward, stitching and cutting everything in his path. Great for breaking through walls of enemies; not so great at avoiding painful obstacles. \nAlthough you will find some items by simply exploring the world and uncovering secret areas, some of the most sought after ones can only be bought from Salis the flying merchant.  \nYou gain Thread Essence by patching up tears in the world and by unsealing chests. Use the essence to buy magical embroidered patches which will greatly help you on your journey.\nA small selection of the magical emroideries you will find on your journey.\nSome of the items will be opt-in modifiers for folks that want an extra challenge: to give the enemies, say, more health in exchange for larger rewards. \n Sometimes a Mothkin will entrust you with a letter to a loved one, other times you might find a ripped scroll of parchment stuck between the branches of a terry-tree. Collect these writings if you wish to delve deeper into the lore and mysteries of the woven world.\nCapable explorers will find ways to reach even the most remote areas of the woven world. There you will find enchanted ribbons which can be used exclusively in Playground mode. Collect them all to create a stunning masterpiece of digital embroidery!\nWeaving Tides' Playgrounds mode invites you to create your own digital artwork. In this mode you can choose from a variety of ribbons, including those you unlocked in Adventure mode. There are also some helpful special features:\ndifferent camera positions allow perfect framing for your fancywork\nyou can toggle the cutting functionality of the dash ability on or off\nload in custom transparent background images to trace with your stitches\ntake a snapshot of your finished work by using the built-in camera\n The only limit is your imagination! Combine different ribbon styles to create mesmerizing patterns or pay tribute to your favorite game characters by reimagining them through weave. \nThese are just a few of the main characters and along your journey you will receive the help of a wide range of peculiar allies.\nWeaving Tides\u2019 evocative musical score, sound effects and overall audio will be handled by our talented composers Timo Jagersberger & Frank Schlick. Time and time again they have put us in awe with their rich and emotional music, but describing it with words won\u2019t do it justice so we will let these tracks speak for themselves: \nWhat is an Add-on?\nYou can customise your Reward Tier by choosing items to add and increasing your initial pledge by the necessary amount.\nHow do add-ons work?\nPress the \"Manage your pledge\" button on the very top of this page.\n  Shipping is already included in the add-on prices.

Prior to this project we made NIVA, a game where you play as a mighty forest god that can grow or wither plants. We also worked on a bunch of smaller projects, but Weaving Tides is our most ambitious project to date.\nThanks to the Kickstarter community creative, niche projects like this can exist. Weaving Tides began as a small idea about exploring a woven world but as development went forward the project grew and so did our passion for it. \nWe want to make Weaving Tides a game that you will love as much as we do and that is why we want to involve you in the process of bringing it to life! We\u2019re going to be especially interested in your ideas and feedback on:\nProgression & Balancing\nNew items\nPuzzle design\nWeaving Tides has been in development for almost two years now. We have come all this way thanks to our close circle of friends, the support we received from the Vienna Business Agency as well as our own funds and efforts, but for this final spurt we need your help. The funds from Kickstarter will enable us to pour even more polish and love into the game and make Weaving Tides what we know it can be.\n  This is how funds will roughly be split up:\nAfter Kickstarter fees, taxes and fulfilling the Kickstarter rewards all funds will go directly towards the development costs of Weaving Tides, localization as well as paying our composers to whip up even more amazing tracks. \nAbout 75% of the game is done. The core of the game is fully finished and all levels except the ending are fully playable. What remains is a lot of gameplay polish, more art assets, scriptwriting for minor characters and bug squashing. We are therefore confident that we will be able to deliver Weaving Tides in late autumn 2020.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been developing Weaving Tides for more than two years.

In each one-shot game, players split up into two teams of competing skaters. Explore relationships with teammates and rivals, choose smart strategies, and play your most skillful moves to help your team win.\nI designed Derby Drama because I used to play roller derby, and I really miss it! This sport literally changed my life. But playing roller derby is also expensive, a huge time commitment, and physically dangerous. It's not accessible to me right now. So I wondered, what if I could evoke the feeling of roller derby... just by playing a tabletop game with friends? \nSince then I've playtested Derby Drama with dozens of folks at meet-ups, PAX Unplugged, and Metatopia, improving the rules with the feedback these lovely generous players have given. I've even played the game with my old teammates from Ohio Valley Roller Girls. Now I can't wait to share it with you!!\nDerby Drama is primarily a set of zines: The Bout (the rules), Holler Derby (a modern-day flat-track roller derby setting), and World-Wide Roller League (a 1970s banked-track roller derby setting). The zines will be photocopied in black ink on light colored paper, folded and stapled by hand.\nThe Rules \nAn early preview of the zine- colors aren't final\nThe Bout is 36 pages of detailed instructions for play, facilitation, world-building, and safety, written to be easy to pick up and play for 2 to 3 hour one-shots.\nThe Settings  \nMe (second from the left) blocking in a co-ed bout in Marietta, Ohio\nHoller Derby describes a fictional roller derby league in Appalachian Ohio. The 16-page booklet includes NPCs and locations, with lots of fun tables to roll on for character backstories, motivations, and relationships. As well as describing a specific setting, this booklet also gives folks unfamiliar with derby a general idea of what a modern-day flat-track roller derby league is like.\nWorld-Wide Roller League is a fictional early 1970's roller derby production inspired by the real-life Roller Derby and Roller Games. Co-ed teams travel from city to city to put on theatrical banked-track productions to entertain crowds of spectators in arenas as well as a home television audience. Players can join in on the over-the-top action with special rules inspired by Nathan D. Paoletta's World Wide Wrestling. \n Stress tokens are any small token that represent the energy of the bout. You can use beads or coins, but if you support the project at the Power Jam level, you'll get 25 lightning bolt stress tokens for your game. You'll also get an eco-friendly reusable scoreboard and team cards.\nPrototype scoreboard and team cards plus stress tokens\nDerby Drama will come with two reference cards (one for blockers, one for jammers) full of real-life flat-track roller derby moves. One side of each card lists Offense moves and the other lists Defense moves. Learn how to Eat the Baby to stop the opposing jammer  or Jump the Apex to score points!  \n Derby Drama is a single-session game that takes between one and four hours to play, depending mostly on the number of players.\nThe game works best with two to six players and an equal number of players on each team. Usually the facilitator of the session plays a skater in the bout. If playing on a team would make the teams uneven, the facilitator can take on more of a game master role, describing scenes and acting as other characters in the bout.\nGame play is organized into alternating phases of interpersonal drama and intense strategic sports action. Each jam, use your athletic prowess and skating skills to dominate on the track. Before the bout and between jams, gain advantages for teammates and inconvenience the opposition. Take your team to victory... or at least look really cool in front of your crush.\nHow to Play\nEach player chooses to play a Jammer or a Blocker. They create a derby name and look for their character, as well as assigning numbers to four stats: AGILITY, POWER, DRAMA, and HEART.\nJust like a real roller derby bout, Derby Drama is broken up into two periods, each having multiple jams.\nDuring a jam, each team rolls the Team Dice that will determine the score. Then players decide (secretly) on a specific strategy or play.  Next, each player reveals their strategy. A good offensive result can allow your own team to re-roll a low score to gain more points. A good defensive result can force the opposing team to re-roll a high score. A failed strategy can lead to a penalty, costing your team points.\n When all the players have played out their strategies, that's the end of the jam - the Team Dice totals are added to the Scoreboard. The team with the highest score at the end of six jams will win the game-within-the-game. But winning isn't everything, and every character has their own reasons for playing.\nBetween jams and at halftime, players can role-play how they are feeling about the bout, their teammates, and their rivals. They can try to gain advantage for their own team by Boosting Morale, or disadvantage the opposing team by Stirring Up Drama. Friendship, romance, revenge, and straight-up cheating are all on the table. However - schemes can backfire. If your bout has a Meltdown, everything spirals out of control, and who knows what could happen?\n The illustration of skaters in the header is by the very talented Kaylee Rowena! \nThe zines are full of illustrations drawn from Intuitive Capturing Studios' catalog of thousands of photographs of women's flat-track roller derby bouts. I've hand-picked dozens of photos and carefully retouched each image so they'll look beautiful when reproduced in black-and-white.\nThanks to everyone's support I've been able to bring on a few wonderful artists to help with the project. Gum (Instagram) will make stickers of cool roller skaters! You'll be able to add these to your pledge when you pay shipping. Michelle S.B. (Instagram) and Alex \"Lorena Vomit\" Wright (Instagram) are going to illustrate imaginative roller derby bout settings and characters!\nSince we were able to raise $2,500, West Virginia artist and designer Liz Pavlovic will illustrate and lay out the Holler Derby setting zine. Liz is a super talented designer with a style that is perfect for this zine and I'm so excited to work with them!\nIf at least 250 people order the print zine, worker-owned, union print-shop Radix Media will print the zine. They use high-quality, environmentally-friendly paper and equipment and make incredibly beautiful printed works.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've never done a Kickstarter before and I've heard many tales of woe about the fulfillment process! So I'm most worried about that and I have spent a lot of time researching how to handle it.

Each episode is written by a different author as they give their own take on the bizarre and bloody landscape and the people who live there, from the surreal bloodswamps of the Fleshlands, to the ghostlands of Tornado Valley, to the sentient hateful forests of the Pacific Northeast.\nYou play as Sam, Cass, Brad, and Lianna, four antifascist mech pilots on the move. After a disastrous event which cost the lives of thousands, your small group is hurled directly into the middle of a massive conspiracy where even the sky isn't the limit. \nWith the clock ticking before the next disaster, you must band together and fight, sweet-talk, and jam your way across the treacherous Rozarx, piloting mechs, killing fascists, and hunting cryptids to pull off the greatest heist of all time.\nWe're gonna steal the motherfucking sun.\nThe combat in Meatpunks is kinetic, gnarly, and bloody. In each combat scenario, you play as one of the four main characters, each with their own specific abilities, moves, and animations, as you scratch, juke, and teleport through endless hordes of fascists.\nAdditionally, we're implementing a new HEART CHANGE system -- when a character has an especially big moment of growth in the story, it comes with a completely new move set for the combat sections! A character who's weak now may have a breakthrough that changes them to the strongest character in the game, or a strong character could become weak.\nSAMAEL GODKILLER (he/him): An absolute sweetheart hiding a terrible secret, Sam used to be a farmer before being run out of town and finding solace in the Meatpunks. He tries his best to appear normal to not worry his friends, but if you look closely... He has two shadows.\n\nCASSANDRA TRANG (they/them): The group's reluctant leader, Cass puts most of their effort into just trying to get through the day. At night, eerily prescient nightmares give them a glimpse of the horrible future. They're almost certain their guidance has gotten good people killed. \n\nBRADLEY ULTRABRAD (he/him): Always quick with a joke or an inscrutable reference, Brad is the group's resident mech engineer. He's got a heart made of meat, and he's always willing to talk about his newest mech designs! He's been a little quiet lately, though... I wonder what's up with that.\n\nLIANNA CARNAGE (she/her): Lianna made her first kill when she was twelve, and has caused a lot of damage to a lot of bad people since. She's pretty cheerful about it, too. Now that she's back in her home state, though, it looks like that first kill is coming back to haunt her.\n\nTHE TRUCKER (she/her): A new friend and potential tagalong for the group, The Trucker is looking to make one last delivery. She's quick with sarcasm and quicker with a right hook. She and Lianna seem to be getting along suspiciously well...\n\nTH\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 (\u2591E/\u2591\u2591\u2591) \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591  \u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 E\u2591\u2591 N\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591D \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 C\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591O\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 M\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591E \u2591S \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\nHeather Flowers (she/her) - Designer, writer, producer \nHeather is an independent developer with dozens of games under her belt.

Notably, she was the designer for the colorful MEATPUNKS postcards, as you can see below! You can find her Twitter here, and her website here.\nEXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash is currently in a pre-alpha state. Think of it as a game with all of its bones but none of the meat yet: all the mechanics are implemented, all the aesthetic decisions have been made, all the story's been outlined. \nThe primary thing we're missing is content, the meat to put on those bones. On the occasion that we succeed with this Kickstarter, we will spend the next year writing dialog, composing music, drawing character art, designing levels, and all the other little things that make a game like this shine. \nIn order to create that content, we need funding. Funding through Kickstarter allows us to make this dream game, without forcing us to compromise our vision for publishers. MEATPUNKS is loudly queer, proudly antifascist, and strongly anti-authoritarian. With your help, we can keep it that way, while continuing the story in a new and bold direction.\nHere's a rough estimate of where your money will be going, by percentage! The reason we call it \"rough\" is because certain parts can only be estimated at present; it's impossible for us to know how many rewards we'll be filling until y'all give us that number!\nStill, we're very confident we'll be able to complete the game with this budget.\nFor your convenience, here's a table of every reward tier, and what you get along with each tier!\nLet's talk a little more about those physical rewards, since we're personally VERY excited about them!\nAt the $40 level, in addition to previous rewards, you get a sick MEATPUNKS patch! Here's the design for it:\nAt the $50 level, in addition to previous rewards, you get a set of postcards of different locations in the world of EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER!\nAt the $75 level, you get the 16-page minicomic EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: GHOSTS. Here's a preview page to pique your interest!\nAt the $100 level, you get a signed postcard of your choice from the previous set...\nAnd at the $150 level, you get a signed cassette tape containing the original soundtracks to EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Powered By Blood AND EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash! It's a two-for-one special! Here's a sneak peek at the concept art for it:\nThen, we move on to the custom reward tiers!\nAt the $500 level, you get a Meatpunks-style character portrait based on yourself, a loved one, or an original character!\nAt the $1000 level, you get your very own MEATPUNKS-style custom fight theme in any genre of your choice (within reason)! The song will be 1.5 minutes long, you will get one round of revisions, and the composer will retain the right to distribute the final song.\nBeyond that point, we have two tiers for people who want to give us several thousand dollars, which is kinda buck wild but we sure aren't disputing the idea.\nAt the $3,000 tier, we will work with you to design a character to be put in the game! This character will show up, have one or two lines, and then instantly die. Maybe a chandelier will fall on them. We'll work with you to give them a fitting death!\nAnd finally, at the $10,000 tier, we will allow your in-game character to actually live throughout the main story! Many writers would say that inserting a complete unknown into an already-plotted story is a terrible idea, but we here are agents of chaos who don't know the meaning of fear.\nEXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash is a hugely personal project, and by supporting it you help us bring it to life. For supporting the project, or even sharing it, let us say from the bottom of our hearts: thank you so, so much.\n<3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash is a game with a small, dedicated team. We fully plan on fulfilling our promise to the community and delivering a game experience that lives up to your expectations, but the nature of independent game development is sometimes chaotic, with unexpected pitfalls. With such a small team, were something bad to happen to one of the members, it could easily delay the release.\n\nThat said, one of the benefits of this being a sequel is that we've basically already made a game exactly like this, and we already know all of the challenges ahead of us. Additionally, much of the game's framework already exists from the first season, and while we plan on improving on nearly every aspect of the original game, doing so with an established framework is much easier and less risky.\n\nEach person on the team is among the best at what they do, and the worst that could happen to the project (outside a serious emergency) is the project being delayed by a few months. We're a hardy team, and we are confident we will bring the game to completion in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Mech Pilot", "descp": "YOUR NAME IN CREDITS\nThank you for pledging!

Like, not really long ago but long ago enough that nobody was asking questions like \"Should we show that?\" or \"Do you think that's a bit TOO disgusting?\" \nEVIL DEAD -- BAD TASTE / BRAINDEAD -- RE-ANIMATOR\nWe want to wash the set in the red stuff, make the audience shrink back in their seats at the sheer, unfiltered barf-fest that is THE HIGH STAKE ROLLERS.\nYou want to see what's under there... We know you do!\nWhen Katie Klein's best friend is murdered by a gang of greasy, no-good vampires, everyone in Falls Grave tells her \"It's just something that happens here. Nothing we can do about it, the vamps have lived here longer than we have...\"\nSeeking revenge, she arms herself with a pointy stick and follows a creature of the night into it's lair... obviously this goes super well and she's about to meet an untimely end, when SUDDENLY a trio of roller derby girls appear and kick the absolute beans out of the monster.\nTHE HIGH STAKE ROLLERS! \nAn elite squad of Roller Derby girls who are on a mission to wipe every last vampire off the face of the Earth! Katie soon joins up, and... we can't tell you the rest! SPOILERS!!\nTHE STICKY STUFF...\nWe love to tell great stories, but we also want to really push the practical effects of THE HIGH STAKE ROLLERS as far as we can. We're no strangers to getting our hands red, our first feature film \"CHESTERSBERG\" which is about to begin it's festival run (no rest for the wicked) is stuffed to the brim with effects, but we kept them all believable and realistic! If you want, you can check out the trailer for \"CHESTERSBERG\" below.\nIn Rollers, we want to crank the dial up to 11! If you've seen the pitch video, you've seen  a vampire have his junk kicked up out of his mouth - probably not medically possible, but absolutely hilarious! \nProducer Laura getting stuck in on the set of CHESTERSBERG\nThe High Stake Rollers will be played by REAL DERBY PLAYERS! A couple of the lead cast will be training over the six months leading to the shoot to ensure that they can skate well but skate safe! SAFETY IS SEXY!\nProducer and co-writer Laura has skated for almost five years, and director Jamie has skated for six months but has spent the last five years as the official photographer for local team THE YORK MINXTERS, both of them either playing or snapping away at the British Roller Derby Championships around the country.\nLaura (or Pandora Monium) has been playing Roller Derby since 2015.\nThe film will use the game! Now, derby can be quite complicated to anyone who doesn't know the sport so we'll be working on the fight scenes hard to make sure that they're exciting and dynamic, but also anyone who plays the game can knowingly nod as a blocker slams into a legal target zone of a vampire, or a jammer whips by a pivot to gain enough speed to take down a fleeing creature of the darkness! \nIf you've ever had the absolute pleasure of watching Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD, there's a fight scene in that film that's our launching point for choreography and in fact the inspiration for the tone of the film. \nIf the campaign is successful, a part of the budget will be used to secure a space in York that we can use as a pre-production base where we can build the effects but also rehearse the fight scenes long before the cameras roll. Fighting on film is hard enough, but adding wheels into the mix is absolutely mad. We want to make sure that the violence is fast paced and hilarious, but also safe and responsible. In the run up to the filming, the space will be transformed into the Rollers HQ set. \nThat absolute toe stomping track at the start of the pitch video is \"Secret Fantasy\" by  GlitterW\u00f8lf . The guys will be joining the team to make the official soundtrack for the film.\nYou can check out more from GlitterW\u00f8lf  on their awesome Bandcamp page.\nOn scoring duties we're incredibly happy to be once again collaborating with KYOTO DRAGON, the wizard behind the score to \"I Am Tim Helsing\" season 3 and of course \"CHESTERSBERG\". \nGet some KYOTO DRAGON into your ears over at the official Bandcamp page.\nOUR LAST PROJECTS\nOver the last eight years we have produced a huge amount of projects on the smallest of budgets.\n\"I AM TIM HELSING\" is an award winning comedy horror series that has screened in festivals around the world. Three seasons made over the course of almost a decade, a real labour of love. We spent around \u00a38000 in total over the years. You can watch all of the show on our YouTube channel.\n\"THE FINAL GIRL\" was made on a budget of \u00a3300 a few years back, and is an example of how we can make things look great on a very tiny budget. The film has played in festivals around the world and is featured in a couple of anthologies and even books about the slasher genre.\nTHE HIGH STAKE ROLLERS\nSo, why do we need all this money if we can make films with so little? Our last project, the feature film \"CHESTERSBERG\" had a total budget of \u00a312500 and that was for a 91 minute film. \nThe script for Rollers is 14 pages and we're looking to raise at the bottom end - \u00a38000 which is around \u00a37000 to \u00a37250 once you remove crowdfunding fees and the cost of making t-shirts, DVDs etc... \nOf course, we want to raise more than \u00a38000. We are looking to raise \u00a311,000 (combined Kickstarter and outside investment) which will giver us the lovely round sum of \u00a310,000 to make the short film with. \nHave a very lovely pie chart to break it all down for you.\nThis is a super simple breakdown of the budget, but it gives you an idea. We want to spend around \u00a34000 on the effects (head moulds aren't cheap) to really get you deep in the guts. \nThe pitch video on this campaign cost us \u00a3250 to make, including costume, location fees, food and drink to keep everyone alive and a good \u00a340 on the Big Boy. \nCome on, you all know what we're talking about...\nIt all adds up brutally fast, but with the amazing and talented people we have working on this film we can make amazing things happen...\nSo this is something we'll talk about if the campaign goes wild and we smash through the initial target in the first week. Unlikely, but absolutely possibly!\nThe High Stake Rollers exists at the moment as a 15 minute (ish) short film BUT we do have a synopsis for a feature. Would we like to make a feature? Of course. OF COURSE! Some of our favourite films are currently appearing on BluRay thanks to ARROW and 88 FILMS. Such films as THE MUTILATOR or the supremely bonkers SORORITY BABES IN THE SLIMEBALL BOWL-O-RAMA. These films are the true inspiration behind THE HIGH STAKE ROLLERS, and if you haven't seen them you should hunt them down.\nWe'll announce these plans as part of a series of very ambitious stretch goals if the initial campaign skyrockets so watch this space!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou're joining us about a quarter of the way through the project.

You wake up, feel the sun on your face, wag your tail, and look forward to the day ahead.\nMoments later, your life changes forever.\nYou don't know what to do. Your owner is nowhere to be found. You have no option but to go.\nTo chase.\nTo be lost.\nTo get back to what matters most: family.\nThis is the story of a lost dog trying to reunite with its owner, the emotional roller coaster of a grand adventure in pursuit of the most important thing in life.\n\n\nWe all grew up with animal stories. From films about overcoming obstacles to ancient stories and motifs about animals that shaped the course of history, animal journeys are part of our collective cultural DNA. And yet, we still haven't had the animal game!\nThat's what we're making.\nDOGGONE is a game about a lost dog trying to find its way back home, inspired by the animal movies we all grew up with. \nFrom the bottom of our hearts, we believe that this game needs to exist - and that's where we need your help!\nWe want to bring DOGGONE to life as an episodic game, and your pledge would help us create part one. This episodic structure gets the game into your hands sooner rather than later and helps us generate additional revenue to fund the rest of development. We'll discuss that in further detail below - for now, here's more on the game!\n\n\nDOGGONE is a fully-fledged dog experience. The core gameplay revolves around platforming and puzzle solving, reminiscent of Playdead's INSIDE. \nOn top of that, we're adding in \"dog things\" because... well, you're a dog and sometimes you need to do dog things!\nFor example, you'll be able to \"sniff out\" pathways and hidden items.\nOther abilities include smell-o-vision to guide you in the right direction, barking, and rolling around (for no reason other than you are a dog).\nOur story will take the dog through a roller coaster ride of environments, encounters, and excitement. Happy ending, we promise! It wouldn't be a good story without bumps along the way, but in the end we want to bring you that warm and fuzzy feeling you signed up for.\nWhile you're on this journey, we're meticulously crafting the game to feel like a fully-imagined 3D space through unique camerawork. Think of the camera as a director framing your journey, moving it to just the right place every step of the way.\nRemember that screenshot from earlier? Here's how that shot is introduced!\nOur visual direction is something we're very proud of, so let's discuss that some more!\n\n\nFrom the beginning, we wanted this adventure to be aesthetically breathtaking. Our game is heavily inspired by the works of Eyvind Earle, who made his name as a background artist on Disney\u2019s Sleeping Beauty (1959).  \nThe art team experimented with many aspects of the Eyvind Earle style, while keeping the same core tenets of vibrant colors and sharp edges. Some trees had very fantastic elements like angular branches and bush-like leaves!\nAs we narrowed things down and worked hard on the style, we created more detailed ideas of how spaces could look. This led us to the overarching visual style you see today!\nOur art director Abdullah has expertly guided our talented art team in the creation of this visual style, and we're very excited to continue bringing this world to life.\n\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of how the campaign funds will be used.\n\nThere is a ~10% \"safety net\" incorporated into this budget accounting for if we missed something in our planning process. If everything goes according to plan and that budget doesn't need to be used for that purpose, it'll go back into the project to create more content in the form of an additional level.\nWe also mentioned earlier that this project is going to be episodic, and we wanted to give you an idea of where that will take us. Here's a look at our tentative roadmap for the game.\n\n\nThis campaign will fund Episode I, the major first steps of our dog's journey. You'll experience the inciting event that sets our hero on their adventure, and traverse the first one third (roughly) of our narrative.\nThe journey won't stop there, though. After completing your first playthrough of this episode, you'll unlock Challenge Mode! This will offer additional gameplay depth and replayability options, with new challenges being available at a regular cadence between episodes. Right now, we envision that as meaning weekly and monthly challenges.\nYour first playthrough will allow you to experience the dog's journey the way we narratively intended. Challenge Mode gives you the option to re-experience the adventure with different modifiers and twists! Think of the recent Hitman games and how you could keep coming back.\nCompleting these challenges will provide rewards, and these rewards will carry over into the other episodes. We're not saying you might get silly costumes and hats, but... ;)\nWe'll use sales from Episode I to create the remaining episodes (aiming for Summer and Fall 2020, respectively) culminating in a release of the full package at the very end of that timeline.\n\n\nAnimal stories are universal across cultures, and we're living that ethos: Raconteur Games is made up of talented folks from all over the world! \n\nAbdullah Kassem, art director and concept artist -- California, USA\nEric Grossman, level designer -- California, USA\nMichelle Chen, character modeler and animator -- Skovde, Sweden\nSebastian Bularca, programmer -- Skovde, Sweden \nJess Gloder, environment artist -- London, United Kingdom\nElise Kates, sound designer -- Washington, USA\nAri Fisher, composer -- California, USA\nKarinya Song, producer -- New Jersey, USA\nNicholas Laborde, lead producer -- Louisiana, USA\n\nWe also want to extend special thanks to Mark Tassin and John Melancon for their help in creating our project video!\n\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to read about our project!

The ~10% extra safety net will account for any extra time we have to spend making the game polished and ready for you to play, and if it turns out we didn't need it, it'll go back into the game to create an additional level.

You will journey to a small village filled with magical girls and other fantastical friends, where you are placed in charge of a run down cat caf\u00e9. Build up your caf\u00e9 by filling it with cute furniture, fun decorations, yummy pastries, and get it bustling with animals again!\nIn Calico, you play as a sweet magical cutie. There are two playable characters to choose from: Heartgirl and Flowergirl! \n Which Platforms?\nCalico will release on PC and Mac (steam included), Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4~\n\nUnlike its inspirations, such as Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, there are no negative consequences.  Animals will not die, the shop will not close, and the crops will not rot.  Players are free to explore the joy of a heavily stylized world full of cuddly critters. \nCalico is meant to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The gameplay reflects that with a laid back, low stress creative environment to explore and play in.\nExplore the village to find cats and other animals, including raccoons, deer, dogs, turtles, red pandas, foxes, and many, many more cuties!\nThe player will encounter many animals in the world of Calico. Once befriended, you can name them, add them to your party, or send them to their new home at the caf\u00e9. Animals in your party will follow you everywhere you go and listen to your commands. The animals in your cafe will relax and play with any customers that pop in for a visit.\n All animals are interactive!\nAlong with adding animals to your party, Interact with cats and other animals by petting and playing! Some of the animal interactions in Calico will include playing with toys, dancing, cuddling, petting, carrying, lounging with, and pampering. There will even be special features, like placing animals on your head! Special creatures like koi fish will be able to be fed, and the birds would love to be given seeds!  \n We have big plans for the animals' personalities. Their AI will include things like:   \nHappiness, trust, and energy levels  \nHow active, lazy, or hungry they are  \nHow close they like to be to the player  \nDo they like being picked up?\nDo they listen to player commands? \nWhat other animals do they like as friends  \nWhat\u2019s their favorite toy?\nUnique actions exclusive to specific animals And more!\nFor the \u201cYour pet in the game\u201d Kickstarter tiers, we will ask you to describe your pet\u2019s personality and quirks so that their in-game version will properly capture their spirit! \nCalico takes place on a star-shaped island with 6 different environmental areas. In the middle is a heart shaped town where your caf\u00e9 resides!\nCalico is a cat caf\u00e9 in the middle of a small heart shaped town. For those unaware, a cat caf\u00e9 is a caf\u00e9 that includes cats that can be watched and played with. But animal caf\u00e9s are not limited to cats. Some areas have bunny caf\u00e9s, owl caf\u00e9s, or even raccoon caf\u00e9s!\nThis caf\u00e9 is open to all animals, and needs your care to become a welcoming cafe again!\nDecoration\n Your task in Calico is to bring the town's caf\u00e9 back to life again. This isn\u2019t just achieved by bringing in cats and animals alone, however \u2013 you can also decorate your caf\u00e9 with furniture and toys! We will have a full system that allows you to collect and arrange furniture, decorations, and toys. Some furniture is for the caf\u00e9\u2019s human visitors, while other furniture is meant for your animal friends (like cat trees, scratching posts, and dog beds, to name a few options!). \nYummy drinks and dessert in the caf\u00e9\n Create a wonderful caf\u00e9 by making yummy bakes goods and drinks for the townspeople! We will have a system in which you can create and display pastries for sale in the caf\u00e9 display cases, as well as create a drink menu. Some of the pastries and drinks will be customizable. For instance, the macaroons will have a surface on which you can paint designs~ \n\n Currency System\nWhile having goods on display in the town, residents of the town will be able to come by and purchase your goods and hang out in the caf\u00e9. This means you will gradually start making money. Things that you will be able to use money for include more furniture and decorations for your cafe, more toys for your animals, more available foods and drinks to make, and shopping around town! (Note: this is entirely optional!)\n In town will be multiple shops, including the potion shop. Autumn runs the potion shop at the top of the hill, in a giant moss terrarium. Give her a visit to get potions that can alter animals and the game around you! \n We wanted there to be no limits to how you could find happiness in Calico. Magic potions are a system that allow us to break the rules of what is possible and to find what would be most fun. \nHere\u2019s a taste of what\u2019s to come: the More-to-pet Potion allows the player to magically turn a single animal giant-sized! You can hang out with a giant animal, or even ride a giant cat! \nOr a red panda!\n\nAbout Funds\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise enough money that both Andrew and Kells can work on the game full time for the next year and a half. That is where most of the money will go, as we cover most of the bases. The other amounts will go to the usual legal requirements/ fees/ safety net, and skills we can't cover.

Follow our socials and sign up for our newsletter to keep updated on Calico! We did not reach our funding goal this time, but we have plans moving forward to continue working on the game and looking for funding. This cuddly kitty dream is not going away any time soon. \u2764\ufe0f\nMailing list\nTwitter\nFacebook\nCalico has a playable prototype! Though very basic, this will hopefully show you our vision for Calico. (windows only for now)\nPrototype Demo Download\nCalico is a day-in-the-life community-sim where you move to a town of magical girls and are given a harrowing yet adorable task; Make the town\u2019s cat caf\u00e9 active and full of cuddly creatures again! You will journey to a small village of Magical Girls and other fantastical friends to fix up the cat cafe, as well as fill it with furniture, decorations, yummy pastries and most importantly CATS!\nYou Can Look Over Our Dev Journey Here!\nCalico is a game meant to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The gameplay reflects that with a laid back, low stress creative environment to explore and play in.\nExplore the village to find cats and other animals, including raccoons, deer, dogs, turtles, red pandas, foxes, and many, many more cuties!\nThe player will encounter many animals in the world of Calico, and once you befriend them you can name them, then add them to your party or send them to their new home at the cafe. The animals in your party will follow you everywhere you go and listen to your commands. The animals in your cafe will relax and play with any customers that pop in for a visit.\nInteract with cats and other animals by petting and playing, all animals are interactive!\n Interactions will include playing with toys, dancing, cuddling, petting, carrying, lounging with and pampering! There will also be features like being able to put the animals on your head. Special creatures, like Koi fish will be able to be fed, and I'm sure the birds would love some seeds!\nWe have big plans for the animals' personalities. Their AI will include things like:   \nHappiness, trust, and energy levels  \nHow active, lazy, or hungry they are  \nHow close they like to be to the player  \nDo they like being picked up  \nDo they listen to player commands  \nWhat other animals do they like as friends  \nWhat\u2019s their favorite toy  \nUnique actions exclusive to specific animals And more!\nFor the \u201cYour pet in the game\u201d Kickstarter tiers, we will ask you to describe your pet\u2019s personality and quirks so that their in-game version will properly capture their spirit!\n\nCalico is a cat caf\u00e9 in the middle of town. For those unaware, a cat caf\u00e9 is a caf\u00e9 that includes cats that can be watched and played with. But animal caf\u00e9s are not limited to cats. Some areas have bunny caf\u00e9s, owl caf\u00e9s, or even raccoon caf\u00e9s!\nDecoration\nYour task in Calico is to bring the town's caf\u00e9 back to life again. Along with bringing cats and animals in, as mentioned in the animal sections, you can also decorate your cafe with furniture and toys! We will have a full system allowing you to collect and arrange furniture, decorations, and toys. Some of the furniture will be for people visiting the cafe, and some will be cat and animal furniture like Cat trees, scratching posts, and dog beds.\nYummy drinks and dessert in the caf\u00e9\nAlong with creating a nice place for the residents and animals of the town to hang out, you can also serve them yummy bakes goods and drinks! We will have a system in which you can create and display pastries for sale in the caf\u00e9 display cases, as well as create a drink menu. Some of the pastries and drinks will be customizable. For instance, the macaroons will have a surface in which you can paint designs!\nCurrency System\nWhile having goods on display in the town, residents of the town will be able to come by and purchase your goods and hang out in the caf\u00e9. This means you will gradually start making money. Things that you will be able to use money for include more furniture and decorations for your cafe, more toys for your animals, more available foods and drinks to make, and shopping around town!\nIn town will be multiple shops, including the potion shop. Autumn runs the potion shop at the top of the hill, in a giant wet plant terrarium. In the full game, give her a visit to get potions that can alter animals and the game around you!\nAutumn's Potion Shop\nWe wanted there to be no limits to how you could find happiness in Calico. Magic potions are a system that allow us to break the rules of what is possible and to find what would be most fun. \nMore-to-pet Potion is just one example of many available potions!\nMore-to-pet Potion allows the player to pick an animal to grow to a larger size. You can hang out with a giant animal, or even ride a giant cat!\nIn Calico, you play as a sweet magical cutie. There are two playable characters to choose from, Heartgirl and Flowergirl!\nWe even have this cute  demo animation from Diego!\nKiva - Town Mayor\nKiva is the friendly magical girl mayor of our town! She is SUPER excited for the cat caf\u00e9 to open again. She is dedicated to keeping the people of the town as happy as possible.

Her appearance is due to her accidentally spilling a potion on herself, which made her part cat. She seems to not mind much though. She is very proud of her well taken care of terrarium home.\nOliver - Travelling merchant\nOliver is a mysterious stray cat that wanders from village to village. Due to this, you know almost nothing about him, but the good part is that he brings cool items from out of town. He seems to like flowers.\nLila - Resident\nLila, another magical girl lives near you. She is very sweet and always smells of roses. She's in charge of the flowers around town.\nAsh - Resident\nAsh is a skilled, yet laid-back magic user. They like to chat with Autumn about potions, and have even used potions to create some of their tattoos.\nElise - Resident\nElise is another Resident.

You'll have to befriend her to learn more.\n Many more residents and characters to come!\nWhich Platforms?\nWe guarantee PC and Mac.

Join our cast of 5 space-faring heroes as they travel from planet to planet, working together to strengthen their bond and defeat a looming evil that threatens the galaxy! \nCast of 5 playable characters to choose from, each with their own ultimate ability!\nDesigned from the ground up for 2 player local co-op! (can play solo!)\nXbox and PS4 controller support!\nArcade mode with global high score leaderboard!\nStory mode featuring visual novel style dialogue scenes and an epic quest!\nOriginal soundtrack!\nFast paced arcade style action for two players! In space!\nStarCrossed is being developed by Contigo Games, an independent games studio dedicated to creating compelling multiplayer experiences. Our team has been working on this game for about 2 years and we've been paying all expenses out of pocket. We're turning to Kickstarter and our community for financial support for outreach and marketing so we can ensure a smooth and successful launch! We also hope to bring the game to console shortly after our PC release, which will only be possible with your support! The team is currently targeting Xbox One and Switch for future releases. Thank you!\nStarCrossed is an action arcade game with a cooperative twist. It's similar to a classic arcade space shooter except your only weapon is the star bouncing between you and your partner. Our mission is to provide an experience that focuses on the importance of collaboration, showcased by the two-player cooperative gameplay. Timing and teamwork are key! \nStarCrossed has two main mechanics, Flying and Starboosting! The only way to destroy an enemy is by hitting them with the star that is bouncing between both players. Since the star always returns to you, your position grants you full control over its path\u2026 If you can coordinate with your partner.\nWhen the star is near you can Starboost with a well timed button press, giving it a burst of speed and increasing the Sync Level between you and your partner. Represented by the bars on the bottom of the screen, your Sync Level controls the speed of the star as well as your score multiplier. Every successful Starboost increases your sync, but each miss takes some away. \nStarboost in sync with your partner for more power!\nWhen things get challenging, a Dash is available to get you out of a bad situation. Sometimes all you need is a few frames of invincibility and a burst of speed to stay alive\u2026 but sometimes you need more.\nIf you and your partner can keep your Sync Level up you will begin to charge your Ultimate ability. This is a flashy and powerful attack unique to the character you choose that can be saved until you need it most! \nA well timed ultimate can make a big difference!\nCan you stay in sync with your partner to destroy the enemies that want to keep you at bay? Join our cast of 5 space-faring heroes as they travel from planet to planet, working together to strengthen their bond and defeat a looming evil that threatens the galaxy!\nThe Nova Galaxy is an empire of unified peoples, physically pulled and held together through time and space with the power of the Harmony Crystal. Though it is constantly protected by the royal family, in past times of crisis the Harmony Crystal has anointed five heroes to defend it from harm and thus keep the galaxy unified. StarCrossed is the story of a new time of crisis and the new heroes chosen to fight. \nWe don't want to give away too much of the plot! StarCrossed's Story Mode is currently in development and features curated cooperative challenges including enemy waves, boss fights, and visual novel style cutscenes telling the story of our heroes and their journey. \nDialogue cutscenes are currently in development and feature fully illustrated character portraits!\nStarCrossed is about the squad's stories, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t challenge you! Using a mix of hand created challenges and procedural enemy generation, StarCrossed scales to the challenge you are looking for. Giving you the option to focus on the story or to chase a world record score.\nSome of us are score chasers too, which is why we have an Endless Arcade Mode as well that makes heavy use of our procedural enemy system to give you a challenge beyond the story mode that you can share how long you and your partner can last on a Global Leaderboard.\nStarCrossed has been designed from the ground up as a local co-op game, but is also playable by one person.\nStarCrossed also features an original soundtrack composed by Alex Parrish. Here's a sample of the playful, upbeat tunes you can expect to hear in the finished game. Click below to listen!\nStarCrossed is heavily inspired by classic mahou shoujo (\"Magical Girl\") media, think \"Sailor Moon\" or \"Tokyo Mew Mew\". Our team loves the premise of a ragtag group of strangers from different backgrounds coming together for a common cause and we borrowed our favorite character tropes and inspirations to create our cast. \nThrough the game, players are able to choose which two characters are used in gameplay. The two characters collaborate and work together, strengthening their understanding of one another and the bond between them. We're excited for players to explore the game's Story Mode with different combinations of characters, resulting in unique dialogue exchanges and memories! Ultimately, we hope you love our characters as much as we do! \nPhysical Rewards include character pins & sticker sheet featuring cute art of the StarCrossed characters!\nThe story of Contigo Games is a story of four friends who wanted to stay close even when life pulled them geographically far away. Francesca, Dillon, Benny, and Mike founded Contigo Games in 2016 in Massachusetts, USA to work on StarCrossed. As personal obligations forced us to move apart, Contigo continued existing as a remote team. We've been working on StarCrossed for a little over 2 years now, but our goal remains the same as it was on day 1; to create a game about cooperation and friendship which brings players together the same way that creating it has kept us together.\nStarCrossed began as a 3-hour game jam project (You made a game in 3 hours???  Yes, it was difficult and we don't recommend it!). We began showing our tiny project to friends, peers, and at local developer meet ups. Although it was hardly a game at the time, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive and our dreams for what this game could become starting growing wildly. Since then we've formed a company, shown demos of StarCrossed at large scale events like PAX East and Pixelpop Festival, and made a game that we're truly proud of! It's been a long and amazing journey and we're excited to finally release the game in to the world. \nWe are a game studio that values the input and feedback from our community. If you've been following the game for a while, we appreciate your support more than you know. If you're just joining us now, welcome! We hope you'll stick around and be a part of our community.\nFrancesca Carletto-Leon (@ceschiii) is an experienced independent game developer and educator who has been with StarCrossed since the beginning. She wears many hats and is our producer, narrative designer, and 3D artist. Her favorite Sailor Scout is Sailor Jupiter.\nDillon DeSimone (@gunpuncher) was brought on after the original prototype. Instantly sold on the promising aesthetic of the game, Dillon locked in as the lead artist. He's animated all the characters and enemies, and focused on designing a fun, effective UI! \nMichael Flood (@MikeFlewd) was introduced to the project shortly after the initial prototype and was immediately hooked on StarCrossed\u2019s unique mechanic. Mike is the gameplay designer and programmer making StarCrossed both fun and fair for all players! \nBenjamin Peake (@BennyPeake) is an experienced software engineer and one of the original prototypers. He has been hooked since the beginning and has been responsible for making many of the inner gears of StarCrossed turn.\nOriana Carletto (@milkliem) was brought on to the team because of her skill in designing captivating characters. She is responsible for our 2D character art and illustrations which appear in Story Mode.\nAlex Parrish (@PearlPixel) is a composer and musician responsible for creating StarCrossed's sound track. Please check out her amazing work here!\nRenzo G. Heredia (@RenzoGHeredia) is a longtime friend and talented sound designer who is handling our sound effects and soundscape. His previous credits include work at Harmonix and Sony Santa Monica Studio.\nWe decided to come to Kickstarter because we love the sense of support and community it invokes. StarCrossed started off largely as a passion project and we've been paying all expenses out of pocket. This includes development costs, cost of living for our team, traveling to festivals and conventions, and marketing costs. We're turning to Kickstarter and our community for financial support for our launch so we can ensure adequate outreach and find audiences that we know will love our game! \nHere's a breakdown of exactly where your money is going. The majority of funds will go towards marketing the game and outreach. After Kickstarter fees (10%) and Kickstarter rewards fulfillment (15%), the remaining funds will go towards certification on consoles and 15% of our raised money will go directly to our lovely contractors, so that StarCrossed can feature more full-color illustrations, music, and sound effects. We hope to bring the game to console shortly after our PC release, which will only be possible with your support! Our team is currently targeting Xbox One and Switch for future releases and this Kickstarter will help support our team through the certification process. Thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign, and we hope you'll consider contributing!

Now it's our turn to repay the favor.\n Boyfriend Dungeon is an action-RPG dungeon crawler in which the weapons you use transform into beautiful people -- take them on dates to level them up and become more powerful together.\nDate up to nine weapons, from dancing swords to heart-piercing daggers\nGenerated action-combat dunj and challenges! Stay sharp!\nVarious combat styles.

Check out our Steam coming soon page and after you back us, feel free to add us to your wishlist\u2026\nWe will also offer DRM-free versions of PC, Mac, and Linux via the Humble Store.\nWhat about consoles? Or other stores? We\u2019re not ready to talk about consoles yet, sorry! This campaign is specifically to support us being able to make the best possible desktop version and merchandise.\nKitfox Games is an award-winning game studio. Boyfriend Dungeon is the fourth title we're bringing to Steam. For more information about our past games, scroll down to the section below entitled The Team.\nAs of the start of this campaign, we've now revealed all 5 of the weapons you can date (Talwar, Dagger, Epee, Lasersaber, and Glaive).\nThis campaign, in addition to helping us finish the game, will fund a 6th weapon... the cat, Brass Knuckles!\nWe don\u2019t want to give away too many spoilers, so we won\u2019t tell you everything about the weapons, but we\u2019ve prepared these dating profiles so you can get an idea of who you might prefer! If you're more interested in their combat abilities and play-styles, scroll down to see their individual tactics.\nAlternately, you can take our Wielder Test to see which one we would recommend for you.\nThe talwar is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian Subcontinent. (Wikipedia)\nSunder says: \"Hey, gorgeous. I didn't expect to meet someone like you in the dunj... I hope I can keep you safe. I've been around a while but don't believe everything you hear -- some people are jealous, or don't know how to forgive. But you're the open-minded type, right?\"\nDaggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations... (Wikipedia)\nValeria says: \"Oh, hey, you're cute! So.. what's your deal? You can tell me. If you want to, I mean. What? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just an old friend, looking out for me. Let's talk about you instead. Maybe you should come by my studio sometime and I'll paint you..\"\nThe entire body is the valid target area. A successful \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time. (Wikipedia)\nIsaac says: \"Goodness. Let's get down to facts, shall we? I may be new to the dunj, but I know plenty about fencing. Hold onto me tightly, but not too tight. Deep breaths. Parry, then thrust. Practice makes perfect.\"\nWhen a Lasersaber powers up, he can be dangerous, but most of the time, he prefers to recharge his batteries.\nSeven says: \"Hey. I want to keep our.. friendship.. secret for now, if that's okay with you. My agent and fans are a little high-maintenance and I just want to relax. Maybe we can watch TV together sometime?\"\nThis class of polearms [is rated] above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. (Wikipedia)\nSawyer says: \"UHH! I'm late for class, but.. hi! Um. Since you seem to have your life together, maybe you can show me how to cook? Would that be okay? I wouldn't want to waste your time. Let me know, but no worries if you're too busy.\"\nAnd this Kickstarter, if it succeeds, will help fund a sixth weapon, Brass Knuckles! \nBrass knuckles are designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force... (Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier.

Includes: T-Shirt, Messenger Bag, Stickers, Soundtrack CD, Mug, Pin, USB Rose game copy, Collector's Edition Box Set, and a Body Pillowcase of your choosing\nThe music, sound effects and audio design overall will be managed by Omar Dabbous, audio designer of GNOG by KO_OP.  \nThe soundtrack of Boyfriend Dungeon is an hour of all-original summery weapon-pop from the master composer Marskye (also of GNOG), often featuring the vocals of Madeleine McQueen.    \nTheir collaboration has already produced a few amazing tracks, including the main theme song you hear in the trailer, \u201cWithout a Weapon\u201d (Soundcloud link):   \n  And, presented here for the first time, a preview of the new soon-to-be-hit single, Spellbound:\n If you back the project now, you\u2019re sure to get notified when we post more songs and track previews in the future, during and after the campaign.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Background Illustration: Jessica Mao is creating most of the game\u2019s background illustrations! They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

Please direct message us through Kickstarter if you'd like to arrange to back the game.]\nGalactic Scoundrels is a storytelling card game with a space-western theme and beautiful, gritty artwork (designed by Kevin Cates). Players gamble and bluff each other to win a job and then tell the shared story of that job by playing cards. Each job is a mini-adventure lasting 15-20 minutes, with spaceships, crew, cargo, strange and wonderful characters, and exciting twists.\nThe game has simple rules, which can be learned in about ten minutes. This allows players to emphasize storytelling, negotiation, and social interaction. A full game lasts 90 minutes or so, but players often just play as many stories as they feel inspired to tell.\nGalactic Scoundrels invites players to draw on classic sci-fi film and TV tropes, but lots of players make up their own stories entirely. For those players who are nervous that they won\u2019t tell a \u201cgood\u201d story, the cards provide just enough guidance to help. Many players find collaborating on the story so enjoyable that there\u2019s very little \u201cmake other players suffer\u201d-style gameplay. Instead, the joy of a great story often becomes the object of the game.\nIf you like gambling, negotiating with your friends, piloting a spaceship, and telling crazy stories about your adventures, then Galactic Scoundrels is the game for you.\nScoundrels need all of these to survive. Which one is your specialty?\nMetal dice available for the High Roller tier\nBack the High Roller tier, and you'll get four of these shiny d4s from SkullSplitter Dice!\n Learn more about the dice on the SkullSplitter Dice website.\nGalactic Scoundrels is played over a series of rounds, each of which is centered on a single player taking a job fit for a scoundrel. All the players start with a five-card hand, a ship, and a bit of cash. Here are the phases of a round.\nWinning the Job\nPlayers draw a new job card and roll the dice to see how much the job is worth. Players play a bluffing, poker-style game using suit markers on their cards, in an attempt to win the job. If players fold, they lose the job. If they lie and get caught, they lose the job and some valuables to boot. Whoever wins the gambling phase may take the job or sell it to another player.\nSurviving the Job\nOnce a player takes the job, roll the dice to see how many turns it will last. The player who took it preps her ship, adding crew, passengers, and cargo as her ship and hand allow. Then, the other players play cards with characters, encounters, and plot twists on them, which the player on the job must deal with, one at a time, using cards from her hand and everything on her ship. If she gets stuck, she asks other players for help. They usually help, for a price. All along, the players tell the story of the scoundrel's adventure. If the scoundrel survives the number of turns of the job, she wins the payoff.\nRelaxing at the Spaceport\nOnce the job is over, everyone heads to the spaceport. Players who weren't on a job can scavenge new cards. Everyone gets a chance to buy better ships and hire crew before the next job card is drawn.\nOnce all the money is paid out, the game ends, and the scoundrel with the most cash wins.\nGameplay/Livestream Videos\nLaunch Day Game Demo Livestream\nGameplay and Strategy Discussion Livestream\nPLAY\n\nA key element of a great storytelling game is variation, so we've focused on giving everyone who backs the game as many additional cards as we can!\nWe will be shipping from warehouses in both the United States and the European Union.

Galactic Scoundrels is very nearly print-ready: a few small revisions might still be made, but the game will be sent to the printer not long after the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign. Delays are always a possibility, but we will make an extra effort to communicate with all backers about any changes in plans or hiccoughs throughout the process. \n\nThis game has been tested thoroughly with many diverse groups to make sure it's a fun, polished, and engaging experience for all play groups. We strive to create games that can be enjoyed regardless of experience level, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual preference, identity, or ability. Ultimately, storytelling games thrive when players can let their imaginations loose, and we hope that everyone can draw on their own experiences for their stories.

Instead, you'll be playing a secret society who is betting on the hopeful victors of this war while pulling strings to rig the results and ensure your bets pay off. A War of Whispers is a game of area control, hidden agendas, and shifting loyalties, that offers deep strategy within a tight playing time.\nRead a design diary by Jeremy Stoltzfus!  \nExample Setup \u2014 Standard Edition\nYou start the game with 5 Loyalty Tokens, each corresponding to one of the 5 different empires, bet randomly on a loyalty value. \nYour goal is to ensure that when the game ends, the empires you are most loyal to control the most cities across the map. You will influence the actions of these empires by placing spies in their ruling councils, which will give you control over certain functions of that empire: attacking, unit placement, etc.\nGameplay consists of turns broken down into the following phases:  \nDeploy Agents \u2014 Each player deploys their agents to empire council positions. Sheriffs solidify an empire, Stewards draw cards or boost a single region, the Marshall prepares for battle, and the Chancellor exercises their authority by copying other agent positions.\nEmpire Turns \u2014 Each council position on each empire council will take an action such as attacking, drawing or playing a card, or marching your banners. Cards are empire-specific but can be combined with cards from other empires for devastating combos. The combat resolution is diceless and brutal \u2014 forces exchange at a 1:1 ratio.\nIn the above example, the player takes the Sheriff action by placing 2 banners, then the Marshall action by attacking 2 banners into enemy territory.\nMark the Turn \u2014 Pass the first player marker clockwise and advance the marker on the turn track. The game will end immediately when the marker hits the final spot on the fourth round.  \nSwap (optional) \u2014 Each player may swap 2 of their unrevealed loyalty tokens. If they choose to do so, they must reveal both of the swapped loyalty tokens and leave them revealed for the rest of the game.\nCleanup \u2014 Each player discards down to 5 cards.\nHow do I play cards?\nYou play cards during your Empire Turn. To play the card, you must discard cards of the empire and quantities shown in the cost listed beside the chosen ability.\nThe card being played counts as one of the cards being discarded to pay the cost. For this reason, the first ability on each card can be played without discarding any additional cards.\nIn the above example, 2 cards are discarded to take advantage of the Bear Empire's Mercenaries ability: destroy 3 banners in any region. \nHow do I win?\nTo determine the winner, players reveal all of their loyalty tokens that were placed secretly at the start of the game. Multiply the loyalty bonus by the number of cities each empire controls. The graphic above represents a sample final scoring for the Pale Raven player:\nLion \u2014 2 Cities x 4 Loyalty (Devout) = 8 \nElephant \u2014 3 Cities x 3 Loyalty (Dutiful) = 9 \nBear \u2014 1 City x 2 Loyalty (Affiliated) = 2 \nEagle \u2014 4 Cities x 0 Loyalty (Unallied) = 0 \nHorse \u2014 2 Cities x (-1) Loyalty (Opposed) = -2\nThe final score for the Pale Raven player is 17 (8 + 9 + 2 + 0 - 2). \nThe player who scores the most points is the winner. If two players are tied for equal points then the player that swapped loyalty the least during the game wins. If both players are still tied, the player with the most empire cards in hand wins.\nLink not working?

I\u2019m Sam, an artist focused on work that explores our inner, emotional worlds. Much of my childhood was spent alone in the woods or exploring the possibilities of dreams. I\u2019ve drawn on these personal experiences to create a visual language of dark nature, hypnagogic patterns, and moody atmospheres.\nThe Blood Moon Tarot is a project being brought to life by over 10 years of experience using the tarot and over 2 years of work on the deck itself. I believe tarot\u2019s marriage of art and symbolism make it a powerful tool for examining ourselves and our circumstances. This deck explores my personal interpretations of the cards in my own visual language, making it quite different from the iconic imagery of the Rider-Waite deck. With this deck I hope to encourage others to sit with their struggles, learn how to navigate the emotional landscapes within themselves, and connect with the mystery of the world around them.\nThe Blood Moon Tarot will be a complete deck featuring a fully illustrated Major Arcana and Minor Arcana. Much of my personal imagery is rich with nature, flowing lines, and earthy color palettes. I'm nearly done the Major Arcana (only The World remains) and I have the sketches for the Minor Arcana cards done and am currently finalizing the drawings so that I can paint. I\u2019ll be sharing my progress on the Minor Arcana as the kickstarter takes place, so look for updates as the campaign progresses! I plan to have the art done and the deck ready to print by August so that I can have everyone's packages to them by the winter holidays.\nThe current card specs are: 2.75 \" x 4.75\", 350gsm, matte finish, gilded edges, foil card backs, in a tuck box.\nThe suits of the Minor Arcana have been changed to Songs (cups), Skins (wands), Dreams (swords), and Honey (pentacles) to reflect the symbolic themes that I\u2019ve used. The individual suits are each comprised of one large painting which will be cropped to the individual cards, making that suit interconnected when laid out.\n A preview of the Minor Arcana sketches... keep an eye out here for updates during the campaign!\nThe Basic, Deluxe, Book, and Sketch & Deck tiers all come with an accompanying digital booklet which includes my meanings for each card as well as 3 unique tarot spreads created for the deck. Stretch goals come with each tier, but certain items will only be available for those who pledge at the Deluxe level and up. You can switch tiers anytime before the campaign ends or purchase additional stretch goal items through Pledgemanager after the campaign has funded (this will work if you want to order an extra deck as well).\nThe Original Art tiers offer original watercolor paintings from the Blood Moon Tarot*. Each one is watercolor and a genuine precious stone pigment on 140lb hot press watercolor paper. They measure approximately 6\" x 10\u201d and have been matted to 12\" x 16\".  These tiers also include a Blood Moon Tarot deck, the digital booklet, and all other stretch goal items that are available in the deluxe tiers. See details below:\n*Please note that when purchasing original art the rights remain with the artist.\nThe majority of my funding goal goes towards the costs of having the first run of the Blood Moon Tarot printed. A small amount of the funds will cover the costs of shipping those decks to me, Kickstarter's fees and processing fees, and I have a little safety net for any miscellaneous expenses that may occur. \nOnce we\u2019ve hit the funding goal I\u2019ll be adding stretch goals. These goals, when reached, will allow me to use the extra funds to make this deck special through additions such as upgrading the paper, adding gold foil to the back of the cards, or items such as beautiful art boxes to store your deck in.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nUNLOCKED $15,000 Paper stock will be upgraded for the Blood Moon Tarot, this upgrade is applied to ALL tier levels.\nUNLOCKED $18, 000 Gold gilded edges for the Blood Moon Tarot, this upgrade is applied to ALL tier levels.\nUNLOCKED $20, 000 8\" x 10\" gold foil print of the card back design, this upgrade is applied to DELUXE tier levels and up (Deluxe x2 tier will receive 2).\nUNLOCKED $23,000 Gold foil added to the card back design for the Blood Moon Tarot, this upgrade is applied to ALL tiers.\nUNLOCKED $25,000 2 extra tarot spreads, sketches, and color palettes will be added to the digital booklet, this upgrade is applied to ALL tiers.\nUNLOCKED $35, 000 I\u2019ll be adding tarot cloths to the DELUXE tiers and up (Deluxe x2 tier will receive 2)! It\u2019ll be an extension of the art from the card back covering the fabric from edge to edge. The design will be gold ink on black cotton and measure 24\" x 24\".\nUNLOCKED $40,000 I\u2019ll be adding a beautiful, art-covered magnetic box to protect your cards! These will be included in the DELUXE tiers and up (Deluxe x2 tier will receive 2)!\nUNLOCKED $45,000 I\u2019ll be adding gold foil to the beautiful, art-covered magnetic box from the previous tier! The art will be an elaboration of the the design on the card back, so the gold foil will bring it all together.\nUNLOCKED $50,000 The physical book will now be hardcover!\nMore to come...\nI plan to charge shipping through Pledgemanager after the campaign is funded - below are the final shipping costs...\nTo ensure the process of getting your rewards to you goes smoothly, here are some notes that will help us to avoid potential delays:\nPlease be sure you use an email address that is valid and frequently checked. When the Kickstarter is over a survey will be sent out to collect any information I might need to get your rewards to you. I will not be able to send you your reward until you fill out the survey.  \nPlease be sure your address is correctly spelled and in the proper format.

Not in The Good Life! This game is made for you!\nPlay as Naomi, a journalist from New York who moves to a backwoods British town called Rainy Woods in order to pay off her massive debt.\nThe only way for her to escape from debt hell is to take pictures of happenings in the town and report on them. Of course, 'the happiest town in the world' is not your average town...  \nThe inhabitants of the happiest town in the world are some of the most bizarre people you'll ever come across. You'll live alongside them as you solve mysteries and experience a hearty helping of craziness. We're sure that you'll eventually come to love all the mystery, horror, and good old charm that this town has to offer.\n\nDownload from the link below\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1wkbB1bNsht-EVkiyvfxdYumbZGIwmuTW/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe Good Life Prototype Demo, Available Now!\nRead Update 24 for all the instructions\nThe main character of this game is a female New Yorker named Naomi. In order to pay off her debt, she took a job from a newspaper company in NY and moved to the 'happiest town in the world.' This game chronicles all the bizarre things she experiences during her time in the town.\n A completely new 'daily life action-adventure game' with a slow life that isn't actually slow!\n In this game, the player has two main goals: \n1. Pay off your debt with money you earn from doing photography jobs in the town.\n\n2. Solve the mystery of the murder that took place in the 'happiest town in the world.'\nThe townspeople are also hiding a big secret...\n In the moonlight, all the townspeople suddenly transform... And suddenly, the town is filled with cats and dogs!\nOnce a month, everyone who lives there transforms into either a cat or a dog.\nNaturally, Naomi and the player will also turn into a cat or a dog.\nYou'll be able to select whether you want to transform into a cat or a dog at the very beginning. But if you get far enough in the story, you may reach a point where you can freely switch between them...?\nWhat happens in the town depends entirely on you!\nHow the townspeople behave, how their lives play out, and how the story ends... It'll all change based on your decisions.\n(How you interact with the townspeople and make friends with them will change how they think and behave.)\nThe townspeople's relationships will change based on how you play. In one town, you may see a surprising couple start dating... Or a normal character in your town may become the mayor of your friend's town...\nYou may even be able to influence how the story in your town plays out!\nThe story will eventually lead its main character (you) to a shocking truth...\nAs a journalist, your job is to take photographs as you live out your life in the town.\nYou can take photos of anyone, anywhere, then later post those photos on a photo app or sell them to a newspaper company for money.\nAll you need to do is frame your subjects! The abilities of your equipment will determine the overall quality.\nThis means that in order to take good pictures, you'll need to acquire a lot of different tools!\nBut first, you'll need to make a lot of money...  \nIn order to pay off your debt, in order to buy good equipment, in order to enjoy yourself, in order to quench your thirst for fashion...\nIn order to enjoy your life in Rainy Woods to the fullest, you'll need to take every chance you can to earn some extra cash!\nMake money with your photos!\n There are two ways for you to turn your photographs into money.\nThe first is to use the in-game SNS photo app \"Flamingo.\"\nUnlike Instagram, you can earn advertising profits for each \"Like\" your photos get.\nAll you need to do is upload them!\nChoose photos that best capture the seasons, add fun filters to your animal shots, or create a charming portrait.\nChoose photos that you think will get the most buzz on Flamingo and rack up the Likes!\nThe other way is to sell your photos to Morningvale, a newspaper company.\nPhotographs connected to the town's secrets will yield great rewards. What are the townspeople hiding...?\nSince Naomi's debt is connected to Morningvale, all the money you earn through them will only be used to pay it off.\nMake even more money with various part-time jobs!\n What do you think of when you hear the word 'countryside?' Gathering bugs and fruit? No, we're tired of all that! Shear sheep, deliver milk, make jam and hay, do some gardening, or work as a bartender, a casino dealer, a miner, or even mine for cryptocurrency if you want to! Enjoy some part-time jobs that are really 'out there' and give your country life a little mature flavor!\nBlow all the money you've earned on whatever you want!\n You can use the money you earn to pay off your debt and buy new camera equipment, but sometimes, it's good just to blow it on something fun!\nGo out for a drink, buy an expensive brand item, enjoy some afternoon tea, start an antique furniture collection...\nDon't forget to reward yourself for working hard!\nEnjoy the changes in time and season!\nThis is an open-world game centered around a rural English town. Naturally, the time and seasons will run on their own in-game clock. There will be special photos that you can only take in certain seasons which can be sold for lots of money, and we want traditional English events to appear in their proper seasons. Of course, classic events such as Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Easter are also being considered! Aside from events, you can test your luck in other ways such as journeying into mines to discover valuable ore veins, fishing your heart out, or harvesting a field of crops.\nEnjoy fashion!\n You can use money to give Naomi some style! Try on different outfits and pick the look you like best. Some clothes might even boost Naomi's parameters...\nYou need to take good care of yourself!\nThis game contains various parameters. For example, life, stamina, hunger, sleepiness, inebriation, beauty care... And for Naomi, a native to one of the world's most cutting edge cities, beauty care is super important!\nMake sure you don't forget to give yourself some special care every morning and every evening. Otherwise, you'll lose your feminine charm and end up as a filthy flytrap!\nOnce per month, you can enjoy the limitless freedom that only cats and dogs get to experience.\nTurn into a cat and climb up to high places, scratch walls, and steal fish and chips from kitchens... Or turn into a dog and dig holes, follow scents, and swim in rivers and lakes... It only happens once a month, so make sure you enjoy it to your heart's content!\nCat/dog mystery solving image\nUse your telescope lens to snap shots of targets in areas you can reach as a cat, or get up close to them as a dog and try to acquire the perfect scoop for a scandal photograph. There are some mysteries that only animals can solve! When you turn into one, you'll be able to do new things and adventure into new places.\nFrom the very beginning, we have been very careful about focusing on the one goal that really matters, and that\u2019s getting the campaign funded.\nWe had made plans for Stretch Goals, though. We put together two plans, one in case the campaign was incredibly successful very fast, and another plan in case the campaign got funded a few weeks in. We also knew there was a chance the campaign would only get funded at the last minute, which ended up the case. We didn\u2019t talk about the other alternative, because we believe in the campaign.\nAnyhow, we want to address Stretch Goals in case we do get funded and you want to know what the extra funds will go towards.\nWe had a long meeting today about this, and we kept coming back to the one thing that we have been asked the most throughout the campaign: bringing The Good Life to the Nintendo Switch.\n\nEven though, as you know, our lead programmer has started to play with the console devkit, we know that this will be a costly endeavour and we don\u2019t want to mess up our budget.\n\nWe have set a unique Stretch Goal at JPY 88,000,000 - bringing The Good Life to the Nintendo Switch\n\nOf course, we know this is a very high Stretch Goal, and considering the way the campaign is going, it is very much possible we are not going to reach it, so let me explain our reasoning.\nWe could have set up more stretch goals, adding content to the game, and help them build up towards the Switch Stretch Goal. However, as each of this smaller goal comes with a cost, they would have set the Switch Stretch Goal even further, making it meaningless, and upsetting the numerous fans who have been asking for the Switch port.\nWe could have set up those smaller game content stretch goals, and not mention the Switch Stretch Goal, but as I mentioned, this is by far the number one request I have received during the campaign, and not addressing it seems bad.\n\nSo, we decided to aim high - go for one single ambitious stretch goal, the most requested addition to the campaign.\n\nBUT.\n\nIf we do get funded and we miss the Stretch Goal, we will use the extra funds towards additional content for the game and we will share what these are with you in a post campaign update. To give you an idea, we are considering things like adding more music tracks, adding more seasonal events to Rainy Woods, creating more part time jobs/revenue generating activities for Naomi to repay her crippling debt, more outfits for our intrepid photographer, and so on.\nThis way you know that whatever happens, you are building towards a better game.\n\nWhat happens to the Nintendo Switch version if we miss the Stretch Goal?\nWe really, really want to make a Switch version. Any game developer these days is excited about this console. I would love to see fans playing The Good Life on the go, on the train. However, I also want to make The Good Life, and for this, we need to be very careful with our budget, and have a clear focus.\nIf we miss the Stretch Goal, I will work very hard to find an alternative way to get the Nintendo Switch version to happen, but we are not making it a promise to you. And the moment we know we can make it, you will be the first to be informed.\n\nWhat about collecting funds after the campaign to go toward the Switch Stretch Goal?\n\nWe discussed this, and as you will see in the next part of the update, we are planning for a way to collect some extra funds after the campaign. However, I know other Kickstarter campaigns have run late backers campaigns in a way where they have set those extra funds to complete more Stretch Goals.\nI think this is admirable and brave, but for The Good Life, we want to be able to really focus on our initial game, and work really hard towards it as soon as possible. The idea of having Stretch Goals indefinitely opened after the end of the campaign is quite scary, it gives us a moving target, harder to hit.\nFor this reason, we are only looking at the funds gathered during the campaign for the Stretch Goals. I believe it will lead to a better focus on our part, and a better game in the end for you all, and I hope you can support that decision and that philosophy.\n \u201cDEADLY PREMONITION DEVELOPER ANNOUNCES NEW GAME, THE GOOD LIFE \u201d\n- IGN  \n \u201cDeadly Premonition creator\u2019s next game is a cat RPG\u201d\n- Polygon  \n \u201cDeadly Premonition director Swery announces RPG about people who turn into cats\u201d\n- Eurogamer\nShipping Information\nIn order to keep costs as fair as possible and to avoid those costs to count towards our goals, we are planning to use a pledge manager (like BackerKit) to handle the shipping costs. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge. They will be charged to you when the items are ready to be sent, after the game has launched.\nBackerKit confirmed for our pledge manager\nWe are very happy to be able to confirm that we will use BackerKit to manage the pledges after the campaign. If you are not familiar with BackerKit, they are a company specialised in supporting the logistical side of crowdfunding campaigns.\nIt will allow us to more efficiently manage the surveys, and make sure we collect the right amount for the shipping costs if you have a physical reward that needs to be sent to you.\nNow, BackerKit also allows us to do a few extra things that are interesting. We can run a late backers campaign with them - we are still figuring things out about this and we might do one. But more importantly, we do know that we will allow our Kickstarter backers to purchase additional items from the campaign. In order for you to be able to plan which tier is best to pledge for, we want to let you know now about items that we have confirmed will be accessible to our backers on BackerKit, and their prices.\nPlease note that the listed prices (just like the campaign rewards) do not include the shipping costs:\n\u30fbThe Good Life T-Shirt. $40\n\u30fbThe Good Life Hoodie. $95\n\u30fbThe Good Life Mug. $20\n\u30fbDigital Copy of the game on PC. $30\n\u30fbDigital Copy of the game on PS4. $40\nWe haven\u2019t confirmed the other items - especially the Collector\u2019s Edition box. The current CE box has an exclusive design for the Kickstarter campaign, but we know that there will be a Limited Run version available at some point as well, and it might mean we won\u2019t offer the Kickstarter exclusive box on BackerKit.\nIf you have already backed The Good Life and put money beyond the reward tier that you have selected, please note that you will be able to use those extra funds towards these extra items.\nAnd if you already know you want one those items, of course, you can increase your pledge accordingly, just make sure you stay at the reward tier that you want. For instance, if you want the Joyful Life Tier (about $50), but are interested in getting the T-Shirt, you can pledge $90, and keep your pledge at the Joyful Life Tier.\nThe Good Life - Physical Collector's Edition\nHere are the contents of the Physical Collector's Edition.\nIt's going to be filled with a lot of high quality items produced by Limited Run, a company known for its great work on countless physical editions so far! Here is a list of everything that will be a part of the set!\nThe Good Life Physical Collector's Edition Contents:\n- Kickstarter Exclusive Box (Embossed, with a completely unique design)\n- Physical Game Disc (your choice of a PS4 or a PC version; PC version comes with a Steam key)\n- Post Card (Scenery of Rainy Woods)\n- Post Card (Letter from Team With SWERY's & Mr. Futatsugi's Signatures)\n- Rainy Woods Tourist Guide Leaflet (A4 size, tri-fold)\n- Artbook (A bit smaller than A5)\n- Trading Cards (Characters / Dogs / Cats)\n- Soundtrack CD\n\nRewards description and USD prices\nBelow you can find a summary of all the rewards, along an estimate of their price in US Dollars. The campaign is in Japanese Yen, those prices below are purely a guideline for the price range. As currency exchange rates can vary, we recommend you check on a dedicated website to have an up-to-date price of the rewards.\n I'm SWERY, the director of The Good Life.\nThe Good Life is my \"dream game\". I've been thinking about it for a very long time, and was finally blessed with a chance to develop it thanks to my powerful partners - and you, of course. Please join in on our project and help us make my dream game into EVERYONE'S dream game! I Love You All!\n I'm Futatsugi, from G-rounding. A long time ago, I used to believe that games had magic in them. A new game always brought me a brand new experience, and excitement as to what would happen next. Crazy things would happen, and it felt really like I had fallen under some sort of spell. But lately, the risks involved in creating new games have gotten more and more extreme, and it's becoming harder and harder to make magic games. SWERY and I want to bring that magic back - but we need to borrow a little mana from you in order to summon it. We want to show the world a kind of magic it's never seen.\n I'm Hotta, the art director. When I first heard about The Good Life, I was deeply drawn in by atmosphere (a personal favorite style of mine) and the direction its art style was heading in. I'm so excited to start working on it. After working hard on the art direction, we've finally arrived at the style that I always hoped we would eventually reach! I'm going to put 120% of all I've got into this, while enjoying the chemical reactions that ensue between the art style, the atmosphere, and SWERY!\nI first met Swery in 2013, I think. We immediately hit it off, and always met up whenever I went to Japan and whenever he came to America. We quickly became good enough friends to have long, deep talks about the future together. When he released the amazing D4, we collaborated with him and performed the soundtrack live, but this time with The Good Life, we've received the chance to work with him on an even deeper level - actually creating the music itself. Orchestral music, band rock, and excellent singing are all important elements of the VGO, so we intend to supply you all with some Sweryism music that only we can create. We'll be posting some demos later, so please check them out!\nUnity\nWhite Owls has an idea for a fun game. G-rounding has the skill and the experience to create it. However, we don't possess the funds to push this project forward.\nSince 2010, the methods by which games are created have been changing rapidly. Through the proliferation of various game engines, virtually anyone can make their own game now as long as they set up the proper environment for it. Indie games have risen, multiple digital distribution platforms have become well-established, and new platforms such as VR have entered the fray. Due to these reasons and more, we game creators must adapt to many changes in order to survive. \nThis is especially true when it comes to gathering funds. The method to gather funds known as crowdfunding is now available to us. We no longer have to narrow in on our target and pitch an idea to a single investor in the hopes of possibly receiving a large amount of funds. Instead, it's becoming more and more common for game creators to pitch their ideas directly to their audience and gather funds that way.\nThe truth is that even in this day and age, most Japanese game creators still gather funds using the traditional method. But this method will never allow a creator to truly own their work and let it be their identity while also knowing that it will be able to support them their future -- two things that Western creators adopting newer methods have managed to achieve. In Japan, copyrights always belong to the investors, which includes not only the profits from those rights, but also the rights to create continuations using the same IPs.\nThat's why we want to take the awesome concept behind The Good Life and use our skill to build it on equal footing with our investors. After thinking long and hard about what our best course of action would be, we decided to adopt a hybrid model that allows us to push forth the project with both funds from partners and crowdfunding together.\nOur plan is to gather a portion of the necessary funds for our project from this campaign. Currently, we're already negotiating with several partners about this project, and we hope that successfully completing this campaign will bring The Good Life closer to perfection in the end.\nMany game creators narrow in on their target, alter their project scope and change their game ideas in order to gain a large amount of funds from a single investor. But what if all those game creators could take their awesome ideas as-is and simply propose them straight to their players?\nCrowdfunding makes this possible.We think The Good Life is an amazing idea, and will lead to a game that will be wholeheartedly accepted once it's completed. We want to prove this, with help from our supporters.\n*We created a pie chart that exhibits the funding ratio between crowdfunding and partners.\nUNTIES\n Limited Run\n Video Game Orchestra\nMEGA64 \nWe may add more allies in the future, so keep your eyes peeled in the updates!\nLast Autumn, we learned a lot thanks to our first campaign. We feel our biggest shortcoming was our inability to provide to our supporters a solid guarantee that we would complete the game no matter what.\nTherefore, we decided to reboot our project only after finding a powerful partner and getting proper guarantees in order to ensure that we would be able to deliver The Good Life to you all.\nBy teaming up with UNTIES, the new indie game label from Sony Music Entertainment, we will now be able to plan everything from the very beginning. The schedule up to the delivery of the product, localization, quality control, and making sure everyone around the world gets to join in.\nWe believe that this partnership guarantees that The Good Life project will reach completion.\nWhile The Good Life now has strong partners associated with it, the project still has a long way to go and has to prove itself in many ways.\nIn the same manner, White Owls is a young company, even though I, SWERY, have been making games for a while. The crowdfunding campaign is a good way for us to start relationships with our partners on a strong foot, where they feel confident that the game will be great, and my team and I have a strong understanding of what will make the game amazing for our fans.\nG-rounding has the history and more than enough power to develop the game, and partners have the marketing networks and the funds to release our game on a worldwide scale, but White Owls only has SWERY and the original idea for the project.\nThat's why I (SWERY) want to invite all our supporters to help us show the world the value of White Owls and The Good Life. If we can gather a part of the funds through crowdfunding and prove that White Owls and The Good Life has a strong appeal, we feel we will truly be able to push this project forward with far more power than we'd otherwise have on our own.\nIn other words, in order to create the best project centered around SWERY, we need much more than funds from a partner - we need to gather support (financial but also moral) through a crowdfunding campaign as well.\n\"But White Owls has SWERY. Isn't that enough?\" To all my fans and supporters out there who may be thinking something like this, I'm truly grateful. But the hard truth is that those feelings alone are not enough to create an entire game. We want to prove that White Owls is a development studio worth supporting, so please, lend us your help!\nWe want all our supporters to join this project from the very beginning so that everyone can carry an equal voice and equal responsibility. Let's work together to build The Good Life into the best game it can possibly be!!\nI Love You All!!  \nSWERY \n SWERY/WhiteOwls.inc                                     Twitter - Facebook - Instagrm - Webpage\nG-rounding.inc                                                                        Twitter - Facebook - Webpage\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 White Owls Inc. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u25bcHigh volume\nSince this game is based around a rural town in England, we\u2019re going to need to make different environments and build events into them. With games like The Good Life, the fun factor is proportionate to the number of different events, so we need to try and put in as many events as we can and also create a variety of areas for them to happen in. This will cost us, and depending on how things go, we may not be able to include all the events we want to.\n\n[Solution]\nWe\u2019ve decided to create multiple plans for the game volume based on how much funding we end up getting. With the lowest volume plan, players will still be able to enjoy a mysterious story, take pictures and earn money, communicate with villagers, and enjoy life in a rural town. On top of that, we\u2019ll also create a schedule for building peripheral elements such as decorations so that the game development will never come to a standstill due to monetary problems. Our staff members have been in the game industry for over 20 years, so we know how to strictly control our schedules.\n\n\u25bcControlling a large number of characters is difficult\nIn this game, we\u2019ll turn characters\u2019 desires, habits, goals, preferences, and invitations to one another into parameters for an autonomous system that controls their actions within the game. This is the first time we\u2019ve tried something like this, but if we manage to complete it, we\u2019ll be able to freely add a ton of variety to the game. The risk is that we won\u2019t know whether or not we can really pull this off until we give it a try.\n\n[Solution]\nIn the end, if we can\u2019t figure out a way to pull it off, we\u2019ll control the NPCs using the same method we used in Deadly Premonition. We can create an enhanced version of that system, which has already been successful once, in order to greatly lower our risk of failure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a5100 or more", "title": "Moral Support Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["388 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a51,500 or more", "title": "The Good Music Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nDigital OST (lossless format)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["167 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a53,000 or more", "title": "The Good Life on PC Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PC (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["4,157 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a53,500 or more", "title": "EARLY BIRD The Good Life on PS4 Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PS4 (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["799 backers", "Limited (1 left of 800)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a54,000 or more", "title": "The Good Life on PS4 Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PS4 (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["1,307 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a55,000 or more", "title": "The Joyful Life Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PC or PS4 (digital version)\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cJoyful Person\u201d list\nDigital OST (lossless format)\nDigital Storyline Overview (PDF)\nDigital concept art portfolio (PDF)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["1,783 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a58,000 or more", "title": "The Double Life Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nTwo copies of the game (PC or PS4; digital versions)\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cJoyful Person\u201d list\nDigital OST (lossless format)\nDigital Storyline Overview (PDF)\nDigital concept art portfolio (PDF)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["240 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a513,000 or more", "title": "The Awesome Life Tier", "descp": "Shipping not included.

But beware \u2013 not only does the cave become more and more treacherous as you explore its depths, but The Boy\u2019s prolonged isolation serves as a catalyst to his overactive imagination, causing reality and fantasy to become indiscernible.\nTo make matters worse, it turns out The Boy might not be the only person astray in the bowels of the Ozark wilderness.  What starts off as a few discarded notes and trace evidence of another person, The Boy quickly discovers deadly threats throughout the cave system and becomes the target of a desperate outlaw who vows to kill anyone who locates his whereabouts.\nLittle is known about the escaped outlaw, other than a local legend that describes his murderous ways and ruthless manner that found him at odds with both sides of the law.\nIn the present day, join the mysterious tour guide as he safely escorts you through the same modern day cave system, recalling each room's treacherous tale over several centuries -- with varying degrees of accuracy -- and attempting to shed light on the truth behind The Lost Cave of the Ozark's enigmatic history.\nThe concise nature of The Lost Cave of the Ozarks is specifically designed to provide players with a deep, rich story and a challenging experience that will leave a lasting impression.  While a typical playthrough will take approximately 2 hours to complete, hidden collectibles, multiple endings, and several secret story segments will provide additional hours of exploration and challenge.\nAlthough the majority of the game is confined to the damp darkness of the cave, the power of imagination will take you to ornate cathedrals, lush forests, freezing mountain peaks, eerie tombs, pirate-infested waters of the high seas, and more!\nThe Boy\nThe majority of gameplay is centered around The Boy and his struggle as he attempts to survive his encounter with the cave.  \n As The Boy, negotiate each room one-by-one in an effort to find extrication from the malicious Lost Cave.  Deep, meditative, and methodical exploration and environmental puzzle-solving is punctuated by heart-pounding action that is carefully designed to challenge your ingenuity and platforming skills.\nAs The Boy progresses, his perception becomes more and more obscured by his manifesting imagination, which serves as both an essential ally and a formidable foe.  As The Boy's story plays out, it is difficult to discern the real dangers from the imaginary ones -- and both are equally deadly.\nThe Boy's lantern not only serves as his light source and a powerful tool or weapon, but it is also the primary visual cue to his vitality.  Rather than clutter the screen with distracting health and stamina bars, the brightness of the lantern's flame is an indication of The Boy's well-being.  While performing strenuous tasks, such as sprinting or climbing, or taking damage from an enemy, the flame will gradually fade.  If it gets too dim, The Boy's speed and strength will be drastically reduced for a short time until he is able to recover.  If he receives enough enemy damage to extinguish the flame, however, The Boy will lose consciousness and have to restart from the last checkpoint.\nFull Vitality\nLow Vitality\nAdditionally, if The Boy leaves no stone unturned, he will find helpful clues left behind by a mysterious stranger.  If all the clues are discovered, there may yet be a glimmer of hope for escape.\nLibedon, the Tour Guide\nAfter completing a room as The Boy, players will return to the same segment in the present day -- this time as Libedon, the peculiar tour guide of The Lost Cave.\nAs he delves into the modernized, now tourist-friendly caverns, Libedon is able to dictate the facts and rich history of each specific room.  With an extreme obsession of the cave's history, as well as remarkable storytelling finesse to fill in the missing pieces, the odd tour guide captivates his audience while making sure they get their money's worth.\nLibedon's greater stories are narrated and presented alongside fantastically illustrated pieces of original art.\nAs an Ozark native, Libedon contains a breadth of knowledge akin to a human encyclopedia for the cave, enabling him to not only describe the stories and legends of the 1800s, but even the rumors and myths of Native Americans, Spanish Conquistadors, and more!\nAdditionally, if he investigates thoroughly enough, he may even discover new tales and evidence of the cave's history and The Boy's story!\nInformed by The Boy's embellishing imagination and Libedon's speculative collection of stories, in addition to the outlaw's own biased one-sided account, it is up to you to sift through the fiction to discover the truth.  \nThrough the lens of multiple unreliable narrators, can you discover the true history of The Lost Cave of the Ozarks?\nThe many people and places you visit in The Lost Cave of the Ozarks are all brought to life with highly stylized 2D hand-painted art.  Additionally, I am taking advantage of many other effects and techniques, such as blend layers, multiple parallax layers, particles, and more to really make the visuals pop.\nVisually inspired by beautiful hand-painted games such as Rayman Legends and Ori and the Blind Forest, I have gone to great lengths to ensure The Lost Cave will be easy on the eyes.\nThe cinematic musical score for The Lost Cave of the Ozarks is not only instrumental (pardon the pun) for setting the tone (and that one), but it is also a very important part of feedback for the player.\nAs you progress through a level, the music naturally progresses as well, creating a more immersive experience for players.  Additionally, the music will often signal when you are on the right track through a particular challenge!\nBelow are some sample tracks from The Lost Cave of the Ozarks.  To fully experience the dynamic musical progression, however, I recommend giving them a listen for yourself with the Pre-Alpha Demo that is linked at the top of this campaign.\nMy name is Adam Miller, and I am the one-man dev team behind The Lost Cave of the Ozarks.\nWhile my background in the video game industry is art focused, I have maintained many creative passions and hobbies throughout my lifetime.  I have a degree in English, I've been a musician for the majority of my life, and I have studied several martial arts for many years.\nAdditionally, I have been loving video games since getting my shiny new NES in the 80s, and I am continually learning and developing new skills.\nMore importantly, I have a wonderful wife and a 1 1/2 year old daughter, with another on the way!

Each track is being meticulously written to embody the tone and atmosphere of the level at hand.  From the melancholy piano of Boy's Theme, to the upbeat hill music of the logging camp and the orchestral climactic boss fights, I am making sure the music is as beautiful as the visuals.\nBeta Tester\nAs a Beta Tester, you will get early access to the entirety of the game before it is released.  Play the game in its early in-progress phase and help me figure out what works and what doesn't.  As a thank you for your help, you'll also get your name in the credits as a Beta Tester!\nArt Book\nAs an artist, I love making art.  As an artist making a game with a heavy emphasis on art, I am making a LOT of art.

Feast your eyes on the heart and soul of the game and get a behind-the-scenes peek at how it was made!\nShort Story\nFor those who enjoy a nice, concise story, I am also adapting the core story of The Lost Cave of the Ozarks into a short story.  While the game's narrative will encompass the broad story at hand, the written story will give you a deeper look at the individual stories of The Boy, the outlaw, and the tour guide.\nGet In The Game\nThere is a graveyard in the game that serves the final resting place for the residents of the logging town, Dryso, where The Boy is from.  You can get your name and a quote on your very own plot for the world to see! (All submitted names and quotes are subject to approval, so keep it PG-ish)\nTwo Signed Posters\nAs a huge thank you for backing my game, I will send you two SIGNED 11 x 17\" physical posters (one being a Kickstarter exclusive) for The Lost Cave of the Ozarks.\nThe inspiration for The Lost Cave of the Ozarks came to me around five years ago.  As I was enjoying a fascinating tour of a real cave in the Ozark Mountains, I was enthralled with the many stories and deep history recited by the tour guide that was contained in each room.\nAbout half-way through the tour, however, my mind began to wander, as it often does.  I began to wonder how likely these stories actually are.  \nWas this underground waterfall really thought to have been the Fountain of Youth by Spanish Conquistadors?\nDid an Osage Tribe hunting party really discover this cave by falling into the sinkhole while fighting a bear?\nDid a young boy in the 1800s really get lost for three days before being found, asleep, on the beautiful formation at the end of the tour?\nAnd even more -- What if the boy really was found here, but the story's ending was actually much more tragic than the family-friendly nature of the tour would allow?\nEver since that tour, I have been obsessed with the idea of stories:  Humanity's love of stories.  How stories constantly evolve over time -- even if the story is only a few minutes old, let alone several millennia.  Sometimes we exaggerate stories to make them more interesting or less embarrassing.  Sometimes we don't even just change a story with our imagination, but in fact our actual recollection of a story has supplemented a detail here or suppressed one there.  We can never know the truth of some stories.  And every single time a story is told -- no matter what -- there is always some degree of bias by the storyteller.\nOn that same note, as a literary nerd, I also love stories that are told by an unreliable narrator: someone who's credibility is compromised.\nIt was with these ingredients of storytelling that I came up with the narrative theme for The Lost Cave of the Ozarks.  I wanted to convey a story which would be best conveyed through the medium of videogames' amalgamation of player input and engagement, music, narrative, and visuals, that would be told by three differently compromised narrators, leaving the truth to be sorted out by the audience.\nStorytelling wasn't the only theme that cave tour inspired.  I was also enraptured by the pure imagination that went into the tour.  While rock formations, as magnificent as they are, may just be a random arrangement of sediment to some people, they are majestic manifestations of imagination to others.\nEach room and major formation of the cave was named and themed by the power of imagination.\nSee how the ceiling looks like a footprint? This is the Shoe Room.\nSee how porous the rock is in this room? The Cloud Room.\nSee that low-hanging rock in our path? That's \"Tall Man's Headache.\"\nI imagine that to most people, these are silly names based on vague resemblances to human experience.  But to others, they turn an ordinary experience into an extraordinary one.  Not only that, but I bet there are some great stories behind some of those names!  That formation is called \"Blondie's Throne\" huh?  The story behind that name is just begging to be told!\nI believe imagination is one of our most valuable tools.  It brings us together, it entertains us, and it even drives us to achieving a better reality -- just ask any scientist at NASA how big of a role Star Wars or Star Trek played in their career path.\nWhat better way to translate imagination from the screen to the players than through a young child?  And while children have the strongest sense of their imagination, I believe it is important for everyone to maintain a healthy imagination throughout their lives.\nI am the sole developer behind The Lost Cave of the Ozarks, so I am responsible for all the design, programming, art, animation, writing, music, sound FX, etc. with no aspects being contracted out to specialists.\nWhile this is extremely beneficial for keeping development costs low, it is time consuming.  Not only does this draw out the development cycle of the game, but it also interferes with my ability to work as a freelance artist.  In addition to needing to keep food on the table, there are also several unavoidable costs for game development, including tool and market license fees and subscriptions (game engine, digital painting software, animation software, backup cloud storage fees, Steam marketplace fees, etc.)\nThis is also why my funding goal is as low as it is.  Rather than needing an exuberant amount of cash to pay other people for their work, I just need a little so I can focus on the game for a short, intense period without worrying about taking on other projects for a bit.  Should this crowdfunding campaign raise more money than the initial goal, that money will all go toward the development of the game.\nWhile I would still have the ability to complete The Lost Cave of the Ozarks, proper funding will ensure I am able to focus on the game's development, which will lead to a much better product that you will be able to play much sooner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I have managed to mitigate most risks for this project, all projects have some type of risks.\n\nThe larger risks, such as catastrophic equipment failure, is very unlikely. However, just in case of such an event, I have a separate hard drive and two cloud storage backups for all my files.\n\nAlthough I have worked with several indie teams on past projects, this is my first solo venture in developing and publishing a publicly marketable game. As such, there are some possible unforeseen hurdles in my development path. However, I have the confidence to be able to solve the problems and the resources to seek assistance if necessary.\n\nI have also completed most of the groundwork for the game, such as the complex programming, animations, design, writing, etc., which means I do not expect this project to take much longer to complete (assuming I am able to raise the funds to focus on it). It is mostly a matter of building the remaining parts of the game that have already been planned, designed, and largely programmed.\n\nAs for rewards, a large majority of them are digitally distributed and therefore extremely unlikely to have issues with manufacturing or shipping.\n\nAdditionally, I am very familiar with the crowdfunding process.

There are monsters around every corner- in the skies, underground, behind your back and in your nightmares!  \nThis Kickstarter is to help fund the illustration and printing of the third issue- we are aiming for a print run of around 300.

This is a story that showcases the art, and our strong and mostly silent protagonist lets us tell the story through the visuals instead of jamming every page full of dialogue. \nSpeaking of the art, GEL #1 and 2 was written and illustrated by myself. This third issue will feature art by Ally Prasad. Since this issue diverges a bit from the main plot, a change of style fits right in!\nGEL #1 and 2 were fully funded out of pocket since I was flying solo.

Our old Kickstarter will be left to slumber peacefully. \nThe campaign is over, but the road goes on. What can I do?\n1. Like and Share this teaser. Keep the word going about Astrobase Command.\n \n2. Join the conversation on Discord.\n\n3. Check out our Patreon.\n\n4. Swing by our website and our forums. All the latest news goes up there first, so if you want to catch it hot off the press, it's the place to go. \nMissed the campaign, but still want to support Astrobase Command? We've got you covered. Head over to our site. We have a store page set up with just what you're looking for!\n  Procedural Personalities Meet 3D Base Building, and Survival.\nLeaders know that their crew's personalities are at least as important as their skills when entrusting them with key responsibilities. Every choice you make will be the difference between life and death in the void. Do you have what it takes?\n        Build the 3D space station of your dreams and handle a tide of paperwork as your crew members, driven by powerful personality-based AI, tend to their jobs as they see fit while developing friendships, rivalries, and romances along the way.\nSpace isn't a gentle place. Your crew works hard to keep the station running while maintaining a work-life balance or their bodies, relationships, and mental-health will suffer!\nCreate your species on a visual and statistical level, so they look and play the way you want. A species of super-intelligent anti-social clones? We've got you covered. Tough and genetically diverse dimwits? No problem! When we say \u201ccreate your own species\u201d we mean it.  \n  Build Space Stations in Full 3D!\n\nDo you think games with side or overhead 2D base building are in dire need of another dimension? So do we! Your Astrobase can be as large or small as you want, along any axis! \n\nHire and Promote Crewmembers That Fit Your Style:\n\nScrutinize the personnel files your Recruiting Officer dumps into your inbox and hire the characters with the job skills, stats, and personality traits that you need to run your Astrobase. \n\nCarefully balance the mix of personalities to create the working environment you desire. While it is natural to promote a handful of your key characters to lofty levels, it's also fine to leave others as trusted and highly skilled lower ranking specialists. Not everyone needs to become an Admiral, and Admirals are expensive.\nProcedural Personalities and Procedural Storytelling: \n\nYou can't control your crew; but you'll command them. Each member of the crew decides what needs to get done, and how, based on their individually generated personalities and personalized history. As characters interact in their daily routine, the drama of life unfolds.\nDeep Relationships and Character Life:\n\nCharacters have their own lives. Watch them live it!  \nWe have been self-funded since 2013 while developing Astrobase Command. This entails ongoing contracts working on other games to cover basic living costs, which are thankful to have! However, these contracts curtail the amount of time we have available to work on our own creation.\nAfter consulting our community, the response was very clear: use Kickstarter for finishing capital to provide the development focus and studio independence needed to cross the finish line in a timely manner.\nIn response, we turn to you, our fans. We are closing in on \u201cfeature complete\u201d for the 1.0 game version, but we need to add the polish to ensure a quality release. This is where the journey starts! \nBuild a 3D Astrobase from modular and gameplay-customizable sections, and then assign your personality-driven crew to jobs to keep the simulation running.\nFactors like resource logistics and power distribution are modeled in detail. From the custodians and maintenance personnel, to the top scientists and engineers, it is your organization to build!\nThe RPG system in Astrobase Command is skill-based, supplemented by stats, to determine crew performance and productivity, plus the procedural personalities which influence all gameplay. There is also morale, non-trivial health, and the things one would expect from an RPG simulation made by professionals. \n   In Astrobase Command you manage the crew at a high level. The characters have minds of their own, and you have no direct control over their decisions and actions. You give the assignments, while their personalities decide the best way to achieve whatever goals and needs they have.\nPerhaps personal conflicts will emerge, potentially hurting the characters' productivity, or worse. Or maybe two complimentary personalities forge deep bonds between the characters, improving their performance, and who knows? Space love?\nThere are no right or wrong, or optimizable personalities. Every character has his or her own strengths and weaknesses depending on a given situation. It's up to you to manage whatever society of individuals you deem necessary to keep the Astrobase functioning.\nYour crew have memories. Some events will have little importance and will eventually fade in their memories. Others will stick in their minds and shape the way characters evolve and how they interact with each other.  \n  What could be more fun than building your own space station? Well, filling out the reams of paperwork that come with running such a fine institution! \nAstrobase Command foregoes conventional UI in favour of fully immersing you in the universe.\nPlug different cartridges into the Datapad to access the various apps that let you to plan and direct your crew's activities, build your Astrobase, promote personnel, and manage your resources.\nYou'll also receive a steady stream of reports and recruitment files that you'll have to work your way through. Find the balance that suits your gameplay. Be a \"Big picture\" commander and don't sweat the details, or get into the weeds and enjoy every report. It's all up to you.  \n  You want to play a game that isn't trying to shoehorn you into a specific way of playing, and experience a unique adventure with every play through. We've built the simulation on a deep procedural foundation, with special focus on the characters individualized personalities and their interpersonal interactions. This in turn sits on a sandbox, where you can build the Astrobase in your mind.\nNo two stories will emerge the same.    \n  NEW: A WORD ABOUT PETS\n\nIf you get a pet as part of a reward tier (R0V-3R and M1TT-3NS) or as an add-on (Community Pet), you will receive a key for each of the copies of the game you have selected.\n\nYou can only have one such pet per copy of the game but you can gift them to other users.\nAdd-Ons allow you to select items from the list below to your backer tier to customize your swag load out. Just add the cost of the add-on below to your pledge!\nThe Community-Designed pet does not exist in any of the backer tiers. The only way to obtain it is with an add-on. \n       Oh, lordie. Somebody isn't being careful with their classified information.\n            Jellyfish Games is an independent Montreal-based game company made up of industry vets.

We enjoy deep, systems-driven games that reward the player for creativity and skill, as well as give them a good laugh and some epic watercooler stories to share with friends.\nWe also believe that the key to making Astrobase Command as good as it can be is to involve the community as much as possible.\n      FOLLOW JELLYFISH GAMES on Twitter @jellyfish_games and/or LIKE our Facebook Page (whatever floats your starship)!\nCredit cards aren't your thing?

This has been the case long before Kickstarter existed, and Kickstarter exposes backers to the situation by its nature. \n\nAfter 3.5 years of self-funded development on Astrobase Command, there exists a functional game that needs polish, balance, and testing/bugfix before it can be released to the 1.0 version which will serve as a stable foundation for a bright future of post-launch updates and content.\n\nWith any Kickstarter, the major risk to you, the backer, is that the campaign succeeds but the development of the game crashes and burns, leaving only broken hearts, lame excuses, and a cynical sense of being scammed. We\u2019ve been there as gamers ourselves! \n\nBeing a self-funded studio means we\u2019ve been using our own money, and paying for one\u2019s own mistakes is a great motivator to learn from them. The development pipelines are in place, the team has been working together for years, our monthly studio burn-rate is a known quantity, the v1.0 design is finished, and the game is nearly feature complete in code. We also have a great community whom we love and can\u2019t let down!\n\nEverything in the Kickstarter campaign exists in this reality, and not merely as a sketch and a bunch of cool sounding words.\n\nWhat\u2019s left is the very necessary, but fortunately much better known quantity of taking a game from feature complete to ready-for-release. Experience says it will cost the dollar value of this campaign goal, taking everything into account. Chances are as a backer you are also a savvy gamer! So you understand that bugs, glitches, or badly polished aspects can cripple an otherwise great game. You\u2019ve played these games and lamented \u201cIf only they spent 3 more months in beta, this would have been awesome\u2026\u201d\n\nWell, here we are!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 9 or more", "title": "\u2605 QUANTUM FLUX \u2605", "descp": "Quantum Flux powers the universe, and so do you.\nThank you for your support!

It is larger than Operation Deep Sleep, the first book in the series, which was a KICKSTARTER staff pick. In this campaign we are releasing the second gamebook, which you can either play as a standalone adventure or as a continuation of BOOK 1: Operation Deep Sleep. We hope this campaign can help us with the final 10% of the funding necessary to make this gamebook even better than originally conceived.\nThe Midnight Legion Box set was a STAFF PICK!\n  Midnight Legion Reviews \n\"Aaron has a system where memories are gradually given to you, allowing for the story and your background to unfold as you read. This is a great strength of the book, where every few sections gives you a new insight into the mystery around you.\" -Lloyd of Gamebooks\n\"...one of The Best Games for Solo Players from Gen Con 2016....\" -Nerdy But Flirty\n\"This game is ideal for anyone wanting a solo roleplaying experience or even for parents who want to introduce their kids to gaming (and maybe hook them on reading at the same time).\" -Josh, YTG Podcast Network, Your Turn Go!\n\"...this series uses a highly advanced game system, offering a deeper level of character generation than a standard CYOA gamebook \u2013 featuring combat, puzzles, diplomacy, stealth and role-playing elements. Book 1: Operation Deep Sleep is available in a very attractive box set,...\" -Gambook News\n\"Just wanted to say Thank-You! Its better then I even hoped for! And the illustrations are just amazing! I have backed projects before and this it the first time I feel that the end results is worth more then my pledge! Again, Thank-You.\"  -KICKSTARTER BACKER book 1 Jason S.\n\"This is definitely an experience I feel I was missing in my collection, and I'm really glad I have had a chance to play this . . . I REALLY recommend it!\" -UK Game Reviewer Slickerdrips\nGame System\nThe Midnight Legion is a highly advanced, color illustrated gamebook trilogy in the style of the classic Choose Your Own Adventure series, but with MUCH more control over your character and world\u2014think of an advanced version of SORCERY or LONE WOLF, with deeper character generation. An interactive story is combined with combat, strategy, puzzles, diplomacy, stealth and role playing elements. Collect information, knowledge, and goods from the world around you to advance your character. \n2-player Version\nIn this variation, one player reads the entries like a game master to another player who experiences the world of Midnight Legion. All the rolls for the encounters are handled by the reader and the player handles all of his or her character's dice rolls. This is also a good way for the game master player to introduce the game to someone who doesn't know all the rules.\nGame Play\nYou must choose whether to complete your objectives using combat, stealth or sixth sense and diplomacy. You can solve the puzzles that unlock the base\u2019s secrets using logic, or you can try to recover your lost memories for clues.\nChoices\nWhatever you decide, your actions change the world around you and determine the encounters you face next. Every game you play will be different \u2013 and you will need all of your skills to survive.\nBook 2: The World Reborn\nMore than four centuries have passed since the Devastation engulfed the Earth. The species that remained were fused and reborn in the alchemy of atomic fire. Now their diverse descendants have claimed the planet. You are an agent of the Midnight Legion, tasked with preserving life and rebuilding civilization. Only one other agent remains, and she is somewhere ahead of you, racing for your last remaining base. Unless you can reach it before she does, she will seize the command center and use its ancient weapons to unleash a second Devastation. This time, if she succeeds, nothing will survive. Your chase will lead you to new creatures, lost technologies and possibly even the clues your adversary leaves behind. But beware\u2014there are no established paths across this constantly shifting land, and nothing is what it seems.\nThe Story: Espionage and Intrigue\nYou are an android agent who had been activated after hundreds of years of stasis. Your scheduled mission is still centuries in the future, but your underground base has been invaded and you were needed to defend it.\nUnfortunately, it will take time for your memories to return. As you fought, tricked or sneaked up from the lower levels to the surface and your memories began filtering back, you realized that your mission is not what you thought it was\u2014and you are not be who you thought you were.\nChoose your strategy wisely, because every choice you make now will lead to different options later. The world has changed since you were put to sleep, and you will need to decide whether you are still willing to follow your ancient orders or whether you are ready to set a new future in motion.\nBook 3: The Portal of Life (Coming Soon)\nYour world is gone. The world that has replaced it is alien and savage, but filled with wondrous new life. In the last remaining Midnight Legion base a computer controls technology that can destroy it or help it to thrive. If you\u2019re strong enough you can defeat the agent who betrayed your mission. If you\u2019re clever and skilled enough you can solve the base\u2019s puzzles and outwit its traps. But even then you will still need to confront the sentient, possibly deranged computer itself. What it can tell you depends on how much you are willing to sacrifice to regain the memories you have lost.\nStretch Goals\n2k:Added color pages. Added artwork.

This is a campaign to help make Book 2 a better product and include those who didn't get a chance to order it.\n\nIn case of any unexpected delay with the printer, delivery, shipping or otherwise, we notify backers and do EVERYTHING possible to accelerate the process. We believe that communications with all our backers provides both the information and clarity necessary for project success.\n\nSince I am the co-designer and the artist, reliance on others is kept at a minimum\u2014making delays far less likely. Each game is edited and tested by my experienced and close-knit team of published writers, editors, and gamers to maintain strong game mechanics and a comprehensive set of rules. A high-quality game printing company creates and ships the finished product to us.\n\nOnce we receive the finished product, we use a high-quality international fulfillment house for delivery. They have over 30 years of experience and have been very professional with previous deliveries, with no complaints from us or our backers and game recipients. Sometimes errors occur with the shipment, and we work with you and the shipping company to correct those. This happens as a standard margin of error, but with experience in shipping we are confident our team can solve it.\n\nIn addition, this is not a new process to us.

Outside your childhood bedroom, the cypress trees stretch for miles.\nIn South Arkansas there's talk of a monster. They say he always follows the creeks.\nChoice-based interactive fiction. Go on then. Bother the cat.\n  Southern Monsters is set across five days in 2005. You play as cripplefoot, a traumatized teen too young to make sense of his emotions. To find the monster, you'll need to strike a balance between cryptid research and cripplefoot's well-being before the dry Arkansas sun sets.\nSouthern Monsters is deeply personal. It's a dark comedy based on my experiences with online communities, domestic abuse, and being disabled in the weird, weird South. It's also imbued with my love of horror movies like Videodrome, Suspiria, and Eraserhead.\nYour actions pass time. Cripplefoot wakes up at noon.

We're all reasonable people here, and that's what reasonable people think!\nsweet pic taken by Julian Dasgupta\nHi, I'm Jay Tholen. Folks know me best from a game I created in conjunction with A Jolly Corpse and Devolver Digital called Dropsy. As groanworthy as the term is, it was definitely a passion project. Felt great to see the positive reviews after four years of development.\nI grew up making games with easy-to-use game making software like Klik & Play, The Games Factory, and Multimedia Fusion. In fact, the prototypes you're seeing for this game were created in Fusion, though work has already started on porting it to Construct 2 so we can offer our Mac and Linux friends a lovely experience. I also tried to start a whimsical Genesis/Gong-esque prog rock band as a youngster, which didn't end in success, but it did end in me learning a lot about music and sound!\nI'm pretty excited to be working on a not-point-and-click for once, and can't wait to show you guys more of what we have planned. Follow me on twitter at @jaytholen.\nThis fine fellow is Mike Lasch. He's providing the smart-guy math power behind the Highway chunks of the game. We've worked together on various projects and he has done an amazing job so far on Hypnospace. Here's more about Mike in his own words:\n\nHi! I'm Mike Lasch, aka BipolarMike, aka [-BipolarDesign+]. I'm not really known outside of the Click community, but I've been making games for about 12 years, mostly using Clickteam software like Jay. Lately I've mostly been working on widgets and tools for other Click developers, and about a dozen small game projects for mobile (SHAMELESS PLUG - Infinite Minesweeper will be coming out soon!).\n\nI work full time doing paperwork in an office, so I'm excited to have the opportunity to go to part-time, drop my other projects, and buckle down on Hypnospace with Jay! This project will use all my skills to their full potential, and I can't wait to start.\n\nYou can follow Mike on twitter at @BipolarMike.\nOther credits include Chris Pavia, who is providing awe inspiring gifs like these: \n I've also been using Dave Sutton's classic gifs liberally as stand-in gifs until I'm able to replace them with originals. He runs Sevenoaks Art, and has for a long long time.\nBUDGET\nI'm partially financially covered by what I've made on Dropsy, so my share is just for some basic expenses while working on the game. But we need more people to make this game, and I can't afford to pay them without help! If I can pay Mike, this will allow him to switch to part-time at his current place of employment to work on Hypnospace more seriously. We do have plans for stretch goals, which will be announced later.  \nThis is the bare minimum the game needs to see completion.\n\nT-Shirt and Poster designs will be voted on by backers at a later time!\nI first heard Hot Dad through via his brilliant Taco Bell Christmas song, and then fell in love with his music after digesting his TV album. It's a collection of 105 alternate reality TV themes for popular shows. It was initially designed as a way to irk unsuspecting folk who thought they'd found their favorite show intro on YouTube, but the songs are actually fantastic and some of them show a surprising amount of emotion.  \nWhile I'll still be handling the bulk of the music for Hypnospace, Hot Dad will do what he's best at and contribute 15-20 second jingles for the various fictional brands in the game. These will be different than the sequenced MIDI-esque music, and will be synced with pre-rendered video ads that appear embedded on various sites or in pop-up ads. I plan on giving them a bit of a sound quality downgrade to emulate old fashioned low bitrate flash audio.\nDropsy Co-Designer/Project Manager/NPC Designer/Animator/Genius Jesse Bull\n This stretch goal will allow me to bring on two of my Dropsy co-conspirators to contribute a few virtual pets to Hypnospace! Check out their mockups below:\nAcacia's slimecat, or catslime, or something. Adorable.\nmore virtual pet mockups. the first two are Jesse Bull's creation, Snakey is mine, and Acacia's is the last\nWill Hypnospace Outlaw be released on Steam, GOG, Humble, etc?\n\nWe'll be out on as many channels as possible. All of the above, so long as we're approved by them for inclusion.\nWill Hypnospace Outlaw have a DRM Free version?\n\nYes, and on as many stores as possible including itch.io and Game Jolt. \n\nHow will BETA testing take place?\n\nWe'll likely handle testing via itch.io earlier on, and Steam closer to release.\nThose Animated GIFs aren't Original, I've seen them around!\nThe gifs I'm using on the pages currently are stand-ins from Sevenoaks art. He's been making animated gifs for a long long time, and allows folks to use them for any purpose, commercial or otherwise. That said, they are stand-in assets, and I'll be replacing them with original creations later in development!\nIs this game Vaporwave/whateverwavepunk?\n\nThat's really up to the person viewing it. I just dig old operating systems and the times when people saw the internet as less of a homogenized thing and more of a wild west scenario. If I had to use up one of those weird genre/movement/aesthetic labels, I'd go with Cyberfunk.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo.

The adventurers sneak into its cavern, each hoping to plunder the most valuable items. Creep around the dragon, collecting treasure sets; steal from other players at sword-point; remember the best caches; and when you feel you're ahead, try to rouse the dragon to end the round.\nHoard features a dynamic board, a custom die, a dragon who wakes in three stages from tail to head, and artwork by Weta Digital artists. Players assume one of six identities such as fearless young Esmeralda (below) or the battle-scarred and gout-ridden Captain Hogarth (further down), desperate to stash away enough of the hoard to earn himself a comfortable dotage.\n  You receive 5 cards as your starting hand. Select a character, peek at any one of the 12 face-down cards surrounding the sleeping dragon, then place your character on that card. The object?  Collect and secure sets of matching treasures; try to end the round when you are in the lead. \nThere are five kinds of treasure.\nIn addition to the treasure cards, there are three treasure chests, which are used as wild cards to round out a set; dragon action cards to stir or settle the dragon; and swords and shields for attack and protection from attack. There are four actions possible each turn.\nHoard's custom die: backers overwhelmingly approved this color scheme.\nMuch of the time, you will roll the custom die to travel around the board to get a new card. If you roll a number between 1-5, you can go clockwise or counter-clockwise that number of spaces. Roll the special symbol and you can stay in place or reach any other location bar one. If you can remember the location of cards you want, try to return to those places.\nJacqui and Nick played a number of rounds at the InkForge event, September 2015\nYou can take or reject the card you land on (it may not be a type of treasure you're trying to collect). If you take it, replenish the empty spot with a card from your hand or drawn from the deck. When you replenish from the deck, you get to peek at the replacement card. \nAll options are available with this hand 1) roll & move to get another card, 2) secure a set of goblets to score 3 points, 3) attack an opponent with the sword, or 4) use the Dragon Action card to stir or soothe the dragon (flip one of its cards)\nRemember to keep one beady eye on your opponents. If someone has one or two cards left in hand, you may be on borrowed time. Do you risk grabbing just one more emerald or should you secure the set of four you've already collected? Or maybe it's time to stir the dragon and add some more tension. Or use a sword to steal something useful from an opponent before it's too late.\nJulia enjoys a game of Hoard with the Shaw family at Board Games by the Bay Auckland, May 21, 2016\nThe round ends immediately if the dragon fully wakes, if the last card is drawn from the deck, or if a player starts their turn with no cards in hand. Treasures left in players' hands when the round ends count as negative points.\n  Hoard has been play-tested hundreds of times.\n  Hoard will come in a sturdy magnetic-closure box with black cardboard tray and gold foil accents plus:\n*Interactives are the sword, shield, crown, sceptre, cloak, and Dragon Action cards. Cards to measure 63 x 88 mm\nWe hope Hoard is on its way to becoming an enduring family favorite and that we may reprint down the line. However, it's unlikely we'd be able to afford some of the stretch goal special features if/when we reprint. So the Kickstarter print run is likely to be as deluxe as it ever gets!\nReview by Jonathan Nelson, Gaming Bits (quoted above)\nThis item in Casual Game Revolution and this Wizened Words blog by Jon Solmundson are about Cheeky Parrot, Hoard, and our creative process.\nA review by the Cardboard Vault\nVideo Review by Tantrum House\nVideo Review by Michael May of Toucan Play That Game  \nGameplay video by Board Gaming At Home: a British family play a round of Hoard and share what they think\nPreview video by GDT Live (in Italian)\nOne-minute Hollywood style promo movie:\nYou can view and download the rules from the BoardGameGeek website. You will also find them there in French and Italian.\nHoard's four other characters\n  These are the ones we achieved:\nSurprise Stretch! If by June 30th (the day before we intend to submit Hoard's files to the manufacturer) we have a combined follower count of 750 on the Cheeky Parrot Games Facebook page, the Cheeky Twitter account, and the Tim Kings-Lynne Artwork Facebook page, your copy of Hoard will contain a special surprise.\n  We hope you may be pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the price is for a game in your currency. Here are the pledge levels for one or two copies converted to different currencies, exclusive and inclusive of shipping, as of June 16:\nExchange rates have been very stable the last few weeks.\n* Our $16,000 NZD target equates to $11,360 US or 10,080 Euros\nNote: if you are in Singapore, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Austria, Bulgaria or Slovakia, you can pay the same shipping price as Japan. \nCheeky Parrot Games in Auckland will receive a shipment to be used to fulfil Kiwi and Australian pledges and orders from our Kiwi retailers. We plan to use Send from China to fulfil pledges outside Australasia. The replacement value of one copy of Hoard should be too low to trigger European VAT taxes. (Send from China can forward games to a depot in Europe for fulfillments from there, however fulfilling this way is significantly more expensive for us, so please contact us if you think your country is problematic.)\nShipping costs for one copy have been differentially priced to help us get an advance indication of where our pledgers are located. That way we can start planning for distribution even before the campaign closes.\nCheeky Parrot Games is ready to fly. We have three titles selling reliably at over 60 outlets throughout New Zealand. We have demonstrated good instincts about what makes a game appealing. For example, Julia discovered Granny Wars when it was a theme-less abstract number game and worked with designer Brad Thompson to turn it into a product that has sold 1000 copies in its first two years on the Kiwi market. We've also learned some hard lessons about manufacture, component design, and retail realities. We think Hoard is our best game yet and Kickstarting it gives it a chance to succeed on the global stage.\nCurrent range of Cheeky Parrot Games\nMeeting our target means we will be able to order a print run of at least 2000 copies, taking advantage of some economy of scale. After all backers receive their games, we expect to make additional copies available through retailers. In addition to New Zealand, we expect to be able to have games warehoused in the United States. For Julia, this will be a poignant achievement, as she is an American who has lived in New Zealand since 2000, and she'd love to have one of her games more readily available on the North American market.\nThe people behind the project: Beck and Tim pose with a few copies of the original edition of Hoard, which they self-published. Julia makes some prototype cards for the Cheeky reboot.\nCheeky Parrot has always had high standards for our products. The base game we can offer if we reach our target will have several deluxe features such as a sturdy one-piece magnetic closure box, a custom die, and unique character pawns. Reaching our stretch goals will mean we can offer upgrades to some components, extra material to allow 5 and 6 people to play, and more. All copies of the game will include any stretches we reach. As Kiwis love to say, that is 'fair enough'.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are confident of completing this project on time and within budget.\n\nProject coordinator Julia Schiller has been involved in the design, publication, and distribution of six new games in her role as co-director of SchilMil Games (2011-2014) and as director of Cheeky Parrot Games (2014-present). Three of these were the subjects of successful crowd-funding campaigns. Cheeky Parrot currently has three titles in circulation. Hoard will be the only new project we publish in 2016.\n\nHoard was originally designed by Weta Digital artists Tim Kings-Lynne and his partner, Beck Veitch. They self-published a small print run that sold out fast--the gorgeous box cover art no doubt had much to do with that--but not before the last copy magically found its way into Julia's hands. She immediately began tweaking the gameplay, while preserving Hoard's unique qualities, such as the dynamic board made from face-down cards and the possibility of the dragon fully waking to abruptly end the game.\n\nJulia, Tim, and Beck began collaborating in September 2015 to prepare Hoard for a larger print run and wider distribution under the Cheeky Parrot label. All has gone smoothly to date, with Tim and Beck, based in Wellington, responsible for all graphical elements and Julia in Auckland putting the game through rigorous play-testing, at events like Board Games by the Bay as well as regular gaming groups, designer meet-ups, and dedicated sessions. To date, the new and improved Hoard has been played hundreds of times.\n\nWe will initiate the production order by July 1st at the latest, so games should arrive at the pre-arranged distribution points by October for fulfilment before Christmas. Artwork and component layouts are nearly complete, and we've already had the tooling for the custom die done. \n\nWhatz Shanghai will be our manufacturer, and Julia has worked with them on four other occasions. Each time, their work has been impeccable and the product ready on schedule. If you've played King of Tokyo, you're familiar with the high production value of Whatz products. \n\nMost of the shipping will be arranged by Blondi, an Auckland company that has worked with Cheeky Parrot Games since the latter's inception. \n\nWe will regularly communicate our progress and any unforeseen obstacles we encounter. Because the exchange rate is unpredictable, we have done our calculations using an unfavourable figure and included an overall safety margin of 10%.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "A Worldly Offer for Hoard Backers", "update_content": "Hello Hoarders,\nI wanted to update you on how Hoard and Cheeky Parrot are doing.

But as I started the process of building a demo version of that for myself, I realized I had a chance to create a new game with all of the things I love about abstract strategy games, but with new challenges. Through various iterations over 5 years, that original idea became what you see today! Below is just a sampling of the various versions that this game has gone through!\nAs the game was adapted to become ILIOS, we discovered that there is famous ancient art depicting heroes from the Iliad actually playing a board game. Here in this video from Khan Academy, you can learn about how this pottery was designed, and the story that inspired it:\nDifferent scholars list the game played as being pure abstract, or a game including dice. ILIOS plays upon this idea, but instead of dice, the random tiles include a form of luck that changes the game each time. That randomness represents The Fates, who sometimes would set the future in stone, but other times would be capricious and unpredictable.\nILIOS wouldn't be possible without the help of hundreds of playtesters, over a thousand players, friends, fellow game designers, the great people at Playford Games and their previous Kickstarter experience, but especially, YOU!\nYour pledge will bring the dream of ILIOS to reality, and only with your efforts to share this Kickstarter with your friends who love games will ILIOS achieve the goal of a published game!\nAs a designer, I want to personally express my gratitude for all of the help I've received over the last 5 years of development of ILIOS.\n\nPlease don't forget to share on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and wherever you share your love of board games.

Why not become toxic to eat and poison whoever tries to take a bite? Try to spread your species across all islands and prove how adaptable you are.

Wandering, running and migrating through different habitats, each with it's own challenges and inhabitants is what brings our worlds to life.\n  When playing Niche, your main objective is to inhabit all island of the world. If all your animals die, the species is extinct which means the game is over.\nIn order to be prepared for the next island's dangers, it's important to build up a big enough tribe. Mating is based on real genetics, featuring dominant, recessive and co-dominant heredity. \nYour babies grow up fast! Animals grow old and will die of old age. So make sure to produce offspring and keep an eye on your gene pool.\nHaving a bigger territory is beneficial in many ways. More food sources, faster movement on the map, approaching carnivores can be detected earlier, etc. So go explore. Some islands are huge!\nBeware of the islands dangers. You may encounter a carnivore! What will you do? Hide? Run away? Fight? Or some other crazy thing you came up with?\nIt would be way to comfortable if carnivores were your only problem!

What little money you do earn is invested right back into paint and canvases. Without that paint and those canvases, you won't be able to follow your dream of becoming a famous artist. Being a starving artist is a constant struggle.\nStarving Artists is an award-winning, blind-drafting and resource management game for one to four players.  Using some of the world's most beautiful works of art, players complete these masterpieces using transparent cubes in an attempt to become famous artists. It takes about 40-60 minutes (approximately 20 minutes per player).\nStarving Artists is played over a series of turns. Each turn represents a new day. On each day, you must choose between: buying new canvases, painting the canvases you already own, or working in order to get more paint. If at the end of the day, you've completed a masterpiece, you can sell it to earn more paint and food. If you don't spend your days efficiently, you won't be able to feed yourself, and you'll have to give up on your dreams. \nYou can read the current version of the rules or scroll to the end to see a short how to play at the bottom of this page.\nAs an aspiring paint-by-cube artist, your life centers around the paintings you must complete.\nIn order to complete those paintings, you take two actions each day. You can buy new canvases from the market, paint canvases in your studio using your paint cubes, or work to collect new paint cubes.\nAt the end of each day, you can sell your completed paintings. But, you'll be competing in the limited marketplace for paintings with anyone else who wants to sell. If there's not enough paint to go around, you'll have to make do with less.\nThe following how to play video is from the survival contest version of the game. There are some changes to the gameplay, but much of the gameplay is the same.\nEach copy of Starving Artists comes with everything that an aspiring artist needs: paints, studios, canvases and food. They also come with things that you probably wouldn't think about: telescoping box, rule book, paint bag, and a wooden carrot (to mark the first player).\n52 Jumbo Cards with great works of art and 145 acrylic cubes.\nFour player references, nutrition markers, first player token and paint bag.\nJumbo-sized canvases (3.5\"x5.5\") that feature the works of art.\nTelescoping box, acrylic cubes and paint bag\nCanvases being painted\nTransparent, Acrylic Paint Cubes\n Plus, the game now includes all these great stretch goal art packs:\nYou can read the current version of the rules.\nYou can also try the Print & Play version of the game.

With the ability to create worlds filled with all of your lore and characters and share them with players on a secondary screen's \"Player's View;\" map making, story organization, and world exploration are more convenient and organic than ever before.\nCreate your campaigns, modules, and one-off's on your smart device and explore them organically with players using Fog of War to conceal unreached areas. Edit maps and draw notes in real time, visible to the players or exclusive to the GM/DM.\nAlong with better map making and viewing is easier organization of your lore, NPCs, and quests. Place markers directly on the map that link to your lore documents and pull them up on the fly to view them while playing.\nA complete, in-depth walkthrough on how the app will function can be found on our website at http://www.infinitasdm.com\nWhy?\nHaving both played pen and paper RPGs and run my own campaigns for many years, there are two aspects I always wished could be easier. Managing worlds, npcs, quests, and lore and being able to use big complex maps without going broke at the copy store or putting my players to sleep drawing out each one room by room while we play. \nThere are a lot of really good digital campaign tools out there, but none of them ever really hit the mark for what I wanted to do with them. I wanted a tool that let me have all of the power and convenience of a digital solution without being forced to play online or from a bunch of individual laptops.\nI also didn't want something that takes over every aspect of the game. I like rolling my dice, I like keeping character sheets on sheets of paper, I like playing with everyone in the same room. That is what drove me to create Infinitas DM. \nHow It Will Work\nThere are two core aspects to Infinitas DM's operation. Creating and Playing your campaigns. That said, both of these functions are served from the same interface, available at the same time.\nCreating A Campaign\nWorld building starts in the Atlas. The Atlas has a 3 tier hierarchy used for organizing maps. The tiers are named Worlds, Continents, and Locations, but the name's purpose are simply to symbolize the overall organizational structure they represent. Worlds could easily be Planes, Planets, or even Factions. Continents could just as easily be regions as individual starships. The possibilities are limitless.\nOnce you have your locations created, you can assign maps to them. Maps can be both loaded and assigned from this menu. \nAdding Maps\nMaps can be added or created in one of three ways. They are either captured with the device's camera, imported from an image file, or created within Infinitas DM. \n Populating Your Maps\nOnce you have your maps assigned you can get to adding document files to them, easily accessed by either browsing for them in the Documents Tree or by accessing them directly from the map with Map Links.\n Map links are great ways to quickly access your encounter notes, NPC dialog, Store lists, Quest information, highlighting Points of Interest, or even linking to other Maps.\nDocuments Tab\nThe Documents you link or browse to are created and viewed in the Documents Tab, an easily accessed panel that slides out to occupy the right third of the screen and can also be maximized to occupy the entire screen.\n Creating and Playing Maps\nThe tools that allow you to draw and populate your own maps are the same tools that you will use in-game to play and edit them on the fly.\n New maps, notes, sketches, and more can be added with the Pencil and Line tools, and removed with the eraser.\nTo keep notes, temporary drawings for spell effects, and the map background separate and easy to edit, Infinitas DM has a 4 layer system. The background (either a map you have loaded or one of the four backgrounds chosen at map creation) layer is not select-able or editable. \nAbove that is Layer 1, which is intended to be used for drawing any additional map background imagery. Layer 2, which is ideal for adding notes, sketches, and temporary effects. The last layer is the DM Layer - a layer that is only visible on the GM or DM's device and is not displayed on the Player View. This is great for notes, traps, and other details that the players are not meant to see.\nAll three of those layers can easily be selected, hidden, or disabled at any time.\nFog of War\nFog of War is easily added and removed with the drawing tools and much like them can be added in various colors to simulate spells and effects that would limit visibility for your players.\nFor the GM or DM, Fog of War is semi-transparent, while for the Player View it is opaque.\nThe DM Drawer\nThe final piece of Infinitas DM's interface is the DM Drawer. This is a set of tools that is pulled out from the left side of the screen containing access to the Atlas, Tokens, Stamps, an assortment of additional funcionality for the Pencil tool, as well as Save and Exit functions.\nBudget and Goal\nWhile a great deal of work has already been completed for Infinitas DM, it is mainly centered around the design, artwork, and interface. Aside from rewards, shipping, and Kickstarter/Merchant fees, the entirety of the remaining funds will go to paying for the programming to put all of this work together.\nIn order to keep the goal as low as possible, I am absorbing all of the art and design costs myself, including all non manufacturing and shipping costs for backer rewards.\nBudget Breakdown\nThe good news is we already have an extremely talented programmer on board for the project.

With the help of a hacker named Jin and the aid of a ragtag group of survivors he recruits along the way, Rook must explore the planet and locate the cell blocks which have detached from the prison's central tower and scattered across Earth's ghostly wasteland.\nDuring his mission, Rook will run into allies and adversaries in the form of dangerous gangs of fellow prisoners, the survivors of the Earth's mysterious apocalypse, and bizarre parasitic extradimensional beasts that haunt the dead planet. Core gameplay fuses platforming, pseudo-turn based combat, puzzle solving, and interactive dialogue/decision making into a story driven, atmospheric experience. Tying it all together is a unique visual aesthetic that merges lo-res pixel art characters with a lovingly hand-painted world.\nUpdate 3: Design Philosophy and Inspirations Pt. 1\nUpdate 4: Design Philosophy and Inspirations Pt. 2\nUpdate 6: Earth, 2171 AD\nUpdate 7: Battle System Breakdown\nUpdate 8: Add-Ons + New Character Reveals\nUpdate 9: Inventory System\nUpdate 10: New Add-Ons + Early Music + Skill Sneak-peek\nWe're very excited to be able to share a draft of a title theme for Wanderer done by our awesome composer Jonathan Geer:\nPLATFORMING\nWanderer is a cinematic platformer at it\u2019s core, a modernized take on classics like Another World, Flashback, and Heart of Darkness. Rook can walk, run, jump, crouch, and climb through the world. Additional movement abilities will be unlocked by the player as they advance, opening up the ways they can move around the environment. Light action elements include environmental hazards that Rook has to safely navigate and a ranged/melee attack used to stun/attack enemies that roam the world. Up to two computer-controlled companions at a time can be assigned to follow behind Rook as the player explores the world.\nThe game world consists of a simplified overworld map filled with locations to travel to and explore. It's centered around a hub where players can return to upgrade abilities and equipment and find companions stationed when not in the party.\nCOMBAT\nWhen Rook makes contact with an enemy on the 'field', the game switches to JRPG style pseudo turn-based combat (allowing the player to control all three current party members). Striking the enemy before they can strike you will give you a free first attack, and the same applies in reverse for the enemy, so you'll need to take note of how each enemy behaves and moves on the field to be successful.\nThe combat system is intended to be challenging and fluid, and is largely based on player skill and strategy rather than stats or random chance. Timing, reflex, and pattern recognition are emphasized, and the player will need to manually time and input offensive/defensive maneuvers to maximize their advantage in battle. Wanderer's battle system design is influenced by RPGs including Paper Mario, Valkyrie Profile, and Rogue Galaxy.\nPUZZLE SOLVING\nAs Rook explores and moves through the world he'll find points of interest represented by nodes that can be interacted with in familiar \"point and click\" adventure game fashion (look at, talk about/to, use item with, pick-up etc.). These interactions take place via a context sensitive radial menu that show the player which actions are available. Puzzles will require the player to examine and interact with characters, the environment, and obtainable inventory items to overcome obstacles and advance the story.\nBRANCHING DIALOGUE/CHOICES\nAlong Rook's mission, the player will have the opportunity to interact with a colorful and varied cast of characters via branching dialogue choices. The way the player chooses to respond to other characters will affect how they view him, and key points in the story will present the player with multiple ways to handle a scenario, each potentially leading to lasting consequences. Inspired by modern interactive narratives like Heavy Rain and Telltale's Walking Dead series, decisions and conversations will play out in real time, actively engaging the player in the scenario and sometimes requiring them to make choices on the fly.\nIn the fairly distant future, humans have escaped beyond the confines of their native planet after a mysterious, cataclysmic event has left it crawling with bizarre otherworldly creatures and turned it a place where time and space have come ever so slightly unraveled. With colonies on Venus, Mars, the moons of Jupiter, and dozens of massive space stations throughout the solar system, for much of humanity the Earth has become nothing more than a massive graveyard and a nostalgic memory.\nThe main character of the game's story, known simply as Rook, is an aged convict held in a state of stasis aboard an Alcatrez-esque orbital prison station designated the VC Harlegand. The Harlegand is stationed in the now isolated corner of the galaxy around Earth, making escape a nearly impossible prospect.\nAfter the prison crash lands on the Earth's surface for unknown reasons, Rook is awoken from his prisoner stasis pod by a hacker and fellow prisoner named Jin who's jacked into his neural implants remotely. Unfortunately, as a death row prisoner who was never intended to be fully resuscitated, upon waking Rook finds himself suffering from fragmented memory, recurring hallucinations, and painful migraines. The prison's medbay can ease his symptoms, but Jin need's Rook's help to reactivate it.\nProposing a plan to escape the planet, she suggests the two work together towards a common goal of survival. The duo embark on a journey to gather what she needs for them to escape, which entails traveling to each of the cell blocks that detached and scattered across the Earth's surface when the prison crash landed. Along the way they'll befriend fellow survivors, clash with gangs of dangerous criminals and monstrous creatures, and unravel the mysteries of the Earth's nebulous fate.\nSupplementary story elements unfold through optional text logs and entries to the player's codex gained by exploring and interacting with the world and speaking with characters. These offer additional detail and flavor to the game's setting for player's who are interested in it's backstory and lore.\nOn a secondary narrative level, a strong emphasis is placed on a diverse and engaging cast of misfits and survivors that Rook will encounter and work together with on his mission. Each ally has a unique backstory and viewpoint that the player will learn as they spend time together. As companions follow the player through the world, they'll often comment on the current scenario or begin a conversation amongst themselves that you can engage in while exploring (and even during combat!).\nHaving certain party members with you will also contextually open up new options and unique ways to deal with scenarios you encounter on your journey. These contextual bonus interactions not only serve to make party members feel autonomous and organic, but offer the player a meaningfully unique experience based on the companions they choose to bring with them..\nJust a few of the story's main characters include:\nThe player will also encounter a wide range of NPC factions that may help or hinder Rook depending on the choices that are made, each with a distinctive visual style, richly detailed background, and unique set of motives and objectives:\nThe player will also encounter bizarre alien parasitic entities nicknamed 'Phantoms', taking the form of a wide range of hostile creatures and beasts to fight, each with it's own capabilities, behaviors, strengths and weaknesses:\nWanderer is being designed as an episodic series. Episodes will be developed and released in sequential fashion, with each being released as soon as it's finished. Each new episode will add new content in the form of newly discovered areas on the world map (as well as hidden ones that must be discovered by other means), adding new objectives to push the main story forward as well as lots of side content to be completed at your own pace.\nEach area on the world map serves as a 'level', full of encounters, puzzles, obstacles, fights, and items. Some levels are much larger than others, and some contain purely optional content seperate from the primary story. You are free to come and go between areas as you please, and you'll sometimes need an item from one area to solve a puzzle on another. Past areas can be revisited in subsequent episodes, and sometimes new content will be added to old areas, so you'll have to keep an eye out and explore to get the most out of the world!\nFor the Kickstarter, we'll be funding the entire series as a whole, and a $15 or more pledge gains you access to all episodes. We're planning to develop 5 total episodes, but if we hit certain stretch goals, we plan to expand the scope of the game with additional episodes. The reason we're taking the episodic approach to development is to allow us to make an RPG with a greater sense of scope than we would otherwise be able.\nLike our favorite RPGs, Wanderer is a long, winding story full of twists and turns, evolving and growing character relationships, and lots of player character progression. To do it justice in a single development period and in a reasonable amount of time isn't a realistic goal for a two-man development team. That's why we're breaking it up into pieces, to make the project manageable and get the game into your hands much sooner. Another benefit is being able to engage with your feedback between episodes, and make sure each one is full of the best possible content!\nOur objective is to be able to release the first episode by September 2016, and then release subsequent episodes every 3~4 months.\nOur core team is composed of 2 individuals, an artist/designer and a developer/coder. The project found it's humble beginnings on the TIGSource forums, where Cris posted his initial pitch for Wanderer while searching for a developer to collaborate with. As fate would have it, Serge was looking for a new project to work on, and quite literally within five minutes after the creation of it's devlog, the two teamed up and Wanderer's development was underway.\nAfter months of searching for for a musician and composer that fits our vision of the game, we've recently teamed up with veteran Jonathan Geer, and we're very excited to have him on-board to bring Wanderer's soundtrack to life.\nJonathan's impressive versatility is a perfect match for Wanderer's concept, and will allow for the soundtrack to have an array of styles that complement the narratives blend of moods and tones. Though we hope to share a first look at the game's music with at some point during the campaign, in the meantime you can have a listen to an assortment of Jonathan's previous work:\nWanderer is a passion project that took over a year to completely conceptualize. It's a storytelling experience that strives to merge retro and modern design elements into something that feels new and fresh, but at the same time recalls nostalgia from our happiest gaming memories. It's a vision we're desperately invested in seeing come to life, but the only way it can become a reality is via the support of a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nDevelopment started 6 months ago, and our two-man team has made excellent progress towards a playable vertical slice of the game, with a prototype that already supports:\n\nThe game's platforming including full AI companion and enemy pathfinding.\nPuzzle solving/adventure game mechanics.\nAn initial implementation for combat mechanics.\nBranching and contextual dialogues.\nA custom and complete in-game scene editor with an advanced script system.\nAll the basic components like the save system, medias integration and management pipelines and an advanced and flexible rendering pipeline with light and post-processing effects.\nCurrently, our programmer is working a full-time job and our artist is living on savings in order to dedicate his time to the project. This is not a situation we can maintain long term. To continue working on Wanderer we need some additional support to allow us to dedicate our full time and attention to the project.\nFor physical rewards, we're very excited to have the opportunity to team up with wonderful IndieBox to bring you high quality items!\n\nWanderer is a passion project, the game we always wanted to play but no one ever tried to make. With your help, we can make it a reality! Thank you for time and support! Together, we know we can make a one of a kind gaming experience, and we want nothing more than to share it with you. :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWanderer is treading new ground in terms of core design structure, which is where we believe much of the appeal lies, but which also means there\u2019s an inherent amount of risk involved in execution. A lack of a tried and true formula means we\u2019re going into this endeavor largely without the benefit of footsteps to follow in regards to the flow of gameplay and the synergy of various hybrid mechanics. \n\nThis risk is why the game\u2019s core mechanics are designed with simplicity and elegance in mind. Adding too much complexity to too many potentially disparate mechanics could quickly muddy the design and make it very difficult to analyze what\u2019s working well and what\u2019s not. Keeping things simple and clean means we can make adjustments on the fly and adapt the direction and emphasis of core gameplay without losing lots of design work and development time.\n\nThe game is very ambitious in terms of scale and scope, especially given that development is handled by only the two of us. That\u2019s why early on we made the decision to divide it into episodes, to allow us to divide what would otherwise be an insurmountable amount of content into much smaller and more manageable milestones. \n\nFurther, the episodic structure additionally benefits us by allowing us to receive valuable player feedback between the release of episodes. This will help us steer the direction of content over the course of the games overall development cycle and gives us ample time to make adjustments as necessary.\n\nFinally, even though this is the first project our team is working on together, we've already made considerable progress on the development, and over the previous six months we've setup a very efficient and adapted workflow. Our pipeline is already established and proven, and we'll do everything in our power to stick to our projected deadlines and deliver the experience we've promised in our presentation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "July-August-September-October Progress Update", "update_content": "July-August-September-October Progress Update\nHey everyone.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content). All non-promo stretch goals are in every version of the game.\nFind all Scythe media on our website and join discussions about the game on BGG.\n\"Scythe is a game that\u2019s about contrasts.

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria. He's also the co-founder and president of Stonemaier Games, and he's written a book about crowdfunding.\nJakub Rozalski is the artist, worldbuilder, and creative director of Scythe. Art prints of his work are available for purchase from him here.\nMorten Monrad Pedersen is Stonemaier's development specialist. He designed the Automa solo variant for Scythe as detailed on his BGG blog.\nCarsten Biernat & Jozsef Szollosi of Unique Voodoo Studio are the 3D modelers for Scythe's miniatures. \nChristine Santana is the lead graphic designer for Stonemaier Games.\nChris Matthew is the Panda Game Manufacturing project manager for Scythe.\nScott Wadyko is the the sculptor of the realistic resource tokens found in the collector's edition and in our new treasure chests.\nVideo: The project video was created by Josh McDowell,  narrated by A.T. Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

Please keep spreading the word!\nYou are a dog, lost in a sprawling and unfamiliar city. You wander the streets, searching for scraps, for shelter, for a friendly face. Slowly, you overcome some of your fears. You learn where you can snag a meaty bone, where you can sleep warm and safe at night. Strange streets become familiar territory. One by one, the streets become yours. You find friends. Eventually, maybe, home.\nProjected Release: Fall 2016 on Mac, Windows and PS4\nHome Free is an open-world action-RPG starring a dog lost in a sprawling, randomly generated city. Use your canine abilities to explore this strange, sometimes hostile environment and find your place in the world.\nI've been working on Home Free for about two years now, and I'm very excited to show you where I've taken it so far. This project is the culmination of a lot of work and a bunch of crazy interests: procedural content, urbanism, quadrupedal locomotion, and dogs -- how they play, the stories we tell about them, and what makes them tick.\nFeatures\nBe a dog in an unexplored city!\nPlay as any of over a dozen breeds (plus many more color and marking variations). Maybe even more, depending on stretch goals and rewards!\nExplore a dense, procedurally-generated city unique to your game. Every street, alleyway, building, nook and cranny was generated just for your game. No one has been here before, so you better start marking your territory.\nPlayer-driven narrative. Shape the story of one dog's survival through your choices and actions. Experience the the world from the perspective a creature who will never quite understand why that world acts the way it does.\nWrestle, wriggle, and pounce. Home Free features a full range of canine moves to master, whether you're playing with friendly dogs in a local park or escaping the aggressions of territorial dogs in a dark alley.\nLearn the unique rhythms of your city. Which neighborhood has the tastiest garbage just after sunset? What park empties at mid-day so you and your dog friends can have a fun romp when no one's around?\nDecide how to survive. Will you be a bandit, stealing food from unsuspecting humans when you can? A performer, trying to earn treats and sympathy from dog-friendly citizens? Or a scavenger, sticking to the margins and following your nose?\nDog it up with your friends in real life! Home Free comes bundled with my local multiplayer dog wrasslin' game, Dog Park, included at all backer levels!\nA dog is always hungry. To survive in the big city, you'll need to decide how best to satisfy your doggy hunger.\nA World Made For Humans...\nThe city is noisy, crowded and surprising, built for two-legged creatures whose ways are hard to understand. Some seem friendly. Can you get them to share their food? Others run screaming when they see you. Maybe they want you to chase them? Some attack on sight, with hands and sticks and boots. What\u2019s your best escape route? Noisy metal boxes fly by in unpredictable patterns. Are you fast enough to dodge them? It\u2019s their city, but you can still master its streets.\nA time lapse of the city generator at work. Every game gets its own unique city. No strategy guides or FAQs will help you here. You are truly lost.\n...A World Full of Dogs\nYou're far from the only one of your kind in this place. Other dogs prowl the streets. Some protect their territory and won't let you pass without a fight. Some are wary and keep their distance. Some could be friends. A sniff, a chase, and a romp through a park is all it takes to seal a friendship. And who knows, maybe one friendship can lead to another\u2026\nAll trailer footage was captured in-game from a pre-alpha build of Home Free.\nHome Free is a beautiful, heartbreaking single player experience, but it also comes bundled with a raucous multiplayer mode: DOG PARK!\nDog Park is a 4-player, local multiplayer dog wrasslin' game, and it comes with Home Free! Become a dog as you chase, wrestle, cavort and gambol with other players in a chaotic struggle to have as much fun as you can.  \nThe new, improved version of Dog Park included with Home Free will feature a bunch of new game modes, improved controls and physics, as well as all the new dog breeds added to Home Free.\nDog Park installed at No Quarter 2014 in New York.\nI created Dog Park for the NYU Game Center's yearly No Quarter show, and debuted it there in September 2014. Dog Park is a game about my fascination with the dynamics of dog play.\nDogs are possibly the world's best game players: they have a huge appetite for play, they manage to negotiate new games with each other without using language, and they seem to play games for the sheer joy of it, not really caring who wins or who loses. Dog Park is my attempt to recreate some of that experience for four humans at a time, in videogame form.\nThe version of Dog Park shown at No Quarter (and at the IndieCade 2014 E-Sports Showcase) was an experimental game about canine play. The \"winner\" of the game is the dog who had the most fun, and fun comes in many forms: chasing and being chased, wrestling with other dogs, playing king of the hill on a picnic table.\nThe final version of Dog Park, included as part of Home Free, will feature several new game modes that offer new goals and new reasons to unleash your furry fury with three other friends.\nHome Free features a brand new, original soundtrack composed by Mark Robinson!\nMark founded the Teen-Beat record label and has been a member of the bands Unrest, Air Miami, Flin Flon, Cotton Candy, and Fang Wizard. \nMark's music is what this game has sounded like in my head since I first started prototyping it over two years ago. If it ever turned into a real game, I knew I'd have to ask him to work on the soundtrack. I had no plan B. It's an amazing feeling to have one of my favorite artists making music for my game, and I'm very, very excited about it.\nThe music in the trailer is a track Mark made just for this Kickstarter campaign. He's already shared some early sketches for songs that will become part of the final soundtrack, and there's so much good stuff in there.\nDo dogs even like music? I don't know. But I know I already can't imagine Home Free without it.\nThe Game\nA DRM-Free digital copy of Home Free (including Dog Park), on Mac or PC.\nDigital Wallpapers\nA collection of high-res wallpapers featuring cute digital dogs for your computer or phone. (Image for illustration purposes only -- there will be more, and different!)\nStickers\nA set of 5 full-color, die-cut vinyl stickers of sweet low-poly dogs. Stick 'em on your laptop or wherever else people stick sticky things.(Image for illustration purposes only)\nT-Shirt\nChoose one of two designs (or pick the $95 tier for both) of cool polygonal dogs doing cool polygonal dog things!\nBe In the Game\nSend me a photo and I'll use magic to digitize you into an abstract, low-poly human NPC who will play an important role in the city. Includes a few high res screenshots of your digital doppelganger in various poses so you can show off to your friends.\nYour Dog In The Game\nI create a fully customized, stylized low-poly playable version of your dog in the game! Just send me some photos, a couple measurements, and a quick description, and I'll interpret your dog as a cartoony, low-poly playable character. Comes with a collection of high res images of your dog in action and in funny poses.\nPlease note the some dogs are more compatible with Home Free's art style than others. If you're wondering whether your dog would be a good choice, message me!\nThe Full Digital Best Friend Experience\nI create a custom, playable version of your dog and a custom, NPC version of you. I also create an ultra-exclusive, fully customized ambient minigame experience featuring digital you and your digital companion spending some quality time relaxing alone in the park together.\nI've been working on this project for approximately two years. Dog Park debuted in September, 2014 at No Quarter in New York City, and was shown again at IndieCade 2014 in the E-Sports Showcase.\nAbout a year before work began on Dog Park, I started experimenting with building a procedural city engine. Walking around in this dense, twisty, mysterious place felt great almost immediately, and I kept experimenting even though I didn't really know what I was going to do with it.\nHome Free is the combination of these two projects: Dog Park provides the dogs, and the city project provides the world you'll explore.\nAt this point, all of that is working well; the trailer was made entirely from in-game footage captured from a pre-alpha build. I've spent my time so far building out the skeleton for Home Free -- an engine that creates vibrant procedurally-generated open world city environments and a system for dog movement, interaction, and control.\nThe fundamentals are now in place, and with your help, I'll spend the next year building out more content, deepening single player gameplay, and tuning controls.\nWhat's Next?\nGameplay programming. Flesh out and add content to the game's core systems of exploration, hunger management, and character development.\nScenario design. Create semi-scripted situations for the player character to encounter in the world: patrolling aggressive dogs, friendly humans with specific requirements, unfriendly humans, NPC-to-NPC interactions that create opportunities for food and advancement.\nCity content and generator refinement. Create a bunch more city assets to avoid randomly-generated \"sameness\" problem. Define larger number of \"neighborhood\" types (currently there are only two) to create more variation and local flavor (similar to \"biomes\" in Minecraft).\nDog modeling and animation. Create at least 5 additional dog body types (maybe more depending on stretch goals and rewards!). Continue building out library of dog behaviors, interactions, and movements.\nI've brought this project pretty far over the past couple years. I've laid the groundwork for a game I'm excited to play, a world I want to spend time in, and a chance to see that world from my favorite animal's perspective. \nWhat I need now is the ability to focus entirely on this crazy idea to see it through to conclusion. So far, all the code, art, animation, and game design has been done by me, on my own. The funds from Kickstarter will allow me to get help on the things I'm not so good at, like music and sound, will enable me to invest in the tools and software I need to make this thing shine, and give me the opportunity to work full-time on Home Free until it's done.\nKevin Cancienne @potatojin\nGame Design, Art, Animation & Programming\nKevin is an independent game developer based in New York.

Home Free is no different.\n\nThe biggest risk to Home Free, as described here, is to its schedule. Software projects sometimes take longer than anticipated, and I want to be honest about that possibility here. I'm helped by the fact that I'm not starting from scratch -- there's over two years' worth of groundwork already laid here. I estimate honestly that another year of steady work fleshing out gameplay, adding content, testing and prepping for release will get me to the finish line. But things go wrong, and I'm only human, so it might all take longer than I want.\n\nAnother \"risk\" that's inherent to all game projects is the risk that elements of the design will change and evolve over the course of the project. Game design is an iterative process, and the process of building, testing, playing, re-building, and re-playing has a way of overturning your early assumptions. This is the beauty of game design, but I also want to be clear with you, my backers, that Home Free is a work in progress, and as it gets better and more complete, it will also evolve. I hope you'll want to join me on that journey.\n\nI've been making games for more than 15 years. In that time, I've shipped nearly 30 of them. I've applied that experience to the planning that's gone into this project, and I'm going to continue to apply it overcome any of the obstacles I'm sure to face in bringing this project to life. I'm also extremely fortunate to be surrounded by an incredible community of talented game developers here in New York. Their ongoing support gives me confidence I'll be able to tackle whatever challenges lie ahead.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "Inside Of A Dog", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Aims", "update_content": "Happy autumn, everybody!\nI've had a very productive period since last we spoke, owing largely to a minor, but very effective change to my process and how I've been able to take advantage of my indefatigable wife Margaret's talents.\nIt was simple, really: I built a gaming PC out of spare parts, put it in the living room, and created a Work folder on a network attached storage drive, and -BOOM- an instant way to let Margaret sit with regular builds of the game, provide feedback, and help shift the focus of the project from larger \"mini projects\" to lots of little meaningful additions and changes that directly address playability."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Dogfriends", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Fear and Loafing", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Odds & Ends", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Friendly Neighborhood Traffic Man", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Run!", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 474, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/143870832/home-free-0", "project_name": "Home Free"}}, {"backer": "Olivia Dunlap", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "How to play\nAbout this project\nMonster Allegiance is a strategic fast-paced card game which challenges 2-4 players to compete for majority control over a horde of powerful and often unpredictable monsters. Tilt the balance of power in your favor and hold it until the end of the game, and you win! But beware... These are not mindless minions, but proud and dangerous creatures. Defeat an opponent\u2019s monster, and you\u2019ll earn it\u2019s allegiance. But if one falls to your opponent\u2026 you\u2019ll lose its respect and it\u2019ll turn against you! As a Monster Commander, you must strategically decide when and where to place each monster, how to capitalize on the elemental strengths and weaknesses of each, and how to turn the tide with powerful item and element cards. Enter the Monster\u2019s arena, but keep your mind sharp\u2026. for if it dulls, your usefulness to the monsters will swiftly end...\nBehind the idea\nMonster Allegiance was designed for those who love games that are easy to learn, but still offer a great deal of strategy, depth, and above all fun. Each card is fully illustrated in pixel art, giving it a retro feel and unique charm that many modern games have lost. For adults, Monster Allegiance will offer a wave of nostalgia to the lost age of pixel art graphics. Children and beginners will find a game with progressive difficulty at their chosen pace, easy to play and fun to collect the future expansions we hope to offer. Lastly, to older card players who shake their heads at us young whippersnappers, all the nerdy frills can be removed to reveal a surprisingly immersing game of pure numbers and light quantitative logic. So, hoping to bridge generations and genres and with fingers crossed we call our dream to the stand for your judgment. I present our vision: Monster Allegiance.\nInside the Box\n55 Monster Cards\n10 Element Cards\n8 item Cards\n5 Blank Cards (Draw and Create your own Monster Cards)\n2 Mini Instruction/reference Cards\nWe need your support!\nMonster Allegiance is set to grow as big as you permit, but we can't do it alone!

We've had a few requests for more details about the backstory of Monster Allegiance's development, so we decided to post this response. For those who are interested...\nMy name is John (JohnBrick), I'm the designer of Monster Allegiance. After several game ideas became too complicated to be completed, I had the idea that by starting with a very simple idea, and working incrementally outward, I could gradually weave a masterpiece of a game over a long period of time without it ever becoming overwhelming. Together with my partner Kim (KimDice), who in addition to his contributions to the game's design led the business side of development, we began to brainstorm through several ideas, considering everything from a customizable spaceship battling game to a parental reward one. Eventually, our current project emerged, and we knew we had our choice.\nMonster Allegiance began as a simple numbers game, and we weren't sure quite what to do with it. The simple 4-number attacking and flipping mechanic was fun, and the rules had no holes, but it needed something special to bring it to life. Inspired by the feelings evoked by many indie developers who used it, I had the idea to populate our cards with colorful pixel art monsters, and searched for an artist. Eventually we found Asher, a very talented pixel artist who took up our offer to come aboard the team. His masterful expressions of the monsters we described brought new life and inspiration to the game.\nWe added a friend to the team at this time with a bit more knowledge of popular card and tabletop gaming for consulting and promoting assistance, Martin (MartinTheViking). With feedback from Martin, I began to write up lore for each monster and the world they lived in, which were released in \"Monster Reveals\" over the course of development. We fleshed out the monster lore into a Pokemon-esq world with a darker tone, where sentient beasts strengthened with elemental powers formed uneasy alliances with human \"commanders\" to lead them to victory... but were always ready to change sides when a more proven leader presented themself. On the game mechanics side, we adopted an elemental advantage/disadvantage system, and some interesting item and element cards.\nJust as I'd hoped, the incremental development process resulted in a game that was immersing but simple to pick up. However, we wanted room to grow and expand. My personal dream was (and still is) to make a career or at least self-sustaining hobby of designing games, and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to try. So, I had the idea to add in currently unimportant details on the cards such as species and rarity. While I'd love to release more expansions, it is my hope that from these base cards, I can develop many new games playable without additional purchases, and continue doing so long term. I know that if we succeed, there will be a ton of suggestions, and I'd like to use as many as possible. It'd be a blast for me, and hopefully long lasting fun for all of you too, as our game slowly expands and changes based on your feedback and your own ideas for games to play with the cards.\nWhile it appears we're a little behind pace still, I am nonetheless thrilled by the response I've seen so far. On behalf of the team, I thank you for your attention and your continued support. Through your pledges and shares, I believe we can make this vision a reality. I look forward to co-creating the future of Monster Allegiance with you all!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDevelopment has been carried out very strategically, and we've taken on all risk personally.
