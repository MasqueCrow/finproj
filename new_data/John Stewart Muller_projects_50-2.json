Final version subject to updates.\n\nNew to Everdell?\nCheck out this great How to Play video from Watch it Played!\nWithin the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding... Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees.

Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Germany was already decimated by the First World War, and the Spanish Flu ravaged the country from border to border. It was during these unsettling years that the world's first horror-fantasy magazine was published.\nPublished in Munich from 1919-1921, DER ORCHIDEENGARTEN was a predecessor to the American pulp Weird Tales, and is considered the first horror-fantasy-science fiction periodical. The series collected macabre and mysterious tales from the finest European literary minds, from well-known names like H. G. Wells to now-obscure titans like Hanns Heinz Ewers. Many of the stories have been collected and translated over the years, so in this series of books we focus on the artworks, nearly all of which have remained unpublished for a century.\n\nGrotesque medieval etchings representing the human relationship with death, strange occult woodblocks that consider what lies just beyond the veil of human understanding, and sinister Expressionist visions as tangible manifestations of anxiety.\n\nFrom our current perspective of global uncertainty and the looming presence of a deadly, devastating virus, the artworks and stories of DER ORCHIDEENGARTEN -created in the same climate, a century ago\u2013 are uncannily resonant today.\nFounded four years before the iconic American magazine Weird Tales launched in March 1923, Der Orchideengarten was published immediately after the First World War, when German art was at its height of decadence and debauchery. The magazine included copious illustrations of themes ranging from suspense and terror to crime and the eerily-erotic. The stories were written by the European counterparts of H. P. Lovecraft and Arthur Machen, and the artworks were by artists both well-known and painfully obscure: Heinrich Kley, for example, was Disney's inspiration for Night on Bald Mountain in his film Fantasia, and is one of the artists well-represented in the magazine. The stories have been reprinted and translated over the past century, but the artworks remain undiscovered treasures\u2013 until now.\nRewards: The Book \nPERILOUS GARDEN: The Art of Der Orchideengarten Vol. 6 is the sixth book in our 'Art of Der Orchideengarten' series, and the third of three volumes completely documenting the magnificent and macabre artworks from the year 1920 of Der Orchideengarten magazine, the legendary German supernatural horror periodical published from January 1919 until November 1921.\nPERILOUS GARDEN: The Art of Der Orchideengarten Vol. 6\nPaperback, 5.5\" x 8.5\"\n80 pages\n60+ illustrations\ncontains every artwork from issues 16-24, published in the year 1920\nThe magazines were printed with letterpress debossing, creating rich, dense text and images; we are capturing the artworks in ultra-high, crisp resolution for maximum detail.\nPostcard Set\nSet of ten 5\" x 7\" postcards featuring five ghastly images from PERILOUS GARDEN (two copies of each image pictured).\nT-shirt\nSuper soft discharge print on high quality, vintage feel 100% cotton t-shirt available in sizes S-4XL (size selected in project survey).

We've prepared the materials, and by pre-ordering a copy of the book and spreading the word, you can help us make a documentation of this very rare and very obscure magazine come to life. Der Orchideengarten gets mentioned frequently in books, at fantasy conventions, and at certain full-moon cauldron gatherings\u2013but the same low-resolution images get shared over and over again. This book is an opportunity to explore the artworks in depth, with synopses and snippets of the stories, and high resolution scans made from a pristine collection. We love tactile experiences, and in a hyper-stimulating digital era there is nothing more meditative than thoughtfully turning the pages of a well-crafted book. With your help, we can perpetuate this romantic educational experience.\nFounded in 1999 by Thomas Negovan, Century Guild has presented Art Nouveau and Symbolist Art in both their Chicago (1999-2013) and Los Angeles (2012-2018) galleries, as well as in numerous international art and antiques fairs across the last two decades- including fourteen years as a major presence at San Diego Comic Con International. Works previously in the Century Guild collection are on permanent display in a number of important institutions, including The Art Institute of Chicago, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Detroit Institute of Art and have been exhibited at The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Minneapolis Museum of Art, and The Art Gallery of Ontario. The limited edition books published by Century Guild are desirable for their academic content, fine quality, and collectability; many out-of-print volumes command high prices on the secondary market.\n\nThank you for your support of our mission to document and preserve rare, obscure, and historically important artworks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPERILOUS GARDEN is the sixth publication in our 'Art of Der Orchideengarten' series; the previous five books in the series were each successfully funded and fulfilled on Kickstarter.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition.

During their journey they are forced to confront dark secrets from the time before civilization\u2019s fall.\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag is the internationally acclaimed author, concept designer and artist behind Tales From the Loop, Things From the Flood and The Electric State. His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world.\nNow, St\u00e5lenhag turns his unique vision to a dystopic future in a new narrative artbook: The Labyrinth. With your support, these amazing images will turn into a top-quality narrative artbook, truly doing justice to the extreme attention to detail and quality of St\u00e5lenhag's work.\nSpread from the Labyrinth\nSpread from The Labyrinth\nJust like Tales From the Loop and Things From the Flood and The Electric State, The Labyrinth will be a thick, oversized artbook of over 150 pages with print, paper, and binding of the highest quality.\nThere will be two versions of the book - the Standard Edition (included in the STANDARD reward level) and the Limited Edition (included in the LIMITED reward level and above).\nThe Limited Edition, with an exclusive and beautifully embossed cloth cover, is unique to this kickstarter and will never be printed again.\nLimited Edition (Work in Progress)\nSpread from The Labyrinth\nLabyrinten kommer \u00e4ven att publiceras p\u00e5 svenska.

His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian and American landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world. Tales From the Loop was ranked one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias\u201d by The Guardian, along with such works as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nIn 2019 his book The Electric State was shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clare Award and the Locus Award. His first book, Tales From the Loop, was adapted into a tv show on Amazon Prime in 2020. \nClick here to stay in the loop on all of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s projects in English.\nF\u00f6r mer information om Simons svenska b\u00f6cker och spel klicka h\u00e4r.\nPhoto: Fredrik Bernholm\n\n\nThe Labyrinth will be a top-quality artbook no matter what, with paper, printing and binding of the highest grade.

In the first volume, you find a message from Mary:\nBeneath Mary\u2019s letter you\u2019ll discover a treasure trove of gorgeous hand-written documents, 2D and 3D jigsaw puzzles, mysterious objects and artifacts, and devious challenges. Prove your worth by studying the documents, constructing the jigsaws, and solving the puzzles... and you\u2019ll be treated to a heartbreaking story that culminates in a shocking reimagining of the truth behind Mary Shelley\u2019s famous novel.\nCombining the best of escape rooms, board games, and immersive theater, Mother of Frankenstein is a 10-15 hour cooperative gaming experience for between 1 and 6 players, ages 13 and up. Mother of Frankenstein was designed to be as welcoming and fun for newbies as it is rewarding for experts, combining the narrative complexity of a good novel with the physicality and challenge of a puzzle-filled escape room. Throw in a couple of clue-strewn jigsaw puzzles, and our game truly has something for everyone!\nOur final stretch(es)!\nStretchy!\nMother of Frankenstein is divided into three volumes. Volume 1 concerns Mary\u2019s teenage years and her education by her iconoclastic father. Players must complete three assignments\u2014poetry, music, and astronomy\u2014each of which is presented in the form of a puzzle. Simultaneously, Mary embarks on a love affair with the dashing (but married) poet Percy Shelley. The course of their courtship is laid out over 15 love letters, though players must read closely to determine the order of events!\nIn Volume 2, the venue changes to Germany, and Castle Frankenstein, where a fancy ball is being thrown on a balmy night in 1814. Players begin by constructing a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle of the castle\u2019s floorplan, then use it\u2014along with gossip rags, billiard hall schedules, and original drawings by comic book artist Liana Kangas\u2014to track the events of the evening.\nFinally, in Volume 3, you\u2019ll construct an epic 3D puzzle of Castle Frankenstein and descend into the secret laboratory hidden therein, where you\u2019ll discover what Mary learned under the tutelage of the famous alchemist who called the place home, and how it inspired her to write what many call the first science fiction novel, Frankenstein. \nWhen our heroes tweet, we screencap.\nThe Standard Edition of Mother of Frankenstein contains the following: \n The Ultimate Edition adds our special printing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, featuring original art by comic book artist Liana Kangas (which has its own reward tier, if you just feel like a re-read!), as well as a ton of other fancy stuff.

Terry has been working 60-hour weeks finalizing the insanely complex imagery that goes into the 3D puzzle. Basically, Frankenstein's castle and its environs have been fully modelled in 3D. Then, through Terry magic, 2D textures are constructed to best simulate what it would \"feel\" like to be looking at this 3D castle from various angles, which are then applied to the facades.

We estimate that in the worst-case scenario, the production might suffer delays of at most 30-60 days, and shipping & customs may add an extra 15-45 days.

By removing chlorine, the filters become the perfect breeding ground for bacteria, mold, and other pollutants in just 2 weeks\u2014making the filter itself a source of contamination.\nRead about it in our white paper\n\n\n\n\nGo beyond filtration with two-step filtration and purification.\n\nStep 1: Better filtration\nOur carbon-derived, plant-based filter gets rid of unwanted contaminants like lead, mercury, chlorine, VOCs, and more, leaving you with pure, crisp-tasting water. No compromises here.\n\n\nStep 2: PureVis\u2122 purification technology\nWhat traditional water pitchers are missing is a vital second step\u2014PureVis\u2122 UV-C purification, which eradicates bio-contaminants at the molecular level.

Ah, that\u2019s what we call pure water beyond filtration. \n\n\n\nWe've done the science to help you drink brilliantly.\nLARQ's proprietary and patented PureVis\u2122 UV-C LED technology is the most advanced in the world.\n\n\nWe opted out of the hard outer plastic casing you\u2019ll find with traditional filters and created a more sustainable woven material to help provide structure to the filter media. The result? A 75% reduction in plastic use during filter replacements over the course of a year.\nBy flattening the filter geometry we were able to maximize surface area for the perfect balance between efficacy, filter speed, and lifetime.\n\n\nTwo types of filters to choose from based on your water quality needs.\nLARQ Filters will be tested to NSF standards (42 and 53) to achieve >90% reduction across a range of contaminants.\nAll rewards or add-ons with Advanced Filter will ship in Q1 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re taking the next two months to finalize our certifications.

So #DrinkBrilliantly.\n\n\n\n\nMany Kickstarter campaigns have disappointed backers by not thinking about shipping, taxes, and duties ahead of time. Truthfully, we also learned the hard way the first time around. We want to assure our backers that we\u2019ve partnered with world-class logistic solution providers to ensure the delivery of all of our rewards across the world.\nPlease be aware that all shipping, sales and VAT taxes will be collected after the campaign is over. \nShortly before the LARQ Pitcher ships, we will email you a link so you can:\nInput your shipping address and latest delivery information\nChoose a color for the LARQ Pitcher\nPay shipping and sales/VAT/GST tax\nOrder additional filters, the LARQ Pitcher or other accessories\nBelow is a shipping estimate table based on the latest data. We will strive diligently to achieve the right balance of shipping speed and cost efficiency for our backers. We will remain 100% transparent regarding shipping costs and will pass on any potential savings to our backers as well.\nTaxes will vary based on where your rewards are shipped. For the following countries, we're collecting taxes before shipping, so you won\u2019t have to worry about paying them at the time of delivery, extra fees, or being held up in customs.\n United States: State sales taxes apply in most states.\n European Union, United Kingdom, China, and Canada: VAT/GST taxes apply.\n Other Countries: We will not charge any taxes in the pledge manager. However, you may be responsible for sales tax, VAT/GST taxes, duties, import fees, or other taxes/fees when your reward is delivered.\n  In order to accommodate the high demand, we have added additional rewards with an updated shipping timetable. This will help ensure that every backer receives their LARQ Reward on time based on the reward selected. This will not change existing rewards, however, we would recommend checking any existing pledges under your \u201cBacked Projects\u201d  to confirm your reward\u2019s estimated shipping window.  Please note that the shipping start date is based on the perk you backed. Due to shipping logistics, not all perks will ship at once. We anticipate it will take ~2 months from the start of each estimated shipping window listed below to fulfill all orders globally.\nWe hope by spreading out the shipping start dates for the new rewards, we can ensure that rewards are shipped out right on schedule.

We are continuing that tradition of innovation with our new filter technology. \n\nWe learned that existing filter technology hasn\u2019t changed much since the introduction of countertop filters in the 1960s. Activated carbon wrapped around a hard plastic filter housing. The most popular models on the market today do little more than remove chlorine and reduce a small handful of contaminants - a cosmetic treatment. Other heavy-duty filters will literally filter out everything from the water, including beneficial minerals and would clog in as little as 2 weeks making them impractical, wasteful and frustrating. \n\nWe wanted to rethink the filter from the ground up, starting with first principles. The foundation of our filter had to be a sustainable material - so we chose a plant-based sustainable carbon. This was a fundamental challenge in finding the right filter design was balancing filtering efficacy, with lifetime and filter speed. We knew we had to find the goldilocks zone of efficacy, sustainability and practicality. This turned out to be no simple task. But with the hard work and dedication from our engineering team, we redesigned the filter geometry and we were able to maximize surface area for the perfect balance between efficacy, filter speed and lifetime. \n\nWe\u2019re taking the next two months to fine-tune our filters and already have preliminary third-party lab results to share. We'll continue testing and provide updates to you. \n\nWe have already begun the manufacturing and production process based on the current design of the Pitcher. With your support, we can quickly scale and expedite the manufacturing and production process so that we can get the LARQ Pitcher into the hands of thousands, and you can be proud to know that you made it happen. While we have budgeted sufficient resources and time, we know that there might be things outside of our control and current visibility. Our timeline as planned:\n\n- The LARQ Pitcher with Essential LARQ Filter(s) will begin shipping in December 2020\n- The LARQ Pitcher with Advanced LARQ Filter(s) and/or any rewards with Advanced LARQ Filter as an add-on will begin shipping in Q1 2021\n\nWe don't anticipate any issues currently with this timeline. However, if by chance anything unexpected happens, we promise to keep you informed, both during the campaign and afterward.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur PureVis technology does not need to be replaced and the Pitcher is made from highly durable BPA / BPS free polymer.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur filters use 75% less plastic than conventional filters because we have designed away the hard plastic out casing.

Christoph Haizmann binds his soul to the devil. Bondage written in blood. Haizmann produced 100s of demonic paintings, some lost to time.\n1923. Sigmund Freud evaluates the painter as suffering from demonical neurosis.\n1937. Adolf Hitler reads Freud's essay, acquires Haizmann's works, and displays them in public at the Degenerate Art Exhibition. A framed Haizmann cannot be photographed; the framed art is obscured by shadow in every photo ever taken.\n1982. Fredrick Haizmann (Christopher Lee) is an occult art dealer with a secret key to a secret room. What cannot be captured, can only be seen in person, deep with the Rovina Rossa. He lures a clandestine group of collectors, including Arthur Grimvane (Vincent Price), to his family home where he reveals the lost demonic paintings of his ancient relative, Christoph Haizmann.\nWhen the lights go out, and the paintings come to life, whether real or illusion, the collectors find themselves locked within the very heart of the\u2026THE HELL HOUSE!\n\n\n\nReward Tiers\nThere are 3 different pledge-level reward tiers. All of them contain the VHS case and included art components, but you can also combine the VHS with either a large poster or a custom framed canvas. All VHS cases, prints, and canvases will be signed and numbered by Bryan Fyffe.\nNote: US shipping and handling is included in the cost of each tier. International shipping is not supported.\nTier 1: $35 dollars (includes shipping) gets you the Hell House VHS case signed and numbered with all the collectibles inside\nTier 2 - The Art Buyer: $65 Dollars gets you a high-quality art print (13 x 19) signed and numbered and the Hell House VHS case signed and numbered with all the collectibles inside,\nTier 3 - The Haunted Frame: $325 dollars gets you a hand-crafted framed canvas (16 x 20) signed and numbered, and the Hell House VHS case signed and numbered and all the collectibles inside\nShipping and Handling\nThe cost of your pledge covers shipping and handling in the United States. \nNote: International shipping and handling is not supported at this time\n\nThe story for the imaginary film The Hell House was inspired by several real life historical events. Seriously!\n1660-1700\nThe blood-bond, possession, and exorcism of Christoph Haizmann\nThe Sacred Trophaeum Mariano-Cellense, (The Trophy of Mariazell), lives in the Austrian National Library in Vienna, The Fideikommissbibliothek. The Trophaeum, which was rigorously studied by Sigmund Freud, details the painter Christoph Haizmann\u2019s struggle with demonic possession. Haizmann describes the death of his father, loss of faith in God, and describes signing not one, but two pacts with the devil. The first, written in ink, was not enough; in 1669 he signed a second copy, one that was bound by his own blood.   \nThe original demonic bond signed by Christoph Haizmann. Source: Trophaeum Mariano-Cellense\nThe contract is unique in ways even Freud recognized: Haizmann wanted nothing in return. He did not ask the devil for wealth, money, or power in the typical Faustian model. Haizmann was contracted for nine years, and in the Trophaeum describes in grave detail how the devil appeared to him in visions, often as a red dragon-creature with breasts and sharp talons. He also had visions of hell, which he described as \u201cfilled with burning flames and terrible stench. In it there was a large cauldron from which came heart-rending moans and groans of human beings; on its edge sat a hellish devil who did nothing but pour flaming resin, sulphur and pitch over them.\u201d   \nUnframed Haizmann artwork, including the tryptich included in the Trophaeum\nMultiple exorcisms were performed on Haizmann. The Trophaeum quotes both Haizmann and his exorcists in detail. \u201cWhen I went to confess, the priest ordered me to say the confession-prayer. But I could not pray it although I started four times\u201d Four devils assailed him. \u201cOne of them sat on my tongue so I took my hand and tore out the evil spirit.\u201d Haizmann\u2019s exorcist described a great winged dragon returning the blood-bonded manuscript to Haizmann during the exorcism; \u201cO foolish cunning of the Evil One! In the form of a dragon he appeared in the sanctuary.\u201d After hours of exorcism, Haizmann was temporarily redeemed via the mirable dictu. Later in life his pain returned, and he began to fall victim to horrifying attacks on his mind and body, resulting in \u201ctrances, visions, and convulsions so violent that on one occasion he writhed about until blood gushed from his nose and mouth\u201d. \n\n 1920-1938 \nThe study of demonological illness, and the Lost Appendix of Sigmund Freud\nIn 1922, Dr. Rudolf Payer-Thurn, director of the Austrian National Library in Vienna, discovered the Trophaeum Mariano-Cellense. He sought out Sigmund Freud\u2019s expertise. Freud was the first to study the Trophaeum, and had long been interested in the power of witchcraft, possession, and how neuroses were represented in the ancient world. Writing to a friend he stated:\n\u201cWhat have you got to say to the suggestion that the whole of my brand-new theory of the primary origins of hysteria is already familiar and has been published a hundred times over, though centuries ago? Do you remember my always saying that the medieval theory of possession, that held by the ecclesiastical courts, was identical to our theory of a foreign body and the splitting of consciousness?\u201d \nSigmund Freud studying the Trophaeum\nFreud was confident there was evidence of neurosis in sacred or precious remains of the past, and saw symptoms of hysteria in \u201cthe portrayals of possession and ecstasy that have been preserved for us in the productions of art\u201d. Freud asked, what if the past captured moments of neurotic illness, like an ancient plague frozen in the ice of an artist\u2019s despair expressed in ink or paint, waiting to be thawed out, waiting to poison minds across the void of time? The psychic maladies of times past are recorded and preserved in the works of art, transmitting the psychic horrors, often misunderstood, into posterity.\nAfter studying the Trophaeum, he published \u201cEine Teufelsneurose im Siebzehnten Jahrhundert\u201d (A Seventeenth-Century Demonological Neurosis)\u201d in 1923.  Freud found Haizmann\u2019s case to be one where Haizmann believed what he was saying was true. Freud expresses Haizmann\u2019s loss of his father as creating severe depression and mental illness which Haizmann solved by inventing a new father: Satan. Freud believed God and Satan were both types of father figures, and Haizmann, seeking to fill a dark void, believed God took his father away, so he gained a new father in the devil. \nLater revisions of Freud\u2019s essay contain the following note from 1938, one year before his death, in an appendix:\n\u201cI have been gifted a painting believed to have been ensorcelled by Haizmann\u2019s demonic pact. I revisited the Trophaeum, and discovered in my original reading I translated \u201cnotitiis clausura redundat\u201d as the enclosure where Haizmann\u2019s exorcism took place, the void where exorcism worked like an ancient psychoanalysis to appease the demonological illness. Yet now as I hold this painting, the corrupted neurosis of the tortured artist overwhelms me. I smell searing flesh, like a spit pig cooking over a roaring fire, captured impossibly in the wood-grain of the ancient frame. \u201cnotitiis clausura redundat\u201d could also mean the enclosure of the painting. I can no longer bear to look upon this work, and my hands sting where I touched the painting\u2019s black frame.\u201d\n                                       ~Freud\nFreud revisits his original essay on Haizmann after obtaining a framed copy of Haizmann's work\n\n 1906-1938 \nAdolf Hitler's demonological connection to Haizmann\nIt is possible Hitler was touched by Haizmann's work at a young age.  August Kubizek, one of Hitler's closest friends since childhood, claims that Hitler at age 17, once spoke to him of \"returning Germany to its former glory\". August stated: \"It was as if another being spoke out of his body, and moved him as much as it did me\".\nThe first photographic evidence of the inability to capture framed Haizmann artworks can be found as early as a 1918 in Italy. Hitler may have been aware of Haizmann, and obsessed with seeing the un-photographable art even in his twenties.\nFirst historical photograph of a framed Haizmann, which is obscured by shadow\nIn Hitler's own forgotten library, just around the time he would have read Freud's essay on Haizmann, he underlined a passage in his 1923 copy of Magic: History, Theory and Practice, (which is dedicated to Hitler). \"He who does not have the demonic seed within himself will never give birth to a magical world\". In the same year, Hitler's mentor, Dietrich Eckhart, wrote: \"Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We have given him the 'means of communication' with Them\".\nHitler, obsessed with both deviant art and Austrian culture, discovers the Haizmann estate, and hunts down as many of the lost paintings as he can find. His hunt leads him to a strange estate in Italy run by a nearly-blind Austrian woman, Annelise Elsa Fleischmann. It is unknown what caused Annie's eyes to ghost over with a milky-white film.\nThe only surviving photograph of Annelise Elsa Fleischman, caretaker of the Haizmann estate\nFleischmann was the sole caretaker of a manor full of occult paintings, most of which were Haizmann's, or which Hitler believed were the lost Haizmann paintings. In 1937 he displayed some of Haizmann's art at the Enarte Kunst, the Degenerate Art Exhibit. Images that could be seen in person, are inexplicably blackened out in every developed photograph. \nHitler is believed to have displayed Haizmann's art at the Degenerate Art Exhibit in 1937\nIn 1938, Hitler annexed Austria itself, and during The Anschluss, Hitler read the original Trophaeum Mariano-Cellense in Vienna. At this time Hitler also identified Annie Fleischmann as a Jew, and after annexing Austria, moved her from Italy to Austria, where she was imprisoned in the Mauthausen, Vienna's category III concentration camp, and home of the \"Stairway of Death\".  \nThe SS called Mauthausen Knochenm\u00fchle, or the bone grinder, AKA The Stairs of Death\n\nPost-War\nThe recovery of the Haizmann estate and the lost key\nAt the end of the war, the allies recovered most of Haizmann's art, along with thousands of other lost masterpieces. Some of Haizmann's works, which could not be photographed, were warehoused and kept by the Allies for study.  \nAllied soldiers recover framed Haizmann art from a Nazi cache. The Haizmann is again obscured in shadow.\nIncredibly, Annie Fleischmann survived Mauthausen, and returned with much of the Haizmann estate intact to the mansion in Italy. Before she died, she sent a letter to the last living heir of the Haizmann estate.\nFredrick Haizmann received Annie Fleischmann's letter and became obsessed with unravelling the history of Christoph Haizmann and his estate.  Fredrick claims ownership of the estate. He finds a mysterious, locked door in the central parlor of the mansion. \nThe entire mansion that holds Haizmann's lost work is built around a locked room with no key. This room is believed to be la Rovina Rossa\nThe door, which reads Rovina Rossa, was impenetrable.  No key fit the shape of the lock. The room was missing from the architectural blueprints of the mansion. A shroud settled across his mind. Uncast shadows danced across the paintings his great ancestor created centuries ago. A solitary unmarked grave lied under a withering olive tree. He looked again at the letter Annie sent him, and read the final lines aloud: \"Niemand kann ins herz schauen\". No one can look into the heart. Fredrick knew then what he must do to recover the key, and unlock the door. He would do anything to look within the dark heart of the Hell House.  \nThe solitary grave of Annelise Elsa Fleischmann\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? \nIf you're not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a platform that allows creators to crowdfund their creative projects.

This will open up his bio page where you can then click the blue \"Contact me\" button to send him a message via Kickstarter.\nIs the Hell House a real movie that I can find and watch?\nWe wish it were! The movie is an imagined film from an alternative history, and it does not exist in our time-stream.\nWhat is VHS? \nVHS (Video Home System) was a standard for consumer-level analog video recording on tape cassettes. Home video rental during the 80s and 90s was primarily offered through VHS cassette tapes;  these tapes were offered in thick plastic cases which had artwork inserted into a transparent plastic film along the exterior of the case. \nDoes the Hell House contain a copy of an actual VHS movie?\nNo.\nWhat's inside the box?\nSome fun objects, mostly printed pieces of art that accompany the backstory. If we told you, it would spoil the surprise, but there is nothing too crazy, unsafe, or overly costly to produce within.\nIs this a limited-run collectors edition?\nYes. The Hell House  products are limited, and will only be available through this kickstarter.\nWas Christoph Haizmann a real painter who Freud wrote about? \nYes.\nDid Christoph Haizmann really sign a contract with the devil?\nFreud believed that the subject, Haizmann himself, believed he signed a contract.\nDid Hitler read Freud's analysis?\nThe real historical time-line is perfect. While we can't prove Hitler read Freud's essay, the likelihood is high. However, it is worth noting how anathema Freud's psychoanalytic theories were to fascism and nazism. \nIn 1907 Hitler and Freud actually lived in the same neighborhood. Hitler admired the Jewish artistic movement and longed to contribute to the arts and sciences. He was, however, rejected from Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts. By 1923 his views have changed dramatically, he publicly disapproves of Freud and declares psychoanalysis an idea of a deranged mind. \nBoth Einstein and Freud are despised by the Nazi party for their anti-war rhetoric (note: a fascinating letter correspondence between Einstein and Freud is published). By 1938 when Hitler \"liberates\u201d Austria,  Freud's daughter Anna is captured up by Hitler's Gestapo. Upon her release Freud fled to London, but his sisters remained behind, and all of them died in concentration camps\nDid Freud really write an appendix to his essay? \nNo. This is the author's fictional creation. No Freuds were harmed in this twisted history, and none of Freud's original words were used in the creation of this appendix to his essay.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduct is already created, materials have been sourced, and there will be no challenge shipping this to you in a timely fashion.

What started as a single drawing slowly morphed into a daily practice, a way to reconcile and record the thoughts, feelings, and change being wrought in the world. These ink drawings and hand-lettered texts are shared daily by Szyhalski on Instagram, poignantly capturing our politically fraught and excruciatingly painful landscape. Accompanied by powerful captions by the artist, this ongoing series, currently, 108 days and counting, operates as both a witness to the current crisis and a container of time, time that is both labored and lost.\nEvery COVID-19: Labor Camp Report through July 4, 2020\nIn collaboration with Frank (a small imprint for artist projects), Szyhalski\u2019s daily COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports will be transformed into a book. By taking the form of a printed publication, these timely and important drawings will be collected together, allowing us a way to remember and reflect on not just the coronavirus pandemic, but the incredible reckoning happening across the globe. Books as a form allow for artists' work to be accessible to a multitude of people in different locations at any given time and are now more than ever, an incredibly powerful communicative force. Organized chronologically, Szyhalski\u2019s COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports book will be 8 x 12 inches, and feature lushly printed, large-scale images of each drawing, including never before seen sketches, newly commissioned essays, and reflections on the work, and the artist's texts written for the Instagram series. The COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports book embodies Szyhalski\u2019s ceaseless and diligent practice, one that continues to provoke, confront, comfort, and inspire its audience. His ongoing Instagram posts continue to gain hundreds of likes, comments, and followers, sparking interest from around the country and the globe, asking for more. Deeply inspiring, Szyhalski\u2019s offers a space to confront the complexity, uncertainty, absurdity of our current moment, all the while reminding us of the importance of compassion, criticality, and change. With its spectacular imagery and messaging, the COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports book is an important vehicle to mark this era of our lives, one that in its printed form, we will be able to return to time and time again.\nArtists have always led the way forward and now more than ever, we need their voices. As Szyhalski said in a recent article profiling the COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports published by the Walker Art Center, \u201cI really believe that as artists, we need to be doing this,\u201d he says,  \u201cIf there is a responsibility, the responsibility is to be there, to witness, and to respond and to reflect what we are experiencing, and unfortunately what we are experiencing has a shitload of hurt.\u201d Szyhalski's drawings transform our collective dismay and anger against the injustice into powerful, concise images of resistance. While the urgency of our current moment lends the work much of its power, it is the universality of the issues that Szyhalski captures that make the COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports so profoundly important.\nSzyhalski & Frank believe in the power of printed matter and the incredible experience that can come from exploring the world through books. Szyhalski\u2019s daily COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports are a poignant record of the time we find ourselves in and we are excited to share them with you through the printed page. We hope you will join us in making this timely and important artist book a reality.\nProject update (July 14):\nWhile our initial goal was 22k for the book, as Szyhalski continues to create his COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports, the publication continues to grow! Raising an additional 12k for a total of 34k would allow us to expand the book\u2019s material production (adding more pages, more images, including more notes, sketches, and ephemera), enable higher commissioned fees to our wonderful writers, allow us to pay our incredible editor, and enhance the book\u2019s distribution. If we double our initial goal to raise 44k, then we can start exploring more creative production techniques, making a richer, lusher, more in-depth book! We want to build a larger community around this work and cannot thank our wonderful supporters enough.\nWho we are:\nPolish-born, U.S.-based artist Piotr Szyhalski established the Labor Camp\u2014an ongoing art project\u2014in 1998. Working across diverse media (painting, photography, drawing, installation, sound, and design), Szyhalski\u2019s practice explores the intricate relationships between history, time, permeance, and participation. Learn more about Szyhalski\u2019s Daily COVID-19: Labor Camp Reports in this great text published by the Walker Art Center here and be sure to follow along as he continues to share his drawings on Instagram here at @laborcamp\nFrank currently exists as a collaboration between Michael Aberman and Courtenay Finn. Operating as space in which art and ideas are passed between friends, Frank\u2019s interest is in the ability of these conversations to make their way into the world. Aberman and Finn met during their tenure at the Aspen Art Museum, where Aberman was the Design Director and Finn was the Curator. They have worked on numerous artist projects, both together and with friends, and believe wholeheartedly in the power of printed matter.\nRewards:\nFrank &  Piotr Szyhalski/Labor Camp have assembled a series of artist rewards from limited edition pins, posters, postcards, and tote bags, not to mention opportunities to have your name listed in the book, signed editions, and original artwork!

I have worked as a professor at some universities and I wanted to share with you the latest work I have done. It is a Tarot deck,  that I have been working on for quite some time.\nIt is the result of a creative process. I do not read the Tarot. As a teacher I started to prepare a series of activities that had to do with Christian iconography. I decided to PREPARE A project that in principle was going to have educational aims. I ended up designing a tarot when I met Kikstarter.\nI have practically based myself on the Tarot of Marseille and the cards of the Spanish deck. I really like Jodorowski's poetic work and I have taken many ARCANOS from his book with Marianne Costa: \"The Way of the Tarot\". I have also been inspired by books and YouTube channels such as Alejandra's \"I want to learn Tarot.com\". So if you know the Marseille and the Riders TAROT it will not be difficult for you to use this project. As an artist,  I have simply been carried away by the most interesting aspects of EACH OF THE TAROTS I HAVE CONSULTED.\nThere are cards in which the color reveals the aspects of the Tarot of Marseille, but that I have not used in cards that I wanted to make darker.\nThere is cards in which I have chosen pictorial references, for example \u201cthe chariot\u201d has the influence of Giotto and his saint Francisco de Asis in a chariot of fire, The high Priestess reminds this Madonna of the Renaissance.\nThe magician's card is one of my favorites, it is the first one I designed and it is the germ of the process. MORANDI is also the name of a character that I created for my animations.\nFor minor arcana I have been inspired by the Spanish deck and their equivalent in the Tarot RIDER. For some cards I have chosen a relative simplicity, when I learned that \u201cswords-cards\u201d are generally \u201cTHOUGHTS\u201d, I decided to make an abstraction that, for example, the mundane \u201cCOINS\u201d do not have .\nI worked with large formats and some details will not be seen in the cards, so I have prepared some postcards with details as a gift for the first sponsors to arrive.\nThe designs are finished digitally, the original sketches are, however, the most important part of the creative process: I attach photographs of some of these sketches that will be finished by hand at the end of the campaign.\nIt seems that in the end, I have completed the trip of \u201cTHE FOOL\u201d , has been a lot of fun AND I hope you like the work and it is useful for many people.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCOVID-19\nAs we all know it is difficult to safely foresee deliveries and deadlines, they will always be subjected to eventualities that may arise in relation to the pandemic.\n\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES\nVicente Molina is a renowned illustrator and an art and communication professional with more than 20 years of experience.

If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS\n\nWe understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\n\nRETURNED PRODUCTS\n\nIf you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\n\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY\n\nSurveys will be completed through Crowd Ox.

W. Leadbeater. It was originally published in 1905 in London. According to the teachings of Theosophy, thoughts and emotions create distinctive patterns of color and form in the human aura\u2014visible only to those who are gifted with a sufficient degree of clairvoyance and can see beyond our normal perceptions. Besant and Leadbeater dictated their clairvoyant \"thought-forms\" to a group of friends who then created the 58 magnificent illustrations contained in the book. This book was a major influence on the artists Hilma Af Klint and Wassily Kandinsky among many others but has long been overlooked as a foundational pillar in art history. \nBesant was also an early suffragist and political activist and was far ahead of her time as an artist and thinker. Theosophy was the first occult group to open its doors to women and Thought Forms offers a reminder that the history of modernist abstraction and women\u2019s contribution to it is still being written.\nA proper, color corrected version of the book is not currently in print. Our re-print aims to bring this over looked masterpiece back into circulation in the form of a high quality clothbound and embossed hardcover at an affordable price. We have also worked with the editor of the project Lucy Lord Campana to commission three introductory pieces by contemporary scholars to further contextualize the book. \nAt a Funeral\nTHE LONG STORY: \nThought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation by Annie Besant and Charles W. Leadbeater originally published in 1905, is a 143 page, illustrated book that offers a look into a chapter of the past that has largely been forgotten.\nBesant and Leadbeater were the third wave leaders of the Theosophical Society. Theosophy is an occult movement founded in New York City in the late 1800s. It was a time when ideas about individuality, religion, art and science were up in the air as the structures of society were shifting. The aim of Theosophy was to unify all religions, create world peace and further the \u201cunlimited capacities of man\u201d, proclaiming that \u201cthere is no religion higher than truth\u201d.\nAnnie Besant was a British socialist, women's rights activist, anti-colonialist, and pro-union fighter whose spiritual journey eventually led her to Theosophy. She fought for birth control, and was arrested when she put out a book on family planning. Besant's close collaborator in the Theosophical movement was C. W. Leadbeater, to whom she credited as helping her gain clairvoyance. Together they wrote about topics such as the human aura, the history of mankind, and the chemical structure of the universe.\nAccording to the teachings of Theosophy, thoughts and emotions create distinctive patterns of color and form in the human aura\u2014visible only to those who are gifted with a sufficient degree of clairvoyance and can see beyond our normal perceptions. The quality of thought determines the aura\u2019s color and shape; a person who is selfless and generous, possesses an aura that is radiant and clear; for those who are selfish and insensitive\u2014their aura is cloudy and muddy. These artist impressions were made available only in Thought Forms and are radically different than anything else made at that time.\nWe learned of Thought Forms a few years ago and it completely took us by surprise. This one book totally challenged the classic art history narrative that had been taught to in school. Not like we fundamentally believed that story, abstraction is found in all cultures\u2014not just in western 20th century painting, but the genesis story of a few male painters \u201cinventing\u201d abstraction does have its truths.\nIn this narrative of Modernism, Vassily Kandinsky is widely viewed as one of the most important founders of abstraction, and his manifesto On the Spiritual in Art is mandatory reading in art school.\nWhat was never mentioned to us in school however, was that Kandinsky was a member of the Theosophical Society, and had acquired a copy of their book Thought Forms a few years before he abandoned conventional ways of painting. Learning that Kandinsky didn\u2019t just come upon these ideas on his own as previously thought, totally changed our understanding of his work. It\u2019s worth mentioning that Piet Mondrian was also deeply influenced by Theosophy and later on, Jackson Pollock was as well.\nLast year the Guggenheim held the first US retrospective of Hilma af Klint\u2019s paintings. She was a member of the Theosophical Society and was undoubtably influenced by the spiritualistic currents of the time. Theosophy was the first occult group to open its doors to women, and it deeply questioned gender roles, many of these ideas are also in Af Klint\u2019s paintings. This show was one of the first times the all-male origin story of abstraction was challenged within the ivory tower. Af Klint, made these paintings before Kandinsky, and she was a woman. Thought Forms came out before Af Klint began her abstract paintings and it is certain that she must have come across this book.\nWe\u2019re republishing this beautiful, overlooked book, so that it may be widely accessible and no longer omitted from the past. Thought Forms offers a reminder that the history of modernist abstraction and women\u2019s contribution to it is still being written.\nTheosophy\u2019s motto seems as appropriate today as it did in 1880, \u201cthere is no religion higher than truth.\u201d\nBOOK CONTRIBUTOR BIOGRAPHIES:\n\nAuthors\n Annie Besant (1847\u20131933) was a British socialist, women's rights activist, president of the Theosophical Society, writer, orator, and philanthropist. Regarded as a champion of human freedom, she was an ardent supporter of both Irish and Indian self-rule. She was a prolific author of over three hundred books and pamphlets. Besant greatly expanded the international reach of Theosophy, and represented it at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893. Besant\u2019s close co-worker in the Theosophical movement was C. W. Leadbeater, to whom she credited as helping her gain clairvoyance. Together they wrote about topics such as the human aura, the history of mankind, and the chemical structure of the universe. Besant continued to be a leader of Theosophy and a human rights activist until her death.\n\nCharles Webster Leadbeater (1854-1934) was a member of the Theosophical Society and author of over sixty books and pamphlets. He was a high-ranking member of the society but resigned in 1906 amid a sex scandal involving adolescent boys. Besant championed and defended Leadbeater, eventually readmitting him back to the Theosophical Society where he was a leading member for the rest of his life even amid additional sex scandals. Leadbeater claimed clairvoyance and much of his work was about the \u201cpower to see what is hidden from ordinary physical sight\u201d. Many of his books remain popular today and include such topics as the afterlife, dreams, vegetarianism, and Esoteric Christianity.\n\nEditor\n Lucy Lord Campana is an artist whose observational based painting practice explores the limits of our collective vision. Recent projects include images from the Hubble Space Telescope, a series around X-ray use in diamond mining, and methane detection with infrared technology. She teaches drawing and painting at Columbia University.\n\nBook Introductions\n Mitch Horowitz is a PEN Award-winning historian whose books include Occult America, One Simple Idea, and The Miracle Club.

You are racing down the streets, desperate to escape into the safety of the countryside. If your cart is the first out of town you and your cart-mates win! Or do you? Some villagers on your cart may secretly already have the plague. If you leave town with a plagued villager on your cart, you will catch the plague and lose! What will you do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? And who will you trust (or betray) along the way? \nBristol 1350 is a social deduction and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes.\n Thank you to all of our backers for an incredible campaign!\nIf you missed the campaign you can make a late pledge here until fall 2020.\nBackers can view project updates for information about delivery and add-ons.\nPlease visit our website or Facebook for the latest information on Bristol 1350.\nWe are excited to offer a Deluxe edition of the game! Depending on later demand, this Deluxe edition may be exclusive to Kickstarter, and at most it will be in rare distribution or only available at conventions. Beyond the core Standard edition of the game (+9 extra Kickstarter characters + stretch goals) the Deluxe edition includes: \nThe 6 Deluxe coins to scale.\nEvery Kickstarter backer of Bristol 1350 (Standard or Deluxe) will receive 9 extra character cards in a special foil pack to add to their core copy of the game (for 18 total characters!) These characters will not be available after Kickstarter and are our way of saying thank you. We will reveal a new character every few days in the section below!    \n\n\nWe have upgraded every single component in the game with the space available in the box. Each upgrade represents our dedication to making high-quality and high-performing games at an affordable price. While we hope to include most of the upgrades listed above in future editions, they are only guaranteed for this first Kickstarter Standard and Deluxe printing of the game.   \nThe level of textural detail on the book, front and back, is kind of mouthwatering.\nBristol 1350 is a social deduction (lying & backstabbing) and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes. The game is enjoyable at all player counts, with lower counts leaning towards strategy and higher counts leaning towards social deduction, lying, and trust.\nIn the game each player begins in one of the three carts behind the starting line. Your goal is to be on the first cart to escape from the town. However, if anyone on your cart has the plague when you finish, everyone on that cart dies of the plague! Play continues until an all-healthy cart crosses or until everyone has the plague.   \nYou can view the full rules and print and play at this link. Note that the rulebook design is still underway, and if you want to play the print and play you'll need to construct your own dice and carts.\nYou can play for free online with Tabletop Simulator or with Tabletopia. \nAs they become available, translations of the rulebook will be available on our website. We currently have translations available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Greek. \nSome of the intriguing mechanics are discussed by The Board Game Critic in this video. \nA full playthrough of a 5-player game can be seen at this link. \nA full playthrough of a 1-player game can be seen at this link. \nBristol 1350 is Volume 4 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. Each game accommodates at least 2-9 players. \nGames in the Dark Cities Series have already sold over 150,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 5, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! Each of these games is available in certain reward levels and as add-ons.\nYou can add an unlimited number of copies of any games in the Dark Cities Series to your pledge! Just add the amounts listed above and after the campaign you'll select which extra games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section, post a comment, or shoot us a message. \nYour shipping cost does not increase for add-ons regardless of your location or the amount of extra games you order. You will receive all add-on games at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery April 2021).  \nThe 18 original character paintings by Sarah Keele are available to purchase! The paintings are 8 x 10 inches and made with mixed media acrylic on masonite board. You can see some of the intricate details below. Email sarahmkeele@gmail.com for more details or to check availability of a specific character.    \nThough this is not an add-on you can get through the campaign, the people at Next Level Board Gaming are selling 3D-printer files so that you can create an EPIC 3D version of the Bristol 1350 board that you can use with your copy of the game. You can see more details by clicking the picture below.\nRegardless of order size or add-ons, shipping costs are $6 USA, $8 UK/EU, $10 Australia/Canada, $12 for the rest of the world. We work hard to find the best shipping rates out there, and we subsidize some of the shipping costs so that you don't have to pay as much. \nTo avoid extra VAT or customs fees, games will ship to depots around the world (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) before being shipped to you. For non-depot countries, in most cases there will not be extra VAT costs because the price of our games is low enough to avoid the duties threshold.\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. Due to unreliable mail systems, we will not perform reshipments destined for Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, or South Africa. \nThese days there are many projects that wait to charge shipping until AFTER the campaign ends in order to shift the risk from the creators to the backers. We have \"done our homework\" in regards to shipping costs and are prepared to take on unexpected risk. What you pay now for shipping is ALL that you will pay for this reward.\nDISCOUNTED PRICE | Normal MSRP of the Standard Edition will be $25. If we release the Deluxe Edition to the public it will be at least $45. We also offer the best shipping prices we can during the Kickstarter campaign.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE CARDS | The 9 Kickstarter Exclusive character cards (for a total of 18 characters in your game) will never be available again and will be unavailable to the public. Additionally, campaign stretch goals, as well as the Deluxe version, are only guaranteed through Kickstarter.\nEARLY ACCESS | Receive and play the game before anyone else in the world. \nJOIN OUR TEAM | Get first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We will take your feedback into account before launching production.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem, back in 2015. Those backers are the ones that allowed us to quit our day jobs and make games full time. We've had more great experiences with the launch of Tortuga 1667 and Deadwood 1876. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community is incredible. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.\nOur thoughts are with those around the world suffering from Covid-19. We have been planning and preparing for this launch for over two years, but it has coincidentally lined up with the pandemic that our world now faces. We considered delaying the project but after a lot of thought and encouragement from our community we ultimately decided to launch. As with all our games, part of this game's purpose is to educate about the history of the world. Bristol 1350 explores the history of the worst pandemic our world has ever faced: the Black Death. The people of 1350 faced huge challenges, and today those challenges are perhaps more relatable than ever. We will be donating $3,000 from our own pockets to Action Against Hunger to assist in getting food and medicine for those most in need. (Per Kickstarter regulations, funds raised within Kickstarter will not be directly donated and have no effect on the donation amount).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th project, and our first 3 have been delivered on time and as promised. Our factory is at full capacity and our shipping partners are optimistic that by next year when this is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues in regards to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated on any unforeseen issues that may arise. As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! \n\nSalem 1692: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kickstarter. Thank you again!\" -Bored Gamer\n\nDeadwood 1876: \"Thank you again for such a wonderful campaign and game! All your games are creative, refreshing, and each have unique mechanics that keep the fun going for hours. The historical component too makes for an added boon. Thank you also for a unique genuineness you bring to your customer experience. It is a prize how you answer each customer individually and how you care about the quality of your interactions as much as you care about the quality of your product and gameplay. I\u2019m excited for the fourth city and experience!\" -Steph Troyer\n\nAfter the campaign we will use a pledge manager system called CrowdOx to send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account.

As so many of us worry about the future and yearn to return to the glorious spring unfolding outside our quarantined windows, we're excited to bring you our newest, most enchanted project...\n\nCreated by illustrator Kevin Jay Stanton, this 78-card deck features traditional paintings rooted in classical tarot interpretations that delve into the lore and mythology of the plant kingdom.\nFor over five hundred years, humans have used Tarot cards as a tool for divination and meditation. Their archetypal symbols have mystical, philosophical and psychological implications that allow us to understand our past, our future, and ourselves. But even older than that is the symbolism we've always assigned to the plants that grow around us. Hermetic, alchemical and scientific traditions explore flowers as tools for making meaning, medicine and magic. \nBOTANICA marries the tradition of Tarot to a lexicon far more ancient: the natural vocabulary of life on Earth. \n\nBOTANICA takes all of the major and minor arcana of traditional Tarot and reinvents them in the language of flowers. The Queen of Swords is Red Oleander. The Hermit is a Chinese Lantern. The High Priestess is the Elderflower. The Devil is Nightshade.\n\nThe deck features  the complete set of 78 Tarot cards, illustrated with acrylic and ink paintings. The Major Arcana are defined by single plants and flowers, and the Minor Arcana are plants combined with the objects from their suit, with regalia on the court cards.\nThe cards are 3.25\" x 4.15\", printed on premium heavyweight card stock and emblazoned on the back with gold foil. Each deck will come with a booklet naming the plants and objects on each card, and explaining the symbolic meanings of each card. \nThe set comes in three editions: THE HERBALIST, THE ALCHEMIST, and THE ENCHANTER. The details of each set are listed further down.\nDivination is the process of finding meaning in symbols or patterns, and similarly the act of reading tarot is finding patterns, meaning and visions in the symbols. A larger picture is created when a story is formed from how one card interacts with the next, as a bouquet is created from the harmony between many flowers.\nBOTANICA can be read in many ways, depending on what you\u2019d like to get out of it. To start, you\u2019ll want to familiarize yourself with the deck. Light a candle, play some evocative music, and think about how you respond to the cards you\u2019ve drawn. Without looking at the meanings, what\u2019s the first card that really resonates with you? What plant strikes a chord in you on first sight? \n After you know the deck a bit better, it\u2019s ready for use. Plants have always been a foundational part of how we treat our bodies, and Tarot can be a tool to help sort our thoughts. Consider drawing a card in the morning to guide you throughout the day. Ponder a question and draw three cards to meditate on the foundation of a problem, what it looks like currently, and how to handle it in the future. Or lay out a full ten-card spread and really get to the root of it all. \nHere is a small sampling of the cards included in the deck, with notes from their creator.\n\n\nTHE LOVERS represents emotional decisions and the union between independent and equal partners. I chose peonies because they have flamboyant blooms that are \"perfect flowers\" -- a botanical term for flowers with both reproductive parts --  and for the generosity they exhibit in their symbiotic relationship with ants. I think it\u2019s important for modern decks to capture the essence of The Lovers, and for me it\u2019s about people being their whole selves and sharing that with others, the way peonies share their dew with ants and are protected from predators in turn.\n Like the floating seeds of a dandelion, THE FOOL sets out on their journey full of hope and with the promise of new growth. It\u2019s a common plant, almost ubiquitous, and carries with it a naive quality I find appealing - I love the idea of making a wish by blowing on its seeds.\nTarot is sometimes described as the journey of the Fool through the deck. That\u2019s why I picked a weed that could weather all of that and still come out on the other side with a feeling of charm and whimsy to be the major symbol of Botanica.\nTHE SEVEN OF WANDS is represented by Datura, or Thorn Apple -- a highly poisonous species of flowering shrubs pollinated by bats. I picked it for this card because the Seven of Wands is about being ready for a battle and having the endurance to see it through, and the fruit of datura reputedly have the ability to heal wounds as much as they can cause harm.\nI picked Japanese vajra (a Buddhist ritual object) for the wands because they\u2019re a symbol of enlightenment that embodies the balance between the five poisons to one\u2019s purity and the five wisdoms that help one attain it.\n\nTHE FOUR OF COINS is a card is about being trapped by comfort. Honeysuckle bears flowers with a sweet aroma that wafts through the summer air, attracting all manner of creatures. It can be an extremely invasive species, and in those cases its vines can take over native plants and literally choke them. The Four of Coins is a warning to avoid excess, to take time to smell the flowers.\nThe coin symbol I picked for this card is wampum, a beaded Native American currency, as the Common Honeysuckle is a species native to the eastern coast of North America. The shells of this protocurrency were harvested off the coast and prized as much for their value as decoration. Their beautiful swirls of purple and white were often woven into belts by tribes like the Iroquois.\n Here are the  three editions in which we're publishing BOTANICA.\n\nThe standard BOTANICA deck will include all 78 cards, and a booklet explaining the symbolic meaning of each card and each plant. Each deck comes in a sturdy tuckbox, blocked with gold foil.  Everything you need to read fortunes in the flowers.\n ***SOLD OUT***\nTHE ALCHEMIST is a collectible version of BOTANICA, limited to an edition of two hundred fifty.

Between our various ventures, we have raised nearly a million dollars on Kickstarter, and rewarded backers of every campaign with many beautiful books and other rewards.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money and how much work are required to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job. To be honest, our biggest risk is that in these turbulent times people won't have the funds to spend on art projects like these.\n\nStill, there are more risks and challenges involved in making things with such high production values than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. Problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict. (For instance, despite our considerable epidemiological expertise, we didn't see this global pandemic coming.)

We're Fred Schroeder & Dave Kellett: Directors of the award-winning comics documentary STRIPPED. That Kickstarter-backed film got to #1 on iTunes, and featured the first-ever interview with Calvin & Hobbes creator Bill Watterson. And today, we'd like to talk to you about a new interview series focusing on comics and animation called Story/Line.\nStory/Line will be a love-letter to the art of cartooning, featuring in-depth, thoughtful interviews about the craft. These will be deep conversations, in the style of a PBS or BBC interview. Each will be beautifully shot in 4K, with one of the best crews in Los Angeles. Among our four Kickstarted interviews, we've already scheduled with Academy Award-winning Directors Chris Miller & Phil Lord (Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie, and every other great movie from the last decade), Eisner-Winning cartoonist Scott McCloud (The Sculptor, Understanding Comics, 24-Hour Comics Day), and the Eisner-Winning cartoonist Raina Telgemeier (Smile, Sisters, Guts)!  \nWe're still booking guests for STORY/LINE. And like we did with STRIPPED, we're actively reaching out to a diverse variety of creators for this first season, and the hoped-for seasons to come!\nAs you can imagine, shooting at television quality and paying our crew and artists what they rightfully deserve costs *cough-cough* a big chunk o' change. We've already conducted an interview with Jake Parker (Skyheart / Inktober), and a secret BONUS interview (see reward tiers, below!) -- so we've been able to METICULOUSLY budget the costs for four more episodes. Have a look: \nAnd here's the really good news: If this Kickstarter allows us to make this first mini-season of Story/Line, we're hoping it lays the groundwork for ongoing seasons with many more interviews! \n Here's a quick guide to help you decide what rewards you'd like for backing the project! \n This Kickstarter is about the production of delightful, downloadable interviews -- so every reward will be getting that in one shape or another. But in addition to those episodes, higher tiers will also be receiving awesome items such as...\nFred Schroeder is an award-winning film-maker, with thousands of hours of TV, film, and commercial experience here in Los Angeles and around the world. He's been nominated for Best Cinematography at Sundance, and is insufferable about it. \nDave Kellett is the Eisner-nominated cartoonist behind Drive and Sheldon, the co-director of Stripped, and the co-host of the weekly comics podcast ComicLab. He also holds two Masters degree in the history of comics, which prepared him for LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE BUT DOING THIS SHOW. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKeeping in mind that Story/Line will be produced by just artists, not a huge studio, there are two potential risks worth mentioning...\n\nCOST: We've already shot two \"test\" interviews for this project out of our own checkbooks, and therefore have a pretty meticulous breakdown of our costs. So, while filmed projects are notorious for unforeseen/unexpected costs, we believe we've safely projected what we'll need to complete the project as planned.\n\nSCHEDULE: While there is always a risk that unforeseen production delays could occur, we are committed to making Story/Line. As we imagine, in the worst-case that this or that final interview gets delayed, we'll still be able to release the already-shot-and-edited episodes as we go.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sequential Films\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nDirector Fred Schroeder is a Sundance-nominated filmmaker.

He presented it as a collection of found documents --  correspondence, newspaper articles, journal entries -- painstakingly transcribed and compiled into the published book by his characters themselves. His experimental approach brings you directly into the story, and refracts it through countless points of view.\nDRACULA: The Evidence is an entirely new way to experience Stoker's masterpiece: through an actual physical research file full of ephemera, correspondence, clues and artifacts. It's the entire original text of Dracula, presented as a gorgeously designed and curated briefcase full of maps, letters, diaries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, and phonograph records. We've teamed up with Dracula expert and Bram's descendent Dacre Stoker to bring you the most immersive way imaginable to experience this modernist masterpiece of gothic horror.\n In our edition, you are not merely a reader \u2013 you are an explorer making your way through this archive of first-hand evidence, retracing this nightmarish story through the remnants it left behind: correspondence, charts and diagrams, memoranda, artifacts, photographs and much more.

Offset printed on fine archival uncoated paper. \nBorn in Ireland in 1847, ABRAHAM \"BRAM\" STOKER studied mathematics at Dublin's Trinity College and embarked on his longtime role as an assistant to actor Sir Henry Irving in the 1870s. He also began carving out a second career as a writer, publishing his first novel, The Primrose Path, in 1875. During this period, Stoker was part of the literary staff of The Daily Telegraph in London, and he wrote other fiction as well.\nStoker visited the English coastal town of Whitby in 1890, and that visit was said to be part of the inspiration for Dracula. Before writing Dracula, Stoker met \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, a Hungarian writer and traveller. Dracula likely emerged from V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry's dark stories of the Carpathian mountains. Stoker then spent several years researching European folklore and mythological stories of vampires.\nIn 1897, Stoker published his masterpiece, Dracula. While the book garnered critical success after its release, it didn't achieve peak popularity until well after its author's death.\nDACRE STOKER is the great grand-nephew of Bram Stoker and the international best-selling co-author of Dracula the Un-Dead (2009), the official Stoker family endorsed sequel to Dracula. Dacre is also the co-editor (with Elizabeth Miller) of The Lost Journal of Bram Stoker: The Dublin Years (2012). His latest novel, Dracul, a prequel to Dracula, released in October 2018, was co-authored with JD Barker and has been sold to Putnam in North America, Penguin Random House in the UK, and additional publishers in France, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Brazil, Serbia, Taiwan, Turkey, Vietnam, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Portugal, and Poland with film rights purchased by Paramount Studios.\nA native of Montreal, Canada, Dacre taught Physical Education and Sciences for twenty-two years, in both Canada and the U.S. He has participated in the sport of Modern Pentathlon as an athlete and a coach at the international and Olympic levels for Canada for 12 years. He is also an avid player and coach of the unique game of Real Tennis. In May of 2016 an athlete he has been coaching for the past 4 years, Camden Riviere, won the World Championships of Court Tennis. He currently lives in Aiken, SC, and together with his wife Jenne they manage the Bram Stoker Estate.\nHEADCASE DESIGN is an award-winning graphic design and illustration studio located in Philadelphia that specializes in publishing. Paul Kepple is its founder, owner, creative director, and lead designer. Paul and his team at Headcase have created ambitious and richly elaborate designs that immerse readers in the diverse worlds of Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, Twin Peaks, The Sopranos, and J.J. Abrams\u2019s and Doug Dorst's meta-novel S. They\u2019ve designed behind-the-scenes books for the hit Broadway shows Hamilton, Wicked, and Dear Evan Hansen, cinematic properties like Harry Potter and Star Wars, and art-centric biographies for music legends Geddy Lee of Rush, Courtney Love, and Eminem. In 2012, Headcase co-authored and illustrated the darkly humorous Zombie Tarot, which put Paul\u2019s vast knowledge of b-movies to good use and has sold over 40,000 copies. Their lavish touch is obvious in the artist monographs The Temple of Silence: Forgotten Works & Worlds of Herbert Crowley and MADNESS IN CROWDS: The Teeming Mind of Harrison Cady, both designed for Beehive Books. Their work has been recognized by AIGA, American Illustration, the Art Director\u2019s Club of New York, Communication Arts, Graphis, How, Print, and was an nominated for an Eisner Award.\nPaul is a life-long horror movie fanatic and Dracula enthusiast, and has spent many a childhood afternoon obsessively seeking out every Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee incarnation in existence. He is very much looking forward to his biggest challenge yet \u2014 bringing new blood and a fresh take to Bram Stoker\u2019s immortal classic.\nS: Produced by Melcher Media, published by Hachette Book Group, product photos by Sam Fritch\nStranger Things: Produced by Melcher Media, published by Del Rey, product photos by Oskar Kalinowski\nZombie Tarot: Published by Quirk Books\nBEEHIVE BOOKS is a Philadelphia-based boutique press founded by the artist and designer Ma\u00eblle Doliveux and author and editor Josh O\u2019Neill.

At present, the union has made it clear that they do not ask for a boycott neither on behalf of creators nor backers (and it is a possibility that a boycott would actually be harmful to the union at this stage).\nAs we are a very small company currently completely reliant on the Kickstarter model, we have decided to proceed with launching this campaign. We understand our backers\u2019 decisions whether they decide to participate in our projects at this time or not, though we urge you to keep supporting small companies like ourselves and marginalized creators of all kinds who can only find backing outside of traditional publishing and fundraising platforms.\nNo form of collective action would disrupt our commitment to fulfilling all rewards for each of our ongoing projects.\n[Video production by Easton Carter Angle and Calvin Woodruff. You should hire them, they are amazing.]", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs the veterans of nearly dozen fully funded and fulfilled Kickstarter campaigns, Beehive Books founders Josh O\u2019Neill and Ma\u00eblle Doliveux know well the challenges associated with funding, printing, and distributing beautiful oversized art books. Between our various ventures, we have raised nearly a million dollars on Kickstarter, and rewarded backers of every campaign with very beautiful books and rewards.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all books, prints and ancillary rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money we need to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job. In fact, with such a substantial funding goal, the biggest danger is simply that we'll fall short of our ambitious aims.\n\nStill, there are more risks and challenges involved in making books with this level of production value than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. This is the most elaborate project we've ever undetaken, and problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict.

Specifically, this book is about the incredible diversity of people who were part of the American West.

Originally printed in 1919, the Daisy Deck and Nifty Deck were created by Theodore DeLand. In honor of their 100th anniversary, we have recreated these ingenious decks from the ground up.\nWe have teamed up with renowned magician, graphic designer, and marked deck expert, Phill Smith (creator of the DMC ELITES) to create these stunning Centennial Editions. These are not simply reprints - each deck has been painstakingly redrawn and enhanced with new art and new features.\nThe Centennial Edition decks will never be reprinted and are offered here in a \"Classic Edition\" as well as a \"Collector's Edition\". When and if we pass a stretch goal of $25,000 we will print an UNMARKED \"Gambler's Edition\" of the decks.\nTheodore DeLand was a genius creator and innovator in the magic world. DeLand lived from 1873 to 1931. Before departing this world, he left behind an enormous collection of mind-boggling creations. His best-known work is the \"Dollar Deck\", a groundbreaking marked deck of cards.\nFew are aware that DeLand actually created many marked deck designs in addition to countless magic tricks. Originally offered in 1919, the Daisy Deck and Nifty Deck appear to be simple, innocent cards at first glance - but each deck holds many secrets waiting to be decoded.\nEach deck has a full-bleed borderless back design that looks right at home on the poker table. We have meticulously recreated each design to be faithful to the original, while making small changes to make the decks more useful for the modern performer. \nTo offer them as a complimentary pair, the Daisy Deck has been designed in a deep Burgundy and the Nifty Deck is dark Blue.\nNot only is each deck marked to tell you the Suit & Value of every card, but there are other secret marks as well. We have expanded upon the core design originally created by DeLand and taken it a step further. In the Centennial Edition, each deck has OVER 500 MARKS in total. A quick glance at any card back will tell you the identity of not just one, but THREE different cards, as well as how many cards are left in a pile.\nEvery deck comes with an instruction card that will teach you how to decode the markings. The systems are hard to detect but are simple to learn and can be mastered with moderate practice. All backers will also receive a video download that teaches the marking system and the special stack order.\nThe tuck boxes feature all-new, 100% custom designs. The Classic Edition tucks will be printed with ink on a traditional stock. The Collector's Edition decks will have their tuck stock upgraded to a natural Kraft paper and will have the design stamped in foil.\nEach tuck delivers a vintage vibe that has been elevated with a touch of modern elegance. We have happily unlocked our Custom Seal stretch goals. So now ALL versions of the deck will have custom sticker seals!\nClassic Edition Seals (Render)\nWe absolutely LOVE vintage card faces. Both the Daisy Deck and Nifty Deck have gorgeous custom faces based on designs from the early 20th century.\nThe faces have been completely redrawn for modern printing, but fully capture the essence of vintage designs, including subtle asymmetry and small imperfections. \nThe Ace of Spades and Jokers are faithful recreations of DeLand's classics.\nHave you ever tried to fan or shuffle a 100-year-old deck of cards? It's not easy! Manufacturing techniques have improved immeasurably since the original 1919 decks, so one of the biggest upgrades that the DeLand Centennial offers over the originals is the handling quality.\nWe will be printing with the US Playing Card Company on a Classic stock with top-of-the-line coating for the ultimate performance for magic, games, cardistry, and more. The decks will be traditionally cut. This means that the cards are cut from face to back, which creates a minuscule yet important edge bevel that aids in executing card moves flawlessly.\nIn addition to the Classic Edition, we have created a limited Collector's Edition. The Collector's Edition decks will have special tucks made from Kraft paper and imprinted with foil, lovingly produced by the masters at Clove St Press.\nCollector's Edition Seals (Render)\nThe Collector decks also come in an exclusive 2-deck Kraft storage box with gold foil. Since we have passed our stretch goal, the Collector Decks will also have custom, individually-numbered seals.\nThe Collector's Edition is strictly limited to only 500 sets ever produced.\nWhen we reach a stretch goal of $17,000 or higher, we will also add gold gilding to the edges of the Collector's Edition decks. This is an exquisite addition that increases the beauty and the value of the Collector's Edition decks.\nWhen and if we reach a stretch goal of $20,000 we will produce a beautiful 2\" Commemorative Coin, which will be available as an add-on.\nWhen we reach a $25,000 stretch goal, we will unlock an UNMARKED version of the DeLand Centennial decks. This \"Gambler's Edition\" will have the same great-looking tuck box and vintage faces of the Classic Edition decks, but the backs will be entirely unmarked and suitable for game play.\nGambler's Edition Custom Seals (Only produced if $25,000 Stretch is Reached)\nThe decks will also come in a standard new deck order instead of in a special stack. They will not be available in Stripper Deck versions. All of these features make them 100% suitable for life at the poker table.\nMany of DeLand's original decks also had a \"Stripper Deck\" feature built in. This is where the cards have a slightly tapered shape to assist in several magic effects. We know that today's buyers may or may not want that option by default, so we are offering the Centennial Edition decks WITHOUT the Stripper Deck element built in by default.\nFor those who would like a Stripper Deck version, they can be purchased as an add-on. Simply increase your total pledge amount by $20 for each deck. The DeLand Centennial stripper decks will be factory die-cut and are perfect for beginners and pros alike.\n\nAdditional add-ons include Classic Edition decks as singles or by the dozen, as well as uncut sheets. Uncut sheets are decks that have been taken off the printing presses and sent out before being cut apart. They are great for framing and are a wonderful addition to your game room, office, or magic room.\nTo add-on any item, you do not need to change your primary pledge level. Simply add the desired dollar amount of your add-on to your total pledge. For example, if you are in the US and have pledged for the $40 Collector's Set and would like to add an uncut sheet, you would pledge $40 for the main level, add $5 for shipping, and $25 for the uncut sheet, bringing your total pledge to $70.\nYou will specify your add-ons in your BackerKit survey after the campaign has ended.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked with our artist, Phill Smith, many times before.

We are Peter Dunham and Linnea Gits, partners in the design & art studio, Uusi and we are thrilled you've stopped by to check out our Kickstarter project!\nMateria Prima: An Expression of Matter is a deck based on the Periodic Table with artwork that has been hand-inked, then burned to plate to be letterpress printed and finally, finished with hand screened color. The final pieces of artwork will be scanned and then sent off to our card printer to become a beautiful deck of cards.  \nThis is a very ambitious production process but we love the unique quality each one of these traditional techniques lends to the final artwork. It is the human hand in each of these art forms that responds to the human journey we are on. A journey filled with imperfections and emotional lines that arise organically to form something unique, creative and spiritual in the world.  We hope you agree and join us on this endeavor to bring Materia Prima to life!\n\"Materia Prima: An Expression of Matter\" by Uusi\nMateria Prima: An Expression of Matter  And so it is, all things in life are collective. Nature is inescapably cooperative. We share with the stars, the clouds, the bees and each other the same elements that created the complex world we live in. This cooperative endeavor is what forms life and is the bewitching mystery of the periodic table \u2013 the Materia Prima of our unified existence.\nThis powerful message of unification that circles throughout the Table of Elements is what inspired us to create 'Materia Prima: An Expression of Matter.'  This deck is an expression of the periodic table concentrated in 84 cards.  Each chosen element is given its part in the cosmic drama of Life, conjuring matter in the soulful, playful language of the imagination.  \nWhen creating this deck we thought of the periodic table as a fantastic play with all the elements cast as characters who would bring their particular wisdom and connectivity to life.  We wanted to be playful with the content, yet still try to capture the scientific truths about each one in hope that this deck could be used as a meditation tool that helps us to integrate matter in all its diversity with our day to day lives \u2013 to look at matter as a force of love that unites us all.\nSince we are breaking new ground here by introducing the periodic table as a meditation tool there really are no past rules or guidebooks to pull from. Essentially, we see this deck as a type of oracle/tarot deck that rounds out your spiritual practice by asking you to concentrate on the nuances of physical matter that surround and move us through the world and create a true picture of ourselves in our wholeness.  \nFor example: Say you drew the element card, radon as part of your daily mediation. What kind of meaning could come from this card to illuminate a question or thought for the day?  Don't worry \u2013 you can actually learn to love radon!  Below is the radon card and an excerpt on it from our book.\nFor radon we chose to create a still, mountainous character who was formed by a fiery, volcanic process which has, over time, cooled and solidified into a noble and self sufficient presence. A bit removed and almost unreachable in its serene composure, radon has tempered the magma of its birth with an iron will allowing it to thrive in what most would consider lonely, inhospitable realms.  True leaders are formed from this process, but so are assassins.  In its heart, radon knows it carries a heavy poison. Fully understood it can be called in for good when you need the strength of poison to kill a poison. Misunderstood it is simply lethal.  \nMateria Prima: The deck where All is One.  Science, that famous institution, pitched its tent long ago on sacred, dreaming ground and stole the show with its arrival. What an attack on the senses and nerves the business of science caused us at first \u2013 and then, what amazing delight as its fantastic discoveries unrolled one after the other before our astonished, newly awakened  eyes.  \nWe gaped at the wondrous experimentation, creative exploration and determined calculations of the scientific players who brought the periodic table into being. Elements were pulled from matter one by one. It was a revelation. An authenticated encounter with life's mysteries. Secrets of our universe were blown like kisses to us from the smiling lips of knowledgeable and highly exacting performers \u2013 first the alchemists and then scientists \u2013 whose discoveries tested the extreme limits of our human understanding. \nBut this was not a light drama that science was dabbling in, it was a dangerous and daring jump with many possible lethal outcomes and along the way we all became involved in the fatal risks of this play. We have gone from onlookers to accomplices, each taking our own part in this dizzying, planetary, alchemical performance that has been raised to extreme heights.  \nAnd here we are at the breath-taking-build-up to the next act.  A unique but mostly confused band of players in this universe, trying desperately to save our own necks from the monsters of insanity we've unleashed. How do we avoid the unthinkable \u2013 the extravagantly stupid ending?  How do all the splendid forms of life that began this ancient play as glittering, silvery butterflies in a universal dream reinvent themselves yet again after being exposed and often dangerously rearranged in our everyday life? How do we learn to love all of this world again \u2013 every piece of it including ourselves  \u2013 so we can save not only our own necks, but the entire perfection of life that surrounds us?\nWhat if we thought of the elements \u2013 all the matter of this world \u2013 as one of us? Cavorting hybrids \u2013 part human and part granular, atomic expression \u2013 that captures our mind and body as well as our heart. What if we looked at all matter using our souls. Could we still speak with straight forward authority about it? Would science listen? We think it would not only listen, but tell us frankly,  it is time. \n**Excerpt from the introduction of \"Materia Prima: A Reflection On Matter\", a book for this deck by Uusi.\n First Edition Book with notes on each element written by Linnea Gits. Black and white images of illustrations by Peter Dunham.  The book cover will be printed on a subtle, metallic paper (shown above).

Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward and which reward tier you have chosen. Unfortunately, a one size fits all price isn't manageable. You will pay for shipping in our Pledge Manager, which you will receive links to shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nDependant on your pledge, the product will potentially be a multi-mailer, quite large and heavy (base product approx. 15lbs), resulting in relatively high shipping fees. The weight of the product may also increase slightly based on unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping costs as currently estimated:\nBase Product Only\nNorth America\nUS:  US$30\nCanada: US$30\nEurope\nUK: US$95\nIreland: US$95\nOceania\nAustralia: US$65\nNew Zealand: US$65\n\n----------------------------\nTimelines\nOur current estimation for shipping is October 2019. We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay. Rest assured we will communicate with you throughout the process so you are kept up-to-date.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMissing/Damaged Products\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing, please contact us at the email provided upon checkout and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible.\nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all items and email them to the email provided upon checkout. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible.\n\nUndelivered Items\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), we will not be held accountable nor will we resend another package. If the package is not delivered due to a postal service fault we will resend the experience.\n\nDelivery Address\nWhen this campaign is over, you will be requested to complete a survey in our pledge manager through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order. Keep in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated delivery date. Please give us an address that will surely not change (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house in January, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery).\n\nOrder Fulfillment\nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. \n\nDeadline for certain pledge levels\nGiven the nature of this product we will need to set strict deadlines for receiving collaborative material from pledgers. We will inform you of these deadlines once the Kickstarter has been finalised. Failure to submit by the deadline will exclude you from the personalized aspect of the experience.    \n\nUpdates\nThrough this campaign you may receive updates on The Mysterious Package Company's other upcoming projects.\nEven though this is a Kickstarter our terms and conditions do still apply.

The name \"Grandville\" was his \u2018grandparents' professional stage name. Grandville received his first instruction in drawing from his father, a painter of miniatures.  \n   At the age of twentyone he moved to Paris, and soon afterwards published a collection of lithographs. After the reinstitution of prior censorship of caricature in 1835, Grandville turned almost exclusively to book illustration, supplying illustrations for various standard works, such as Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Robinson Crusoe.  \nThis is, how the original books mostly look.. molded and yellowed..\n Though the designs of Grandville are occasionally unnatural and absurd, they usually display keen analysis of character and marvellous inventive ingenuity, and his humour is always tempered and refined by delicacy of sentiment and a vein of sober thoughtfulness. He died on 17 March 1847 in Vanve near Paris. \nPages in my book taken of \"Un autre monde\" / \"Another World\"\n I started collecting books and drawings of Grandville 8 years ago, when i first looked for Vintage Illustrations with animals. I remembered his drawings on several music records like CD covers of Queen. \n\"Un autre monde\" / \"Another world\" / wood & steel engravings\n\"Les fleurs anim\u00e9es\" / \"The Flowers personified\" steel engraving, handcolored\nTaken from the book \"Vie priv\u00e9e at publique des animaux\" / \"Public and Private Life of Animals\"\n\"Vie priv\u00e9e et publique des animaux\" Landscape scenes in large format\n +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nGRANDVILLE POSTER (for more information and the poster-gallery please scroll down)\nMore than 100 Grandville motifs are available as Art Print Poster 50x70 cm, printed on 200g matte Archival Paper in Museum Quality.\n +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nRESTORING & RETOUCHING FROM THE ORIGINAL BOOKS\nI've been working with Grandville Illustrations now for more than 4 years and always tried to get the early, handcolored originals. So all colors in the book are based on the original, handcolored books. Not on later colorations of modern reproductions!\nAll images are restored.

My name is Dakota Cates, but many people will know me on the internet as Wizard of Barge! I'm a full-time illustrator and cool thing-maker from Houston, TX. I've always been inspired by fantasy, monsters, the occult, and basically any weird mysterious forces of the universe! Which brings me to my latest project....\nTHE WIZARD'S TAROT! \nIf you follow me online you probably know I took on this project months ago and it's completely taken over my life. Well I've finally finished it! \nThe Wizard's Tarot is a 78 card full color tarot deck, featuring four suits (56 Minor Arcana), and all 22 Major Arcana, all of which contain the brightest and most epic scenes my brain could conjure up! \nBut wait! This is no ordinary tarot deck, we're gettin' weird! Instead of the standard four suits, (swords, wands, pentacles, and cups) I decided to go a different, and dare I say? More magical route! \nThe suits in the Wizard's Tarot are..\n BEASTS! \n That's right! A whole 14 card suit dedicated to the creatures that crawl in my head! This suit is meant to replace the traditional suit of wands!\n CURSES! \nOh boy, if you remember my zine \"Black Magic For Dummies\" you'll know this one is right up my alley! Spells, ghosts, hexes, oh my! This suit is meant to replace the traditional suit of cups!\n CULTS! \n It's always been a dream of mine to be the leader of a cult. Not a mean or evil one, but like, maybe one where all you watch is cartoons and live in a castle made of slime. This suit is meant to replace the traditional suit of coins / pentacles!\n AND FINALLY.. SWORDS? \nYeah I know I said I had new suits, but like, swords are cool and we need to accept that. Don't make me stab you!\nSo those are the suits! But don't fret, I didn't create an entire new set of guidelines based around you getting cursed or eaten by a beast. You simply just use the traditional translations through my outlandish artwork! \nI decided to stray away from most of the usual symbolism in typical tarot decks in order to mesh with my art style and create the most imaginative, fun, strange world that I could. Although I have monsters and cults and kind of dark subject matter, this is a very bright and fun deck made up of kooky characters in imaginary worlds that I love. Nothing more nothing less!  Immerse yourself in the weird!!\nThe cards will measure traditional Tarot card size at 2.75in x 4.75in (70mm x 121mm). The deck will be printed on 300gsm smooth cardstock, shrink wrapped, and delivered in a custom matching tuck box featuring a devilishly handsome wizard! Also the cards feature a reversible back design so you'll never know the orientation of the card until flipped over!\n*UPGRADED* Since we went way over goal I'm upgrading every deck to come with a fancy, sturdier 2 piece box instead of the aforementioned tuckbox, NOW IT'S LIKE, 6% COOLER!!!\nTHE PRINTS!\nI wanted to keep the rewards for this fairly simple since the main goal is just to create the tarot deck, but I did want to make a couple new prints for backers to get their hands on!   \nThese babies are epic! Goblins? Dragons? Wizards? Unicorns? I mean, come on!! I had a blast making these and think they look great together, so there is a reward for just the prints, or one with the prints and deck included (recommended for maximum magical sorcery) Frame these babies up and they'll conjure a magic force-field of radness around your home!  *PS: i am not liable if someone breaks through the force-field and burgles your home, lock that door dummy!* Each print measures 5x7!\n THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \nAnd at long last every single backer will also receive one of these 5.5 x 2.14 stickers to proudly show your allegiance with wizards, witches and warlocks everywhere! \nThanks so much for looking/backing this project! It's been a huge work in progress and I'm really stoked to finally make it a reality. Whether you're a tarot collector, a fan of my artwork, or you're just lost and got this mixed up with your grandmother's gofundme page, thank you for the support!\nYou can keep up with my artwork and see more of the cards I'll be posting throughout the campaign here on my Instagram!

WELL, apparently something went wrong in the process of dyeing the edges having to do with the specifics of the gloss coating that we did. I used a very highly reviewed printer that has made some amazing products in the past but I guess there's no escaping the chaos lords and their reign of havoc.  They caught the issue pretty quickly and suspended printing until they notified me but my options were to restart printing from the beginning since all the decks already had the gloss coat or to just reprint the decks that were messed up and continue without black edges. I didn't want to keep you or I waiting any longer to restart printing so I went ahead and continued without the black edges.

We will be announcing a new milestone reward every day during this project and every copy of Terraforming Mars: Turmoil sent out to backers of this project will include all these milestone rewards. \nNote that anything marked with these symbols are: \nPromo - An item that Kickstarter backers will get in their rewards, and will not be included in the retail edition of Terraforming Mars: Turmoil. These items may be released at a future date as promotional materials and/or game expansions.\nPromo items from this project will be available in the future from all the partners participating in this project, and from all the partners not participating. There is nothing in this project that is exclusive to pledging for this project. Each partner that makes Terraforming Mars will determine how they will distribute promos in their languages after the project ends.  \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the biggest and most strategic expansion for the best selling tile placement and card drafting game, Terraforming Mars.  The base game of Terraforming Mars is required to use this expansion. For more information about Terraforming Mars: Turmoil, we encourage you to read our draft rulebook here.\nIf you are not familiar with Terraforming Mars, we suggest that you watch this great video to learn the rules. You can also read the complete game rules here.\nPlease note that Terraforming Mars: Turmoil should be considered an EXPERT expansion. This expansion adds a distinct, new level of play as players vie for control of the Terraforming Council, as well as plan for the Global Events.  This expansion will appeal to those who want to play a more expansive game of Terraforming Mars.\nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the 49th project from the combined teams behind Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards, & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 48 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil was designed by the talented Jacob Fryxelius, and developed by the Fryxelius brothers of FryxGames. This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the fifth expansion that takes players back to Mars for the struggle to control and progress human society. \nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $34 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just four easy steps: \n Step 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \n Step 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \n Step 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing!\n Step 4: Shortly after the projects ends on May 5th, we will send you a link to our pledge manager. This is where we will get your shipping information and which language versions of the game you would like to receive.\nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Stronghold Games on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more!  \nStronghold Games is excited to offer retailer packages on the English Language editions of Turmoil for Brick and Mortar stores. Many of our partners are also offering retailer packages for their language editions as well.\nFor more information, please email us at: retailers@indieboardsandcards.com or contact your local language partner directly.\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping and sales taxes are very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a discount on ALL shipping and taxes, but there is no free shipping. Shipping & Taxes charges will be added after Kickstarter ends, every backer will be responsible for paying these fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please see shipping & taxes chart below: \nFor the US, Canada, UK, EU, Brazil, Japan, Thailand and Korea we have included applicable taxes, your rewards will be sent Duty Free from within your region \u2013 there will not be any additional customs charge. Outside of the US, Canada, UK and the EU, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a pledge nor will we pay those fees. In case a package is returned or destroyed due to non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled. \nStronghold Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and all other countries not listed below.\nMINDOK has full responsibility for rewards sent to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nMaldito has full responsibility for rewards sent to Spain, Mexico, and Latin America except Brazil.\nIntrafin has full responsibility for rewards sent to France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Swizterland.\nGhenos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Italy.\nMeeple BR Jogos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Portugal and Brazil.\nReflexshop has full responsibility for rewards sent to Hungary.\nFryxGames has full responsibility for rewards sent to the EU countries not listed above & Norway.\nKorea Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Korea.\nArclight has full responsibility for rewards sent to Japan.\nSiam Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Thailand. \n MARS ATTACKS: (Pledge $34 or more) One copy of Terraforming Mars: Turmoil including all of the milestones from this campaign.

We will post an update to notify backers when the pledge manager email is being sent out. At that time, you\u2019ll need to manage your pledge and enter your shipping address and complete your order. You will be able to select the language for your games in the pledge manager.\nOur plan is to have Terraforming Mars: Turmoil available at Essen. While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out around the time of Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.  \nIf you want Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \nTurmoil and all the milestones will be available in Essen \u2013 your support is very valuable to Stronghold Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.

Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Terraforming Mars: Turmoil will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards, & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nStronghold Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and all other countries not listed below.\nMINDOK has full responsibility for rewards sent to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nMaldito has full responsibility for rewards sent to Spain, Mexico, and Latin America except Brazil.\nIntrafin has full responsibility for rewards sent to France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Swizterland.\nGhenos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Italy.\nBR Jugos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Portugal and Brazil.\nReflexshop has full responsibility for rewards sent to Hungary.\nFryxGames has full responsibility for rewards sent to the EU countries not listed above & Norway.\nKorea Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Korea.\nArclight has full responsibility for rewards sent to Japan.\nSiam Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Thailand.\n\nART ASSETS\nSome of the cards shown have not been finalized.

Icebergs, Weeds, Chimneys, and Birds replace the standard playing card suits of clubs, diamonds, spades, and hearts, in keeping with the themes of the deck.  \nFine Art edition, lava flow and floodplain editions\nThe POKER DECK FOR THE DROWNING WORLD invites you to play a game of chance whilst its narrative and imagery reminds you how humanity has gambled with industry, growth and the natural world; or perhaps, you prefer to build a precarious House of Cards, where one card removed causes all the others to change and fall as does the extinction of a species or the disappearance of a glacier change ecosystems and our environment.\nCard Plates, detail from an Eisbergfreistadt panorama\nTHE DROWNING WORLD\u2019s iconography first arose in our body of work EISBERGFREISTADT, a multimedia project we immersed ourselves in from 2006-2010. EISBERGFREISTADT told the tale of an iceberg that broke away from Greenland and, adrift off the coast of Lubeck, Germany, became a \u201cfree trade area\u201d\u2014the Iceberg Free State\u2014during the 1923 hyperinflation. EISBERGFREISTADT\u2019s most elaborate representative iteration took place in a 2010 exhibition at the Overbeck-Gesellschaft Museum in Lubeck, Germany, where we presented photographs, postcards, banknotes, architectural models, period clothing, and marzipan as documentation of a complex society besieged by climate crisis, economic chaos, and the rise of fascism. \nImage of Eisbergfreistadt from our book \"100 Views of the Drowning World\" (Candela Books)\nIn 2006, we started producing an edition of 10 artist-printed, individually hand-painted poker decks for exhibitions around the country at our various Galleries. We soon found  so many people wanted to own the deck that we decided to have a smaller-scale facsimile edition of 2,000 souvenir decks produced by a commercial manufacturer. This first version was very popular and sold out quickly.\nCards from the Fine Art edition have square corners and are unnumbered\nOver the years we\u2019ve received many inquiries about the souvenir poker deck, but rather than simply reprinting it we decided to take it apart and put it back together in a much-improved revised version. We have updated the imagery to be more universal and less tied to the fictional history of EISBERGFREISTADT, and to speak more directly to contemporary climate change. \nFine Art edition backs (commercial version will use a single repeated panel)\nTitrating between the old drawings and computer files and improved iterations of the images, we adapted, redrew, and repainted the cards. The POKER DECK FOR THE DROWNING WORLD eschews the antiqued finish of the first souvenir deck and instead favors a richly saturated, brightly-hued series of images. The commercial version of the deck will have standard English numbers and letters unobtrusively placed in the corners so that the cards can be used for actual card play. To produce the deck we will use the Expert Playing Card Company to ensure faithful reproduction of the original paintings on the best commercial paper stocks available. The deck is regulation poker size.\nKing of Birds, from \"100 Views of the Drowning World\" (Candela Books)\nWe hope to raise $12,000 by April 15 to pay for printing an edition of 3,000\u2014working again with the same printers who made our successful CARNIVAL AT THE END OF THE WORLD TAROT DECK commercial edition.  We estimate they would ship the finished decks to us by July; we would then be able to ship decks and rewards to our supporters in August 2019.\nOriginal design sketches\nAn framed early version of deck\nA Drowning World Book or Carnival Tarot Deck are offered as rewards at certain pledge levels", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Poker Deck of the Drowning World offers a number of risks and challenges for us to solve. We were overwhelmed with so much support and excitement on our last deck and thrilled with all the reviews of the deck when people finally had it in their hands. With our second Kickstarter, we will be more aware of what we did well and what we need to work on, and hopefully with we will be able to get the decks into the hands of our supporters in a more realistic timeframe. Our biggest challenges with our Tarot deck were estimating how long proofing and file preparation would take and thus accurately gauge when we would receive the decks from the printer; getting our shipping costs correctly estimated without a printed deck in our hands; and figuring out how to efficiently address, pack, and ship orders with such a tiny team. We are dedicated to clearly communicating to you all what\u2019s happening, and if there are delays, to be totally transparent about when and why the decks are coming when they are. We had some issues with mailing packages to certain countries, and the loss of decks on route is not something we can inexpensively address as such a small operation, so we are being stricter on which countries we will or will not take orders from with this deck--we don\u2019t want to promise what we can\u2019t easily deliver. We want everyone to get their decks and other rewards as soon as possible so we will be doing everything we can to help make that possible. Balancing trying to make every one of our supporters happy with their rewards while continuing our career as fine artists is perhaps the hardest challenge, but creative solutions and quality control have always been a large part of our job, so delivering a product with really high quality at a price anyone can afford is an exciting challenge that we love solving. We will deliver the best panoramic poker deck this world has seen, and well before the waters rise to drown us all!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "The King of Icebergs and King of Birds", "descp": "Two hand printed 3\" x 5\" cards from the Drowning World poker deck, printed with archival inks on matte paper, with hand cut square corners and marbled back, suitable for framing or placing on your altar.

Click here to see it in high resolution\nWe\u2019re excited to be back on Kickstarter! Our 10th project to date, the Lomogon is a new classic for travel & street photography. Enjoy an exclusive 40% discount on its final retail price. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s unlike any other lens: \nEnhanced Colors, High Contrast & Unique Bokeh: Built to deliver unmistakable pictures by enhancing colors and contrast, the Lomogon is similar to the character of the Lomo LC-A+. Its perfectly round apertures produce one-of-a-kind, circular bokeh \u2013 different from any modern-day lens. \nTravel and Street Photography Optimized: With a 32 mm focal length and a minimum focusing distance of only 0.4 m, the Lomogon allows you to get dramatically close or wonderfully wide. Designed for speed, the dial-styled aperture mechanism goes from f/2.5 to f/11 in a split second \u2013 you won\u2019t ever miss a moment again. \nA Carefully Crafted, Beautifully Designed Object: Assembled entirely by hand, the Lomogon brings to mind the timeless qualities of traditional craftsmanship. It's compatible with analogue and digital SLRs, as well as mirrorless cameras.\nShaped by Round-The-World Adventures: Tested by photographers and videographers from all corners of the world, the Lomogon was born into a life of wanderlust and travel \u2013 and it\u2019s ready for more.\n We're in the news!\nTop & bottom left: pictures by Daniel Schaefer / Bottom right: picture by Lomokev (click for high resolution versions)\nWe've created a lens to refresh street and travel photography. Introducing the Lomogon \u2013 with a 32 mm focal length to widen your world. But the Lomogon isn\u2019t your standard wide-angle lens. In the age of black plastic equipment, hyper-communication, and digital saturation, we wanted this tool to put the adventure back into your everyday stories. We inspired ourselves from vintage optics for a retro design that sparks wanderlust from the outside, while producing timeless character from the inside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s giving you a look and a feeling that has been lost by a lot of modern designers. What it comes down to is character. These unique and distinct images that you just wouldn\u2019t get with any standard camera \u2013 and you definitely couldn\u2019t get with a phone, or anything in that range.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Schaefer (Photographer & Optics Expert, New York)\nFor many, the first time you shoot with a wide-angle lens is like rediscovering photography. With a 32 mm focal length that comes very close to that of a human eye, and a closest focusing distance of only 0.4 m, you can approach your subjects intimately, fill the frame, and get that feeling of being \u201creally there\u201d.\n\u201cThe wideness of the angle really gives you a rich photographic composition with a lot of details but it doesn\u2019t deform your image. That\u2019s really important.\u201d \u2014 Julia Grandperret (Photographer, Paris)\nPictures by Julia Grandperret, click here to see them in high resolution\n\u201cFor many cases in photography, shooting on a wide-angle lens is one of the most helpful things in the world.\u201d \u2014 Geoff Thompson (Photographer, New York)\nPictures by Geoff Thompson, click here to see them in high resolution\nThe Lomogon\u2019s dial-styled aperture mechanism works with Lomography\u2019s signature click-and-stop feeling, meaning that you can feel each aperture lock into place as you dial through them. Switching through apertures has never been simpler. \nSwitch straight from f2.5 to f11, and feel each stop click into place\nWhat\u2019s more? This dial-styled mechanism allows perfectly circular apertures \u2013 impossible to achieve with a blade system \u2013 and thus beautiful bokeh. It covers a range from f/2.5 to f/11.\nBokeh comparison between the Lomogon and ordinary lenses\n\u201cThe aperture ring is great \u2013 it means the aperture is a perfect circle; which means your bokeh\u2019s going to be really, really nice.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Meredith aka Lomokev (Photographer, Brighton)\n\u201cI love being able to change my aperture with the dial because it makes it such a quick transition. When the bands are moving and the lights are moving I can change my aperture just as quickly as they do, which makes for flawless continual photography.\u201d \u2014 Coco Alexander (Photographer, New York) \nPictures by Coco Alexander, click here to see them in high resolution\nThe Lomogon was developed together with the illustrious Russian manufacturer Zenit and assembled by hand with the finest glass optics in a small manufactory on the banks of the Yangtze river, Central China. This means that your shots will be crystal clear and sharply defined \u2014 every single time. We hope you enjoy the attention to detail and retro exterior, which is a nod to billowing sails, caravels and golden compasses.\n\u201cIt has that sort of language that you just don\u2019t get on modern objects and it gives you that character that really builds on an elegant package; no matter what kind of work you\u2019re looking to do.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Schaefer (Photographer & Optics Expert, New York) \nPictures by Daniel Schaefer, click here to see in high resolution\n\u201cThe design is everything. I think that the exterior of the camera and the lenses definitely play a part in how excited the model is to have you photographing them.\u201d \u2014 Ruby June (Photographer, New York)\nPictures by Ruby June, click here to see them in high resolution\nThe Lomogon has been developed with exploration in mind. From the tropical beaches of Thailand to the roar of Manhattan\u2019s subway; from the fjords of Iceland to a dizzying Parisian games arcade, the Lomogon has been tested by photographers and videographers all over the globe \u2013 through photo series, music videos, documentaries and more.\n \u201cThe only way to stay inspired for shooting photos in the street is by traveling or putting yourself in new surroundings, new environments, meeting new people. To stay inspired \u2013 I think that\u2019s important.\u201d \u2014 Adrian Morris (Photographer, Barcelona) \nPictures by Adrian Morris, click here to see them in high resolution\n\u201cWhen compared with other DSLR lenses, the Lomogon is much lighter and much smaller, which makes it perfect for packing in your bag when you\u2019re traveling.\u201d \u2014 Wilson Lee (Photographer, Hong Kong) \nPictures by Wilson Lee, click here to see them in high resolution\nPraised not only for its photographic abilities, the Lomogon is also a brilliant lens for videographers and filmmakers looking to experiment. Allowing you to create special bokeh effects and adjust the depth of field all whilst filming, the Lomogon renders videos in a unique, cinematic look.\n\u201cI had a lot fun shooting between apertures. Instead of waiting for the click of the aperture dial when dialing between apertures, I paused between two options which allowed me to create particular bokeh effects.\u201d \u2014 Alfredo Buonanno (Photographer & Videographer, Naples)\nCelebrating 25 years of Lomography, the Lomogon\u2019s character is inspired by the Lomo LC-A: the little camera which sparked the whole Lomography movement and aesthetic in 1992. It produced images with bold contrast, sweet saturation, and moody vignetting. Now the Lomogon recreates some of this classic look \u2013 but in high resolution, for digital and analogue SLRs. This aesthetic can also be toned down at smaller apertures for a more transparent look.\n\u201cThe biggest thing about the LC-A was that lens \u2013 the fact that it let that huge amount of light in. So to then take this lens that I know so well and redesign it so it works with a DSLR\u2026 it\u2019s a huge deal because it brings that aesthetic to the world of digital\u201d \u2014 Kevin Meredith aka Lomokev, Photographer, Brighton\nSo let\u2019s raise our glasses to the LC-A camera \u2013 born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1982 \u2013 and discovered in 1991 by a bunch of Viennese students, in an old junk shop in Prague. Those students were us, and The Lomographic Society International was born.\nPictures by Alfredo Buonanno, click here to see them in high resolution\nThe Lomogon is a lens that is both at the height of technology and a glowing, nostalgic object. Constructed with six multi-coated lens elements in six groups, the Lomogon corrects optical aberrations to minimize distortion and improve micro-contrast, giving your shots richer colors and tone transitions. And as the closest focusing distance is 0.4 m, you\u2019ll be able to capture even the tiniest of details in razor-sharp focus and high resolution. The Lomogon will be available in Canon EF and Nikon F mount. It will also be compatible with numerous other bodies with adaptors available from Lomography.\nTechnical Specifications\nFocal Length: 32 mm\nLens Construction: 6 elements in 6 groups\nMaximum Aperture: f/2.5\nRegular Apertures: dial aperture stops, f/2.5, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11\nImage Circle: 44 mm\nField of View: 68 degrees\nLens Mounting Profile: Canon EF, Nikon F & Pentax K\nElectronic Contacts: No\nClosest Focusing Distance: 0.4 m\nFocusing Mechanism: Helicoid\nFilter Thread: 62 mm\nOptical scheme of the Lomogon\nTechnical drawings\nThe Lomogon Art Lens is available with Canon EF, Nikon F & Pentax K mounts. It is designed for full frame sensors but will also give great results when used on crop sensor cameras. It's compatible with a great list of system and mirrorless cameras when using an adapter: Sony E mount, Fuji X, Micro 4/3, Canon RF, Nikon Z, and more!\nIf you are not sure whether the Lomogon is suitable for your camera, simply write us a message on Kickstarter and our friendly customer service will check it for you. \n\nWe\u2019re very proud to bring you a brand new Lomography Art Lens, and excited to be back on Kickstarter to share its creative process with photography enthusiasts worldwide.

Called Depero Futurista, or \u201cDepero the Futurist,\u201d it is also known as The Bolted Book, because it is famously bound together by two large industrial aluminum bolts. \nFilled with bold typographic experimentation, daring layouts, and featuring work in nearly every artistic and design medium, it is universally recognized as a landmark avant-garde example of the \u201cbook as object\u201d  and is often considered the first artist's book of the modern era. Today, however, copies of this trailblazing publication can rarely be found.\nWith your help, we want to make our facsimile \u2014 an exact replica of the original \u2014 available so that the Bolted Book can remain a continuing source of creative inspiration for the 21st century.\nEach copy of the facsimile comes with our acclaimed Reader's Guide. We are also offering a unique display stand custom designed for the Bolted Book. See below for DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL OF OUR PROJECT REWARDS. \n\u201cEye-popping.\u201d \u2014 Hyperallergic\n\u201cOne of the world\u2019s most iconic design books.\u201d \u2014 WIRED\nCover of the Bolted Book Facsimile, an exact replica of \"Depero Futurista.\" 240 pages, 12.5 x 9.5 in.\n\nAbout the Original Bolted Book and Fortunato Depero\n\"Depero Futurista (also known as the Bolted Book) is considered one of the avant-garde masterpieces in the history of the book-object. It exemplifies all the Futurist innovations: witty typographical effects; the use of colored inks and decorated paper; the brilliant idea of dynamo binding, making the book seem like a machine.\" \n \u2014 from The Artist and the Book in Twentieth-century Italy (Museum of Modern Art, 1992)\nDepero Futurista  (\"Depero the Futurist\") is a showcase for the work artist and designer Fortunato Depero (1892\u20131960, Italy) completed between 1913 and 1927 and also serves as a platform for his iconoclastic ideas. These ideas anticipated, by over 90 years, an approach to design and art making that can now be seen everywhere \u2014 from the breaking down of barriers between fine art and popular culture, to an emphasis on working in multimedia, to the necessity of self-promotion by artists and designers.\nAs a portfolio of Depero\u2019s career, the Bolted Book includes paintings, sculptures, textile and architectural designs, theater, dance, and advertising work, wordplays, manifestos, and reviews he received in many different languages. The book in particular highlights Depero\u2019s work in graphic design and typography, including his well-known advertisements for the Italian ap\u00e9ritif Campari.\nCampari \"advertising painting\" from the Bolted Book Facsimile.\n\". . . evidently printed in the heavens on paper made from the Milky Way\" is how Futurism's founder, F. T. Marinetti, described the Bolted Book in 1927.\n\nInterior pages from the Bolted Book Facsimile.\nDepero by 1913 had embraced the modernist movement Futurism, which was marked by a love of the new century\u2019s machine-driven technology and \u201cdynamic\u201d motion (in the form of cars, trains, and airplanes), coupled with a forceful rejection of past traditions and institutions.\nPublished in Milan in 1927 by the painter-aviator Fedele Azari, who on an introductory page describes it as \u201ca mechanical book bolted down like an engine,\u201d the book was dubbed \u201ca typographical racing car\u201d by Futurism\u2019s founder, F. T. Marinetti.\nDepero took the Bolted Book with him on his first trip, in 1928, to New York, where it served as a business card for securing design work and as a \u201cportable museum\u201d (when the bolts were removed, the pages could be pinned up on a wall, exhibition style). He was the only Futurist ever to live in New York City and while there, he produced graphic designs and covers for publications such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, and The New Yorker.\n\n\n\n\nThe Legacy of The Bolted Book and Why it Matters Today\nDepero continued a long and varied career in the years following the publication of the Bolted Book. In 1959, a year before he died, he opened in his hometown of Rovereto the Casa d'Arte Futurista Depero, a museum-laboratory dedicated to his Futurist work and ideas (today part of the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto). \nAfter Depero\u2019s death in 1960, the vast range of the artist-designer\u2019s production receded from public view and attention. As Futurism approached its 100th anniversary in 2009, however, Depero was gradually rediscovered and his adventurous, playful, and expansive outlook on art and design, expressed in the Bolted Book, came to be seen as an embodiment of the 21st century.\n\u201cDepero\u2019s Futurist vision is now ubiquitous. We are living in his reconstructed universe.\u201d Jonathon Keats in Forbes, May 29, 2009\nStill, relatively few people today are familiar with Depero and his work. \n\u201cYet, when you look at a multimedia performance art installation in New York\u2019s Chelsea district, glimpse a Tokyo skyscraper lit up with advertising, or even pick up a bottle of Campari soda, which Depero designed, you\u2019re seeing his legacy.\u201d  \u2014 Keats in Forbes, May 29, 2009\nGroundbreaking in its outlook, Depero's Bolted Book serves as an inspiration to us all to remain true to our creative spirit. \n\n\nThe Bolted Book in 2019\nTwo years ago, we created the first exact replica of the Bolted Book, following a successful Kickstarter. This facsimile was hailed as \u201cthe most beautiful publication of 2017\u201d by the international press. \n\"Gorgeous\" and \"spot on\" \u2014Columbia University's Rare Book & Manuscript Library, about our 2017 Bolted Book Facsimile.\nOwners of our facsimile were enthusiastic.\n\nThe facsimile sold out quickly.

This copy was personally presented in 1928 to Gianni Mattioli, who was one of Depero\u2019s most important patrons and supporters and who actively participated in the production of the original book. His daughter, the Milanese art historian Laura Mattioli, is the founder of the Center for Italian Modern Art in New York. \nCollaborators on the facsimile (2017) were MART, Museum of modern and contemporary art of Trento and Rovereto, which houses the Depero archives; and the Center for Italian Modern Art (CIMA) in New York, which featured the Bolted Book as a centerpiece of its 2014 inaugural exhibition, devoted to Fortunato Depero.\nFACSIMILE SPECIFICATIONS\n  Trim: Length: 32 cm (12.5 in.); height: 24.2 cm (9.5 in.).

We sent these glorious volumes out to our supporters just in time for the holidays.\nAnd now we're back, ready to push this wild experiment even further, with three brand new editions pushing the envelope of illustration, production and design: one masterpiece of Russian literature, one beloved children's classic, and one flabbergasting work of bizarre proto-sci-fi/feminist genius plucked from obscure antiquity.\nThe books are each $100, with some discounts on larger orders. From our rewards tiers, you can just select a total number of books (i.e. ONE ILLUMINATED EDITION, TWO ILLUMINATED EDITIONS, etc), and you will be prompted to select your titles later one the campaign is finished. All six of these beautiful books -- the three new ones, and the three we produced last time -- are available through this campaign!\nEach edition is an oversized 9x12\" hardcover edition, cloth-bound in sewn signatures from 148-320 pages, enclosed in elaborately debossed and embossed die-cut slipcases, which create a topographical map of the interior artwork in foil blocking. \nThe interior is printed on creamy, acid-free uncoated paper with a fine tooth, and each edition includes a minimum of ten full page illustrations, along with numerous spots, illuminated letters, and design pieces. The entire package is designed by Ma\u00eblle Doliveux with a restrained graphic boldness, and an unparalleled eye for beauty, clarity and readability.\nWe're producing three brand new Illuminated Editions through this campaign. They are:\nDostoevsky's 1867 opus is a profoundly intense, deeply internal novel of guilt, morality and philosophy. Arguably the first psychological novel, it opened the door to a whole modern history of fiction and storytelling with its close third person examination of an anguished and tormented anti-hero. We'll be using Constance Garnett's translation to explore the deep human passions of this brilliant Russian novel.\nThere is simply no artist on the planet more fitting to bring these intense moral, mental and emotional currents to the page than Dave McKean. Dave is one of the greatest graphic artists and cartoonists ever to work on the printed page. The author of the masterpiece CAGES, the cover artist for Neil Gaiman's celebrated SANDMAN series, the co-creator of ARKHAM ASYLUM with Grant Morrison and so much more, the winner of nearly every award a cartoonist can win, Dave is sure to present Dostoevsky's story as never seen before. \nTHE DESCRIPTION OF A NEW WORLD, CALLED THE BLAZING WORLD is simply one of the most fascinating, unusual and astonishing pieces of literature we've ever come across. Written in 1666 by Margaret Cavenish, the Duchess of Newcastle, the book details an interdimensional otherworldly queer romance that is centuries (if not millennia) ahead of its time.\nThis strange metafictional experiment follows a young woman who is transported to a world of animal-people, becomes their empress, and eventually leads an invasion back into her own world, complete with bird-man bombardiers dropping magma stones and submarine ships infiltrating naval barriers. The tale involves spirit possession,  astral projection, the many-worlds theory, cutting edge science and philosophy, and more mind-boggling bits than I can express in a short summary. It is truly one of the most bonkers books in the English language, and it must be experienced first-hand.\nRebekka Dunlap is the brilliant cartoonist and illustrator behind 2016's DREAM TUBE, alongside many other comics, animations, and illustrations for clients like The New York Times, The New Republic, The New Yorker, and presumably other institutions starting with \"The New.\" Her astonishing, often experimental work excels when bending worlds and minds, envisioning bold new possibilities in physical and psychological space -- which makes her the best artist imaginable to bring this bizarre and utterly unique piece of fiction to life.\nThe beloved classic fantasy adventure PETER PAN (originally published in 1911 as PETER AND WENDY), has been adapted countless times for film, stage, and spin-offs -- but it's never been seen as depicted by the brushwork of celebrated Belgian cartoonist Brecht Evens, author of the masterful graphic novels THE WRONG PLACE, THE MAKING OF, and PANTHER. \nBrecht will take an inventive approach to this impossibly beautiful book, treating Neverland as an imaginative space of infinite possibility to detail and explore. Pirate ships, lost cities, fairy societies, unknowable beasts and magical creatures.\nWe cannot wait to see this one come to life -- the imagination of Brecht Evens set loose in the hinterlands of this rapturous and enigmatic fantasy story. It's sure to contain visions that fall, as Barrie wrote, \"somewhere between reality and all we've ever dreamed.\" \nThose are the three new titles we're funding with this new campaign. But that's not all -- our first three books, funded via our last campaign, can also be reserved if you missed them the first time around. They'll all ship together when we fulfill the campaign.\nThe first round brought us:\nBefore Bill even began work on his jaw-dropping illustrations, we knew this one would be a masterpiece. Wells' gleefully blasphemous tale of human chimeras and deranged scientific curiosity comes to nightmarish life through Bill's supreme brushwork and unmatched vision. \nBill Sienkiewicz, for the few who aren't aware, is a living legend, and a master of mutants if there ever was one. The man almost single-handedly brought fine art techniques into mainstream American comics, drew many of the most acclaimed comics and graphic novels of of the last 40 years, and collaborated with Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman and Frank Miller on some of their most powerful and ambitious works. \nHis Illuminated Edition of THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU is accompanied by an introduction by none other that Guillermo Del Toro, whose Moreau-vian THE SHAPE OF WATER is the reigning Best Picture and Best Director champion of the 2018 Academy Awards.\nEarly in his career, Oscar Wilde produced two books of fairy tales -- THE HAPPY PRINCE AND OTHER TALES and A HOUSE OF POMEGRANATES. They've rarely been collected in one volume -- and never with stunning artwork by Yuko Shimizu (THE UNWRITTEN, BARBED WIRE BASEBALL), one of the modern masters of illustration and graphic art.\nWilde's original fairy tales are moving, sweet, sad and magical -- much like Yuko's artwork. Yuko is one of the most celebrated and admired editorial illustrators in the world, and her work is perfectly aligned with Wilde's witty, rueful voice. As the Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Michael Cunningham writes in his introduction to our volume, this collaboration is \"a meeting of such extraordinary talents the book itself emanates the minute traces of a pulse.\"\nAlgernon Blackwood is one of the most important authors in the history of weird fiction and literary horror, and his work deserves to be universally recognized. His turn-of-the-century occult sagas of the natural and supernatural world had a huge impact on many 20th century masters, including H.P. Lovecraft, who believed that his masterwork THE WILLOWS was the greatest supernatural tale in all of English literature.\nTHE WILLOWS is a chilling and gorgeous story of two friends rafting down the flooded Danube, and slowly becoming deranged by a mysterious force at work on the branch-choked river. Has the river itself become astonishly, malevolently conscious? Or is this a tale of two human souls perched on the brink of madness?\nBut in the 110 years since its original publication, THE WILLOWS has floated in and out of print, without the wide recognition it deserves. But now the celebrated cartoonist and graphic artist Paul Pope, whose vividly energetic brushwork seems to writhe and vibrate on the page, brings this story to life, along with four other classic Blackwood horror tales.\nDAVE MCKEAN ENAMEL PIN.

The original piece can be had as a unique reward. \nDAVE MCKEAN has illustrated and designed over eighty award winning and ground breaking books and graphic novels including The Magic of Reality (Richard Dawkins), The Homecoming, Skeletons (Ray Bradbury), The Fat Duck Cookbook, Historic Heston (Heston Blumenthal), What's Welsh for Zen (John Cale), Varjak Paw and Phoenix (SF Said), The Savage (Liverpool reads book 2009), Slog\u2019s Dad, Mouse Bird Snake Wolf, Joe Quinn\u2019s Poltergeist (David Almond), Arkham Asylum (Grant Morrison, the most successful single graphic novel DC ever published), Voodoo Lounge (The Rolling Stones), Night Shift, Wizard and Glass, The Colorado Kid (Stephen King), I Am Legend (Richard Matheson) and Mr. Punch, Signal to Noise, Violent Cases, Coraline, The Wolves in the Walls (NY Times Illustrated Book of the Year), American Gods and The Graveyard Book (Carnegie/Hugo/Newberry Medal winner) (Neil Gaiman).\nHe has written and illustrated Cages (Harvey, Pantera, Ignatz and Alph Art awards), two Pictures That Tick volumes of short stories (V+A Book of the Year), the erotic novel Celluloid, and Black Dog: The Dreams of Paul Nash, a commission by the 14-18 Now Foundation and the Imperial War Museum. He recently received the inaugural Aragones award for excellence in comic book arts. He was chosen by Apple as one of their 30 key creatives representing 30 years since the launch of the Apple Mac (Dave\u2019s year was 1994, the year he created the first Photoshop comics covers for the hugely influential Sandman series, and the first online interactive narrative Club Salsa).\nThe multimedia live performance of Black Dog was featured at Tate Britain, the Somme Memorial in Amiens, and many other festivals in Europe and Canada.\nDave has also performed his Nine Lives project at the Sidney Opera House and British Library, and co-created and performed An Ape\u2019s Progress for the Manchester Jazz and Literary Festivals in 2015.\nDave has directed five short films, including N[eon], which won first prize at Clermont Ferrand Film Festival, and three feature films. MirrorMask (Jim Henson Company/Sony Pictures) which premiered at the Sundance Festival in Utah, and was officially selected for the Locarno, Sitges, London, Edinburgh, Sarasota, Hawaii and Dublin film festivals. It won 9 awards (including the Inaugural Black Tulip at the Amsterdam Festival) . Luna (Raindance Festival Best British Feature and BIFA awards) premiered at Toronto FF, and The Gospel of Us with Michael Sheen (two Bafta Cymru awards) in 2012. He is currently editing his fourth feature Wolf\u2019s Child, adapted from his own play, created with Wildworks Theatre Company. \nHis next publishing projects are Raptor, a book about grief, literature, and political monsters, a book of Venice drawings, and a book of paintings and drawings inspired by silent cinema.\nHe lives on the Isle of Oxney in Kent, England with his wife, studio manager, and musician, Clare.\n REBEKKA DUNLAP's figures often bend and distort, filling the frame or floating into oblivion so as to allow traditional space to fall away completely. Her pre-occupation with the interiors of the mind have lead her to visually discuss such topics as Mental Health, Women's Issues and more generally, the emotional strain of navigating tumultuous systems of power. Leaning heavily on a lexicon of Children's Media and Anime, Rebekka combines the whimsical with real world gravity.\nBelgian cartoonist BRECHT EVENS was born in 1986 and studied illustration in Ghent, Belgium. Important mentors were his illustration teacher Goele Dewanckel and cartoonist/comedy coach/zen master Randall Casaer.\nHis debut comic book, A Delivery from Outer Space, was released in 2005. The slightly melodramatic Vincent was released in 2006, followed in 2007 by a little nocturnal fantasy called Night Animals. The Wrong Place (2009) started out as a graduation project and was a departure from the more typical comic art of his earlier books. It won the Haarlem Comic Festival's Willy Vandersteen Award for best Dutch-language graphic novel, and an award at the Angouleme International Comics Festival. He followed The Wrong Place up with The Making Of (2012) and Panther (2016), which appeared on many year-end best-of lists.\nBEEHIVE BOOKS is a new Philadelphia-based small press founded by the artist and designer Ma\u00eblle Doliveux and author and editor Josh O\u2019Neill.

Between our various ventures, we have raised nearly a million dollars on Kickstarter, and rewarded backers of every campaign with very beautiful books and rewards. \n\nArmed with that experience we feel very ready to tackle the task of producing and publishing substantial, handsome volumes befitting their brilliant authors and illustrators.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all books, prints and ancillary rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money we need to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job. In fact, with such a substantial funding goal, the biggest danger is simply that we'll fall short of our ambitious aims.\n\nStill, there are more risks and challenges involved in making books with this level of production value than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. Problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict.

While creating my own interpretation of the cards, I worked avidly to stay true to the original imagery.

More recently we launched the Eldritch Tarot, a set of 22 Major Arcana cards magnificently illustrated. We decided to go a step further and create a full cult set to worship Cthulhu and communicate with the Old Ones as it should be! This is our new Talking Board with a magnificent planchette and matching candleholders.\nthe Cthulhu Talking Board\nThe new board has been designed in Transylvania with the great artist Luciana Nedelea. The result is astonishing: the new board is loaded with impressive details, headed by Cthulhu and guarded by the Nightgaunts.\nboard game detail\nWood or cardboard?\nThis board is presented for the first time in two editions: one, printed in compact cardboard and second, the luxury edition in wooden board. If you want a lightweight board with attention to printed details, the cardboard board may be your choice. If you want a superior touching and authentic feel\u2026 the wood will impress you!\nNightgaunt detail\nTo go a step further we created the luxury edition on wood (16mm thickness), in which we get an incredible touch and old feeling that give this board some unique characteristics. Take a look to these details, directly from the workshop:\nwooden board, close view\nThe Cthulhu planchette (click to enlarge)\n                A board of this magnitude could not be used with any planchette... that is why we created a unique piece of resin following the design of the board with all luxury of details sculpted by Marta L\u00f3pez from the Monster Box with as much care and horror as the one that endows our sculptures collection.\nplanchette front, back and custom bag\nThe new planchette is hand-painted and comes with a 33mm lens to read the messages on the board. For better protection and storage, each planchette will be delivered in a cloth bag stamped with the Necronomicon, with a cord closure.\nplanchettte, bottom view\nThe perfect light for your cult\nThis collector's outfit would not be complete without the amazing Cthulhu Skull candleholders that complete the setting for the ritual. Like the planchette, they are hand-sculpted, resin-made and hand-painted pieces; there's one candle included to start your cult! (you can add more candles to your reward; anyways, spare candles of this size can be easily found). Size: 8x8x6cm (3.2x3.2x2.4\").\nCthulhu skull candleholder\nCandleholder and planchette\nShipping\nPlease choose your reward to check the shipping cost for your country.

This is the limited edition (latest units) only for Kickstarter, including a Cthulhu bag.\nAbout us\nFor this project we brought together a great team of talented artists and collaborators with the aim of creating a unique set of high quality. The board is illustrated by Luciana Nedelea from Transylvania, and the luxury wooden boards will be produced by El Troquel workshop. The resin pieces are sculpted by Marta L\u00f3pez from The Monster Box and hand painted by the artist, piece by piece. The Major Arcana Eldritch Tarot is illustrated and created by Sara Bardi. The entire project has been designed and coordinated by Cthulhu Project.\nThe Cthulhu Project has previously produced, with the help of our backers, collector's products like the Cthulhuoshkas, Mountains of Madness statuettes, Whispers from R'lyeh, The Light of R'lyeh, the Commemorative Idol, and board games like Cthulhu Crusades or The Writer. \nAll contents are based on the works by H.

(Disclaimer: Any funds raised to meet this goal will not go to charity but to pay the authors of this anthology.)\n\nNightscape Press is proud to present ASHES AND ENTROPY edited by Robert S. Wilson, an anthology of cosmic horror and noir/neo-noir. ASHES AND ENTROPY will include brand new stories by Laird Barron, Damien Angelica Walters, John Langan, Kristi DeMeester, Jon Padgett, Nadia Bulkin, Jayaprakash Satyamurthy, Lucy A. Snyder, Tim Waggoner, Jessica McHugh, Paul Michael Anderson, Max Booth III, Lynne Jamneck, Greg Sisco, Lisa Mannetti, Nate Southard, Erinn L. Kemper, Matthew M. Bartlett, Autumn Christian, and will be published in December of 2018.\nASHES AND ENTROPY will also be illustrated by the phenomenal Luke Spooner of Carrion House Illustration (Luke also created the Kickstarter artwork). As you can see, Luke is an amazing artist. You might have also noticed that we have not showcased a cover for ASHES AND ENTROPY yet. This is because we are simultaneously running a cover art contest for the book. You can go here for more details about that. \nWe have a variety of great perks to offer including the following: \nTwo trade paperback editions (both a black and white and a color edition) and an eBook edition of ASHES AND ENTROPY (copies of the anthology combined with other items in perks will most likely not be available before December regardless of the month listed on those perks).\nSigned items and books of all kind, including some out of print editions.\nKickstarter-exclusive chapbooks of each individual story in the book signed, numbered, and limited to just ten copies each. \nA one of a kind Jon Padgett hardcover including his story in ASHES AND ENTROPY \"Yellow House\" and his forthcoming Nightscape Press Charitable Chapbook THE BROKER OF NIGHTMARES (plus three alternate versions of this amazing novelette. These alternate versions will never be in print elsewhere and offer an unprecedented depth-filled look into this bleak terrifying story, offering twisted eye-opening reflections of the final product along with a short introduction by the author to each version discussing what went into the decision process of determining their fate).\nSome phenomenal creative perks like story critiques by some of the authors in ASHES AND ENTROPY and special stories created for you and/or with you as a character by John Langan, Tim Waggoner, and Jayaprakash Satyamurthy.\nKick back by the beach with your copy of Ashes and Entropy while you take a Nightscape Press vacation in beautiful Costa Rica.\nBecome an executive editor and help me put together a future anthology.

You put those two items together along with the scope of artwork commissioned and add in a budget for promotion that attempts to meet the high bar of excellence of the talent involved in these stories and you end up with a fairly hefty tab. \nThat said, we would like to think both the book itself and the variety of amazing perks we're offering will make this budget an achievable goal. And, since we value transparency, here is our budget broken down for clarity. \nAuthor payments: $6,000\nCover art, interior art, and marketing: $4,500\nFees, taxes, and estimated cost to cover perks and shipping: $4,500 \nStretch Goal List:\nCheck out our super cryptic list of planned stretch goals! We'll reveal more secrets as we meet certain thresholds.\n#1: $16,500: Open submissions for two slots for writers from underrepresented demographics in Ashes and Entropy during the month of September!  \n#2: $18,000: Two alternate covers will be chosen from the best runner up submissions from our Ashes and Entropy cover art contest! For those who aren't already aware, our cover contest announced last month and open for submissions throughout this month will be paying the one winning artist $500 to $1,000. If we reach this goal, we'll actually do two alternate covers that we choose from the runner up cover submissions and each of those artists will get $500! And each of you who have purchased a paperback copy will have the option of switching to one of these other covers! You can learn more about this contest by going to our submissions page! \n#3: $20,000: Wide open pitch session for one story slot in Ashes and Entropy during the first two weeks of September! If we meet this goal, you'll be able to pitch me your story up to the length of a tweet and if I like what I hear, you'll be invited to submit your story for me to consider for Ashes and Entropy!

But publishing is a complex and expensive business and so when the publisher who was originally signed on was in a bind, an amicable decision to split ways was made and I was back at square one. \n\nAfter reaching out to several publishers who in the end told me they were not willing to take on the risk and cost of this book (it's a rare publisher willing to pay pro rates for short stories these days unfortunately), I brought the project to my wife and Nightscape Press co-owner, Jennifer Wilson. And after a lot of discussion and brainstorming and planning, we decided to publish the project ourselves. \n\nAnd while Nightscape Press has never published a project with these kind of budgetary requirements (we have mostly published and/or collaborated on charity anthologies in the past), we have what it takes to create some amazingly solid books. Some past successes include:\n\nHORROR FOR GOOD edited by Robert S. Wilson, Mark C. Scioneaux, and RJ Cavender (which contributes to amfAR the Foundation for AIDS Research and includes stories by authors such as Ramsey Campbell, Jack Ketchum, Joe Lansdale, Lisa Morton, Laird Barron, F. Paul Wilson, Nate Southard, Ray Garton, and more).\n\nWORLD'S COLLIDER edited by Richard Salter (a shared world horror/sci-fi anthology which includes stories by authors such as Steven Savile, James Moran, Aaron Rosenberg, Trent Zelazny, Jonathan Green, Simon Kurt Unsworth, Kelly Hale, Richard Wright and more).\n\nBLOOD TYPE: An Anthology of Vampire SF on the Cutting Edge edited by Robert S. Wilson (which contributes to The Cystic Fibrosis Trust and includes stories by authors such as Peter Watts, Laird Barron, William F. Nolan, Tim Waggoner, Amelia Mangan, Stephen Graham Jones, Michael Collings, Mike Resnick, Jilly Paddock, Taylor Grant, H.E. Roulo, and more).\n\nFANTASY FOR GOOD edited by Richard Salter and Jordan Ellinger (which contributes to The Colorectal Cancer Alliance and includes stories by the likes of George R.R. Martin, Roger Zelazny, Carrie Vaughn, Kelley Armstrong, Alan Dean Foster, Piers Anthony, Michael Moorcock, Katharine Kerr, David Farland, Jane Lindskold, Nnedi Okorafor, Todd McCaffrey, Jay Lake, Kevin J Anderson & Rebecca Moesta, Neil Gaiman, and more).\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, Nightscape Press has recently relaunched with our new charity publishing model that will include (at least) two lines of books: our Charitable Chapbooks line and our charity novel line.

We know that shipping overseas is very expensive and we wish it was cheaper, too! We help by subsidizing some of the shipping cost. We make no money from the shipping.\n Jeff's Thoughts on Working with John Fleskes\nI love working with John because he makes beautiful books. It's as simple as that. He is a master craftsman, and I know that he will bring the same level of attention and care into bringing the book into the world as I did in creating the work within it. I could not have been happier with our first book together, Notes From The Shadowed City, and I can't wait to see what he does with The Thousand Demon Tree.\nJohn's Thoughts on Working with Jeffrey Alan Love\nI was mesmerized with Jeff's work from the moment I first saw it. I could tell immediately that this was an artist with that rare individual voice that could speak in soft tones, yet have a strong commanding presence through his art. Upon meeting Jeff I found someone with an equal passion and commitment to making art and books that had a genuine purpose. He is humble, one of the best storytellers and designers who I've met, and someone who lets his work speak for itself. It's a joy to work with Jeff--especially when I get to see each new work for the first time, and during the excitement that comes while we brainstorm ideas. It's pure pleasure to have this opportunity to bring his work into the viewers hands.\nJeffrey Alan Love is an award-winning artist and writer whose clients have included the New York Times, TIME, The New Yorker, Scholastic, HarperCollins, Tor, Gollancz, and others. Winner of the World Fantasy Award for Best Artist, a gold medal from the Society of Illustrators, a Silver Spectrum Fantastic Art Award, and two Academy of British Cover Design Awards, he has been nominated for The British Fantasy Award, The British Science Fiction Award, and the Chesley Award.\nA message from the Publisher, John Fleskes: What Kickstarter offers is the opportunity to create and do what we love, while connecting and giving back to our supporters in a personal way. This makes the process much more enjoyable than if we simply worked behind closed doors. It is also gratifying to have the opportunity to continually add value to the project through stretch goals. I've never felt that we are making products. Instead, we are making unique art books and prints. This is done with great care to best allow us to showcase Jeff's art in a way that we can be proud of. We hope that you will cherish them just as much as we do.\nThe Thousand Demon Tree is trademark and \u00a9 2018 Jeffrey Alan Love.

Cooper, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before.

In the 1660s he began a series of experiments analyzing the nature of light - passing it through prism lenses demonstrating that clear white light was composed of seven visible colors (or hues): red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.\nCredit: Apic Hulton Archive / Getty Images\nAfter more than 30 years of experiments, tests and discoveries, he released Opticks: or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light in 1704.\nWritten in English and in a simpler form, it was made more accessible to a wider audience (in comparison to Principia), but without affecting its influence over physical science.\nThe first, 1704, edition of Opticks\nIt is considered one of the great works of science in history.\nEinstein\u2019s Forward to Opticks, 1931:\nFortunate Newton, happy childhood of science! He who has time and tranquility can by reading this book live again the wonderful events which the great Newton experienced in his young days. Nature to him was an open book, whose letters he could read without effort. The conceptions which he used to reduce the material of existence to order seemed to flow spontaneously from experience itself, from the beautiful experiments which he ranged in order like playthings and describes with an affectionate wealth of detail. On one person he combined the experimenter, the theorist, the mechanic and, not least, the artist in exposition.\n\u2014Albert Einstein \nThe spectrum of light, the invention of the reflecting telescope, the first theory of how raindrops refract sunlight to form rainbows, the first color circle....it opened minds in physics, optics, natural sciences and the arts.\nOur reissue of Isaac Newton\u2019s Opticks\nThere is no art without perception of colors and light.\nWe have set out to create a unique book, following the philosophy of our previous books. A book able to capture the attention not only of scientists excited about the science of Newton, but also artists or designers.\nWe have created a book where color is the protagonist. From a cover that reflects the light to show us the tones that Newton described, to interiors tinted by his rainbow.\nThe cover is made with a reflective paper that makes it \u2018interactive\u2019. As you move it - the light angles change and colors are shown. Just as Newton did with the sunlight through the prisms.\nThe inner pages are also colored, making gradient color changes throughout the book and differentiating the sections through different colors. Turning the book into an explosion of color, with an elegant layout.\nEach chapter is defined by a new colour - following a colour gradient. Once you are within that chapter, the colour remains along the interior spine. This pattern repeats until the end of the book.\nKronecker Wallis Opticks reissue features:\n148 x 210 mm size (din-A5) \nAround 500 pages \nHolographic film cover \nEngravings in stamping \nSpine lined in cloth \nGradient colored interior pages\nThis book will be unique, made almost by hand, with a small print run. A beautiful book to collect, touch, browse or offer as a gift. Transmitting the scientific culture that Newton gave us.\nWhy we need YOU? We are a small independent publishing company, so guaranteeing the costs of the first print is vital to the success of our project. Without your support, we simply could not absorb the costs of starting this project. We need your support!\nProject rewards\n1) Newton's Principia book\nWith Isaac Newton\u2019s Principia we took a different approach to the editorial design, than what is typically found in mathematical or physics texts. We created a very detailed design; working with a creative binding technique which allowed us to present the three books as individual art objects.\nThe three main chapters of Principia are bound separately as three individual books, all contained within the main cover. We wanted its \u201cwrapping\u201d to be visually appealing and different. Therefore, we have opted for visible binding that leaves the spine bare, displaying a part of the books that usually remains hidden.\nMore details and photos: https://www.kroneckerwallis.com/product/isaac-newtons-principia/\n2) Euclid's Elements book\nEuclid\u2019s Elements has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written. It was one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and has been estimated to be second only to the Bible.\nHow do you do something different with Elements? Something different from the other Elements that exist and different from our reissue of Principia? Elements is too a public text and widely known and shared. We wanted a challenge \u2013 something that would allow us to continue applying art within science. To create something unique again.\nOliver Byrne was our answer. Byrne was an English engineer who re-wrote the first six books of the Elements of Euclid with a totally new and innovative language. He transformed the tedious geometric references to which we are accustomed, into visual concepts.\nWe can not categorically state why Oliver Byrne stopped at the sixth book, but it is true that the first six are purely geometric themes. They are subsequently followed by books that deal with arithmetic or mixed themes; complicating further the application of their visual language. So it is at this point in our adventure, that we accept the challenge. Together with a team of mathematical experts, university teachers and post-doctorates who will accompany us \u2013 we will finish the work of Oliver Byrne and completing with his style \u2013 all the thirteen books of Elements.\nOur book is currently under development. And it is on pre-order.\nMore details and photos: https://www.kroneckerwallis.com/product/euclids-elements-completing-oliver-byrnes-work/ \n3) Newton's College Notebook\nAs described by Cambridge Library:\n\"This small notebook was probably used by Newton from about 1664 to 1665. It contains notes from his reading on mathematics and geometry, showing particularly the influence of John Wallis and Ren\u00e9 Descartes. It also provides evidence of the development of Newton\u2019s own mathematical thinking, including his study of infinite series and development of binomial theorem, the evolution of the differential calculus, and its application to the problem of quadratures and integration.\"\nMore info and images here: https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-04000/\nWe are going to print 1.500 notebooks for the first print-run. We don't know yet if the future holds a second print-run, so do take this opportunity!\nRewards with Opticks are limited to a number of users, as we can't make more than 1.500 on our first print-run.\nWe will made a facsimile version; meaning all interior pages will be as per the original (as you can see in these photos):", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a very thorough and meticulously-produced edition, so in order to fund the costs of printing the book and offer it at an affordable price, we plan to launch this crowdfunding campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Thank you for supporting our project", "descp": "Subscribe to our newsletter and you will be notified when the printed book is available for purchase from our online store, if the Kickstarter campaign is successful.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac30 or more", "title": "The book (early bird price)", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["463 backers", "Limited (37 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac38 or more", "title": "The book", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["159 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "The book + Newton's Principia book", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of our Newton's Principia\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["126 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "The book (early bird) + College Notebook", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of Newton's College Notebook\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["249 backers", "Limited (251 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac78 or more", "title": "The book + College Notebook", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of Newton's College Notebook\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17 backers", "Limited (333 left of 350)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac110 or more", "title": "The book + Principia + College Notebook", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of our Newton's Principia\n+ one copy of Newton's College Notebook\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["61 backers", "Limited (239 left of 300)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac190 or more", "title": "The book + Euclid's Elements book", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of our Euclid's Elements\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac220 or more", "title": "The book + Principia + Elements books", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of our Newton's Principia\n+ one copy of our Euclid's Elements\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["65 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac230 or more", "title": "The book + Elements + College Notebook", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of our Euclid's Elements\n+ one copy of Newton's College Notebook\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers", "Limited (85 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac260 or more", "title": "Book + Principia + Elements + Notebook", "descp": "One copy of Newton\u2019s Opticks\n+ one copy of our Newton's Principia\n+ one copy of our Euclid's Elements\n+ one copy of Newton's College Notebook\n+ newsletter subscription for updates and new projects", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["60 backers", "Limited (190 left of 250)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Shipping update", "update_content": "Hi all,\n\nShipping is almost finished \u2013 it will finish this week.

He sent it to a film historian who was writing a book about him. The first 500 copies of this book were packaged with a facsimile of the manuscript. What remains of that print run exists now only in the jealously guarded collections of film enthusiasts who have been lucky or wealthy enough to secure one.\nThis memoir is an enthralling story in which M\u00e9li\u00e8s guides us from his childhood into his early career, explaining how all of the elements fell into place to put him in the perfect position to become a pioneer of cinema. He talks about becoming one of the first people in the world to see a projected moving image at a private demonstration by the Lumi\u00e9re brothers and the international mission this inspired him to take to become a part of the new medium. He explains how and why he became the first impressario of cinema, how he built France's first film studio and how he invented special effects techniques and helped define the very format of cinematic film. More than this, it's a human story; at times braggadocios, joyous, humble and bitter. We learn how times and the industry changed, how he became the first victim of film piracy and how he ended up in his old age, forgotten, broke and selling toys and sweets in a tiny stall in Montparnasse train station. Most interesting to me was discovering that he was a man already aware of his legacy and surprisingly unhappy about how he could see he was going to be remembered. His memoir crackles with life and is a vivid account of the dawn of movies from its most colourful participant.\n73 years later, M\u00e9li\u00e8s's autobiography is lost. Never translated into English, it is a footnote to a very rare book which has been out of print for over half of cinema's entire history. With your help, I want to put this incredible testimony back into print and create a beautiful first edition of it.\nFor the first time, M\u00e9li\u00e8s's autobiography will be front and centre in a gorgeous hardback publication filled with supplementary material to create a definitive book to honour his work. The manuscript has been translated by a cine-literate translator, meaning the technical details M\u00e9li\u00e8s refers to are soundly expressed.\nThis is a hugely important - and wonderfully characterful - piece of writing from a man who was present at the actual birth of cinema and single-handedly discovered, developed and created technical processes we still use to this day. Don't you want to have a copy of that?\nThis is a beautiful HARDBACK edition bound in BLACK CLOTH coverboards, with the cover art and spine hot-foil stamped to shimmer and sparkle. The front page will be hand-numbered and in the back of the book will be a list of all Kickstarter backers who brought this project to fruition.\nTHE KICKSTARTER BOOK\nThe book will contain:\n- M\u00c9LI\u00c8S' UNABRIDGED AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN FULL, IN ENGLISH\n- COMPREHENSIVE FOOTNOTE ANNOTATION, PROVIDING GREAT DEPTH AND FURTHER INSIGHT INTO HIS STORY.\n- INTERVIEWS WITH FILM ACADEMICS AND FILMMAKERS ON M\u00c9LI\u00c8S' LEGACY AND INFLUENCE\n- ILLUSTRATIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS\n- A GUIDE TO M\u00c9LI\u00c8S' FILMOGRAPHY\n- TRANSCRIPTION OF M\u00c9LI\u00c8S' ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT IN FRENCH\n- SURPRISES.\nPackaged in a bespoke wooden box sporting the logo of M\u00e9li\u00e8s Star Film company, along with your book, you will receive:\n- STRICTLY LIMITED TO 1896 NUMBERED COPIES WORLDWIDE.\nThis is a photo of me at 17 years old. If you look closely, you'll see the T-shirt I'm wearing is of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's moon.\nI don't remember exactly when I first discovered the work of M\u00e9li\u00e8s, but I was familiar with, and adored his work by the time I was a teenager and hungered to see more than the famous 'A Trip To The Moon' and the occasional clips that would be shown in documentaries. However, I knew that most of his work was missing or unavailable.\nThere was plenty more cinema history to go around, though. My childhood, then teenage film obsession lead to film school and onto a career in and around film.\nWhilst visiting Barcelona in 2013, I started noticing a lot of posters on the streets sporting M\u00e9li\u00e8s's moon. My traveling companion told me they were advertising a M\u00e9li\u00e8s exhibition. My jaw dropped and we turned on our heels, sprinting across town to the Caixa Forum. What I saw there blew my mind, I had no idea so much of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's work survived - original artwork, sketches on the backs of dockets, original and incredible props and costumes from his films. I was in heaven. I learned that day that far more of his work survived and had been restored than I had previously realised. I bought an exhibition poster on my way out which has remained framed on my living room wall ever since.\nI was now fully charged to find and watch as many of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's films as I could and thanks to the wonderful DVD label Flicker Alley, I've been able to do just that. M\u00e9li\u00e8s has remained a minor obsession of mine ever since.\nRecently, I found my holy grail - the facsimile of his hand-written autobiography manuscript and I realised that it wasn't right that this document just languish in private collections. M\u00e9li\u00e8s's thoughts deserve to be published and widely available.\nHaving delivered two successful film-based book campaigns on Kickstarter last year, I have the passion, the knowledge and the experience to do this but I need your support.

I ordered all of the packaging materials - many huge bags of inflatated protective wrap, protectove paper and, of course, cardboard boxes - all to ship over 400 box sets out in. These would all arrive the day before the wooden boxes, which coincided with the first day of my wife\u2019s two-week summer holiday from work. My family would join us and, within 10 crazy, hard-workin\u2019 days, we would have assembled, packaged and shipped out all 400 box sets.

We've hit the goal!! Stretch goals have been added below the deck descriptions! I'll be adding new ones as we move along ^___^\n2/28///// UPDATE! We've officially cleared all stretch goals! Check them out below the deck descriptions!\n\nThe Neon Moon Tarot is a fully illustrated, 78-card tarot deck set in a retro-futuristic cyberpunk world using the archetypes and themes of a RWS tarot deck. Backers can expect a gritty urban hi-tech setting with a limited neon palette and heavy black inks. \nI've been able to work with different production sources to bring two different versions to this Kickstarter. The deck is available in both standard and pocket editions(details below).\nUsing the unique flexibility and depth of symbolism in the tarot, the Neon Moon deck emphasizes atmosphere and world-building. The RWS archetypes are alive and well here, merged with cyberpunk themes. \nThe Neon Moon Tarot lives in its own unique world and does its best to bring you along. It asks you to use your gut to read meaning from the cards with intuition. But you aren't left out in the cold. Each card has associated keywords and quotes to get you started. If you'd like, you can  check them out right now at www.neonmoontarot.com\n       The standard edition of The Neon Moon Tarot Deck measures 2.75 by 4.75 inches, and is printed on 300 GSM coated card stock. It comes complete with a custom rigid box and booklet. \n      The pocket edition of The Neon Moon Tarot measures 57 by 97 millimeters on 14 pt C2S coated card stock, and comes with a custom tuck box. \nThanks to all of your support, we've hit the goal as of 2/17! Here are some extra goodies to look forward to as funding continues!\n$6000 -UNLOCKED- Extra card unlocked! A second Fool card with a different take. Specific to this Kickstarter and won't be available in decks beyond Kickstarter backers. This reward will be automatically added on to both the pocket and standard editions of the deck, so if you've backed a tier with either you'll have an extra card for each deck.\n$6500 -UNLOCKED- A short mini-comic in PDF format unlocks for all tiers! This comic will serve as an introduction to the Neon Moon's cyberpunk world. I'll be working on it myself in the same style that is present in the cards. \n$7000 -UNLOCKED- Pocket edition decks will now also include a booklet! Additionally, all backer tiers with physical product will receive a mini art-print of their choice(or random if the backer survey isn't filled out) from the deck with their package. Mini so I can fit it in without increasing weight or shipping costs.\n$8500 -UNLOCKED- The short mini-comic PDF for all tiers from reward tier $6500 becomes a full length single issue comic(~30 pages) PDF for all tiers!\n$10,000 -UNLOCKED- Along with your physical decks you will receive a letterpress printed prototype card of the next deck I\u2019m working on. Additionally, we will unlock the Neon Moon Tarot Spread to the public. On top of that, the Neon Moon Card Game will also unlock for the public. Both will be posted to the Neon Moon website.\n  The Neon Moon setting is my original take on a cyberpunk world. You'll see the usual themes of hi-tech low-life, A.I., cyborgs, corporations run amok, and more. For my version of the world, there is a divisive plate separating the rich and powerful from the masses underneath. \nThe suit names have changed, along with the court cards, to better reflect the cyberpunk interpretation of this deck. They are as follows: \nSwords - Arms\nWands - Wires\nCups - Vials\nPentacles - Zent\nPage - Apprentice\nKnight - Agent\nQueen - Supervisor\nKing - Executive\nAbove the plate, people can live essentially forever through a mixture of memory backups, clones, and \"gene-therapy\", which has resulted in a very strict society under constant surveillance by the most powerful members who have been alive for hundreds of years and in that time have accumulated power and wealth. The court cards effectively play the roles of those most powerful members of this society living on top of the world. \nFor the minor pips, they depict life beneath the plate. I've strayed a bit from convention and things are more of a neon-lit, urban mad max than they are Neo-Tokyo. People are mostly too poor to advertise to, so most of the advertisements are aimed at pure necessities. Gangs roam what's left of the streets, sponsored militias run through on orders from above the plate, poverty is rampant and conflict is everywhere. People live short and violent lives of desperate struggle, and find hope and strength through banding together with friends. \nOutdated robots, discarded from above, hack into each others' firmware with updates giving their A.I. freedom. Gene-therapy is largely experimental and therefore much less stable than above the plate. People have started giving themselves vanity alterations in addition to performance enhancing ones. The internet is patched from a local mesh of wires that are strung from building to building, from the underside of the plate down to the ground. This accounts for the imagery of the minor pips. Previous ideas of what it means to be human, imposed by the ruling class, struggle against the people who remake themselves into a thousand different versions of humanity.\nAnd yet something new arrives with a strange, neon pink full moon. Magic begins to surface in the city, along with strange occurrences and impossibilities. Somehow, it seems to be relative in power to the waxing and waning of the moon. \nEach card is meant to evoke a particular piece of this world, using the archetypes available from the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot. I chose tarot specifically to bring this setting to life as it allowed me to emphasize the ambiance and themes of the world while letting a larger cast of characters be depicted than other mediums would comfortably allow. As with any tarot deck, every card has a piece of story behind it, and every combination of cards tells a different story. \n      Out of the goal of $5500, funds are estimated to be allocated accordingly:\nEstimated shipping costs - 15% ($825)\nEstimated Kickstarter fees - 10% ($550)\nEstimated production costs for both versions of the decks, boxes, and booklets - 75% ($4125+personal funds added)\nThe estimated timeline, and product status is as follows:\nMid-Late March - Campaign ends and funding transfers. Wallpaper+Avatar packs are done and ready to send out. PDF Booklet is also ready to send out. The Neon Moon Tarot Spread and Card Game will be put on the website and added as additional PDFs for backers. I'll place orders with my print shops for decks and booklets. Work has started on the 30-ish page PDF Comic.\nApril - Depending on order sizes and shipping times, I should start to receive product from my print shops in early to mid April, which I'll start to assemble and send out to backers. While I wait for product to arrive, I'll be letterpress printing prototype cards for the 10k stretch goal. Work on the PDF Comic continues.\nMay - Except for unexpected shipping delays, most backers should have received rewards. I should be finalizing the PDF comic reward at this point and I'll send it out when it's finished.\n    I'm James Brothwell, and this is both my second Kickstarter campaign, and my second complete tarot deck. My first campaign for The Sinking Wasteland Tarot was fortunate enough to not just fund, but to hit all of its stretch goals as well! I've previously been involved with comics, computer games, movies, and the odd commission work that's landed me in strange and exciting places. \nThanks to the success of the last campaign, I was able to put my nose to the grindstone and finish up The Neon Moon Tarot, and I'm very pleased to be able to offer it for you all now. I started work on this in the last couple of months of 2016 and only recently finished artwork for the last of the cards at the end of January 2018. \nI'm hoping that this deck will speak to those who, like me, are sometimes left wanting for a tarot deck that depicts a more urban environment, and incorporates technology throughout.\nIntroduction video Music by Gavin Luke.\nExplanation video music by TeknoAXE.\nImages represent prototypes. Final product may differ slightly.\nI do offer worldwide shipping but I'm sorry to say that I have little control over shipping costs or customs fees. If you order from outside of the US, please be aware that I've done my best to keep weights down, prices affordable, and shipping tracked. Still, some things are simply beyond my control. \nFinally, thank you to all of the backers, friends, strangers, and fellow internet oddities whose enthusiasm and support allows projects like this to exist and thrive. Much love. <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk campaign for backers. I have prototype decks and packaging in hand and arrangements for all listed physical product figured out. All artwork is completed. For my previous Kickstarter and Etsy store, I have repeatedly received feedback for fast shipping, sturdy packaging, and satisfaction with the product.\n\nShould we fund, I am ready to commit myself full time to fulfilling orders and getting product out the door as quickly as possible. It is my goal to repeat with this campaign the speed and efficiency that I brought to my previous Kickstarter project for The Sinking Wasteland Tarot.\n\nI'm looking forward to getting these decks into good homes out in the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Uplink", "descp": "Complete pack of all digital rewards featuring custom avatar images, HD wallpapers, and the PDF booklet for The Neon Moon Tarot\nINCLUDES:\nWallpaper and Avatar pack\nPDF Booklet for The Neon Moon Tarot", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Runner", "descp": "One pocket edition Neon Moon Tarot deck with custom tuck box.

Series Two has been reworked from its original launch because I wanted to refine the design and bring the whole deck closer to the original concept set out by Series One. I feel now, the whole deck has a cleaner more precise and elegant look, one that is important to have in every collection.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\nOriginally starting in the 1920s in Germany, the Netherlands and Russia, the \u2018Swiss Style\u2019 later developed in Switzerland in the 1950s. It\u2019s main principals are readability and cleanliness, with most creations adopting an asymmetric layout, always based on the use of a grid. These grids, usually made up of hidden columns and rows, are used to align words, numbers, pictures and patterns and so each series in the Grid collection adopts these principals. The works of designers such as Ernst Keller and Josef-M\u00fcller Brockmann have been a real inspiration from a graphic point of view. \nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nThe cards are poker size and printed by USPCC but are far from traditional. These cards will be printed on linen, magic air cushion stock which I know first hand really does feel like nothing else with fully customised tuck box and seal. As a graphic designer more than an illustrator, as well as a card collector, I wanted to find a way to combine two of my biggest passions and make a collection of decks which truly stand out from the crowd. I fully appreciate the incredible work of designers of other playing cards currently in the world, I am often drawn to the cards with incredible detail and illustration. After all, I am a Kickstarter backer as well as a creator. Personally, I see the detail of my decks as \u2018less is more\u2019, doing away with traditional pips and instead adopting a typographic format, with each card acting like a miniature poster, with bold words setting the theme rather than illustration and numbers.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nI have tried to keep the design minimal but functional, even the back of the card is super stripped back to just the name of the deck, with full colour bleed for real impact of colour. If, for example, you look at my version of the picture cards, they each have a diagonal line introduced as a minimal graphic, like a poster, but it replicates the diagonal line often found on traditional picture cards where the suit is duplicated and rotated. It\u2019s a small detail but it\u2019s my way of reflecting tradition.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nWith Grid Series Two, as well as vertical and horizontal alignment like in Grid Series One, I have introduced the circle to create a dial effect and explore how different grids can be adopted on playing cards. Each card has a bespoke set of alignment with the numbers and letters that sit on the edge of the circle so that they visually look to have the same alignment, whilst not always sitting in exactly the same place on each card.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nThe cards can be read and viewed in many different ways with only two being symmetrical.\nA) The card is written in it\u2019s full name; seven of diamonds. \nB) Traditional use in the corners with 7 and the diamond pip. \nC) Written with upper and lowercase next to it; Seven / Diamonds. \nD) Around the circle there is the current sequence of cards before and after; 6 7 8. \nE) Short hand code in the upper right corner; se/di \nF) In the lower left corner similar to Grid Series One, the current card is shown by the pip and lit up dots, with ones that don\u2019t apply being faded out for ace to ten, and then switching to diagonal lines for the picture cards; diamond pip with 7 white dots.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Each backer will receive 2 free phone background images of their selected cards available for download, as well as a PDF certificate of gratification to download. This is to say thank you and will include your name and backer number. Backers who would like these bonus items just need to message me after funding to confirm selection and I can send the files to them.\nTwo custom phone backgrounds for every backer\n   Signed Standard Edition\nIf you would like your deck signed, simply increase your pledge by \u00a35 per deck and message me to confirm this add on. You will be able to choose where the deck is signed and if you would like it resealed with protective plastic cellophane.\nLimited Edition\nThe limited edition Grid Series Two deck is an extremely rare product. There will only be 20 made, they will also never be printed again. These will be printed on professional grade plastic coated, lower stock than the standard edition, the same I used for Series One limited edition, this is purely because the print run is so small, I need to use a different printer to get them made. From previous campaigns, I know these are highly sought after, so keeping them so limited increases their exclusivity.\nUpdate - I did post this in my first update but thought best to note it here as well; the limited edition decks are currently all reserved, but if you would like to be added to the waiting list please still do message me!\nGrid Series Two - Limited Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Limited Edition\nEvery deck will be numbered and signed in a place of the backers choice. There is no limit to how many decks each backer can request out of the 20 made. Every deck will come with a printed certificate of ownership, signed and numbered to match the deck.\nGrid Series Two - Limited Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Limited Edition\nEach deck will cost \u00a325 which includes delivery and certificate of ownership. If you would like to add on any limited edition decks, please private message me directly to reserve a deck and be added to the waiting list.

The goal is to provide an alternative for the regular playing cards you use to play games with, but in my own unique flat design style. So I'm proud to present to you: Essentia Playing Cards!\n  Features:  \n54 fully customized poker size cards\nFully customized tuckbox on matte stock\nPrinted by LPCC\nClassic finish\nCasino grade quality\nSilver foiling on tuckbox (stretch goal: \u20ac6500)\nNumbered stamp sticker seal (stretch goal: \u20ac7000)\nInside tuckbox printing (stretch goal: \u20ac8000)\nEssentia is a fully customized deck of cards, with unique artwork on all 54 cards. Designed for both players and collectors.\nCourt cards \nThe court cards are based on standard courts, but completely redesigned from scratch in my own flat design style. I paid a lot of attention to the details that are hinting back to the standard courts. This way the courts are completely customized yet still very recognizable! \noverview of all the Essentia court cards\nAces \nI chose to customize the pips for all aces to make them stand out from the other cards. The ace of spades got some extra attention like usual, with an even larger pip and some decorative texts! \noverview of the aces\nJokers \nThe jokers in this deck are represented by The Four Magician Brothers! They each represent their own pip, which is very noticeable when you take a closer look at their clothes. The brothers are divided into the black magicians and the red magicians. Unique jokers that fit the style of the Essentia Deck perfectly! \nThe four magician brothers as jokers\nPips \nSet of pips designed from scratch\nThe pips of this deck all fit within a rectangular shape. The curves of the circles are also matched between the pips as much as possible. By using this framework the pips became a nice coherent set. Completely unique pips in a two tone flat design! \nNumber cards\ntraditionally arranged pips on the number cards\nThe number cards have traditionally arranged pips, because these cards are also made for players. Traditional arranged pips are best suitable for this!\n  The back design of the card is a personal version of the well known argyle pattern. I wanted to increase the detail level by customizing each 'diamond' with nice decorations and pips. A dark and light blue color is used to create a nice contrasting back design that looks both classy for playing and interesting for fanning.\n    For the tuckbox design, I wanted to create an overall clean look with the focus on the front and the back. I chose a dark blue main color to give it a sophisticated appearance.The front and back features a variant of the back design pattern in nice contrasting colors. The box will be printed on matte paper that works great in combination with flat design artwork. \nA classy tuckbox with lots of details that will look great in every collection!\nAnd on top of that: the stretch goals will make the tuckbox totally awesome!\nYou can add various extra items to your pledge, simply by increasing your pledge with the right amount of money.  Here is a list of the cool Essentia add-ons! \nExtra decks\nYou can add extra decks to your pledge to get the exact number of decks you want. If you want 8 decks for example, you can pledge for the 6 decks tier and add 2 decks by increasing your pledge by the right amount of money. You can find the additional costs in the overview table below.\nadd extra decks to get the exact amount you want\nLeather travel case (+ \u20ac17)  \nThis limited edition travel case will keep your deck clean and crisp when you toss it in your bag during traveling. The case is made of high quality genuine leather and it fits the Essentia deck perfectly. On the front side you will find a nice debossed and silver printed Essentia logo.\nOnly 100 pieces of these travel cases will be made, so be sure to grab one before they are all gone! (41 left @ 27/02/2018)\nLimited Edition genuine leather case\n  Close up of the debossing and silver foiling\nUncut sheet (+\u20ac30)  \nAn uncut sheet of the Essentia deck looks great on the wall as a unique decorative item. It is nice to display something different than regular posters or art pieces. These sheets will only be printed once, so they are a great collectors item and serve great as a unique gift!\nEssentia uncut sheet (frame not included)\nOverview \nIf you want to add one of the products to your pledge, simply increase your pledge with the correct amount of money. You can find a list of the add-on prices in the overview table below.\nFor example: If you want 3 decks and 1 leather case, please select the 3 decks pledge tier and add \u20ac17 to your pledge. So your total pledge amount should be \u20ac30 + \u20ac17 = \u20ac47 (\u20ac33 + \u20ac17 = \u20ac50 for international backers) \nExample 2: If you want 2 decks, an uncut sheet and 2 leather cases, please pledge for the 2 decks tier and add \u20ac30 for the uncut sheet and \u20ac31 for the two leather cases. Your total pledge amount should be \u20ac22 + \u20ac30 + \u20ac31 = \u20ac83 (\u20ac24 + \u20ac30 + \u20ac31 = \u20ac85 for international backers)\nI have set up some stretch goals to add extra features on to the deck after the funding goal is reached. These enhancements will make the decks even more attractive and unique!\n    The Essentia Deck will be manufactured by the Legends Playing Cards Company, which is a well known company by playing card enthusiasts. The quality of their decks are among the best of the world. \nTo ensure that your decks arrive safe and quickly, Legends will also handle the fulfillment of the decks. They did a great job last time for my Cultura project, and I am sure they will deliver the same quality this time.\nIf you are wondering what the shipped price per deck is for all the pledge levels and don't want to calculate it yourself, you might find the table below very useful! \n  The exchange rates of euro and other currencies change every day, so this is just an indication of the exchange rates at this moment.  \n\u20ac1,00 = 1,238 USD\n\u20ac1,00 = 0,879 GBP\n\u20ac1,00 = 1,529 AUD\nThe picture below shows the phases of this project. I will do my best to deliver everything according to this timeline. In the meantime, I will post some project updates regularly to keep you all informed.\n    Here are some cool freebies for all backers and visitors of this project: Exclusive Essentia profile badges!

Of course it's just the beginning in making these special decks. I'm really looking forward to seeing them completed and on their way to you soon.  \nI'll update here of course, and if you missed out, visit originscards.com\nWith sincere appreciation, Rick\nIn my previous campaigns I created premium quality decks based on some of the earliest traditional playing cards.  The decks have had amazing feedback.  My goal is always to produce a higher quality deck than the standard Kickstarter and I\u2019m now very excited to look to the future with De Novo, the United Cardists 2018 annual decks!\nWhere will we be hundreds of years from now, when the world we know today is forgotten?\nDe Novo - meaning 'starting anew\u2019 - conceptualises playing cards from a distant future with an elegant yet futuristic accent.\nUnique design, metallic green & gold foiled tucks\nInner foil on both tucks\nHigh quality tuck stock\nFully custom designed cards\nGreen & Gold metallic ink backs\nPremium black core casino grade cards\nCampaign only special pricing\nAll packs shipped in protective boxes\nThe premium tuck boxes of De Novo are hot stamped in green (Viridi) and gold (Aurum) foils with a unique mirror design that makes the pair a perfect collectors set.\n          The court cards of Viridi and Aurum feature complimentary yet unique styles - full colour illustration for Viridi, strong metallic inks for Aurum.\nInspired by today's standard design, each suit imagines characters from influential groups. The cards will remain a work in progress over the course of the campaign as I improve and finetune.\n              The De Novo backs feature ornate full metallic backs in green and gold. The artwork depicts a powerful global artificial intelligence, providing an instantaneous link to it's vast knowledge through a neural chip.\nThe standard suits have evolved but remain familiar for easier recognition.\n    Excellent!  Our First Stretch Goal is the addition of Embossing. This will lift the metallic foils and really make them pop.  For me, embossing is like icing on a cake.  Love it!\nWe already have inner foil but at $30K we'll take the inner foil one step further and add Internal Artwork.  Because we can.\nThese decks are already premium but this is a big one.  Every deck in each set will be numbered, and we'll do our best to keep pairs together.\n  Enhance your pack with these special additions. Like the decks themselves, these are available in a limited supply.\nTo add the above items to your De Novo pack:  \n1. Click the 'Manage your Pledge' or 'Back this project' button.  \n2. Enter your pledge total in the Pledge Amount box with the amount of your pledge tier and add-ons combined.  \n3. Once the campaign is closed you'll receive a survey where you can list the items you've pledged for.\nThank you for being a part of this exciting campaign.  \nI was proud to be asked to produce the United Cardists deck for 2018.  The forum has many passionate members, who were a huge help in my step into the world of card design.\nOver the last year or so I've created the Shadows of History deck, Rouen 1567 deck, Shadows Black Label, LUXX Greilles, and most recently the Cobra deck for JP Games.  It's been an amazing and busy time.  This may be my last campaign before I take a little important time out with my boys.  Thank you to everyone for your amazing support.\nI'm very excited to be working with another perfectionist in card production, Lotrek of OathPlayingCards. The decks will be printed in Greece by OPC under his close supervision. De Novo will be the first decks to feature OPC's \"MAESTRO\" finish, a coating that is specially formulated to give very smooth, high slip and silky handling. Lotrek has been developing the formula over the past 2 years and he is proud to present it through De Novo. The decks will be printed on the finest 320gsm playing card stock imported from France.\nShipping will be taken care of by the same experienced team who provided excellent service in my last campaign, with quality well boxed pledges.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third Kickstarter, and I am confident in the planning and team I have in place for this campaign. Minor issues can arise in production, but I always work hard to ensure all backers are pleased with their pledges.\n\nPlease note that there can be delays in shipping. In my previous campaign, domestic shipping across the US was over two weeks, and longer internationally, so I appreciate your patience as the packs ship.\n\nI am always improving the art so work shown above is subject to modifications and updates before production. All visuals are also concepts only and may vary slightly in the final product.\n\nWhile I do my very best to honour every pledge, unfortunately I cannot be held liable for replacement of packs damaged or missing during shipping. Please ensure you enter your address correctly when asked at the end of the campaign.\n\nThank you again for being a part of this journey into the future!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 20 or more", "title": "1 deck - Viridi", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\nViridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["57 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 20 or more", "title": "1 deck - Aurum", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\nAurum deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 36 or more", "title": "Mixed pair", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\nAurum deck\nViridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["114 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 69 or more", "title": "Two pairs", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Aurum deck\n2\u00d7 Viridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 98 or more", "title": "Half Brick", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Aurum deck\n3\u00d7 Viridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 168 or more", "title": "Full Mixed Brick", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 Aurum deck\n6\u00d7 Viridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 34 or more", "title": "Early Bird 48 hr - The Pair", "descp": "(US shipping inc)\nINCLUDES:\nAurum deck\nViridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "168 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 66 or more", "title": "Early Bird 48 hr - Two pairs", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Aurum deck\n2\u00d7 Viridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "63 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 89 or more", "title": "Early Bird 48 hr - Half Brick", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Viridi deck\n3\u00d7 Aurum deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "17 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NZ$ 146 or more", "title": "Early Bird 48 hr - Full Mixed Brick", "descp": "(US shipping included)\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 Aurum deck\n6\u00d7 Viridi deck", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "17 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Thank you.

This is exactly what we have been working on it for the past few weeks. This update is about everyone who still has to receive their coins.\n\nWinter is here and with him the holiday shipping season has started earlier than expected. The past couple of months we have faced several issues with multiple logistics partners that we use when shipping games and coins. These issues include delays in both picking up items and delivery times.\nEven Gamesquest, our trusted fulfilment partner who is in charge of shipping out this campaign was affected by this situation, but since we delivered to them the coins a month in advance most of you received them in time.\n\nHowever, we still have some backers that their pledge has not yet been shipped.\nThe , but were not included in the initial batch of sets to be shipped out. \n\nUnfortunately, right now Gamesquest cannot guarantee that the coins will all be shipped in time for you to have before Christmas. They are overwhelmed by work and even though they will try to make it happen, they have informed us that it doesn't seem likely. However, they informed us that by the 15th of January things will return to normality and they will be able to ship them out to you.\nWe have been thinking this over for the past weeks, and unfortunately, we feel our hands here are tied. Even though they are willing to ship the coins to someone else to fulfil the coins to you, it is a very complicated project that nobody else can guarantee to do it faster without any mistakes. Therefore, we have decided to wait for them to ship the coins. We always prefer a job well done over a hastily done one.\nEven though there is a chance to ship them out during December, we expect them to be shipped between 5-15 of January.\n\nIt is not a situation we are happy with,since we have manufactured the coins and we will be more than happy when you will receive them. We remain steadily focused on making a quality product that makes people happy to game with, and after the coins are made we can hardly wait to see them in your hands. \n\nFinally, we had some super late backers, who completed the pledge manager outside the deadline. Their coins are being manufactured as we speak and will be shipped in 2019 for sure.\n\nIf you have any questions please let us know and will get back to you asap.\nAs you may have noticed we are responding to every single comment made in our campaign by mail and we will be even more active in the comment section these days.\n\n~TL DR version: The coins are ready but after a shipping delay will be shipped in the next 30 days. ~\n\nHappy holidays to all of you and many wishes from your friends at Drawlab :)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update: Deliveries, Pledge Manager Lock and more", "update_content": "Hello awesome backers!\nWe are glad to read that you have been receiving your coins.

We explore the primordial battle between good and evil, highlighting it\u2019s intersection of the natural elements.\n  Fine Silver Series - details in Update #14!!\n  PLAY\n\nOur coins can be used in practically any tabletop rpg, board game or larp- as treasure, markers, rewards, magic items or of course as currency.\nIn this, our Forgotten Creatures series we\u2019ve designed coins without denomination so they can be used in an even wider range of games.\nPLAY\n\nThose of you familiar with our previous coin campaigns and our actual products, know you can depend on quality craftsmanship, attention to detail, swift fulfillment & a highly qualified team that is dedicated to bringing fantasy to life.\nPlease check out the links above to see our previous campaigns which were under the Osborne Coinage account.\nAs of October 2017, we are no longer a division of Osborne Coinage, though all of our coins are still produced in their facility in Cincinnati, Ohio (100% Made in the USA). They have a long history of producing coins with crisp detail out of pure materials that will withstand the test of time. \nThe quality and attention to detail you have come to expect from us will continue!\nOur journey continues with this Kickstarter - while we are no longer employees of the mint, we still have their faith & support. Because we can no longer depend on their financial backing, we are not able to produce coins before successful crowdfunding.\nThey still believe in us, which is why they agreed to create the Swarm of Pixies & Water Dragon dies & a few samples for us to share with you, upfront.\nAll of the artwork for each design is complete and we are ready to begin production of the remaining dies, with your support. \nSwarm of Pixies with art\n  Reverse, Antiqued Copper\n        All of our coins used together give an even greater depth, as multi-cultural currency that reflects your travels through various realms.\nWe encourage you to explore our Instagram & Facebook feeds as well as our website, for more details, behind the scene production shots & to see our other lines of Fantasy Currency.\nSwarm of Pixies, art\nEach step from initial sketch to finished coin requires a great deal of precision to meet our high standards. Kerry & Miya take the design of each coin very seriously. We proof & revise every step of the way, from concept art, final line work, the engravers renderings to the final die.\nWater Dragon coin, art & die\n  Water Dragon with dies\nOur coins differ greatly from cast coinage, (not all, but most gaming coins are cast, not struck) where molten metal is poured into a mold. All of our coins are solid metal, die struck using the same process as U.S. currency.\n  Werewolf, art\n    Leviathan, art\n  Water Dragon, art\n  Water Dragon with art\n      Griffin, art\n      PLAY\n\n Updated, Foundry Hoard reward tiers:\n Updated, From The Vault reward tiers:\n Additional photos and descriptions on our website.\nNot shown, Forgotten Creatures Full Set!\n     Additional product descriptions and photos of our existing items can be found on our website. \n   How to calculate add on items: Backers may purchase as many additional coin sets as they wish by adding the appropriate amount to their pledge.\nCalculate the correct amount to pledge by adding the price of the add on item(s) you would like, to the price of the reward tier you have selected.\nReward tier prices include domestic shipping, so as you will notice, Add On pricing for the same item is a little less.\n     NEW RELEASE! \nFine Silver!  - Please see Backer Update #14 for more details!

And while we are intimately familiar with the process, due to confidentiality agreements with our manufacturer we can only disclose so much of that process. As a private mint (the oldest in North America!), they have obvious reasons to keep trade practices confidential.\nThe basic manufacturing process starts in two different places: With the dies & the coin blanks. Both are made in house.\nKerry\u2019s fine art and Miya\u2019s reverse designs are translated into 3D by Master Sculptor, Randy Caskey, final materials are turned over to Osborne so that their engravers can cut the final production dies.\nThe coin blanks are punched from metal strip, on site at Osborne. They are washed & processed before they are ready to become a coin. Next is the \u201ccoining\u201d process, the blanks & dies finally meet! The coin is struck only once using both dies. Most of our coins & all in the Forgotten Creatures line, are Antiqued. This is a complex process that involves multiple steps & accurate chemistry. The freshly struck coins are oxidized, buffed & lacquered. This creates the aged, ancient feel & brings out every line of detail in Kerry\u2019s artwork.\nKerry & I proof each step of the way, ensuring we get an expertly detailed scene, die struck onto solid coin blanks that will withstand the test of time!\nThe creatures, people and lore depicted on our coins exist in a world plagued by an ancient magical corruption that is slowly breaking free of its primordial cage.\nAges ago a pair of fearless sovereigns sacrificed themselves to lock away this great corruption found deep beneath the forest.\nOver the millennia their power has begun to wane and a foulness seeps up from the very earth, mutating everything in its path.\nFew remain who know the secrets of the Foundry and the whispers of dark times to come. The guardians of the Foundry can no longer hold back the force that is corrupting the very fabric of our world, polluting minds and devastating the lands.\nWe\u2019ve created a unique universe and are thrilled to share our take on classic myths and creatures. We hope you enjoy the tales we weave and the art we create. \nAt it\u2019s core Rare Elements Foundry is dedicated to melding fine art, design and craftsmanship to produce high quality coinage. But we also hope to tell a compelling story. Both with the coins themselves & the lore we develop. \nLook for our Adventure Prompt contests on FaceBook & follow our blog posts, which will explore the myths, legends and lore we have created. Our coins can be used with any campaign or adventure, but we hope you will enjoy & be inspired by what we have created!\n  We guarantee our coins are the highest quality, minted using the same standards as United States currency, with pure materials and timeless craftsmanship. But don't take our word for it - here are testimonials from our previous backers and customers.\n\"I received my shipment today and am very pleased. The quality of the coins are impeccable, communication as to what I was getting and the status of the project was solid, the speed of shipment from the end of the project was simply the best I have experienced in any kickstarter project. A model for other projects for sure.\" - Richard\n\"Rare elements is by far one of the best fantasy coin makers I have ever encountered. The details on each coin and the feel of each one is undeniably high quality. We use these coins with great honor with all our fantasy games now and forevermore. You will not be upset with your purchase of these fantastic pieces of art.\" - Tim\n\"Just got my fire dragon, and all I can say is...WOW! The detail is superb! That sound you hear is me kicking myself for not getting the entire set! I'll ask what is probably a premature question: do you have more KickStarter plans?\" - Alan\n\"I JUST got my box in the mail! THE COINS LOOK/FEEL MARVELOUS! The 500 Smoke Denom is spectacular, and a lovely thing to behold. I'm left breathless by the quality. Count me in for backing any and all future campaigns you offer!\" - Keegan\n\u201cBeen with you guys since the beginning of the first Kickstarter and am absolutely blown away by delivery. Exceeded expectations. Worth every penny. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SINCERELY.\u201d \u2013 Chris\n\u201cMy coins arrived about 1/2 an hour ago. They are truly amazing! Wish I had pledged for more, guess I'll have to check out the new webstore once it is up and running! Will definitely continue to support you guys as long as you continue to put this much skill and passion into gaming coins. Any chance you have considered Sci-Fi themed coins for a future Kickstarter? That would please me and my gaming group immensely!! :^D\u201d \u2013 Michael \n\u201cI just got my shipment of coins and they blew my MIND!~  All of the coins are so beautiful and detailed. I have to say that pictures don't do the Smoke Behemoth justice. It's an amazingly huge and lovely coin. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future. \u201c - Crystal\n\"So glad I opted for the Silver Dragon! It has to be one of the most beautiful pieces in my precious metals collection.  No need for any extras to gain my loyalty, you have a fan for life, and I will back all of the projects you care to launch. I'm really looking forward to the next set, especially since you've set the bar so high with this one.  Thanks for this project, it has been nothing but enjoyable from beginning to end.\" - Roger\nFounded in 2013 - Miya Sohoza developed the concept for Rare Elements in the hopes to bring high quality fantasy coins to pen and paper RPGs.

You\u2019re staying at one of the three major establishments in Deadwood where you and your associates are working together to steal some of the gold-filled safes floating around town. But you suspect that the \u201cfriends\u201d you\u2019re working with are secretly plotting to keep all the gold for themselves. Will you be ready to turn on them before they shoot you in the back?\nDeadwood 1876 is a social deduction game where you'll work with teammates to find and collect gold. But in the end, the team with the most gold will have to fight each other to the death to determine the winner! Will you spend your turns helping your team find gold, or preparing to defeat your own teammates in the Final Showdown?\n2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 13+.\n1 Magnetic book box\n1 Faux leather pouch\n1 Rulebook (includes character biographies and Deadwood history)\n3 Wood carved platforms\n9 Wood star pawns\n10 Wood engraved dice\n79 cards (9 Characters, 20 Safes, 50 Deadwood)\nThe game comes in a magnetically-closing faux book. Extra room is provided in the center section should you desire to sleeve the cards.\nThe wood establishment platforms conjure the look of an old western storefront. Since each platform is stained and laser cut, the wood grain and color will be slightly unique in each copy of the game. The platforms are laser cut in the negative space, so each letter and design comes outwards.\nThe ten wooden dice each use custom designs instead of standard dots. Each colored dice corresponds to a gun in the game and has different values depending on the gun. Each die is colored and engraved.\n Nine wooden stars act as the pawns in the game.\n The dice and stars come in a faux leather bag.\nThe 9 characters are based on people who actually lived in or visited Deadwood in 1876. Character biographies are included in the rule book. Each character card is colored on the front, and black and white on the back.\nThe 20 Safe cards are designed to look like genuine safes from the 1870's.\nEach of the 50 Deadwood cards contains a gun on top and a special item on the bottom.\nIn Deadwood 1876 you\u2019ll use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!\nNote: The video above gives a brief overview of rules. Strategy tips, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, card descriptions, and character biographies are all included in the game rule book. We currently have rules available to view in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch on our website. You can also view the contents of this page in Chinese.\nValuable items are hidden behind each Safe. You won't know which Safes have been shuffled in, so every round will play out differently.\nEach player always has 4 Deadwood cards in their hand. You'll get to play one card from your hand each turn, and then it will be replaced from the deck.\nEach card can either be used as the gun listed on top, or the special item listed on the bottom. The Holster lets you help out teammates, the Stetson lets you view hidden Safes, the Horse lets you abandon your team for a different one, and the Duster lets you improve your hand of cards.\nThe more powerful guns, such as the Messenger, have higher values on its dice, whereas worse guns, such as the Pepperbox, have lower values and zeros on its dice.  For shootouts you'll need to manage your hand and decide when to use a powerful gun and when to gamble with your weaker guns.\nEach player takes on the identity of one of nine people who actually roamed the streets of Deadwood.\nA game in progress.\nThis game requires teamwork, but also actively punishes you if you play too nice. That balance makes every round insane. - Sam J.\nMix strategy with the best and the worst of the Wild West, and you get Deadwood. - Charlotte C.\nThe strategy never gets old and I consistently find myself playing with new options every single game. -Spencer H.\nBackstabbing has never been so much fun. This game keeps you on your toes. It is not one you can play half-heartedly. -Abigail S.\nThe more I play Deadwood, the less likely I am to trust other players. When I trust them too much, they take my gold and shoot me with a gun they stole from me. I always regret it. -Patti S.\nIntrigues of Deadwood 1876 video from Beasts of War.\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\nMechanics\nDeadwood is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best Deadwood cards and Badges to hunt down Gold for their team, they\u2019ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates in the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Showdown Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight, they\u2019re probably plotting to use your Gold to reach the Final Showdown and then destroy you! There may come a point when you need to attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\nTheme\nWhen we were searching for the city for the 3rd Volume in the Dark Cities Series, we fell in love with Deadwood almost immediately upon learning about it. Large deposits of gold were discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota in late 1875. Word quickly spread about the gold and the town of Deadwood was born almost overnight in early 1876. It soon reached a population of 5,000 miners, gamblers, prostitutes, outlaws, and businessmen. Lawlessness was prevalent as people flocked to the town to find (or steal) their share of the gold. Deadwood quickly became an infamous western town where old west legends lived and died.\nThe book has a raised UV effect so that all designs and logos pop out from the cover and spine.\nDesign\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players into the world of the wild wild west! We used wood and leather textures with our components, old west Victorian charm with our book and character cards, and cards that look like antiqued metal Safes built by the \"Facade Safe & Lock Co\" similar to Safes from the time period. The goal of our design is to take you and your friends deep into the raucous, chaotic, exciting world of Deadwood, South Dakota in its prime. You can view time-lapse videos of Sarah illustrating Molly Johnson, Solomon Star, Seth Bullock, Kitty Leroy, and the Holster.\nWe've already made many \"premium\" choices for the game (wooden platforms instead of cardboard, faux leather bag instead of plastic, wooden star tokens instead of standard pawns, faux book instead of standard box, etc.), because we believe in publishing awesome games regardless of funding amounts. But if we reach the following milestones, we'll be able to make Deadwood 1876 even better!\nNote: Some of these upgrades will be exclusive to the 1st Edition of Deadwood 1876. Backing on Kickstarter is the only way to guarantee that all upgrades listed above will be included in your copy of the game.\nWe've been working hard on logistics all year and for this campaign we're very pleased to offer free US shipping at all reward levels, and low international shipping rates. We are also using fulfillment companies around the world so that you won't be charged extra customs fees. If you are mistakenly charged customs fees when the games arrive, just let us know and we'll pay you back. (For EU backers, we will be shipping games from Germany so you won't have extra customs fees)\nBecause of cheaper shipping, we\u2019re happy to be selling Deadwood 1876 at prices that are even cheaper than the early bird levels of our previous two Kickstarter projects!\nDeadwood 1876 is Volume 3 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. \nVolume 1: Tortuga 1667 (Published 2017 thanks to Kickstarter!). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website. Tortuga was recently nominated as the best party game of 2017 by Board Game Geek!\nVolume 2: Salem 1692 (Published as \"Salem\" in 2015 thanks to Kickstarter! Second edition published as \"Salem 1692\" in 2017). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website.\nBoth of our released games have sold over 20,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 4, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! See Add-Ons section below for details.\nIf your pledge includes at least one copy of Deadwood 1876 then you can add an unlimited amount of Tortuga 1667, Salem 1692, or extra copies of Deadwood 1876 to your pledge! Just add the indicated amounts below to your pledge amount without changing your reward level. After the campaign we'll send out a survey where you'll select which games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section or shoot us a message.\nYour shipping cost does not increase at all regardless of your location or the amount of add-ons you order. You will receive all add-on items at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery October 2018).\n Examples:\nYou are outside the US and want 2 copies of each game. Select the $43 reward level and pledge $129 ($43 two-copies reward level + $6 reward level int'l shipping + $40 two add-ons of Salem + $40 two add-ons of Tortuga).\nYou are in the US and want 6 copies of Deadwood, 1 copy of Salem, and 10 copies of Tortuga. Select the $110 reward level and pledge $300 ($110 six-copies reward level  + $20 Salem add-on + $170 Tortuga large group add-on). \nIf you want Deadwood and Salem, Deadwood and Tortuga, or one of each game, we have reward levels available for those options.\nOur illustrator Sarah Keele wants to turn you into a Dark Cities character! During the campaign Sarah is offering a limited number of discounted custom portraits in her shop! We will then turn this portrait into a card that you'll be able to use during game play in your copy of Deadwood 1876!\nCustom Character Cards are also available in her shop for Tortuga 1667 and Salem 1692. Discounts are also available in her shop during the campaign for other art from the game.\nFollow her instagram for other giveaways and discounts.\nWe will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account on April 10th using the CrowdOx pledge manager system. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey at this link anytime after April 10th: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/travishancock/deadwood-1876-a-safe-robbing-game-of-teamwork-and\nGame creation and graphic design is by Facade Games, owned and operated by Travis and Holly Hancock (and our little cheerleader Margo).

This game would not exist without your ideas, feedback, and criticisms. Thank you!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem. We had another great experience with the launch of our second game, Tortuga 1667. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the very 1st edition of the game, the lowest shipping costs we can offer, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We also take your feedback into account before launching production. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete.

The forbidden tome. The impossible otherworld. A textual entryway into\n\"...a place where everything was transfixed in the order of the unreal. . . . Each passage he entered in the book both enchanted and appalled him with images and incidents so freakish and chaotic that his usual sense of these terms disintegrated along with everything else. Rampant oddity seemed to be the rule of the realm; imperfection became the source of the miraculous \u2014 wonders of deformity and marvels of miscreation. There was horror, undoubtedly. But it was a horror uncompromised by any feeling of lost joy or thwarted redemption; rather, it was a deliverance by damnation. And if Vastarien was a nightmare, it was a nightmare transformed in spirit by the utter absence of refuge: nightmare made normal.\"\nOur name is drawn from Thomas Ligotti\u2019s classic story of the same title (quoted above). Vastarien is a source of critical study and creative response to the corpus of Thomas Ligotti as well as associated authors and ideas. The inaugural issue is going to be something unusually special, filled with in-depth essays, interviews, weird fiction, terrific poetry, and fascinating hybrid pieces by some of the best authors out there.  An interview with Thomas Ligotti and an introduction by him, neither of which have ever been presented in English, are included. \nAnd we are open for submissions for issues 2 and 3 right now.\nAll galley proofs for Issue 1 have been approved. Final cover art is by the incomparable Dave Felton for the inaugural issue of Vastarien.

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD Homicide detectives that will do whatever it takes to solve the case, but one player will take on the role of The Chisel whose goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn. \nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a mystery and crime solving game unlike any other. \n    4 unique sculpts are included in the game. Prototype sculpts shown here.\n  Detective: City of Angels is a VRG Select title. This means that it will not be sold through normal retail channels. It will be available at the best price to backers of this Kickstarter campaign, for preorder/late pledge at a higher price through our pledge manager, and eventually through our website, at conventions, and/or through other direct partners. For more information see Update #9 here.\n          Each case is beautifully illustrated by renowned artist Vincent Dutrait, creating a rich and gritty noire atmosphere.\n  Detectives will explore every shadowy corner of the City of Angels, rendered in gorgeous and authentic detail on a massive 33x21 inch game board. The game board is based on an amazing public domain map created in 1932 by K. M. Leuschner, which Vincent has lovingly updated and adorned with his own touches.\n     Click here to download the rulebook for Detective: City of Angels. This is the rulebook that was sent to reviewers and uses prototype components and art. It is NOT the final version! \nWith 9 cases included and the option to play competitively, cooperatively (see below), or even solo (see below), Detective: City of Angels will provide hours of mystery-solving gaming.\nPlus, go all in for the Hardboiled Pledge level and get Bullets Over Hollywood, the first expansion which includes four additional cases, putting even more noir goodness on your table!\n      While we highly recommend the game be played competitively, the versatility of Detective: City of Angels is such that it can also be played cooperatively against \"The Chisel\" or Cooperatively/Solitaire with no Chisel player. \nPlaying cooperatively against the Chisel removes the \"corruption\" elements and the detectives become a team working together to solve the case. There is still competition with the Chisel though. \nAlternatively, this KS will come with a 64-page Solo/Cooperative case book and case grid cards that allows the game to be played without a Chisel player as the book will simulate the play of the Chisel. In particular, playing the game solo is a great way to prepare for your first game as The Chisel! \nDesign of solitaire case cards and solitaire paragraph book is not final.\nIn each of these modes of play the ARC system is in the spotlight and the competitive elements of the game, like scratch and bribe actions, are removed. The focus is primarily on solving the case and immersing yourself in the role of a detective.\nAn important question with scenario-based mystery solving games such as Detective: City of Angels is: how replayable is the game? \nWhile detective players will not be able to experience a given case again as a detective (since they'll already know the solution), anyone can play the same case multiple times as The Chisel. In fact, it even benefits The Chisel to have played a case more than once! The Chisel will understand how the mystery works and have a better grasp of how to mislead and delay the detectives during their investigation. \nIn fact, a case can unfold VERY differently depending on how the detectives pursue their investigations, always forcing The Chisel to stay on his or her toes even if it's a case he or she's already played.\nDetective player boards\n  Rahdo Runs Through\nThe below video has Richard \"Rahdo\" Ham's final thoughts on the game.

Because of the huge narrative aspect of the game, it's a real challenge to bring to life all the iconic characters and well-know places. I've never worked on a game with a \"film noir\" atmosphere before, and I did a lot a research to find precise documents and great references, all in support of helping the players immerse themselves deeply in the game and the city of Los Angeles in the 1940s. Another tricky challenge was to get the right tone and to capture the right mood! Working with Evan and the Van Ryder team has been incredibly rewarding as we worked so hard to share and convey our points of view with the players. We wanted to give them the chance to live out the stories and everyday life of Detectives & Mob characters.\"\n\"Technically, I really enjoy to working on 'fake' illustrations, imitating textures, objects, colors and lights of past periods, which is a unique opportunity. I also enjoy bringing the characters to life, giving them authenticity, truth and credibility! Furthermore, Detective is a fascinating project because of all the different component sizes and elements: I have to develop precise and accurate solutions for building the box, cards, boards and tokens in order to get the most cohesive ensemble!\"\nMiniatures\nWe would like to thank James Van Schaik for his incredible sculpting work on the miniature in Detective. Thanks to him, each player will have his or her own miniature to move around the City of Angels!\nJames has worked on many top grossing kickstarters including Gloomhaven, Defense Grid, Myth, Mercs, Relic Knights, Dreadball, and many more. As a sculptor, he has worked with Ral Partha, WizKids, Wyrd Miniatures, Games Workshop, Mantic, Megacon Games, Ninja Division, Soda Pop Miniatures, Pulp City, Battlefront, Gale Force 9, Dust Tactics, Reaper, Gloomhaven, and Lynnvander.\nSee the many projects he has developed here on Artstation.

It was great.. Look under the crowd funded projects!  http://www.thesecretcabal.com/Home/ArtMID/426/ArticleID/201/Episode-146-Folklore-The-Affliction-Mythos-Tales-and-A-Spooky-Short-Topic-Extravaganza\nSYFY WIRE! It's a great write up - and we're thrilled to have the SyFY community's interest. Check it out!\nExclusive first looks at FOUR more recipes\nhttp://www.syfy.com/syfywire/stuff-we-love-necronomnomnom-cookbook \nA Note About Shipping:\nTo be fair to everyone, shipping will be charged AFTER the Kickstarter concludes. Shipping will be based on the actual costs incurred to ship. \n\nFunds will be collected via the pledge manager after the campaign concludes and the product is ready. \n\nThe below are estimates for international shipping based on a 2lb weight and 9\u201dx12\u201dx1.5\u201d size (the final product could weigh a bit less, or more...it doesn't exist yet, so...you know how this goes). These rates do not cover VAT taxes and other fees. These fees will be determined after end of the campaign, and based on your information/location. \nWe will be using a fulfilment service, and availability of shipping, and pricing, will be dependent on the service. We\u2019ll have an estimator and shipping map up as soon as possible. Backers ordering physical products should be aware that some parts of the world are just not shipping-friendly. If a professional fulfillment company can\u2019t get it there - we sure can\u2019t. While we\u2019d like to have anyone interested be a backer - we have to have a service willing to get a physical product to you. If you know you are in such an area, please limit your pledge to the digital-only offering. \nUS - $10 , Canada - $17, Mexico - $18, Europe - $21-26, Brazil - $18 Australia - $28-$35, Asia - $28-$40\n(note-within-a-note - we think these are on the high side)\nOther regions will depend on backer information. The above estimates are subject to change pending final weights, dimensions and backer information. Fulfillment all depends on the shipping company and publisher. If all goes smoothly, you can expect the book in your hands (or inbox for digital purchases) approximately 6 months from the end of the Kickstarter. We\u2019ll keep you updated, and appreciate your interest, support, and patience.  \nSTRETCH GOALS:\n#1 - $35,000 USD - READ THE BOOK OUT LOUD!  \nDONE!

Muhhaaahhaaaahhhaaaa - RDG\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Risks: where to begin. - it's a Kickstarter, trusting in the basic good nature and kindness of humanity at large, jellyfish population explosions, we have day jobs, art costs money, we need to incorporate to protect our families (think of the children!) - all of this costs money, too (not that much - almost all of the funding requested goes into the book's production, both virtual and physical).\n\nHow will we overcome these challenges? This thing will haunt our dreams, destroy our sanity, and eat our souls if we don't bring it into reality (how's that for motivation?). It's been years in development; we've been hoarding recipes, researching the correct look, and searching for the perfect artist, and we think you'll enjoy this even more than we enjoyed creating it. We really want it to be a thing (or a Thing). \n\nWe understand that Things can go wrong, timelines slide, and costs escalate unexpectedly - but we believe we've taken \"worst case scenarios\" into account and have done our homework.\n\nOnce the Kickstarter is funded we will be able to incorporate, get our artist and our cover designer working and paid. Also, retain a fulfillment service, as well as sign the contract for our publisher. All of this is already lined up and ready to go. We are giving ourselves a 6-9 month window to get you your books. We are going to do our level best to make sure your books get to you in that time frame, but we've funded Kickstarter's ourselves, and know how these things can go. \n\nWe're committed to the project. We're honest dudes. We want this to lead to bigger things for us, and more great products for you. If this flies, it just might get us into creative endeavors instead of \"day jobs\".

They make the best playing cards in the world, including Bicycle\u00ae and Bee\u00ae, casino-quality decks. The smallest batch they will produce is 2,500 decks, so that's why your pledges will give me the funds and quantities to manufacture with such a great company.\nThis deck is being printed on Bicycle\u00ae card stock, with Air-Cushion finish. Air-Cushion finish is a linen-textured coating on the cards that give them an incredibly smooth, slippery feel. They're a pleasure to play with.\nThe USPCC's high-quality industrial printing presses give the cards a rich, vibrant colour, and the lettering is very crisp and legible.\n   The Rewards\n \n The Design Deck\nIn 2014, I designed and kickstarted the Design Deck, and received tremendous support from the design community, with almost 1000 backers.\nSince then, thousands have of Decks have been sent to dozens of countries. The Design Deck is available as a reward for this campaign, so you can have the pair of decks. If you'd like to purchase the Design Deck and get it right away, click here to visit my website.\n\nTypeface Poster\nAnother pledge reward for backing the Font Deck is the 'How to Choose a Typeface' poster that I designed. It allows you to answer a few simple questions, follow the flow chart, and then arrive at the perfect font for your project.\n\nThe History of Typography\nA few years ago, I created a stop-motion animation about the history of typography.

So here's a quick explanation of the process.\nKickstarter isn't a store, but you can think of it as a way to support the creative process with the potential of getting rewards for your support.  When you back a project, you\u2019re helping to create something new \u2014 not ordering something that already exists.\nHOW TO PLEDGE\nSelect a pledge amount and reward on either the right-hand side of a project page or after clicking the \u201cBack this project\u201d button and selecting \u201cContinue\u201d. From here you\u2019ll be taken to a page where you can continue as a guest, or login if you already have an account. If you would like to continue as a guest, just enter your email address and select \u201cContinue as Guest\u201d.\nMake sure to double check your email address \u2013 that\u2019s where you\u2019ll receive your pledge confirmation details, messages from the project creator, and a survey to provide details needed to deliver your reward if the project is successful.\nNext, fill in your payment details and take a minute to review your pledge details. When you\u2019re ready, just click the green \u201cPledge\u201d button.\nPRODUCTION\nAll artwork and text are signed, sealed, and delivered to the manufacturer. While I do not foresee any issues with manufacturing please be aware that the final product may very slightly from the what is seen.\nI am happy to announce that I will be teaming up with Gambler's Warehouse to accomplish fulfillment.\nPlease give good addresses to make sure your rewards get to you.\nPackages can get lost or stolen or held in customs.

He recovered the wood from the original Evil Dead 2 set and will be signing the certificates of authenticity.\n More Add-Ons will unlock as the campaign goes on!

We\u2019ve provided art and creative services for Marvel, DC, Nike, Microsoft, Universal Studios, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. You can be sure that this premium box of Deadite-slaying goodness is in good hands.\nKickstarter is a fantastic tool not just for funding great projects, but for helping fans become aware those projects exist while getting them involved with the creative process. That\u2019s what we hope to do with our Kickstarter campaign. Plus with the help of Evil Dead fans and Kickstarter we can add more bad ass miniatures, game play expansions, and extra Evil Dead greatness that we would never be able to offer without their help.  \nAdditionally, we want to reward hardcore Evil Dead fans by offering exclusives to Kickstarter backers, like a deluxe edition of the game with an Ex-Mortis box, which has miniatures of combat Ash and Deadite Henrietta. We want to make the best, most official Evil Dead 2 game possible, and we can only do that with your help.\nSome of the top game and horror press outlets like Comic Book Resources, Deadites Online, HorrorFuel, iHorror, Bloody Disgusting, Popcorn Horror and MovieWeb have covered the game, and here's what other press has had to say about it:\n\"Our dream of giving deadite scum a fistful of boomstick from the comfort of our own living rooms is about to come a reality.\" - Dread Central\n\"An 'Evil Dead 2' card game is coming\u2014and it looks super groovy\" - The Daily Dot\n\"...an official tile and figure based survival game that every Evil Dead fan is going to want to own.\" -GoresTruly\n\"Much like a more bad-ass, interactive version of Clue..\" - Wicked Horror\n\"[With} the idea that the players are working together but they can turn against their friends and you have an interesting concept for a game\" - Beasts of War\n\"Smells like a cash-in.\" -Some guy on Reddit\n\"As unappealing as any form of game is to me at this point in life, I\u2019d jump at the opportunity to pick this one up...I\u2019m certain a great deal of genre fans would strangle a Deadite to get their hands on this beauty!\" - HorrorFreak News \n\"Here\u2019s one that, I\u2019m sure, will get a lot of people going, 'Oh, I\u2019m soooooo going to be backing that!!'\" - Tabletop Gaming News\n\"[It] looks like it will be a frightening twist on family game night.\" - Daily Dead\nHere's a listicle from our boss you can read and share around social media.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter ends based on actual shipping costs and is collected via Backerkit.

We will, however, ensure a global release of any Evil Dead 2: The official Board Game products for retailers.\n\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter, however we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.\n\n======= \nRefunds \n=======\n\nRefunds may be given within 60 days of the campaign ending including fees. After this time refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees due to us not being able to claim them back after 60 days.\n\nIf we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project (around 6-8 weeks before the actual shipping date) we are unable to refund at this stage.\n\nRefunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit/debit card. Refunds after 60 days of the campaign ending are processed via PayPal only.\n\nThis is a USD Kickstarter and refunds will be processed in USD for the amount received, excluding any applicable fees dependent on the day at which the refund is processed as detailed above.\n\n================= \nTerms and Conditions \n=================\n\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details within 10 weeks of our notification via email to confirm it will be treated as abandoned. We will however look at each case sympathetically and try our best to satisfy each customer.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that our responsibility to you is for shipping your order as entered into the pledge management system. You are responsible for import or other duties that may be payable to relevant tax authorities. You also accept that you are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and will risk your pledge being unable to be delivered or lost in transit.\n\nWe are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept the proposed terms please do not pledge on this Kickstarter project and wait for the global general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Digital Copy of Evil Dead 2: Beyond Dead by Dawn #1 and all of the Kickstarter updates about the game!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2016"}], "stat": ["79 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Beyond Dead Comic Book Collection", "descp": "Receive a digital copy of the Evil Dead 2:Beyond by Dawn graphic novel, our first Evil Dead storyline.

Dominus seek to represent light and darkness with a mirrored 2-deck theme, Divinus and Obscura.\nObscura (Darkness) vs. Divinus (Light)\n  Dominus is the artistic and spiritual successor to my Indictus project, and this time each court card tells a unique story of fate, destiny, choice and consequence! Click HERE to see the deck gallery in HD on Imgur, and track the project Updates to see the background stories of the rulers. \nMatte deluxe tuck cases designed with hot stamped gold foil and embossing effects only. The stock is similar to Golden Spike by Jody Eklund and Defunctorum by Roman Kotiv. \nDivinus (Light) vs. Obscura (Darkness)\nDivinus reads Lux mundi Justitia (Justice is the light of the world), which is a motto of Johann Georg I, Elector of Saxony (1585-1656), next to an embossed Fleur De Lis. Obscura reads Felix Culpa below the embossed goat skull, representing Baphomet and the Underworld.\nThe Dominus tuck seals displaying the title, unique no. and total amount of decks made\n  The back of the tuck cases. No printing. It's all gold foil and embossing effect. Seals are optional.\n  Decorated with royal, divine, religious and occult symbolism the two backs represent the european monarchs moral codex and reign. The noble and honourable ruler will stay on a path of light. The relentless ruler may be lured by the underworld in ambitious blindness, soon to be set on a new path. For both editions, the 2-way artwork is a single Pantone ink with gold pigment. Click HERE to see the deck gallery in HD on Imgur.\nBacks printed in metallic ink with golden pigment\n  4 Knights (Jacks), 4 Queens and 4 Kings of European monarchies. All illustrated on their moral right paths in the Divinus deck, while the Obscura deck features the same rulers in their darker versions. The afterlife is unforgiving and may turn your gift or talent into a curse that will haunt you forever. All are in a mirrored design and illustrated by hand in collaboration with the talented Eugen Poe. I can\u2019t take full credit for these.

This affect is also vectored artwork, and not just a filter. A decision voted by backers - and I love it!\nThe number cards of Divinus (Divinity & Light)\n  Divinus face cards all have a delicate frame to represent the limits of self control. Tiffany Fordyce explained it better than I can: \"The caged has a lot of symbolism in the restraint of self-control, the mask being worn, the lens through which the pawns (pips) view their courtly overlords. It also adds an air of elegance and refinery to the deck that I think would be appropriate for the Divinus deck. By contrast, the lack of cage on the others would symbolize open freedom to do whatever is pleased, the visible corruption in the lordship, the lack of self-restraint and the ugliness (lack of elegance) that comes with corruption.\" \nThe number cards of Obscura (Darkness & Consequence)\n  The Obscura face cards are frameless to illustrate the unrestricted moral codex of the darker side of mind. There are no boundaries to the conscience.\nThe Aces of Divinus (Divinity & Light)\n  The Aces of Obscura (Darkness & Consequence)\nClick HERE to see the deck gallery in HD on Imgur.\nBoth Divinus and Obscura has a set of 2 jokers. Here you can see one from each deck. I want the jokers to represent the path of all that is right and all that is selfish.  \nThe darkness wants to consume the light in the battle of the jokers\n  If you support Dominus with 6 or 12 decks I've included a branded brick box in your pledge to store the decks. If the project is funded I will let you choose which box version you want for your decks (in a survey after the funding). They will be manufactured in a sturdy and matte quality similar to the Indictus brick boxes.\nDivinus brick box\n  The ornaments and details will be as close to the foil gold as humanly possible within the limitations of CMYK printing. \nObscura brick box\n  I only have a very limited supply of Indictus decks left in my private reserves. These turn out to be hot like lava, so I hope for your understanding that these add-ons are administrated manually within private messages as this is the only way I have control of the remaining amount.

The pouches are manufactured specifically to hold one deck of poker sized playing cards. Please send me a message to state which edition you want.\nTo grab 1 uncut, simply add +265 DKK to your pledge\nAn 'uncut' is a double sided sheet of the actual playing cards fresh out of the printer w. cutting marks. One side showing the card backs and the other showing all card fronts from the deck. Frames are not included.

If you don't want all your decks signed, you must be sure to notify me.\nDominus Divinus A4 print (frame not included)\n  Dominus Obscura A4 print (frame not included)\nYou can add as many prints as you like to your pledge and the price per print is +25 DKK (~$4).

I will get into more detail about each Stretch Goal if and when we get closer to them. I don't want to commit Hubris by putting too much focus on this right from the start.\nClick the image to learn more about this booklet\n         As the lead artist of several deck projects I am no novice in the world of custom playing cards. I have in-depth knowledge on most printer companies and the strengths and weaknesses of each. I am an avid backer and know how things work. Take a look at my profile to see more details and a personal rambling about my view on Kickstarter in general.\nA photo of me. I haven't changed much since my last project.\nThrough Dominus I am hoping to tell a story of the shadowy union between the deceptive underworld and the european monarchy of the late middle ages. Betrayal, deceit, double-dealing. A deck of moral value, wealth and virtue that carries a message for subjective interpretation.\nDominus will only be made with your support to help cover the costs of setup fees, proof charges, printing, design, freight, shipping and the time to create the 54 original pieces of art. I am launching this deck on Kickstarter as an artist, a cardist, and an active fan of the crowdfunding concept. Let's do this together and create something unique!\nYes, I have one.\nWith senior artists, better packaging, deluxe tuck stocks, etc, I've invested more in this project, compared to Indictus to further up the scale. Rest assured that I will go the extra mile to deliver the decks as advertised!\n\nAll artwork is basically complete and awaiting your support. I've set a plan to have all rewards delivered by late November 2016 and here's how I am going to make it happen:\nAll decks will be manufactured by NPCC during July/August and shipped to me before October starts. Then I am going to start my fulfilment. This should allow all parcels to ship and transit without much hassle during November. If everything goes according to plan the decks should be well delivered to all backers by late November or early December. In other words I've made a plan with buffers and some wiggle room. It may actually be conservative, but I care much for my reputation and credibility.\nI require top service, manageable production/import costs, and an efficient production flow. NPCC is the obvious choice for me for this deck project and I have a good communication with them. Working with NPCC will allow a great mix of above mentioned aspects and they did a great job with Indictus.\nI've tested the quality of the Dominus cards and tuck stocks. You can expect the same high quality as with Indictus. If for some obscure reason my cooperation with NPCC fails, I will simply turn towards another printer and ensure the best possible deck quality and fulfilment for all backers.\nPresented artwork is subject to minor tweaks and updates.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third Kickstarter project and I know how things work. \nAll presented features have been technically confirmed, and formally quoted by NPCC prior to launching this kickstarter. My last project, Indictus was manufactured by NPCC and did live up to my high ambitions of quality. I have every reason to use them again for Dominus.\n\nI've spent several months researching, designing and budgetting. However, obstacles can arise unexpectedly. Potential set-backs include production delays, shipping and sourcing issues. That being said, I feel extremely confident in my tested suppliers and the conservative timeline I've chosen. Buffers are added to the development plan because I'd love to deliver all rewards as promised, if not before.\n\nAs an experienced graphic designer, I've brought many complex products to my audience on time and with great feedback. There's nothing more important for me than getting your rewards delivered on time and as advertised.\n\nI have a long and extremely positive track record with the shipping company, Deutsche Post/DHL. However, 'force majeure' events do happen from time to time and this project budget does not allow expensive ensurance contracts in relation to unsuccesful shipping.\n\nPlease note that customs MAY carefully open your deck(s) during shipping and thus break the factory sealing/cellophane. These are standard procedure checks to make sure that the parcel contains what it says. This project budget does not allow me to replace any such inspected decks with a new ones, and I hope for your understanding in such event. I am not to be held responsible for damaged, lost, unclaimed, opened or destroyed parcels.
