Naked. For large (and occasionally insultingly modest) sums of money. \nMy name is Jacqueline Frances. On the internet I\u2019m known as Jacq the Stripper. In addition to being a stripper, I\u2019m also a writer, \nThe Beaver Show\ncomedian:\nand illustrator:\nWhen I\u2019m not telling jokes or hustling lap dances, I can be found at home in Brooklyn with my wife and plants. \nStripping has taught me more than I ever could have extracted from my Russian Literature degree at McGill University. I\u2019ve learned the necessity of self-worth in an economy where time is just as pricey as tits. I've learned the power of the blink in a high-stakes negotiation (apparent ditziness paired with silence is impossible to deny), and how to thunderclap my butt cheeks (relax the pelvis, accept that all butts jiggle, and clap away). \nStripping is about feeling powerful, sexy, and endlessly curious about human kind. It\u2019s fun and funny and it\u2019s my mission to share this perspective with as many people as possible.\nThe Beaver Show is the crass and inspiring saga of my journey from Australia to New York as an enterprising megababe. It is slutty, funny and feminist, and I published it myself. \nWhat I\u2019m trying to do: \nI want to humanize sex work and lessen the social stigma attributed to a career that I - and many other women and men - love. I want to put an end to slut shaming. I want to take The Beaver Show on tour to make people laugh - and think - with my comedy, all the while celebrating the women I meet along the way who are committed to being unabashedly themselves.\nHere are the cities I'm currently planning to visit: \nLos Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Las Vegas, Miami, Toronto, and Montreal. \nI have set the goal at $6,000 because based on my calculations it is roughly what I will need to pay for printing and shipping the book, travel to and from the destinations I plan to visit, and my Kickstarter fees. It is a modest goal and if I reach it, it will all be going to funding the best book tour I could ever dream of.  \nWhat kind of enterprising megababe would I be if I didn\u2019t have stretch goals? If my Kickstarter funds beyond $6,000 I will add Vancouver, New Orleans, Atlanta, Austin and Chicago as funds allow. \nSuper-stretch goal? I want to bring The Beaver Show back to where it all began: Australia. If I raise $15,000, I\u2019ll be re-visiting my old stomping grounds of Sydney, Melbourne and Surfer\u2019s Paradise. \nHow you can help: \nBACK THE PROJECT at whatever level you can. Every little bit helps! \nTELL YOUR FRIENDS! Crowdfunding projects are about a bunch of rad people contributing modest amounts of money. Share the project on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram!

Part educational and mostly humorous, much of Pole Dancing Adventures comes from my years of experience as a pole dancing student. You'll find everything from dancing and safety tips; to commentary on current trends; to the funny and embarrassing truths in becoming an experienced dancer.\nMost of all, PDA seeks to encourage dancers and non-dancers alike to understand the beauty behind the dance form. It's also about health and fitness, building self esteem, confidence, and just having fun. Since 2012, men and women around the globe have shared their love of pole dancing with each other using this comic. Bringing another book of Pole Dancing Adventures to print will make it easier to share the story with others and will help me to continue the webcomic.\n\"(Pole Dancing Adventures) gives a pretty solid reason why it\u2019s become her favorite pastime. For her, pole dancing is a legitimate athletic activity, no different than yoga or aerobics.\" - Larry Cruz, Robot6 / Comic Book Resources\n\"You can see that Leen is in love with her art.

[This number is based on the approximate costs from my previous successfully funded Kickstarter for PDA Vol 1.] \nApproximately $1000 for reward manufacturing. \nProcessing fees to Kickstarter (5%), Amazon (5%) = $1605\nTaxes at 30% = $4816\nThe grand total comes to approximately $20,000! While it does sound steep, my largest concern is being able to cover for shipping costs as international shipments will be expensive. Giving myself cushion in the budget will make sure the shipping and manufacturing costs are covered so that I can get your books out on time!\nIn the event of over-funding...\nA second printing of the book and rewards will be made to accommodate the amount of backers that pledge. I would also love to do a re-print of Volume One as the first run is just about gone! \nWhen will the book/rewards be ready for shipment?\nIf funded, my goal is to have the books and unlocked rewards begin shipment in late December 2015 if not sooner. Different pledge levels will have different estimated delivery dates.\nI\u2019m Leen Isabel! I\u2019m an illustrator who loves to pole dance and I\u2019ve combined both of my interests into a web comic called Pole Dancing Adventures. Besides creating this comic, I have exhibited my artwork both domestically and internationally. Last year, I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for Pole Dancing Adventures Volume 1.

In which case for self-publishing a book, that would be that the ship carrying my books from China doesn't arrive on time. If that were to occur, I would ask that my backers exercise patience as I will keep you updated on the arrival of the books and how the shipping schedule will be affected. :( Any extra books AFTER backer fulfillment would then go for sale online at www.poledancingadventures.com.\n\nOf all the pledges, the sketch rewards will take longer to ship out. I intend to work on sketch pledges unless I face any illness or any other harm to my person which can delay production. Those orders will be shipped out as they are finished with an expectation of completion by March 2016.

Just\u2026because.\nAfter a one-year hiatus, the team is ready to go and ready to inspire.   Once again, we shall aspire to blow people\u2019s minds, and touch their hearts, with a meticulous re-creation of a small-town cinema, complete with old-school theater lobby, candy counter, and dilapidated interior\u2014paint peeling and seats that are distinctly \u201cnon-stadium\u201din their aesthetic.\nOnce again, we want to have people stumble upon us in the middle of the night, mouths agape, wondering if they have lost their minds entirely, since a fully fuctional, lost-in-time movie theater shouldn\u2019t, and couldn\u2019t, exist in such an incongruous place.   Once again, we want to see and feel the magic as candy is gifted to theatergoers, who duck into the tiny auditorium entrance and get transported to another place and time via the silver screen. It\u2019s a mindfuck no one ever forgets.\nWill you help us bring it to life once again?  Can we count on you for your support?  It takes a minimum of $15k to make it all happen.  As it turns out, making magic at the carnival of Burning Man isn't cheap.  Fortunately, in the years past, Bijou fans far and wide have stepped up and made it possible.  We\u2019re glad they understand that our particular illusion\u2014our carnival mirror trick, as it were\u2014requires an extra level of cost. There\u2019s real, movie-theater-size candy to buy, there\u2019s a real interior and exterior to painstakingly craft, and there are extraordinary transportation, storage, and materials costs to incur.   As Dolly Parton once memorably said, \u201cit takes a lot of money to look this cheap.\"  [UPDATE:  Bijou fans, you've done it again.  You've given us the baseline funding we need to make the theater, and your generous support above that helps us enhance what we can offer to our patrons (candy, interior decor, exterior wall art,sound, lighting, etc.) , as well as offset the considerable out-of-pocket cost we would have incurred creating those groovy rewards for everyone!  You guys are the best!]\nBy the way, your contribution to this art project goes solely to the direct costs associated with making the experience happen for the community. No one\u2019s ticket, burn costs, or non-build-week expenses are paid for by these funds.\nThanks again for your support!  \nLove,  \nSam, Release, Matt and the whole Bijou team\nVideo above is a time-lapse of the very first Bijou creation in the warehouse in Los Angeles in 2010. The Bijou has since evolved but this video commemorates it's birthburn. \nLittle taste of the extras we send in appreciation for your support:\nKatie Ryan working on the mold for your \"Snow Globe\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges?! You mean of building a movie theater in the middle of f---ing nowhere?! I mean besides the dust storms, flooding, extreme heat, extreme cold, risk of accidental injury using nail guns and folklifts to construct a small building? And/or the risk of safely transporting all the material and equipment we need to a remote desert location? Other than that, this thing is a piece of cake. Now that the financial side has been covered by you generous folk, it's just the usual perils of trying to build something on a compressed timetable in the Black Rock Desert that's the main issue. Our crew leadership has done this four times, though, and have gotten pretty good at doing the impossible. But you never know. We're humble about the challenges. We'll do our best, and you're welcome to come watch! xoxo\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "an update from the playa!", "update_content": "Bijou supporters:   thank you for your patience as all of us on the Bijou team have been in a pressured scramble to get things ready for the playa, and also, to get our Kickstarter rewards delivered.  I'm pleased to report partial progress on the latter front:  stickers, medallions, beanies, and hoodies will be sent out Thursday, August 20th.  Per Solar, \"they look fantastic.\"  The snow-globes have slower going for us; because of design complications and us not wanting to deliver something short of our expectations, we have to finish them after the burn.   The good news on that front is that Solar thinks this is a better idea anyway because instead of white glitter, we get to use Sawdust made during the build THIS YEAR as the playa/\"snow.\"   Apparently this is a popular material to use in snow globes and it looks way better than glitter for a \"playa storm\" inside the globe.

Each year I tell Solar (Sam) that I'm worried we're not going to make it.  Each year, he talks me off the ledge.  And, sure enough, there are about 200-250 of you out there each time we do this who decide that the Theater in the Middle of Nowhere simply must reappear in the deep playa.   You feel, like we do, the need to inspire the adventurous wanderers--or even better, the lost and disoriented--who make it out to the trash fence.
