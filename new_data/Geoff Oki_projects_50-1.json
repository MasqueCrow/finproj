the Kickstarter RPG magazine initiative. According to the rules, our project is in black and white and will be a saddle-stitched A5 booklet.\nI wanted to make the easiest-to-play TTRPG ever. It had to have some mechanics, it had to inspire awesome adventures, and... it had to have zero math, no dice, and just be a blast to play regardless of the player's TTRPG experience. (No easy feat let me tell you).\n\nI also needed a setting that was both cinematic and action-packed... Bounty Hunters in space.\n\nSo I proudly present to you for your backing: Bounty Hunter - a cinematic, slick, and easy-to-play TTRPG.\n\n\"The PCs are Bounty Hunters taking on jobs, hunting down bounties, claiming the rewards and living large in a galaxy full of wonders and chaos. \"\nRetro-styled, easy to use, and printed on recycled paper\nIf you've ever wanted to run a cool game set in space with super simple rules -and you wanted to run it now - this is the game system for you.\nIn this 32 page A5 rulebook we've packed in:\nAll the rules needed to run the game\n  Character creation and Backstory Generator\n  96 Bounty Hunter random names generator\n  Starship Combat\n  5 sample starships\n  5 sample NPCs\n  Epic bounty hunter equipment\n   The rules are designed in such a way that this Bounty Hunter TTRPG can be played with ZERO BOUNTY HUNTERS and is also an awesome Sci-Fi TTRPG system. Wanna run Galaxy Journey? Galaxy Conflicts? Warsun Universia? A large open space that expands for a long way? It's all here. \n\nThis is the color version of the booklet. Many folks seem to prefer the color option, so here it is! This is still subject to change if we get funded.\nThe rules are simple. So simple in fact the system was originally called \"Yes/No\" as that was the only mechanic. Can you fly a ship? Yes or no? Do you dodge the mouth of that massive Keel Wyrm as it tries to eat you and your ship? Yes or no? I wanted nothing to stand in the way of a great adventure and an awesome gaming session.\nAfter playtesting my rules set, refining it, and bashing it about, Bounty Hunter is the end result and ticks all the boxes: No math, no dice, all fun.\nA Carbithian captain could not outrun QW1CK-K1LL.\nCharacter Creation is a breeze. Seven unique alien races, dozens of career paths, histories, and momentous life changing events shape your character. In fact, once character creation is done - you have a full blown character backstory ready for the GM to use and abuse. That's how complete this system is.\nCharacter creation is fast and easily guides your characters backstory as you make it.\nNew players will enjoy the fact that within 10 minutes they are up and running with a cool character chasing bounties, fighting monsters and flying spaceships.\nYou end up with a cool Bounty Hunter and a great backstory. Your GM ends up with several solid plot hooks and a PC with a backstory!\nThere are a few more steps than just these five presented here. I wanted players to experience the power of a good backstory, without becoming overwhelmed and either not creating anything, or writing a novel. The system helps you write a concise yet solid narrative of just who your character is and how they came to be a Bounty Hunter.\nThe Combat system is - like everything else in the game - straight forward and quick. Space combat - ship versus ship - is super simple yet verbally dramatic. Each character sheet, monster, and starship comes with all the rules pertaining to how they work on their sheets. You don't need to remember or learn anything. It is all right there!\n\n\"Cinematic TTRPG\" was another title that we considered; which seemed apt since the very essence of this game is about vivid descriptions, awesome actions and kick-ass heroes... or anti-heroes!\nCombat is all about the drama, the fun, and all the PCs having a role aboard their own starships\n The settings booklet will feature a galactic map and dozens of planets, peoples, places, and ships for you to use in your game! \nI'll make a starmap like this one (one of my other campaign settings) and will fill it with fun things for your PCs to explore and do!\nWe have unlocked our third stretch goal! A second booklet will now ship with the main booklet. The second booklet will feature an introductory adventure for Bounty Hunters TTRPG! \n\nThe main booklet will now include a variety of extra starships for your bounty hunters to command, attack, and board! We will also include additional Monsters and NPCs, primed and ready for use! \n\nNext goal: My First Bounty - a Bounty hunter introductory Adventure written by me for you to use! \nA small job! A small job!\n I'd also write up an adventure that would be added to the booklet. Finally, The Campaign Setting would feature a map of the galaxy and a write up of all the major aliens and places needed for a full campaign.\nI've designed rule systems for 5th Edition, rule systems for dozens of homebrew systems for decades, and rule systems for fun. None of them are so intuitive and dramatic as this rules set. My partner - a total TTRPG noobie (literally 1 game of 5th ed under his belt) - challenged me to make a system without math or dice (random number generator). I initially said it couldn't be done.\n\nThen I realized... it could be. With a little inspiration, several dozen hours of playtesting basic mechanics, a couple hundred hours of tweaks, and bingo: Bounty Hunter the TTRPG was born.\n\nI love sci-fi as a setting, and I've always been frustrated with traditional TTRPGs that force great roleplaying off the table in favor of random outcomes. This system is not my first attempt to marry these two concepts together, but this is the best one I've created thus far and I'm proud to play this game and explore this space, and I hope that you and your players will be equally entertained. Let your story begin...\n\n\"In a cantina at the edge of space sits a nervous Fulkathian engineer. Sweat pools on his brow. He knows he is being hunted. And hunted by the best.\nYou walk into that cantina, you know the target is here because you are the best. You are Bounty Hunter.\"\nKeel Wyrms can get big... really big... Oh and they fly through space. Did I mention that?\nSo why do we need to kickstart? We want to bring in a professional designer for the layout, editor to make sure it makes sense, and have more artwork made to flesh this puppy out. Join us and together we can rule... I mean collect ALL the bounties!\nWe are proud to be part of Zine Quest 3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVery few risks exist. The rules have been written, the game tested.
