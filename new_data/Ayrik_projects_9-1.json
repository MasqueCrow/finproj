The only problems that may occur would be manufacturer issues. We have decided to go Shuffled Ink as our offset game printer. From what we have read and from my own experiences, they usual have little to no issues with fulfillment. Though it is not unheard of for there to be issues when mass printing card games no matter what company you go through. \n\nSecond is the custom artwork - The problems that would occur with this is if all 25 slots got filled for custom cards. This will take time to get the pictures from everyone and then draw their card of choice. With that said, we are confident that all artwork and custom cards will be finished and delivered by December 2019.\n\nThird is the 3D printed Hero Cat - As displayed in the pictures above, the 3D Hero Cat figurine has been tested, printed and painted. The 3D printer is ready to get the job done. The only problem with this if the painter has troubles with keeping paint in stock. Luckily we have limited this tier to only 25 backers so there shouldn't be too much to worry about.\n\nOverall we are confident in the conversations we have had with printing companies and others that have agreed to help fulfill this Kickstarter once it is successful. It is up to all of you guys now to make it happen. Lets get this game out there and have some fun. Thank you all, you are amazing.\n\nShipping - There is a little confusion with how shipping is going to be fulfilled as of right now. Currently we are planning on shipping through \"stamps.com\" they are a company that helps lower shipping costs for businesses. They have competitive rates compared to using the standard USPS.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "FURBALL BABY", "descp": "You will get an E-card saying thanks for your support.\nINCLUDES:\nE-Card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "FURBALL DWARF", "descp": "You will get a copy of the Furball card game.

What? Postponed? I am sad to say that the pizza party will not be happening this evening. The games were planned to be here on Thursday, but there was a major problem with the shipment of games coming in from China and getting stuck in customs. We missed the mark by literally 1 flight because of how busy the holidays are. Our shipment of games was too big to fit on the first flight out of China so they had to put it on the second. We have been on the phone for the past 3 days nonstop with FedEx trying to get the games here on time so we could have our awesome launch party, but again this did not happen. I am so VERY VERY sorry everyone! We know many of you were excited to have a good time at the party and get your copy of the game.

In this twisted world inspired from Warhammer and the Chtulhu Mythos, you will have to choose your way and find out what happened to the world around you.\nBack from the dead after being sacrificed during a bloody ritual to bring old and forgotten deities into your reality, Inmortis invites you to discover a mystical world that changes depending on your actions.\nThroughout your journey, you will face difficult choices that will make you question your morality along with challenging battles in which each mistake can lead to a horrible death...\nThis game isn't a Hack & Slash where you're gonna make your way through countless enemy hordes rushing at you, the gameplay is rather slow, but that doesn't mean it's not dynamic or breathtaking during tough fights. \nWe designed this game to be the perfect mix between brutal and unforgiving combat, and a deep narrative core where the player's actions will really have an impact on the story.\n A challenge - This game is easy to pick up and the controls are simple to learn, but in order to master it and finish the game you\u2019ll have to use clever tactics and take advantage of your environment and equipment to adapt to every situation.\n Highly customizable gameplay - Play with a variety of builds; lots of weapons to use, fully customizable equipment, and many spells and abilities to use in order to be ready for any situations. Choose wisely how to prepare yourself for each encounter.\n Face difficult choices - During your journey, you\u2019ll quickly realize that neither pure good  nor evil exists in this game, in fact, these are relative concepts and you\u2019ll have to make sacrifices in order to save your soul.\n Handcrafted World - While we love good roguelikes, procedurally generated levels mean we can\u2019t really control what the player will be facing, that\u2019s why we created each of the levels pixel by pixel to offer the best experience to the player. \n Highly replayable - The world itself doesn\u2019t change, but it can be seen in two different ways. As your corruption increases, you\u2019ll see a totally different world, and you\u2019ll get random effects, each one with a specific buff and debuff, that will greatly change how you experience the game each time.\n\u201cThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\"\nH. P. Lovecraft\nSince our childhood, we\u2019ve always been told stories about ancient, powerful and feared deities, long lost in the past. Most of us think they are just legend, born from some archaic beliefs, and refuse to see the truth. \nBut some are convinced these gods exists, and dedicate their life to bring them into our world. Those who take part in the ritual, should they be a cultist or a sacrifice, are all rewarded, and are tasked by their masters to rule this world while they feed on the reality itself.\nThe player will take the role of the Offering, the last sacrifice used to bring these gods into our plane of existence, and is rewarded with immortality, but at a cost: as long as they exist in this reality, the player will slowly get corrupted by their influence, driving  him to insanity...\nTo escape this fate, you'll have to find the cultists who killed you before the events of the game, now ascended to Servant-Kings, powerful demigods at the service of a specific deity, and banish them or absorb their powers.\nBut depending on your choices, you'll face consequences, as your body is alive only thanks to the Gods influence, the more you banish their servants, the more death and decay will spread around you, but at the same time absorbing their power will grant you an improved vitality at the cost of your sanity... \nNiynth The Blind Whisperer, Quod the Apostle of Bones, Vel the Golden Lord, Jing The Mirror of Perfection, Epulari the Fleshy Scholar, Primigenia The Fate Weaver, Sfagi the Almighty Champion, Oeka The Righteous Sinner\nEach God represents an ambiguous concept, having both its good side with its qualities, and the exaggeration of these qualities. They cannot be considered truly evil, but at the same time most of those calling for their help end up facing dramatic consequences, often leading to insanity or death.\nFor example, asking Quod to bring back a loved one will reanimate this person. But over the days, the reanimated corpse will rot away and cause an eldritch plague to strike everyone coming in contact, creating fresh servants for the Apostle of Bones, for each deal with this God is doomed to end in entropy, death, disease and despair.\n Primary Weapons - Your main weapons, which can vary  from a sword, a pair of daggers to a two-handed greataxe or many others, depending on how you want to play. You can carry two different sets of weapons, and each one has a 3 hit combo, a dash attack and a special move for dual wielding and two-handed weapons.\n Secondary Weapons - If your left hand is free, you\u2019ll have the possibility to equip yourself with a shield, a parrying dagger or other weapons allowing you to protect yourself or confuse your enemies.\n Spells and Active Items - Along with your weapons, you\u2019ll find various items and spells you can use to turn a situation to your advantage. Hidden blades, Bombs, Blood swords or Blessings from a God are scattered across the world.\n Gift of the Gods -  Through your journey, you\u2019ll inevitably gain corruption in one way or another. When accumulated for too long, corruption will manifest itself on the player, either physically or mentally, turning your blood into deadly acid, or changing you into a vampire, unable to heal but stealing the life of your foes.\nEvery time you die, you come back to life at the last tombstone you visited, thanks to the power of the gods. \nIf this happens too many times, you may be gifted with a curse. It\u2019s up to you to see it as a blessing or a burden\u2026\nIt might allow you to slowly regenerate your health when you are not too wounded, but also slowly kill you if your health drops too low. Or you could bleed acid, damaging everyone walking in it, including you.\nOf course, some of these effects can change how other abilities are working, for example a spell creating a sword made of your own blood to attack your foes will act completely different if your veins are filled with acid, dealing poison damage instead of magical damage, and leaving acid pools on the ground.\nThe more you get corrupted the more the world around you will change, allowing you to truly perceive all the darkest things that are usually invisible to mortal eyes; and some things are not meant to be discovered...\n\nOne thing very uncommon in a 2D pixel art game with complex animations, is the possibility of having your character entirely customizable, and we really wanted to have this feature in Inmortis.\nThat's why your character will change when you modify your equipment. In the inventory menu, you will be able to spread your loot between four dynamic equipment slots for your armor: head, torso, arms and legs. \nYou also have two slots for your weapons, and you even have the possibility to equip a ring and an amulet. \nEach item has its own stats and bonuses, as well as a unique skin, granting you a large amount of possibilities to customize your look and experience ingame. \nYou could go with a full heavy armor or mix it up with light and medium gear depending on your playstyle or fashion tastes ! \nSome armors and weapons you may find in the demo or later in the game\nEach place you'll visit during your journey is dedicated to a specific God (with a few exceptions), and each one will react differently to your corruption.\nThese change can be only visual (like some lighting changing color, or strange flesh appearing in the environment) or really have a notable impact on the gameplay (new dangers appearing out of nowhere, some path getting blocked or freed)\nMajor bosses Concept Art:\nAmbrosius, the Great Devourer, favored son of Epulari, the God of carnal and intellectual pleasure\nFelicia and her two sisters, Fausta and Syntyche, the Heralds of Fortune, and most esteemed servants of Primigenia, the Goddess of Luck\n Music plays a major role in the player immersion, that's why our composer is doing his best in transferring the various emotions and atmosphere of the different places of the game through the music.\n You can listen to game music or ambience sample below:\n\nGet a digital copy of the game\nGet your name in the credits\nGet a digital wallpaper set\nGet a special role on Discord\nAccess to the Beta\nGet a digital Artbook\nGet the OST\nGet an Exclusive Spell and Ability\nGet access to a special role on Discord and be among the first to get news from the devs\nAccess to the Beta\nGet an exclusive weapon skin\nAll the rewards from above\n Have access to an exclusive channel reserved for this tier and higher, so you can follow the game development and give your feedback ! \nGet an exclusive skin for the starting armor set\nAll the rewards from above \n Write a lore fiction, help us bring this world to life by adding side stories to the game (subject to approval by the team), we'll then hide it somewhere, waiting for players to find and read it !\nAll the rewards from above\n Design a Gift of the Gods, work with us to create a new Gift of the Gods,  you'll help finding a new interesting effect that can happen to the player when he gets too corrupted (Subject to approval by the team)\nAll the rewards from above\n Design a spell or ability, these active items you can use during or outside battles that will help you adapt to any situation and / or vary your attacks.

P. Lovecraft. Some of us already worked on games in the past, but this is our dream project, bringing together what we love in games: a challenging experience hiding a deep and interesting backstory. Together we're doing our best to make this dream come true !\nCorto Dufour (Moandor) - @Moandore\nLead Programmer + Animator + Designer\nAt first working alone on the project, Corto believed in it for 2 years, spreading his will of creation and quickly gathering a small team of passionate folks around Inmortis. Today he takes care of the team management, programming and of most of the animations. \nAnthony Rubier -  @AnthonyRubier \nPixel Artist + Concept Artist\nAnthony is the main artist of the team, doing gorgeous concept art and creating most of the environment you'll find ingame. As a concept and 3d artist who worked on other games, he just discovered pixel art and is already near to mastering it. Inmortis wouldn't have its visual identity without his hard work.\nGuillaume Vanneste (Raahos)\nVideo Content Creator + Designer + Sound Designer\nGuillaume is creating most of the sounds you can hear in Inmortis, and is also a very competent designer, reworking almost every UI asset since he joined the team, he really pushed the project forward.\n\nCyril Piotrowski (Nounet):\nPixel Artist\nCyril learned by himself over the years the secrets and the arcanes of pixel art. If Anthony loves doing nature sprites, Cyril shines when it comes to structures and artificial assets, and is able to draw very detailed sprites, he is the true master of pixel art in the team.\nBenjamin Baldassini (Panda) \nComposer\nBenjamin is a talented composer who worked on many other games such as Dark Devotion, and all this while managing a restaurant. When recording a song, he makes sure to only use physical instrument and SFX in order to give more character to the whole composition.  \nWe\u2019ve also been punctually helped and would want to thanks:\n Alexandre Lellouche for helping us programming a lot of features\n Bastien Ruivo for managing with the community and helping us with some sprites\n Guillaume Rech--Bieber for giving a lot of interesting ideas and marketing\n Maxime Pontillo for his work on the UI and Game Design\n Brendan Le Goff for creating most of the assets of the first level in the demo\n Pierre Mazucca for helping us with some sprites and marketing\nDo you want to chat with us ? Click on these image to join our Discord or follow our Twitter:\nAt the begining, Inmortis was only a small project to make us work on something we would really love to play. Creating our own game from scratch with imagination as our only limit was like a dream for everyone in the team.\nAfter working on it for 2 years, and with the community getting bigger everyday, the project followed the movement and got even more important for all of us. \nToday we want to be able to fully work on Inmortis, without having to spend too much time on a part-time job, and that\u2019s why Kickstarter is the perfect solution for us. With your support we would be able to buy better gear and get external help from talented collaborators.\nSo far, this game has only been fueled by our own money,  funding the game on Kickstarter will allow us to realize the vision we have for Inmortis and keep a full creative control, and show the development process to the community by giving timely updates so we can make together a game that every fan of challenging Action-RPG would love to play !\nOur main goals are:\nHave the game funded so we can be sure we'll be able to reach the quality we're aiming for Inmortis\nGather feedbacks from fans and veteran of challenging Action-RPG games, since we're making a game for a very specific audience.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe started this project almost 2 years ago, some of us were already experienced in game development, while others realized step by step how gigantic was the amount of work required to build up a game like this...\nWe are working hard every day, and during countless sleepless nights, while struggling to survive the work rate between our full-time jobs and the game. \n\nDuring all this time the development was done without any budget or financing, and it was a truly exhausting experience.\n\nWe know that there are still many challenges to face until the day we'll be able to release a final version of the game, but after 2 years of development in these conditions, we feel confident that nothing can stop us :)\n\nNo matter the campaign result, we are going to finish this project. Financing will essentially speed up the development, and allow us to implement many features we would want Inmortis to have. We have already spent our own money on this project to make sure that we will be able to release it, but the number of features and the time we'll have to polish the game and reach the level of quality we're aiming for will be greatly influenced by the community support.\n\nOur biggest concern is about schedule, we're a small but ambitious team, and even if we already planned our workflow to be able to deliver the game in time, we know that it is impossible to reduce the risks to zero.\nKnowing this, we will talk with the community openly about any possible issues that might delay our development plans.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Pecking Crow Studio\nFirst created \u00b7 8 backed\nPecking Crow Studio is a french independent game development studio creating Action-RPG games.

Run, jump, hang, climb, roll, and shoot your way through mysterious alien ruins, a flying penitentiary, a high-tech megalopolis, and a majestic forest.\nALPHA GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE:\nThe game is at approximatively 15% through development. The purpose of the alpha footage below is to show Leo's move-sets and animations, some of the levels and the sound design. The UI is far from final and I'm working on new textboxes (improving the readability and including the portraits).  \nI hope it'll give you a feel of the game's ambiance.\nAs Earth became inhospitable, Noah, an AI whose sole purpose was to preserve humanity, was created. Noah chose the Moon as humanity's Ark - renamed Lunark - using it as a ship to evacuate a handful of chosen ones to the nearest superhabitable planet. Unfortunately, whether the planet was inhabited or not was not part of Noah\u2019s programming.\nCenturies later, you play as Leo, an orphan rejected for being\u2026 different. You'll retrace your origins in the midst of a rebellion against the totalitarian regime of Lunark, and meet a wide cast of colorful characters, stuck on either side of the escalating conflict. \nI've designed Lunark as a homage to cinematic platformers while bringing modernity to a lot of the core aspects: The controls are responsive and intuitive and the progression system generous. The game is meant to feel fresh while being nostalgic. Lunark is also an adventure focused on delivering a thrilling narrative with explosive moments.\nSums up my main inspirations quite well...\nThe game will be available Nintendo Switch, PC (Windows) & Mac (OsX) in English, French, and Spanish. I hope to be able to add even more platforms and languages depending on how well the campaign and development goes. A survey will be sent to backers upon release to confirm platform choices.\nYou have no idea what a 2D cinematic platformer is?\n\u201cCinematic platformers are action-adventure platformers with a strong emphasis on realism, cinematic presentation, detailed character animations, [...] and a minimalistic approach to storytelling\u201d. (\u201cThe Cinematic Platformer Compendium\u201d by itchyander)\nJust like the fantastic games from which Lunark draws its inspirations, I use rotoscoping for the cutscenes\u2019 animation (tracing over motion picture or 3D footage).\nEvery backer counts!

I'm originally from France but now live in Montreal, Canada. Although I've worked for several years as a graphic designer, you may know me as a pixel artist and animator in the independent video game industry or even have seen that little red-haired guy running on twitter. I've contributed to a dozen games such as Flinthook, Shovel Knight Showdown, Adventure Time, Mercenary Kings Reloaded and Rivals of Aether.\nPrince of Persia, Another World (aka Out of This World) and particularly Flashback have made a significant impact on me as a kid. Seeking to recreate the special feeling conveyed by these games, I started working on Lunark in my spare time. Given the enthusiasm around the project and how my passion grew about it, it became obvious to me that this game had to see the light. In September 2018, I took the leap and decided to quit my job to start my own independent studio: Canari Games Inc.\nI was 7 years old when I started music theory and have never stopped playing and composing since. Everything you hear in Lunark comes from me, music and SFX included. Yet, I\u2019m also enthusiastic about working with other collaborators on Lunark's OST depending on how well the campaign does! \nPLAY\n\nWith your support, my goal is to be able to remain fully independent throughout this venture; without having to look for other contracts or business partners, and allowing me to work with talented collaborators. I really hope to fully realize this personal vision that I have for Lunark, knowing full well that there's an audience craving for this kind of game. \nSo this is why I need you: for allowing me to create the best version of Lunark possible.\nNewsletter // Discord // Twitter // Facebook\n\n> Thanks to illustrator Justin Chan for his amazing cover art! \n> Everything shown is pre-alpha footage, subject to change (for the better!) in the final version.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLunark is already at an advanced stage of its design and is being developed with GameMaker Studio 2, a long-proven engine behind some well-known titles such as Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter and Nuclear Throne. \nAs for me, I've been a successful freelancer since 2005, participated in the production of a dozen video games and worked for 4 years at Tribute Games where I was closely involved in several aspects of Flinthook and Mercenary Kings Reloaded's release.\nWhether on Twitter or Patreon, I've always been committed to sharing my work, which is why I'm gonna be totally transparent about the progress and any challenges I'll be facing.

Now we bring you something completely new - 626 EVOLUTION - a present-day, urban, found-footage, scifi paranoid-thriller.\nDirected by John Lyde, the visionary behind some of Arrowstorm's most beloved films - OSOMBIE, THE SHADOW CABAL, SURVIVOR, THE CHRISTMAS DRAGON and the last two MYTHICA films, 626 EVOLUTION stars fan-favorite Danielle Chuchran, back at her butt-kicking best.\nAs with all our past Kickstarter efforts, this film has already been shot and edited, and we are well into post-production. The trailer is actual footage from the film, so you can get a good gauge of the quality, and how close we are to fulfilling our vision.\nHunted by government agents and constantly assaulted by a cartel of vengeful thugs, an amnesiac known only as \u201c626\u201d searches for her true identity while protecting a teenage girl who shares her superhuman combat skills; but when 626 uncovers the horrifying truth about her past, she must infiltrate enemy headquarters to expose a corporate conspiracy that threatens the free world, before she and her companion are silenced forever.\n  Danielle Chuchran - a rapidly rising action star, you've seen her decapitate zombies, massacre orcs, and cuddle puppies and ponies. Dani's back in fighting form, kicking butt and taking names.\nRuby Jones - if you're an Arrowstorm fan, you'll recognize this talented young actress from her roles in Survivor and Christmas Dragon. Now she'll do something unexpected...\nFilmmaking is expensive business, and there\u2019s no way we\u2019d be able to make awesome indie fantasy and sci-fi films without the support of our community of fans and backers. Kickstarter is an invaluable resource which not only allows us to fund our films, but also lets us do it while connecting directly with fantasy and sci-fi fans like you! \nWe\u2019ve been able to make some really fun films, all because of your contributions. We want to do that again, and again, and again!\nWith Kickstarter it\u2019s all or nothing. Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the total of all pledges for our project meets or exceeds our goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funding. If not, we receive nothing, nobody gets charged, but everybody is sad :( \nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country. PLUS, our films release at all different times around the world. Our Kickstarter backers usually get to see the finished product months ahead of the general public. \nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there\u2019s others out there like us, who we aim to please. \nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 5, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :) \nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles: \nJohn Lyde - Director/Producer\nJason Faller - Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Executive Producer \nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and our projects at our website: www.arrowstormentertainment.com ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilm is a complicated technical exercise, and often unforeseen difficulties arise, causing budget and scheduling overruns - particularly when complex visual effects are involved. That being said, we are an experienced group and have successfully completed and released every film we have started - over 20 of them now. We have produced several visual effects heavy projects in the past, and see no reason why we shouldn't continue to accomplish our goals.\n\nOn the plus side, this film is largely complete. A great deal of the risk in the project has already been mitigated, and we are too far along to turn back and give up.

Sure, we've made some sci-fi action movies (Survivor, Osombie and Zombie Hunter), but now we're talking NASA, artificial intelligence, quantum entanglement, Fermi's paradox, mysterious signals from space and an awesome onboard computer voiced by Matthew Mercer!\nAs with all our past Kickstarter efforts, this film has already been shot and edited, and we are well into post-production. The trailer is actual footage from the film, so you can get a good gauge of the quality, and how close we are to fulfilling our vision.\n  After NASA picks up a trio of mysterious signals from within our own solar system, astronaut Roger Nelson is dispatched on a multi-year solo mission aboard the Magellan spacecraft to investigate the sources. What he discovers will change our understanding of science and our place in the universe, but the journey will have lasting consequences on Nelson and the wife he left behind.\n  We\u2019ve never attempted anything like this before. Inspired by the works of people like Carl Sagan and Arthur C. Clark, we wanted to create a \"hard\" science fiction film about space exploration, based on real science and theoretical situations. Every aspect of the story had to be carefully researched. We even brought in a former member of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to advise us on astronautics and planetary science. The result is a mind-blowing space thriller about possible first contact, and we\u2019re really excited to share it!\nWe've also partnered with some awesome people to bring the story to life, including VFX guru Cecil B. (Guardians of the Galaxy) and film composer Nathaniel Drew (who studied at one point under the tutelage of a certain Hans Zimmer).  We are also featuring music by VanLadyLove!    \n  Brandon Ray Olive plays Commander Roger Nelson, a by-the-book astronaut whose wanderlust drives him to the stars. Brandon\u2019s talent as a performer has landed him multiple roles in both film and television including NCIS, CSI:NY and Tyler Perry\u2019s Single Mom\u2019s Club. Recently he\u2019s been cast in two projects from director Steven Soderbergh: Logan Lucky and HBO\u2019s Mosaic. \nMatthew Mercer voices Ferdinand, the deep-spacecraft Magellan\u2019s primary A.I. unit. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises including Attack on Titan, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy...basically, if you\u2019ve played a video game, you\u2019ve heard Matthew\u2019s voice. He\u2019s also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and of course played the evil necromancer Szorlok in our own Mythica series. \nDanor Gerald plays NASA project director Gerald Becker, and brings to the role a perfect blend of intellectual authority and tweed-jacket wearing geekiness. Danor has appeared in multiple roles including ABC\u2019s Blood and Oil, Forever Strong and was the leading man in Saints and Soldiers: The Void.\nNicola Posener brings to life the voice of Neil, the deep-spacecraft MAGELLAN's cheeky, secondary A.I. unit. Arrowstorm fans will know her from her starring role in the Dawn of the Dragon Slayer and the Mythica franchise, but this may be the first time you hear her full American accent! She\u2019s starred in several British films, and you can see her in the upcoming TV series Age of the Living Dead.\nWhitney Palmer plays Abigail Nelson, NASA A.I. specialist and spouse to Commander Nelson. This marks Whitney\u2019s first major role in a feature film, and she drives home an emotional performance as the \u201castronaut wife\u201d left behind for a decade. \nFilmmaking is expensive business, and there\u2019s no way we\u2019d be able to make awesome indie fantasy and sci-fi films without the support of our community of fans and backers. Kickstarter is an invaluable resource which not only allows us to fund our films, but also lets us do it while connecting directly with fantasy and sci-fi fans like you! \nWe\u2019ve been able to make some really fun films, all because of your contributions. We want to really take it to the next level now, and are confident we can blow you away if you give us a chance. \nWith Kickstarter it\u2019s all or nothing. Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the total of all pledges for our project meets or exceeds our goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funding. If not, we receive nothing, nobody gets charged, but everybody is sad :( \nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, and have now just finished up production on Mythica 4 and 5, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, Mythica 2: The Darkspore and Mythica 3: The Necromancer have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers. Mythica 4: The Iron Crown digital rewards have been delivered, and physical rewards are currently being manufactured.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 5: The Godslayer - the final, and definitely the most epic Mythica film yet!\nYou can learn more about Mythica at: http://www.MythicaMovie.com\nOr join the Mythica fan group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/531601233681817/\nIf you missed the first four Mythica films and want to get them right away, you can order digital downloads here:\nhttp://watch.arrowstormentertainment.com/\nYou can order Blurays and DVDs here:\nhttps://mythica4.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Godslayer\nAs the Lich King's zombie legions ravage the world, a cursed young sorceress (Marek) embarks on a quest to obtain a weapon from the gods, with her friend Dagen, a self-serving half-elf rogue. But when she joins her sworn enemy in a desperate attempt to save the world, she must recover the good in herself before her friends are all dead, and defeat the Lich King before the gods are destroyed and the world forever enslaved.\nWatch the trailers for the first four Mythica films below!\n          Melanie Stone plays Marek, an escaped slave and natural-born necromancer. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, Riot, and Miracle Maker.\nKristian Nairn plays Tek, God of the Forge. Kristian is from Northern Ireland, and is a real-life giant, standing 6'11\" tall. He is a world-renowned DJ and actor, best known for his role as Hodor in Game of Thrones.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew's voice. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less than Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known to his scifi and fantasy fans for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars, Once I was a Beehive and Dudes and Dragons.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series. You can see her in the upcoming TV series, Age of the Living Dead.\nThe film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all under way. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, lots of magic, giant CGI sets, armies, etc. We want this finale of Mythica to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nYou may have noticed, we really stepped up the VFX game in Mythica 4, all because of your contributions. We want to really take it to the next level now, and are confident we can blow you away if you give us a chance.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $85,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $85,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better! PLUS, our films release at all different times around the world. Our Kickstarter backers usually get to see the finished product months ahead of the general public.\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there are others out there like us, who we aim to please.\nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 4, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :)\nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles:\nJason Faller - Writer/Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Writer/Executive Producer\nJohn Lyde - Director\nJennifer Griffin - Producer\nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and purchase our past projects on our website:\nwww.arrowstormentertainment.com\n$110,000 - MYTHICA BOARDGAME\nIf we reach $110,000 you will unlock the creation of an awesome Mythica boardgame, that will be available as an add-on in Backerkit.\n$400,000 - MYTHICA PREQUEL\nThis is an ambitious one, but let's all dream a bit. If we reach $400,000 in pledges, we will make a Mythica Prequel, featuring backstory's of your favorite characters. How did Marek meet Gojun? What was Dagen up to before he was an adventurer? What were Teela and Caeryn up to? Hammerhead? Gojun? Thane?

Dark Flame brings you the perspective of a knight who must battle the horrific conveyance of unknown evil that has overtaken his order. Featuring large, hand-crafted environments, tailored gameplay, and an armoire of weapons, armor, and magic, the game blends classic with new to bring a unique experience!\nYou play the role of Taharial; a crusader in the midst of the Batlic Crusades. Upon discovering a mysterious onset of insanity by unknown causes amongst his brothers, Taharial sets forth to purge the area of evil and persevere through the dark possessive powers before all is lost in chaos.\nPLAY\n\n  For centuries, humanity's greatest willed champions, the Keepers of the Flame, have been tasked with containing the Dark Flame, an entity of unknown origins and purpose. Since its discovery, The Dark Flame has poisoned the souls of weak-minded humans, causing instant violent reactions and sacrificial behavior. Discovery of ancient texts gave humanity the tools, technology, and rituals to restrain the Dark Flame; mankind finally had the chance to protect themselves from the assumed destruction, and the Dark Flame was kept secret from all but the elite tier of Crusaders and the Church over the course of countless generations. After a bright light flashes from the fortress guarding the flame, reports of brutal slaughters in the neighboring town have the people desperate for help. The Church responds by dispatching Taharial, a potential candidate for the Keepers of the Flame, to investigate and protect the townspeople. The mission is clear: Find the members of the Keepers of the Flame, investigate the nature of the light flash, and save the townsfolk from the raiding monsters that have started appearing; the way, however, is not so well lit. When a young man steps into the ranks, his exceptional skills and ability to withstand the temptation of the Flame have his peers heralding that he, Islude, may be the person to eradicate the flame.\nTaharial being dispatched to protect the townspeople\nUtilize the Pyre to modify the powers of your weapons and spells  \nManipulate the unique level system to suit your style of play\nImmerse yourself in the diverse storyline of Dark Flame where you struggle between the lesser of evils\nAdorn powerful weapons and armor to customize your appearance\nDiscover hidden chambers and uncover dark secrets\nUnlock unique talents and channel hidden powers\nThe Pyre - where you can augment your character and create spells!\nThe ancient texts gave men the knowledge and ability to forge weapons and spells at Pyres. Harnessed only by the Keepers of the Flame, the Pyres can attune magic crystals, allowing the player to craft new, more powerful spells, equipable to Taharial.\nTaharial gazes into the Pyre while it attunes one of the magic crystals\nThe Pyres will also be used to forge more powerful weapons from the ones you already have, imbuing them with dynamic properties. There is an ancient writing on the use of Pyres. They contain much power of which the source is unknown. This power can be contained within \u201cMagic Crystals\u201d after attuning the crystals with the Pyre. Once these Magic Crystals have been attuned, they can be carried and used by those who have the power to use them.\nTaharial using the power of the Pyre to enhance the power of his sword\nThe Pyres have also been known to imbue a portion of its power within other items as well. The most commonly used are weapons of the Keepers of the Flame. The ritual used to attune these weapons are another closely kept secret of the Keepers.\nWhile front-swinging swords are the main weapon in the Pre-Alpha, they are most certainly not the only armaments you will get to use against the horde of horrors ahead. Tools such as crossbows, polearms, hammers, greatswords, daggers, and a slew of other forged steel arms with many different attack patterns and various sizes that will help you claw or club your way to victory. Yes, Shields will an addition to the game; We wouldn't want you to go around not defending yourself, would we? There will be an extra space for this kind of equipment on Tahrial, and a shield may be your best friend when defending from those poison-spitters! At the moment, the plan is to implement shield similar to Dark Souls; defending bleeds stamina, meaning you have to juggle attacks and protecting yourself with some care.\nTaharial swinging a giant sword over his head to take down multiple enemies in one fell swoop\nA future change you will see (Hopefully in the Alpha or Beta) is a revamping of sub-weapons. We wanted to do something that was a bit more in line with the theme of the game, so we are looking into changing the genre-standard items with glass fire bulbs. These little anachronisms will contain different elements, alchemy, and bric-a-brac and can be lobbed in different patterns depending on the bulb type. Once a bulb hits an enemy, it can break and spread the contents around, potentially doing more damage.\nTaharial wielding a shield to protect himself from the various types of hazardous projectiles\nArmor won't only increase stats, but will change the physical appearance of Taharial!\nThere are many other features that could be put into this project pending stretch goals! Make sure to check them out below!\nI started working on Dark Flame over 2.5 years ago when I first started building the engine. My initial goal was to create a custom engine that would run with both efficiency and performance! After playing around with some pixel art, I realized I would need something better than my less-than-mediocre art to really make this project come to life. That's when I invested over $5500 of my personal money to work with three artists and a musician to bring you the wonderfully made pre alpha that you can download for free (HERE)! This sacrifice of both time and money is my investment to you, as backers, to hopefully gain your trust in knowing that I am fully invested in this project!\nHaving some fun showing off the game with various individuals!\nI have been a huge fan of video games since before I could pick up a controller. I was such a huge fan, I ended up teaching myself how to program and put as much effort into a game engine as possible. I am not merely making this game for profit - I'm doing it because I have a passion to do so. The funding received will directly go towards the success of this project!\nBefore (left) and After (right) - one of the reasons I'm relying on Kickstarter\n                                                                                    I am turning to Kickstarter to hire on a few professionals to polish up this game and get it to the players (you) as soon as possible. I have already tried and tested each and every one of them and put their beautiful work into the playable demo with my own personal funding. Unfortunately, hiring people who are good at what they do, is a bit expensive. With your help, I can turn Dark Flame from a dream, to a reality. I just need your support in backing this project and allowing us to finish this masterpiece!\nWarren (http://darkflamegame.com/) has been a hobbyist programmer since 2005. He has always fooled around with art and music but his passion has always been in video games. Dark Flame is something that Warren has been working on during his free time while holding a full time job. He is now working on taking his dream off the back-burner and creating something amazing... with your help!\nWill (http://unsilentwill.com/) is a trained painter and sculptor who while playing games as a kid drew creatures and stories to explore, learning from history and myth to build living worlds from pixels.\nBryan (http://www.bldaudio.com/) has been making music in some form or fashion his entire life - from his incessant humming of video game music as a child, to seeing his works performed live on stage. He plays and teaches all styles of guitar, specializing in Jazz, Classical, and Progressive Metal. Bryan also loves the piano, synthesizers, other stringed instruments, percussion...basically anything that makes noise!\nGreg (http://gregtaylorart.com/) was drawn to art from early childhood, his first exposure and fascination to fantasy art was upon commandeering his Father\u2019s Frank Frazetta book. He traveled to the United Kingdom in 1995 where he studied traditional art & design. In 2007 he chose to pursue art professionally and began his career as a freelance artist. To date he\u2019s worked with many clients producing art for a wide range of applications. Some of his largest contributions to projects have included Dead Frontier and Doom Warrior where he provided all Environmental, Character and Creature Concept Art, Promotional Illustrations, Storyboards and 2D Assets.\nCecilia \"Cecihoney\" (http://cecihoney.deviantart.com/) has been a spriter for more than 20 years. She loves giant robots, starships, sci fi, magic, and fantasy. Aside from pixelart she likes to write, build plastic models, customize toys, read, watch anime/cartoons, play video games, and roleplay\u2026 Her main influences come from 32bit era games, mostly Phantasy Star IV, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Megaman X, and Final Fantasy VI.\nLoren (https://twitter.com/lorenlemcke) is a Mathematics graduate from the University of Arizona, where he studied mathematical simulations and models of crowd based behavior. He has been playing video games ever since he can remember and started programming from an early age as well, since his passion for mathematics went hand in hand with programming. He released his first solo commercial project, Over 9000 Zombies!, on Steam in February 2015.\nBrian (http://www.twitch.tv/thatmoustachio) is a streaming personality who is self-charged with bringing the game to the forefront of the online media community. He has written and scripted for several online series and short films, and was drawn to the project not only due to his undying love for Metroidvania titles, but for the vast scope the story could be. This will be one of his largest projects yet, and he is excited for the challenge.\nTom (http://www.tomking.net) is a game designer and writer who believes the creative direction of a script should be at the forefront of a game's design regardless of its graphical complexity. Tom claims he has always had a fascination with video games, stating that his parents encouraged him to create fan stories and art of his favorite games growing up. Although Dark Flame will be his debut as a writer for video games, he is confident his love of the medium and experience with script writing will help him deliver a memorable tale.\nFor those of you who are backing this project - thank you!

I've spent many hours searching through people's work/talents/interests and have hand selected these amazing masters of crafts. We all have the passion of creating video games in our own way. Although we might not agree on everything - it creates a great variable that will make us think twice before putting something in the game. I've worked with these individuals for a good amount of months and am comfortable working the long run with them. We only want to make the best we can!\n\nFunding - As you know, I've already invested a fair amount of my own money into creating what you can currently play! As much as I would like to keep feeding this beast, my small allowance of a paycheck will not allow that. I would need this Kickstarter to make (and hopefully break) the initial goal! \n\nTime - We all know time never stops, but sometimes life puts hardships in our way to delay our goals. These can be anything from personal loss to design issues. One way or another, I will make sure to deliver a great game within an expected timeframe!\n\nSpeaking of time - I have put a ton of time, effort, and love into this game. It is something I have been greatly passionate about!

Life is vicious and short.\nWe All Fall Down is a new series from Arrowstorm Entertainment, imagining a world built by children with just a brief window to live a full life. If Lord of the Flies and Walking Dead had a baby, this is what it'd look like.\nPresented in ten episodes of about 8 to 10 minutes each, this Kickstarter campaign gives viewers the chance to get the whole series before it ever releases to the world, and to be a part of bringing this project to life.\nAfter a lifetime of wandering in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Todd (an 18-year-old on the verge of transforming into a zombie) struggles to find a safe haven for his kid brother Benny; but when Todd becomes the chosen prey of a wicked young huntress (Matra), he must learn to trust and befriend other survivors before he succumbs to the zombie virus, to stop Mitra from adopting Benny into her clan of bloodthirsty savages.\nKurt Knight (Writer/Director/Producer) - Kurt is a talented young filmmaker. He has been working with Arrowstorm Entertainment since Osombie days, and quickly moved up the ranks from Production Assistant, to Props Master, to now Art Director and Co-Producer of the Mythica series.

You can check out more of his work on his WEBSITE.\nCardiff Gerhardt (Lead Actor) - Cardiff plays Todd in We All Fall Down. He is an exciting and talented new actor and musician, and has appeared in the films The Mistle-Tones, Thirst and the TV series Granite Flats. Dedicated to his craft, Cardiff spent the duration of the We All Fall Down shoot camping in the wilderness to prepare his mind and body for the role.\nThe series is already shot, and we are hard at work editing the various episodes right now. But we have a lot of work to do still, and need your help covering these post-production costs. After editing, we need to do a kick-ass 5.1 surround mix, we need to have a composer score the whole thing, we need to do color correction on all the footage to make it beautiful, we have some visual effects that need to be completed, and we need to make some groovy title sequences. So it's a lot of work - pretty much equivalent of the actual shooting/production phase.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $25,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our series. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(.
