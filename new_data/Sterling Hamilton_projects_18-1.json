This is the last chance to get the Nomiku with the Kickstarter discount!\nPress for Nomiku:\nMAKE - Our true maker story!\nEngadget - \"It's dead simple to use, and is about the same size as a hand blender, so most folks won't have a problem finding a place for it in their kitchen.\"\nCNET - \"Certainly in the case of the Nomiku, the capability to use it with existing kitchen accessories is a positive, not only because it is a space-saver, but it makes it affordable too.\"\nWired Gadget Lab - \"By making any pot in the house a sous vide with a portable device that can be stored in cabinet, the Nomiku could be a great addition to a foodie kitchen.\"\nLA Weekly's Squid Ink - \"Want to make a cheap cut of steak or bunch of carrots melt like butter? Throw them in a thermal immersion circulator for a half-day and revel in the results.\"\nSerious Eats - \"I really dig the styling of the prototype, the seemingly easy-to-use controls, the large control face, and its versatility.\"\nFood 52 - \"Everyone should be able to bring a little sous vide to their kitchen. Here\u2019s to the end of overcooked meat, everywhere.\"\nLet's cook better.\nHello, we are Q, Abe, and Bam. We created an immersion circulator for sous vide cooking called the Nomiku. It is beautiful and scientifically accurate enough for the professional chef, but made for the home cook. \nSous vide is a simple process that uses precise heat to create perfect dishes. Just put your desired ingredients into a bag, give it an airtight seal, and then rest it in a Nomiku controlled water bath. The resulting food is tender, moist, and other-worldly delicious.\nSweet and sticky sous vide ribs.\nSadly, sous vide machines in the past have been too expensive ($1000+!) and complicated (six buttons?) for the home cook. Happily, the Nomiku has one knob that you turn to adjust the temperature and a screen that displays the temperature. You press the screen to turn the Nomiku on and off. The Nomiku clips on to any pot you already own and can be stored away after use; it is the most compact immersion circulator in the world. Other home sous vide machines like the Sous Vide Supreme don't circulate water.\nSous vide trout in olive oil.\nThroughout our sous vide adventure we have always been active members of the maker community and voracious eaters. We wanted to share sous vide with the world so we created BagSoakEat.com for sous vide recipes and made a DIY kit for hackers from our little Lower East Kitchen. It became quite clear to us that if we really wanted to get everyone sous viding it would take more than a kit--- we'd have to make a consumer appliance.\nOur Ember DIY sous vide kit.\nOur class at BioCurious in California.\nWhile we taught classes bi-coastally to spread the good DIY cheer, we were also gearing up for a 111 day hardware accelerator (the first of its kind) called Haxlr8r in ShenZhen, China. Through the program we created a working prototype of the Nomiku and developed solid relationships with ethical facilities. Now, we just need the cash to press the go button on production. Our Nomiku prototype floored everyone at Q and Abe's wedding by making perfectly cooked steaks. The chefs at Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Palm House are now converts to the sous vide method. :-)\nOur machine has been vetted by some of the best people in the appliance industry and they stand behind our design and technology. Dr. Abe Fetterman, co-founder and plasma physicist, worked closely with Dragon Innovation engineers who made the Roomba to make the guts of the Nomiku. Bam, co-founder and industrial designer, closely aligned the design ideas from our mentors at IDEO to make a beautiful and accessible appliance. He's also worked with Zoku in the past. Q, co-founder, is not a top chef, but she is a pretty good cook. She's tested over 100 sous vide recipes using our prototypes since the beginning of the fun a year ago (and we've made a lot of friends along the way).\nRapidly prototyping in ShenZhen, PRC.\nWith your help, we can all start eating and sharing great food.\nHere's what your contribution towards the $200,000 will go towards:\nComponent costs.\nTooling and mechanical costs.\nAssembly and testing costs.\nFinal engineering to get UL and CE approval.\nBuilding a kitchen appliance takes more than just hardware. We need to rigorously test each Nomiku so it accurately and safely makes amazing dishes.\nBam and our prototype.\nIt is only with your support that we can bring the Nomiku into production. We'd be honored to have you on board and grow with us. At the $299 mark you can get your very own Nomiku! Do we have some recipes we want to share with you!!\nPerfectly cooked Sous Vide short ribs\nHere are some specs to get you better acquainted with the Nomiku: \nHeater output: 750 Watts.\nCirculation rate: 10 L/min.\nTemperature accuracy: 0.2\u00b0 C.\nTemperature stability: 0.1 C.\nDisplay: 1.3\" full color OLED.\nMinimum water height: 4 inches.\nLive switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit.\nSeparate 120V (US + Canada) and 220V versions (the 220V version will work with 220V-240V, and will ship in March)\nOur goal is to create the best immersion circulator for home cooks so everyone can have sous vide in their kitchen arsenal. Eating and sharing perfect food shouldn't be out of your reach.\nWe toast to you, food person of excellence!\nWe are deeply humbled and inspired by your interest in our project and hope you'll share it with your friends and family members that love food.\nSoundtrack by Drexler, Ball Point Pen.

It's as Easy as Downloading an App.\nPebble is the first watch built for the 21st century. It's infinitely customizable, with beautiful downloadable watchfaces and useful internet-connected apps. Pebble connects to iPhone and Android smartphones using Bluetooth, alerting you with a silent vibration to incoming calls, emails and messages. While designing Pebble, we strove to create a minimalist yet fashionable product that seamlessly blends into everyday life. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH APPS\nApps bring Pebble to life. We're building some amazing apps for Pebble. Cyclists can use Pebble as a bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, distance and pace data. Runners get a similar set of data displayed on their wrist. Use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. Don't worry about the rain, Pebble is water-resistant! If you're a golfer, feel free to bring Pebble onto the course. We're working with Freecaddie to create a great golf rangefinder app for Pebble that works on over 25,000 courses world-wide. Instead of using your phone, view your current distance to the green right on your wrist. These apps will be the first, with more in the works!  \nCUSTOMIZE WITH WATCHFACES\nPebble can change instantly, thanks to its brilliant, outdoor-readable electronic-paper (e-paper) display. We've designed tons of watchfaces already, with more coming every day. Choose your favourite watchfaces using Pebble's iPhone or Android app. Then as the day progresses, effortlessly switch to the one that matches your mood, activity or outfit. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you need to stay on top of things, Pebble can help with vibrating notifications, messages and alerts. Dismiss a notification with a shake of your wrist. Don't worry, it's easy to disable all notifications.\nIncoming Caller ID\nEmail (Gmail or any IMAP email account)\nCalendar Alerts\nFacebook Messages\nTwitter\nWeather Alerts\nSilent vibrating alarm and timer\nAndroid users can also receive Text Messages (SMS) on their Pebble. Unfortunately iPhone does not expose this data. Have any suggestions for other notification types? Leave us a message in the comments! \nCUSTOMIZE BY CODING\nWant your watch to tell you when your next bus is leaving? Maybe you're jonesing to see your compile status or recent github commits.. Think push notifications, directly to your watch using the data connection on your phone. Want to check-in on your watch, or create an app that can monitor your sleep? Pebble can send data from the accelerometer and buttons back up to the internet. \nPebble can receive simple alerts and notifications from if this then that (ifttt.com) or our web-facing RESTful endpoint. More adventurous developers can use the Pebble SDK, with its Arduino-like abstractions and simple C structure, to gain full control of the watch. Multiple apps can run on Pebble, along side watchfaces and regular notifications.\nLoad apps using Bluetooth \n144 x 168 pixel display black and white e-paper\nBluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy)\n4 buttons\nVibrating motor\n3 axis accelerometer with gesture detection\nDistribute apps via Pebble watchapp store\nDetailed SDK specs are available on our Pebble Dev Blog.\nHow does it work?\nPebble connects by Bluetooth to your iPhone or Android device. Setting up Pebble is as easy as downloading the Pebble app onto your phone. All software updates are wirelessly transmitted to your Pebble.\nCompatibility\niPhone 3GS, 4, 4S running iOS 5 or any iPod Touch with iOS 5.\nAndroid devices running OS 2.3 and up. Works great with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)!\nUnfortunately Pebble does not work with Blackberry, Windows Phone 7, or Palm phones at this time.\nWhere we're at\nWe\u2019ve been working on smartwatches for over 3 years now. The Pebble that you see in the video is a real, working prototype.\nWith your support, we can bring Pebble onto wrists worldwide. While we're close to entering production, your contribution will help fund:\n- Production tooling\n- Large component order\n- Global Bluetooth certification\nREWARDS\nEach Pebble has a textured plastic case, shatter resistant lens with an anti-reflective optical coating and a custom-designed 22mm rubber strap. You'll also receive a special USB cable that recharges the watch.\nColor Option: Voter's Choice You're part of the design process! Three color options are already set: Arctic White, Jet Black and Cherry Red. If you back any of the color options, we'll email you a survey after the project closes so you can vote on a new, 4th color option. Later on, we'll email you again asking which of the final color options you'd like to select. Even if you don't like the Voter's Choice, you'll be able to choose from Red/White/Black.\n$99 - Early Bird: 200 Black watches available.\n$115 - One Black Pebble.\n$125 - One Color Pebble.\n$220 - Two Black Pebbles.\n$235 - Prototype Pebble for early app development + one Color Pebble.\n$240 - Two Color Pebbles.\n$550 - Five Color Pebbles.\n$1000 - Ten Color Pebbles.\n$1,250 - Custom watchface + five Color Pebbles.\nFAQ\nQ.
