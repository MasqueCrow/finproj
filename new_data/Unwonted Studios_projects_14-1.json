Nonetheless, an unexpected chance turns up for you to become a man. The only thing is, during sex you find out that having it teleports you to other worlds. Which you\u2019ll have to save from global disasters and catastrophes. But for a start you should try to return home. How? The same way you got there, find a girl and try not to fall in love with her. Because if you do this thing right you will probably never see her again...\nText copy of video\nRoman\nRoman: \u2013 Greetings visual novel lovers! Because this video is intended for visual novel lovers I decided to get in the game. Now I can tell you about our project from inside the game. To begin with, my name is Roman. I'm also from Russia. But don't think you'll see any vodka, balalaikas or Gorbatchov in the game. What is more, we don't have bears walking our streets and there are no... What? The painting on the wall? Fine, I'll admit it, they do walk the streets. And we ride them. At least this famous gentleman does. But no balalaikas for sure! Or matryoshkas... But there will be cute girls. Like the one on TV for example.\nNatalie\nRoman: \u2013 That is Natalie and she is one of the game characters. If we raise enough money to create the full version you will have a chance to meet her. Perhaps even a bit more than meet. =^__^= In the short demo version you will get to spend time with Linda.\nRoman and Linda\nLinda: \u2013 Hi! I'm the Linda that will send the main character to another world. In quite an interesting way...\nRoman: \u2013 Stop! No spoilers! Let the readers see it for themselves. There will be a link to the demo-version on the page.\nLinda: \u2013 I just wanted to say...\nRoman: \u2013 Shush woman, you talk more than enough in the game. Give the men a word.\nLinda: \u2013 Pff... Men...\nRoman: \u2013 Sweetie, we love you the way you are, but talking to you wasn't the reason I got in the game...\nLinda: \u2013 What? How dare you! You hurt my feelings...\nSave menu\nRoman: \u2013 I'm here to tell about the amazing project we're working on. What a great musician we have! What a fantastic artist! What a wonderful translator! Even the writer-programmer-team lead is not so bad. Only they don't want to work for free for some reason... Strange guys. I understand. Making games puts food on their table. But they could wait six months or so. It's not like they have to eat every day or pay the rent... But then again, they probably won't be making games then. Well then, we'll have to help them out. I already paid them some money myself but I'm afraid that without your help the project won't see the light of day. So let's raise at least a thousand dollars for the first part. Actually, we don't have to stop at that and raise more. The more we raise the more parts of the novel will be created. And the most generous benefactors will get to join me and Linda in the game. Huh, I like it here! I don't even want to go back to the 3D world. Mind if I stay?\nLinda: \u2013 Sure, you can stay.\nRoman: \u2013 Great... Wait! Linda, why are you the one to decide?\nLinda: \u2013 Because the writer isn't in the game. He said he's not photogenic. So I have to talk for him. I'm extremely photogenic!\nRoman: \u2013 Can't argue with that. But the writer could've joined us too. Who cares what you look like. You can be anyone in the game! Linda: \u2013 He says he will think about it.\nRoman: \u2013 Too late. It's not free anymore. Those who, like I, will help the developers will have the opportunity to become part of the game as characters. Well then, let's start? Let's help an interesting game come into existence!?\nLinda: \u2013 Bye-bye! P.S.: We have minigames!

The story of Mach, a foreign StarCraft 2 player that put it all on the line, was one that many fans told us they resonated with.The demand to learn more about the world of eSports and the struggle that its competitors contend with went beyond our expectations. \nYou can play the original game on Steam to experience what caused so many people to push for another installment of the series.  \nPlay the game that started it all.\n A sequel to SC2VN was never part of the plan. But you, our fans, have made it clear that we have stories left to tell. We agree.\nTeam Eleven is happy to announce our next visual novel, Don\u2019t Forget Our eSports Dream, a prequel to SC2VN set in the Brood War era of South Korea\u2019s professional StarCraft scene.  \nWe have received permission from Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. to use their assets in our upcoming game.

Beholden to the idea that only the best players deserve to live and train in South Korea, Bolt contends equally with setbacks and triumphs in the chase for his eSports dreams.\nAt his side is Chae-young \u201cJett\u201d Song, a former darling of the Korean Pro-Gaming Association and an estranged childhood friend. A year after her departure from the professional Brood War competition, Jett continues to make her living on StarCraft on low-paying local tournaments and betmatches. Together, she and Bolt strive to become champions and to resolve their differences along the way.\nTheir journey takes them to rival PC bangs, international tournaments, the offices of Korea\u2019s top eSports officials, and into the booth at the highest level of professional StarCraft.\nThe game will feature  \nLarger gameplay and narrative scope in comparison to its predecessor (we are shooting for 3X)\nAn authentic story that is both true to eSports fans and relatable to a general audience\nPlayer choices for both character interactions and StarCraft strategies.\nSequences featuring both StarCraft Brood War games and original reimagined StarCraft art. \nA glossary of StarCraft and eSports terms for new players\nGalleries for character and background art\nSteam Trading Cards and Achievements\nWe\u2019re returning to Kickstarter more than two years since our original SC2VN crowdfunding campaign back in September 2013.

Choose from Melee, Ranged, Air, Siege and more\nExperience an arcade-style battle arena: Pick up speed boosts, damage modifiers and health on the map to gain an edge\nTrigger deadly traps to surprise your enemy\nPlay through story campaigns to experience the Eternal Flame universe\nOver 12 Heroes to choose from in Season One\nOver 30 Minions to choose from in Season One\nCustomize your tower\nParticipate in tournaments and special events\nONE TOWER is the game WE want to play. Why? Here\u2019s why:\nWe are tired of watching mindless, useless minions running to an enemy\u2019s tower in other MOBAs.\nWe want more control of the game. Why only a hero? Why not control your minion waves?\nWe love the classic RTS game unit types including melee, ranged, siege and air\u2026 and having LOTS of them to choose from.\nWe want a fun head-to-head battle arena game that is specifically designed for head-to-head play.\nWe want heroes to be simple again like we experienced in Warcraft III. No more going through hundreds of item descriptions in an item shop to create the perfect build only to have your items nerfed in a game update.\nWe don\u2019t want to have 30-60 minute matches. Many of us have families and cannot play for 2 hours. We can get in 6-8 matches within an hour.\nONE TOWER is designed and balanced so that the typical match will last between 10-15 minutes. Higher-skilled players may be able to end games within 6 minutes if they can get the early advantage.\nIn the event of a stalemate, players can opt for a secondary objective of killing the siege demon to force an attack on the enemy tower which will cause considerable damage. After a few of these tower attacks the game will end. Our siege demon can be taken as early as level 9 and respawns every minute.\nONE TOWER isn\u2019t just another MOBA game and does not try to replace larger MOBAs like League of Legends, DOTA 2, Heroes of the Storm or SMITE. We expect many players to play ONE TOWER in between longer matches of their favorite game, whether it be one of the aforementioned games or a game from a completely different genre.\nPlayers can control their minion wave configurations, whether you want tanks, casters, healers, air, DPS or siege, you can configure your wave and change them on the fly to dominate and outwit your opponent.\nNo more learning and memorizing the perfect item builds or tech trees. Players of all skill levels will be able to jump into the game and immediately understand how to play.\nToxicity arises the most when teammates are feeding the enemy team and causing you to lose 30-60 minutes of your life that you\u2019ll never get back. No more having to argue over who will jungle, take mid, top or bottom. No more complaints about why you didn\u2019t heal, gank or ward.\nONE TOWER will foster competitive play and sportsmanship in it's community. You\u2019ll need to outwit and outplay your opponent instead of trying to anger your teammate into surrendering or going AFK.\nThe Eternal Flame universe is tightly intertwined. Everything and everyone is connected and has a specific role to play in our story, from heroes, locations, beasts and minions to their origins, abilities and appearances.\nExplore a bit of our world\u2019s lore below and discover more as we release it.\nThe ancients have passed their stories of legend and lore on to the generations that have survived Prestiya. Whether these generations have survived because of fate or fortune, it makes no difference, these stories both haunt the dreams of children and inspire those hoping to become Prestiya\u2019s next legendary hero, to have their names and victories spoken of by the generations to come.\nThese histories of Prestiya are often challenged by the scholars who claim they are children\u2019s stories. Stories of people who live in the forests called The Flow who can harness the power of nature to crush their enemies. Stories of beasts the size of mountains and the undead that dwell in the underdepths of the Arrian Rift.\nPrestiya is a small continent with treacherous environments. The Valley of Arrian is the most lush and coveted piece of land not only because of its rich soil and resources, but also because of the natural safe haven its surroundings provide, with mountains to the north and south, the rift to the west and the ocean to the east. Raiders attempting an attack from the mountains would need to be on foot and would likely fall to their deaths or run out of food before initiating an attack. An attack from the water would also be unlikely due to the razor sharp reefs.\nThe Sca are the first known civilization in Prestiya. They took claim of the Valley of Arrian and established a stringent set of rules and judgements that were so harsh no one dared to break them, and no tribe or people ever attempted to challenge their claim to the valley. Sca made great advances in architecture and weapon technology that often resembled magic. The Sca kingdom is protected by a series of towers spread throughout the valley\u2019s entry points. These towers stand alone and are powered by the ground beneath them \u2013 pulling energy into them creating a pulse energy that fires at any hostile threats detected nearby.\nAs the Sca fell into a deep slumber of increasing their gain and leisure, a great change has been happening around them, invisible to their complacent eyes. Many would be forced to wake and face the reality of their world as the wilds of Prestiya fall upon them.\nEvery hero is designed around a particular faction which establishes their origins and play style. Our story begins with these four factions.\nThe Sca have been the protectors of the Eternal Flame since the beginning of civilization in Prestiya. They live by strict laws of purity without compromise and those who fail to follow them are exiled without question. Because of this, the once unstoppable empire is now at its most vulnerable state.\nThe Firelords were formed by many of the original lords from the Sca. Now banished, the Firelords claim the Eternal Flame is rightfully theirs and they will stop at nothing to see it returned to their hands. They are heavy handed and often ask questions later.\nNecro were once a part of Sca\u2019s elite army, trained from birth to protect Sca kingdom. When Lord Bantinan was killed by Galagor on their watch, the Sca lords damned them to the underworld.\nThe Necro, while dark and mutated in appearance, are actually the most misunderstood in our universe. Their banishment to the underworld was a cruel and unfair penalty for their alleged failure to protect Lord Bantinan, and they will do everything they can to see redemption and to rise again and take back their home.\nFlow are believed to have existed before the Sca and many suspect they were born from the Eternal Flame. Flow are connected to earth, air, water and fire. They have little interest in the Eternal Flame and are guardians of nature, using fire only as a last resort.\nFlow\u2019s heroes do not desire destruction, favoring harmony with nature. When in combat, Flow heroes are calm, but powerful, exerting little effort while packing a punch.\nONE TOWER\u2019s heroes are key to tipping the battle scales in your favor. Heroes have unique abilities that players must learn to harness to assist them in battle against the enemy hero, minions and jungle creep.\nAll heroes are designed to be damage dealers, but each hero is also designed to have a support ability to assist them in battle. As your hero earns experience points it will level up which will allow you to unlock and upgrade special abilities.\nBecause ONE TOWER relies heavily on minion control and management, heroes in ONE TOWER do not have item builds. Many minions are designed with their own passive abilities that can affect or assist the hero, including heals, stuns and other buffs.\nWhen players first begin playing ONE TOWER, they will be given a hero upon completing the tutorial campaign. After, players can unlock additional heroes by using Ore that is earned in-game through winning matches, or they can purchase mystery treasure chests that may grant a hero. At ONE TOWER\u2019s release players will have over a dozen heroes to choose from, with new heroes continuously being added as part of new game updates.\nMinions are the cornerstone of ONE TOWER. Players will need to micro-manage their minion wave configurations and counter the enemy\u2019s waves in order to win.\nChoose from a variety of minion types, including:\nTanks\nDPS\nRanged & Casters\nHealers\nSiege\nAir\nAnti-Air\nSupport & Utility\nUsing gold earned in-game, players will buy and deploy new minions to the lane in the order they choose. You can earn gold through killing minions, jungle creep, and your opponent\u2019s hero.\nPlayers will earn a core set of minions through completing tutorial campaigns and may earn more either through completing campaigns, unlocking via Ore earned from winning matches or through opening mystery chests.\nHeroic Minions are a special kind of minion that can be earned from mystery chests. Heroic Minions closely resemble common minions but are able to be upgraded by winning matches and can earn special abilities. For example, a Heroic Archer can be upgraded into a Fire Archer and so on.\nONE TOWER\u2019s battle arena was carefully designed for head-to-head arcade style gameplay in mind and to give players a level of depth rarely found in MOBAs. Players are given only a single tower to protect them in a single lane leaving no room for mistakes.\nThe battle arena has power-ups spread throughout the map. Players will need to time the power-up respawns in order to control the map while pushing the lane and clearing the jungle at the same time.\nTo raise the stakes even higher, we\u2019ve added a few surprises to the map, including traps to ensnare your enemy, a trader to boost your income and a siege beast that attacks your opponent\u2019s tower when captured.\nAdditional battle arenas will be designed after the release of ONE TOWER or upon reaching the stretch goal to allow us to design more arenas for players.\nPlayers will be able to jump into a Quick Match with players of similar level, or choose to be pitted against other players of similar level and win ratio within Ranked Match. Players can also directly challenge friends to an unranked match.\nIn addition to these matchmaking modes we will host special events for players including prize-based tournaments and leagues.\nWe\u2019re a small indie game development studio and we\u2019ve been able to build a playable version of ONE TOWER through keeping our development costs to a minimum. The funding goal will help us fund the additional content needed in order to complete and release the game.\nIn addition to the funding, Kickstarter provides us with an amazing platform to receive direct and early feedback from the Kickstarter gaming community which is an invaluable tool for helping us shape the game.
