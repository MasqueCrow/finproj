Projects often have trouble completing production and meeting the expected deadlines for shipment. The project could face possible challenges if the quality of the product or packaging does not meet our requirements. However, we will personally be in charge of assembling and shipping all of the pledge rewards as soon as we reach our goal. Our last project was fortunate enough to deliver earlier than expected for most backers. Our team is experienced and has been preparing for months to ensure that post-funding will be like clockwork when the time comes.\nAlthough we do not see any direct risks and challenges, there are always indirect or unseen tasks that may present itself during the process of productions. We hope to run everything as streamlined as possible and also ahead of schedule. Like most small businesses, we face a challenge when trying to offer affordable pricing while postage rates are continually rising. Furthermore, due to lack of infrastructure and transport from the global pandemic, reliability in shipments have plummeted resulting in increased costs and losses.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe've designed this wallet to last longer than our BANDO 2.0!

The storage capacity can be upgraded by simply exchanging the SSD module in the future.  \nThis model does not have a built-in SSD storage. \nYou can add your own:\n- external USB Drive or\n- M.2 2280 SSD module to use as your storage. \n\nFor example, if you plug in a 2TB drive, then you will have 2TB storage space. \n* Diskless model also comes with the M.2 SSD connector on it.

We have shipped the first version of Monument to users from 120 different countries and gained an invaluable experience. \n\nIf we experience any difficulties along the way, we will be as transparent as possible and communicate every detail in a timely manner. \n\n- Software Development \nIf you were a part of Monument 1 campaign, you may have experienced difficulties with our initial software. Thanks to our early supporters, we have improved the overall experience significantly. \n\nWhile the software architecture for Monument 2 is developed from the ground up, we're using a significant portion of the existing code base which is pretty stable. Monument 2 software is currently in internal beta testing. The foundation of the client apps is based on our existing software and we've been testing them internally. We are not expecting delays with the Monument 2 software. \n\nAdditionally, we will ship review devices to our beta users before the mass production starts. Doing so, we can ensure the software meets our expectations before we start shipping all rewards.\n\n- Manufacturing \nThe hardware development of the Monument 2 is complete and the design is verified. We're working with our existing manufacturing partners and they're ready to continue with the production once the certification is complete. \n\n- Fulfillment \nWe have an ongoing fulfillment operation and been shipping Monument worldwide. However, due to COVID 19, we have been observing delays with certain carriers and changing regulations depending on the destination due to lockdowns. This may result in additional delays for these regions.

We\u2019ve even looked at different curvatures to come up with the evenest lighting we can get in a compact space. Our LED system guarantees that all your microgreens will grow to a beautifully uniform height for maximum yield.\n  Why Pink Light?  \nThere's a good reason you'll find pink lights in many indoor commercial farms, and Micro is no different. Using LED's that target the specific wavelengths of light where plants are the most efficient at their photosynthetic process allows us to be more effective with the lighting as well as use less power.\nThe Power of Modular Design\nEvery Micro has zero holes that you have to plug something into. Instead, they magnetically snap together, securely transmitting power to each other.\n\n        All this is possible because of the Power plate which is the base of your stackable garden. But wait... The power plates are stackable too! Magnetically snap another one and make your garden taller.\n The Story Behind Agriolabs and the Micro\n S T R E T C H   GOALS\nStretch goals are reward tiers that become available for purchase or are automatically applied to applicable rewards.\n\nIncluded Performance USB Chargers - Applied to Quad Stacks | Unlocks at $13,000\nWith the Agriolabs Performance USB charger, you can ensure that your quad stack will always be performing at its best without any dimming or loss of power. All Quad stacks and above will automatically have these added to their rewards when we surpass $13k!\n\nSeedpad Include Label Stickers - All Tiers Containing Seedpads | Unlocks at $20,000\nKeep track of whats in each micro, especially if you have stacks of them. We make these stickers in house, just like everything else. Every Seedpad will come with a label sticker.\n\nDishwasher Safe Water Drawer & Removable Drawer Fronts - All Micros | Unlocks at $30,000\nWanna keep an eye on your microgreens as they grow? Simply remove the front of the drawer after the microgreens have sprouted (doing this before may result in poor sprouting due to lower humidity). \nWhile the drawer water reservoir isn't that hard to clean with a sponge and some soap,  we'll make it extra easy by making it dishwasher safe. Just throw it on the top rack of your dishwasher and wash as normal! Easy peasy. \n\nTruly Wireless Powerplate - CAD$35 | Unlocks at $50,000\nThe Powerplate requires power via a USB-C Cable... Or does it? With the Wireless Powerplate, the Powerplate itself can be the power source for your Micro's. Simply charge it up, stack your Micro(s) on top, and it'll last you long enough to grow a delicious bed of microgreens. This add-on will allow you to have true freedom. Want to grow microgreens under your sink? Behind your toilet? On the top shelf of a secret closet? We won't judge, go wild, enjoy that absolute freedom.\nWe have some plans and drawings but haven't done all the calculations to finalize this design yet, but we'll make it happen if you make us!\n\nInjection Molded Shell - Automatically Applied to all Micros | Unlocks at $100,000\nThe Micro is full of intricate details that all work together, and most of those details are impossible to injection mold. The outer shell is not one of them. \nWhat's injection molding though!? Injection molding is type of manufacturing where plastic material is melted, and injected into a metal mold. The mold cools and a solid plastic part is formed. Injection molding is how much plastic items are made and is known to have good surface quality, depending on the machine/finishing process.\nAlthough our 3D printed build quality is not that far off from injection molded plastic, the outer shell of the Micro actually takes the longest to print. It's full of broad simple shapes that injection molding would do a fantastic job of creating. Thus injection molding our shell will result in a more consistent build, and quicker fulfillment. It'll also allow our specialized 3D printers focus on what they're good at.\n\nWant to see more stretch goals? We're open to ideas. Chat With Us\n\nLet's Go Hyperlocal... Wait, What Does That Mean?\nTraditional agriculture is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions worldwide. Growing \u201chyper-local\u201d means your food doesn\u2019t have to travel thousands of miles to reach you and cuts out unnecessary middlemen all while delivering you healthier, more affordable food. This is our first step to making hyper-local the new normal.\nDid you know the average North American throws out about $2000 of food a year?\n        A majority of that food waste is organic content which produces methane gas, which is 25x more damaging than carbon dioxide.\nHyper-locally grown food reduces the demand for less sustainably grown produce, as well as tasting better and staying fresh much longer, reducing the amount of organic waste going to the landfill.\nBeautiful, Sustainable Design\n  ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING  \nIs a term for when you add material when creating something instead of taking away material like subtractive manufacturing.\n\n        The most commonly known form of additive manufacturing is 3D printing, which is used in most components of our products with a special high-quality, high-strength version of the bio-polymer called polylactic acid (PLA).\n  SUSTAINABLE TO ITS CORE  \nYour contribution to less global waste doesn\u2019t just start at your first harvest. With additive manufacturing and high quality, compostable bioplastics, it begins the moment you invest in an Agriolabs product.\n  HOW DOES IT WORK?  \nLike nature, 3D Printing builds layer by layer, until the finished product is done. This efficient process allows us to use our material to its greatest extent and minimize waste which is good for the environment and our pockets\n    THE CHALLENGE.  \nTime. 3D printing takes a long time compared to more traditional forms of additive manufacturing like injection molding.\n\n        However, with our print farm growing and constant advances in technology, we are slowly reaching up to the speeds of traditional manufacturing processes.\n\n        We strive to have the best surface finish on all 3D printed parts, whether that means post-processing or working with our material supply partners & polymer engineers to source innovative materials to further improve the visual and structural quality.\n\nThe Humans Behind Agriolabs\nBragging isn't really our style, but we aren't lying when we say we've got the most amazing team ever. Agriolabs was made to tackle big problems by leveraging awesome technology and out of the box thinking. Everyone in the team is a natural problem solver in their own way and we all share the same mission to do good, sustainably. We start with the MICRO as our first step in our mission to get more people eating what they grow, reducing their waste output and carbon footprint. \n\nWhat we'll do with your support:\nYou've decided to support us with your hard earned money, you can bet that we'll use it wisely. From creating jobs, helping reduce food waste, or building vertical farms in the oceans, know that you're supporting a innovative startup that is willing to take massive action. \n Are you looking for the stretch goals here? You'll find them about 3 sections up :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy are seedpads Canada only?\n\nOur seedpads contain organic seeds embedded in hemp fibre mats and covered. This means that most departments of agriculture will NOT allow them to be imported as they are unable to identify the seeds easily, as well as the possibility of certain species being invasive, and other reasons. \nAt this time we are only offering our Canadian backers seedpads in order to keep fulfillment running as smoothly as possible.\n\n\nFulfillment time & process:\n\nWe're looking at being able to fulfill most units within the next 4-6 months of the Kickstarter completing. \nWe'll be fulfilling units of earlier backers first, so if you backed our project on the last day, that's still fantastic and you'll still receive your reward, but it may take longer than some other backers. \n\nWith the pandemic still going strong, please understand that there may be delays in the global shipping system. \n\nBackers's rewards will be organized and processed through our online store system, so you will receive details (such as tracking #'s) regarding your package and shipment by email or text from our site. \n\n\nThe more we raise the quicker fulfillment will be:\n\nSurpassing the goal by large amounts will allow us to bring more processes in house instead of sourcing them internationally. Allowing us to:\n- Bring bio-plastic resins in house where they will be processed, extruded, and used in manufacturing all under the same roof. \n- Get more, higher quality printers and exponentially increase production. \n- Create some jobs! We'll likely be hiring someone to help automate the assembly line, someone to manage our print farm, and another position as well. \n- Get some awesome universal robots to help our staff do all the heavy lifting & repetitive processes quicker and safer.\n\n\nFinal Notes:\n\n2020 has been an extremely unpredictable year so far, and we have no idea what to expect with our fulfillment window extending into 2021. \n\nNo matter what happens though, you had our backs and we'll have yours. Expect frequent updates and reports from our founding team. Our goal is to be as transparent and authentic with our backers as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe Micro has a extremely durable build. You probably won't be dropping your garden a lot, but if you do, it'll survive the fall. \nThe Micro is easy to clean with some soap, water, and a sponge. Allowing you to use and re-use it year after year.\nReusability and recyclability\nWith a durable build of over 85% biodegradable & compostable material, the micro will last as long as you will. \nHowever, if for some reason it ends up in a landfill, the Micro will decompose in as little as 5 years, compared to some plastics that take decades to decompose.\nSustainable materials\nThe main material used in the creation of the Micro is derived from Vegetable starches, usually corn and sugar cane. It is renewable, sustainable, and helps use by-product from other industries that would have ended up in the landfill.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe're a vertically integrated startup. We understand that it makes it a lot more difficult but it allows us to control every step of the process. From the sourcing of north american made Bio-polymers to manufacturing & packing our own products. \nThis ensures that we operate ethically and remain environmentally friendly. Our manufacturing facilities are also optimized to reduce waste as much as possible, and recycle waste product to be reused wherever we can. All in house.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll our products are packaged in recyclable/compost-able material. We ensure the contents of the package are safe while minimizing material required. Boxes contain at least 10% recycled paper.\nSomething else\nThe very nature of our product is carbon negative.

The problem is fabric mask itself, regardless cotton or polyester made one, does not have the capability to filter small particles. On average, fabric masks can only filter up to 20% of the airborne particles in the air.\nIn plain word, fabric masks alone is not good enough. Filter is needed to add the filtering capability to fabric masks. However, filters comes with different sizes and shape, which means you might need to pair a specific mask to a specific filter. \nEarth Filter Solution\nEarth Filter is created to add filtering capability to your current fabric masks, or any fabric you are wearing. \nEvery Earth Filter is made with 4 layers of top quality filtering materials, which provide filtering ability to N95 standard.\nWith our patented pending Earth Filter tap design, the mask can easily attached to your current fabric masks and add filtering ability immediately.\nEasily Uplift Your Current Fabric Mask\nEven on scarf!!\nWe need your support - and we are offering a awesome launch deal on Kickstarter!\nTo make Earth filter possible commerically, we need your support to reach a reasonable scale for us to negotiate with suppliers.

We have to reduce our mass production.\nWe need more durable products\n  This is why we created Scrubbio: to replace all similar and single-use products with only a simple product, thereby considerably reducing our production.\nThis product replaces many other products in your home and will decrease global production. You could also keep it and use it for years. Scrubbio is made with a recyclable & ultra-durable silicone. \nWe must reduce our production of products to save nature. We have to produce durable and recyclable items easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo FUN!

Having been able to compare a diverse range of pros and cons, we have chosen an experienced, reliable, top quality manufacturer based in the EU and we've agreed on all key terms with them such as lead times, minimum order quantities, terms of quality assurance and pricing. \nWe are, however, not dependant on one manufacturer and we have a sound contingency plan. There might be no planet B, but we definitely have Plan B should there be a delay. \n\nShipping\nOur ultimate goal is to ensure that no US and EU based backer pays any import duties, taxes or other charges on top of their pledge. We have found a fulfilment partner who will help us deliver on that goal.\n\nTiming\nOur timeline published above includes some leeway for unexpected events, except COVID-19 and any other force majeure.\n\nCOVID-19\nOur delivery schedule assumes manufacturing capability of our supplier currently affected by COVID-19 delays returns back to normal by mid-May. We will be closely monitoring the situation and provide you with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAirBag\u2122 has been designed to last a lifetime. We've intentionally chosen a more expensive manufacturer because we want to be 100% sure that we offer quality to support our claim. We've chosen a special, high-strength and durability material and added ripstop technology to make it significantly less prone to ripping and tearing.\nReusability and recyclability\nAirBag\u2122 is made from partially recycled material and it is fully recyclable (at least in the EU and UK).\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe have compared a number of factories in Asia and Europe and the decision is to proceed with a factory in the EU, which meets a number of criteria from carbon offsetting, fair wages, meeting EU environmental standards etc.\nSustainable Distribution\nWhenever available, shipping will be carbon neutral (currently we can guarantee this for customers in the EU and we'll be aiming for the same for orders from the USA as a matter of priority). All shipping will be 100% plastic free.\nSomething else\nFor every bag sold we will help protect a slice of precious wildlife habitat through the World Land Trust's 'Buy An Acre' scheme, best represented by their patron Sir David Attenborough.

Our unique, patented, two-candles-in-one design started with the idea that you could create a candle without the wasted wax left over from burning traditional candles. The idea is simple. Why not move the wick from the center of the candle out to the outer edge? Now you\u2019re burning the side of the candle that normally ends up in the garbage. As the candle burns, the sides flow into the middle leaving you with a cozy, wood wick candle at the end.\nWe started Spiral Light in our garage in 2017.  The demand for candles has grown faster than we could ever have imagined possible. This leaves us with no choice but to seek out a new, larger facility and create custom machines to help make enough candles to keep up with demand.  This Kickstarter campaign means we don't need to \"sell out\" to investors or handcuff ourselves to big banks/venture capital firms. This enables us to continue focusing on independent retailers and resisting the demands to put our candles in big box stores or on Amazon. Don't get us wrong, we like our \"Prime\" too. We just also like shopping local and our candles give stores an exclusive product they can sell without fear of being undercut.\nTo find out more about us and to try some for yourself, click Back This Project. Or read on to hear more of our story.\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n Unique Design:\nSpiral Light's unique design burns in a circle for the first three hours, filing in its hollow core. This is our \"Party Trick!\"\nLong Burning Time:\nWhen the hollow center is completely filled and the spiral portion burns out, you're left with a wood wick candle that you can enjoy for over 40 hours. That's the \"Real\" candle.\n Clean Burning: \nWhat's the recipe for a clean burning candle? It's a highly refined, food-grade, edible (please don't eat it) wax perfectly matched to the right sized, 100% cotton wick. It is phthalate-free scent oils mixed with vegetable-based colorants finished off with a locally sourced, softwood wick.\nGreat Scents:\nWe work hard to make sure every candle smells great. It starts with a bit of an obsession, add a little love and just a touch of family disagreement and voila, you have our candle scents. Seriously, we work with some of the best scent companies in the United States to bring you great smelling candles without the nasty chemicals.\nHandcrafted in the U.S.A\nUnlike a lot of candles, ours are all made in the United States from raw materials sourced right here in the U.S.  While we've been able to modify equipment to help us pour our candles faster, everyone of our candles is still hand-manufactured by our family and employees in our facility in Minnesota.\n\n\nWe could have just been happy that one of our candles actually worked and set off to make a million of them but we didn't.  We have three different sizes and burn times so that everyone can afford to try a Spiral Light and make them their favorite \"go-to\" gift item.\n\nWe can climb the highest mountain and scream out all the great things about Spiral Light Candles. But, in the end, we are only as good as what our backers think.  We know we have a great product that people will love but it sure is nice to see it in writing.\n\nLoyal to the Local Store\nIf we had a dollar for every time someone asked us when we are going to \"Sell out\" to the big candle industry or show up on Shark Tank, we wouldn't need to look for backers. We are driven to remain the champions of smaller, independent retailers across the Country. We can do this without investors, without big box stores and without Amazon. Just our family, our friends and our backers making a great product for great people.\nManufacturing Capacity\nOur Existing Factory  \nWhen we started this adventure just over two years ago, we took a huge leap of faith and built out our current 2,500 square feet manufacturing space and small retail store. While it served us well at the time, It's already too small.\n\nThe New Space\nThis is the new home of Spiral Light Candles. At almost 8,000 square feet, we now have the space necessary to grow.  We need your help to bring in the new equipment and hire the people that will help us keep up with the growing demand.\n\nNot sure how this whole Kickstarter thing works? Read on.\nTo help us get the new factory up and running, you must become a \"backer\" of this Kickstarter project.

The good news is we have been making these candles for well over two years. We don't need your help to make a candle, we need your help to grow into a national brand without selling out to the big box stores or venture capitalists. While the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has created a complicated environment for a lot of small businesses, we have managed to stay lean throughout our entire growth spurt. We do this by paying for everything we use upfront and we have managed to stay debt free through it all. We will survive and with your support we will use this time to grow stronger.\n \nYour help ensures that we can grow to meet the demand necessary to stay independent and to continue to sell our super cool candles through independent retailers without the need to sell out. \n\nA lot of Kickstarter projects get tripped up during the shipping and fulfillment stage. Believe me, after this last Holiday season we've got this covered. We have the right tools and people in place to make it work.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur candles are by nature a consumable item. We do however get our long burn time by utilizing an extremely hard wax.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur unique candle design was invented with very idea that we could completely use all the wax that is normally wasted in a traditional candle. When burned correctly there should be nothing to throw away except a tiny sliver of wax and a recyclable steel clip. With no jar, there is no glass to dispose of and the light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.\n\nWe package all our candles in recyclable kraft paper boxes and ship only using starch based packing peanuts and 100% recyclable shipping boxes.\nSustainable materials\nOur packaging is manufactured from recycled kraft paper. Our wax is a food grade, edible wax (please don't eat it). We use 100% sustainable cotton and softwood wicks. Our scent oils and vegetable based colorants contain no toxins nor California Prop 65 components providing a very clean burning final product.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nOur new space uses LED lighting and a brand new and efficient heating and cooling system. We work very hard to keep our footprint as small as possible.\nSustainable Distribution\nOur light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.

Most of the problems such as fire, charging error and slow charging during wireless charging are actually due to unstable modules.\n Module can be charged even at a distance of 7mm\n\n1PICK supports up to 10W of wireless charging.\nIt requires 15W wireless charging functionality for both transmitter and receiver to be fully compatible for normal 15W wireless charging. The fact that the wireless charger supports 15W does not mean that all smartphones will be 15W wireless charging and even smartphones that support 15W wireless charging may vary depending on the 'standard' used. Even though the smartphone manufacture's 'original specification' has 15W fast wireless charging technology, most third-party wireless chargers do not charge 15W.\nIn short, most wireless charger specs you know and buy are 15W, but there is no difference in actual charging speed.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n5 years ago, in spring 2016, there was a product that I created with the idea of adding wireless charger to the magnet holder, the most convenient form. I thought, 'Let's use it until the right ready-made product came out'. So I decided to commercialize it myself and now I am trying to do more testing, research, hard work to make the right product because it is a product that many people should use.\nWe made our first appearance 1PICK through Kickstarter.\nMost of the funding amount will be used for the development and mass production of 1PICK, Other funds will be used for the development of subsequent 1PICK products.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "1PICK 1EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assis arm + Cable + Absorption Mount\nINCLUDES:\n1PICK\n2\u00d7 1PICK Plate\nAssist Arm\nBlowhole Mount\nCable\nAbsorption Mount\nAdhesive Mount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["91 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Early Bird Couple Pack : 1PICK 2EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assist arm + Cable + CD Slot Mount\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 1PICK\n4\u00d7 1PICK Plate\n2\u00d7 Assist Arm\n2\u00d7 Blowhole Mount\n2\u00d7 Cable\n2\u00d7 CS Slot Mount\n2\u00d7 Adhesive Mount\nPower Outlet", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers", "Limited (1 left of 30)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 59 or more", "title": "1PICK Couple Pack 2EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assist arm + Cable + Absorption Mount+ Power Outlet\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 1PICK\n5\u00d7 1PICK Plate\n2\u00d7 Assist Arm\n2\u00d7 Blowhole Mount\n2\u00d7 Cable\n2\u00d7 Absorption Mount\n2\u00d7 Adhesive Mount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["63 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "1PICK Family Pack", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Assist arm + Cable + Absorption Mount + Power Outlet\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 1PICK\n10\u00d7 1PICK Plate\n4\u00d7 Assist Arm\n4\u00d7 Blowhole Mount\n4\u00d7 Cable\n4\u00d7 Absorption Mount\nPower Outlet\n4\u00d7 Adhesive Mount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (16 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird : Simple Pack", "descp": "1PICK + Power Outlet + 1PICK Plates\nINCLUDES:\n1PICK\n2\u00d7 1PICK Plate\nPower Outlet\nCable\nAssist Arm", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Early Bird : 1PICK 1EA", "descp": "1PICK + Adhesive Mount + Blowhole Mount + Asist arm + Cable + CD Slot Mount\nINCLUDES:\n1PICK\n2\u00d7 1PICK Plate\nBlowhole Mount\nAssist Arm\nCable\nCS Slot Mount\nAdhesive Mount\nPower Outlet", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "30 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "New Update", "update_content": "Hello Dear Supporters!\nFirst of all, I am really, really sorry for the late response.\nWhile producing 1PICK magnetic holder, we found the critical bug!\nSome mobile phones cannot be held on exact position because of the inner charger and camera etc."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Good news!

The top finial also features fine knurled details on the outside.\nThe standard stainless steel nib can also be upgraded to a titanium flex nib for an extra \u00a345.\nBronze pens are very hard to find and usually very expensive, which makes the Naos a great opportunity to add one to your collection. Every single part of the pen except the nib has been machined from CuSn8 bronze, the same grade used in high-end watch cases. This material is very heavy and will form an attractive patina with age. \nWe use only the best nibs, manufactured by Peter Bock in Germany. The Naos uses Bock 250 which is a large nib with a 6mm feed, commonly known as a #6 nib.\nYou can add additional nibs to your pledge. Your pen comes with a steel nib, but you can upgrade to more flexible material like titanium for greater line variation. The nibs use a screw-in assembly so you don't need any tools to change them.\nEach material has a different character. Titanium has significant flex (considered a semi-flex nib). Steel is very smooth but provides little flex.\nStainless Steel sizes:  EF, F, M, B.\nTitanium: EF, M\nTitanium Flex Nib - EF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Naos fountain pen can be used with international standard cartridges (short or long) or a refillable cartridge called a \"converter\" which has a piston mechanism inside to draw ink up through the nib.\n\nAs explained above, you can transform your Naos fountain pen into a rollerball and vice versa by changing its grip section (extra grip section required, add \u00a310 to your pledge). \nThe rollerball refill provided is the Schmidt 5888F in black with a fine tip, a very smooth writer that uses water-based ink which, unlike ballpoints, requires very little pressure to write. This reduces fatigue and cramping during writing sessions.\n\nKeep your pen safe with our custom sleeves which are made by hand from high quality leather that has gone through the natural process of vegetable tanning.\nSimply add \u00a310 to your pledge.\n\nYou can choose options like colour, fountain pen/rollerball, and nib size in a survey that you will receive at the end of the campaign.\nInterested in multiple pens? Pledge for a set and save more!\n\n\nWant to add extra pens? Apart from the sets we offer, you can add extra pens to your reward simply by adding the following amounts to your pledge:\nTo have two writing instruments in one, just add \u00a310 to your pledge to get one rollerball grip section with a Schmidt refill.\nAdd the following amounts to your pledge. The accessories will also be available to add in the survey at the end of the campaign.\n\n\nNamisu was founded by Adrien Cols and Maria Millan, two fountain pen enthusiasts and designers based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have completed five large writing instrument projects over the past 5 years on Kickstarter and we will use this experience to successfully deliver your pledge.\n\nThroughout this time, we have developed strong relationships with experienced manufacturers which is crucial to delivering a high quality product. We are using similar manufacturing techniques as our previous five projects and have developed a production prototype to validate the feasibility of the design.\n\nWe know that there can always be some unexpected delays during production but we have planned for this and extended our production schedule accordingly. Raw materials like metal rods can arrive late during busy periods of the year; machines can break down and require servicing. These are minor delays that may require a small extension to the delivery date of the project, but which wouldn't affect our ability to deliver the project.\n\nAnother common challenge is fulfilling a project that exceeds its project funding goal significantly. To solve this potential issue we are working with large manufacturers that can produce our pens in any quantity realistically possible on Kickstarter. We do not anticipate any extension of the delivery date unless the project exceeds 2000 backers, at which point we would need to revise the manufacturing completion target date.\n\nWe are also working with a professional logistics and fulfilment company which will handle all shipping and packing operations to avoid any delays during the shipping phase of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "Naos Aluminium -

Sometimes we ignore it, sometimes we cherish it. \nBut why is sound so important?\nWe spend everyday hearing and listening, it is part of our lives.  Sound is influential, it can be informative, educational, conclusive, emotive, and many other things for us.\nThe problem is people remember only 30% of what they hear. Smartphones can do the \u2018work\u2019, they are certainly not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSo why not try the better solution?\nBorn from a team of researchers and engineers who spend many hours in front of a computer, TileRec is our constant reminder to take a walk and \"stop and smell the roses\", so to speak.\nWe designed TileRec to exceed even our own extremely high personal standards.  \n\n Thin: Only 1/4 inch thin. Fits easily in the slimmest wallets.\n Small: As small as a piece of a chocolate bar ( 2.48 square inch).\n Light:  The same weight as a US penny (0.5 oz).\n Simple: Simple everything! Easy to use, easy to recharge and easy to playback.\n Long-lasting Battery: 24 hours on one charge. Designed to be used the entire day.\n Surround Recording: 360 degrees recording in a 15 feet range. Meeting, lecture or simple discussion - all sounds are easily captured with HQ clarity.\n Resistant: 100% recycled aluminum casing. Sleek design that blends discreetly in the everyday setup.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 1.6 inch in length, and 1/4 inch in height, weighing only 0.5 oz nothing else on the market comes close with the discreet portability offered by TileRec.  \nTileRec is so slim and small than it can fit almost anywhere you can think of. It blends discreetly with everyday objects - in your pocket or wallet, between the pages of an agenda, on your desk or even on your child's backpack.\nTraditional voice recorders were bulky and uncomfortable, limiting day-to-day activities.   \nThe idea of a voice recorder so slim and thin that it can be used as a  personal assistant is to improve the daily productivity of its user. And is practically indestructible.\nYou can drop it, step on it, even run the car over and then resume recording. \nThe aluminum casing ensures complete protection for worry-free use.\nWhen you combine these benefits with excellent audio quality, you get a voice recorder that is perfect for lectures, interviews, meetings, and dictations too! \nMost smartphones have a built-in voice recorder app that you can use anytime, so they can do the \u2018work\u2019, but certainly are not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSmall, discreet and efficient, Tilerec is the latest voice recorder designed by ATTO DIGITAL, created to encompass the ideal balance between form and function. \nSo, what makes TileRec so superior to smartphones when it comes to recording?  \nTileRec is perfect for anyone that wants to work simpler, faster and better \u2013 without compromising quality. \nTileRec is recording Hi-Q MP3, using a 128 kbps bit rate. You can choose to set it to record in continuous mode or in voice-activated mode to capture sounds in a 15 feet range (360 degrees).\nIn voice-activated mode, the ultra-performant sensor of the microphone will initiate ad start recording only when sounds are detected in the range of the recorder (15 feet) thus avoiding recording long silent periods and saving memory time.\nThe built-in Li-Po 3.7 V battery (240 mAh) needs only 1.5 hours to fully charge (DC IN 5 V 500mA), even when connected to a computer and will be up and running for more than 24 hours.\nRecord the entire day then just plug & play all your recordings. \n*no additional software needed\n TileRec can also record while charging so you will not miss any information that matters to you.\nLet\u2019s get nostalgic for a hot second. Reflect on a childhood memory, recalling an exact time or event \u2014 what you were wearing, who you were with, the sights, smells, tastes. Try to remember how you felt, specific noises like, I don\u2019t know, shrilling crickets layered under siblings\u2019 laughter or, the sound of your mother's voice.\nIt\u2019s difficult, right? Unless the event was recorded, the memory is likely pretty hazy.  \nTileRec is designed to record your daily meetings, activities, and ideas in a non-intrusive way and carries our belief that \u201cwear-ability\u201d is the utmost goal in the design of everyday carry technology. \nYou live in a fast-paced world where TIME is MONEY and you are searching for the best tool to improve productivity and save time?  \n Here are  some situations  TileRec can help you with:  \nThe perfect solution for professional use\nLawyers may use them to take voice notes while preparing cases, while criminal investigators record digital notes in the field, and doctors use it to record important info about cases. If you make a living in one of these fields, you may find a portable voice recorder invaluable.  \nUsing a voice recorder has never been easier. \nSo why not take the leap into the digital era? Stop wasting time and paper trying to keep track of all the information. \nJust slide one button to record and enjoy the Tilerec experience.\nUse the USB cord to connect your TileRec to any computer and select the audio file you need to playback.  It's just that simple: \nPLAY\n\nCheck on Soundcloud the audio sample recorder with TileRec.\nThe Li-Po built-in battery of TileRec is re-chargeable for more than 1000 charging cycles. It takes only 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery, then it can record continuously or in voice-activated mode, for more than 24 hours. \nHave you ever wondered how much paper we use yearly? \nAmericans use 85,000,000 tons of paper a year; about 680 pounds per person. The average household throws away 13,000 separate pieces of paper each year. \nUsing TileRec for your daily notes and meetings saves time, effort and also 1 tree/ person/ year from becoming paper. \nAll this while increasing productivity, saving time and keeping all your information organized with time and date stamp!\n\n Find a reward that works for you and your family, office or team, there's something for everyone.  We are particularly excited to offer fast shipping in the US and EU.\n This is ATTO DIGITAL's  2nd product launched via crowdfunding.  We always deliver. We've learned a ton over our first Kickstarter, helping develop a good sense of our capabilities and timeline.\nThe satisfaction of our users is paramount!\nThat is why we want to make sure that when you enter the ATTO  family you feel the care and support.\nOur Customer Service team is  24/7 available to offer support in more than 5 languages. And because we really do believe in the manufacturing quality of our recorders, we offer lifetime warranty for TileRec.\nWe, the ATTO DIGITAL team, have more than 10 years of combined experience in designing, producing and selling sound recorders and surveillance equipment.\nDownload Press Kit \nOur mission and passion are to listen, so it is also paramount for us to listen to our customers' feedback to better understand how the ideal mini voice recorder should be. \n Our team is ready - so is the manufacturing - now we just need you! \nIt has been a long adventure. From brainstorming to product design, engineering, and branding, it has been a trying, monumental amount of time, conviction and expertise.\nIt has been a stressful, exciting and thrilling experience to design a product from scratch. We want you to be part of our experience! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working non-stop the for last 3 years developing this product and we feel that the amount we are trying to raise is realistic with what is needed for fulfilling the project. We know that the Kickstarter journey is a long one and that there might be several surprises along the way - including foul weather, or maybe even (shock!) our phones running out of battery.\n\nUnfortunately, there are always risks involved in getting a product from the prototype phase to the market, but we have done everything possible to minimize these risks for our backers. Extensive planning has gone into the costs needed for raw materials, labor and shipping and we feel confident we will be able to meet our outlined delivery goals.\n\nOur biggest challenge is the timely delivery of all of our components. In order to keep TileRec at such a small size, parts must be assembled simultaneously, meaning if one shipment gets delayed, our entire process may get slowed down. Hopefully, everything goes according to plan, but if not, we have multiple suppliers for each component, always ready with a plan B!\n\nThe second biggest concern is quality control. While we are using the best manufacturer in China who was the previous supplier for one of the top international consumer electronic brands, we need to inspect each TileRec to guarantee 100% satisfaction. This dedication to detail is time-consuming, yet necessary to ensure a quality product.\n\nWe promise to keep all of our backers informed if anything happens or our timeline changes! If we encounter anything that might affect the product, its development, and/or shipping date, we will make sure to notify you about it with frequent updates.

And that we throw 8 million tons of plastic waste every year into our oceans?\nPlastic situation in the ocean\nGravity Wave is a project created by young social entrepreneurs that have decided to act so that the numbers you just read start decreasing.\nGravity Wave team: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nWe want to change how things work for good and we have a very clear objective: Empty ALL the plastic from the Mediterranean Sea. Not only we want to recollect it, but we want to transform that waste into valuable products.\nTwo years ago we founded our first phone accessories company. We were producing phone cases, ring holders, USB\u2026 and all of our products were made out of plastic. We realised that in the smartphone industry everything gets outdated very fast and especially phone cases, 1 billion units that are thrown away every year because of this (some of them even inside their plastic packaging!) We took the decision of turn the whole business around. How could we be contributing to this negative impact on our lovely planet?  \nPlastic recycling\nWe realised that oceans are full of plastic (8 million tons end up there every year) and it is causing the whole marine ecosystem to collapse. We started thinking about solutions, and how we could collect all this plastic waste, as 70% is at the bottom of the ocean and we do not have the resources to remove it. Moreover, thousands of species are dying because of this.\nImpact of plastic waste in animals\nWe needed people that had the knowledge and the way\u2026 Of course, the fishermen! We then spoke with some of them and realised that every day they collected marine litter but didn\u2019t know what to do with it, and that's when we met our now partner Lefteris Arapakis, founder of Enaleia, a sustainable fishing school that has been operating for more than 3 years in Athens, Greece, where they show local fishermen how to collect waste from the sea. When they go out to fish, they dedicate part of their time to fish plastic waste and afterward they bring it back to the harbour and drop it in our containers. We then pay them for every KG they extract and we take care of the rest of the process. \nWe already have more than 130 boats in Greece which are now called #plasticfishers and have collected over 50 tons of marine litter! Along 2020 we are will start to work with the fishermen in Italy and Spain so we can continue cleaning the Mediterranean Sea.\nSo far we take care of the collection and supply, but how do we transform it? We started working hand in hand with Crazy & Things, our partners in Spain, who have been creating, developing and patenting products for more than 10 years. Recently they created Tecnikoa 3D filaments, a project focused on developing and producing 3D filaments. We had been working together in our previous mobile phone accessories company for a long time developing products, and at that time we decided to go one step further becoming partners of Gravity Wave S.L.\nTogether we got the recycling factory in Alicante, where we select, clean and cut into small pieces that are ready to be reused for creating new products. We then send it to the Crazy & Things factory (also in Alicante), where we produce 3D filament and smartphone cases. \nWe already have the first prototype created in our 3D printer with a filament made out of Ghost Nets collected from the sea.\nPLAY\n\nWe have created a business model that recycles and reuses marine litter to transform it into valuable products. But how do we close the circle? Can we achieve a fully circular economy model?  \nThree step manufacturing process\nAll the cases that we sell, if the user no longer wants them, can bring it to our collecting points all over Spain and will get a great discount for the next purchase of Gravity Wave products. With all the collected cases, we again do the recycling process and give them many more uses until they are no longer recyclable, then we transform it into energy with a 0 emissions certificate.\nThe idea to create this Kickstarter campaign is to produce the 6 needed molds to launch the first 13 phone model cases. By offering more models we reach to more people to whom we provide a sustainable alternative creating like this bigger impact that allows us to collect more and more marine litter every day. \nIn Gravity Wave we create sustainable alternatives for our daily life products so that the consumer knows where all these products come from and how they impact the global climate crisis. But we are not selling charity, we are selling quality.\nTechnical specifications\nBuying 1 Gravity Wave case, you contribute to extract 3KG of plastic from the Mediterranean Sea, and moreover, you contribute to sustainable fishing, empower plastic recycling, support local production, local job creation and of course the development of social projects.\nNow we need you so that Gravity Wave becomes a reality.\nContribute to this campaign and be one of the people leading the climate revolution!\nJoin the Wave!\n ESPA\u00d1OL\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \n1 funda = 3kg pl\u00e1stico\nELIGE TU FUNDA\nEdici\u00f3n GHOST NET\nEdici\u00f3n PLASTIC\nEdici\u00f3n GRAVITY\n\u00bfSab\u00edas que se tiran alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas de pl\u00e1stico para m\u00f3vil al a\u00f1o? \u00bfY que vertemos 8 millones de toneladas de pl\u00e1stico al a\u00f1o en mares y oc\u00e9anos? \nSituaci\u00f3n del pl\u00e1stico en mares y oc\u00e9anos.\nGravity Wave es un proyecto creado por j\u00f3venes emprendedores sociales que hemos decidido actuar para que las cifras que acabas de leer sean cada vez menores. \nEquipo Gravity Wave: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nQueremos cambiar las cosas de una vez por todas y tenemos un objetivo muy claro: vaciar todo el pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo. Pero no solamente recogerlo, sino convertir todo ese desecho en productos de valor. \nHace dos a\u00f1os empezamos con una empresa dedicada a la fabricaci\u00f3n de accesorios para smartphone. Est\u00e1bamos haciendo fundas, anillos de sujeci\u00f3n, USB, y todos ellos llevaban algo de pl\u00e1stico. Nos dimos cuenta que en el sector de la telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil todo es muy pasajero, y las fundas se quedan enseguida obsoletas, as\u00ed que las que no se venden, se tiran. El mercado de fundas para smartphone tira alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas al a\u00f1o por no estar al d\u00eda de los modelos de tel\u00e9fono. As\u00ed que nos replanteamos todo nuestro negocio, \u00bfc\u00f3mo \u00edbamos a seguir contribuyendo nosotros a esta causa tan negativa?  \nReciclaje del pl\u00e1stico\nSe nos ocurri\u00f3 que en mares y oc\u00e9anos hay much\u00edsimo pl\u00e1stico, tanto como 8.000.000 de toneladas que se vierten anualmente y que adem\u00e1s el 25% viene de redes de pesca o \"redes fantasma\". Adem\u00e1s, miles de especies de animales est\u00e1n muriendo por causa de este desecho. \nImpacto del pl\u00e1stico en animales\nEmpezamos a darle vueltas y a pensar en c\u00f3mo pod\u00edamos recoger todo ese pl\u00e1stico, ya que el 70% est\u00e1 en el fondo y nosotros no pod\u00edamos dedicarnos a pescarlo, ten\u00edamos que contar con personas que conocieran muy bien el mar y salieran cada d\u00eda a pescar. \u00a1Claro, los pescadores! Quer\u00edamos empezar por nuestro mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, as\u00ed que hablamos con algunos de ellos y y fue entonces cuando conocimos a nuestro primer socio Lefteris Arapakis, fundador de Enaleia, una escuela de pesca sostenible que lleva operando m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os en Atenas, Grecia, donde muestran a los pescadores tradicionales a recoger residuos del mar. Cuando salen a faenar, dedican parte de su tiempo a pescar pl\u00e1stico y una vez lo traen a puerto lo echan en contenedores, los cuales pesamos, y les compensamos por kg de pl\u00e1stico recogido. En Gravity Wave contamos ya con m\u00e1s de 130 barcos en nuestra sede de Atenas, Grecia, que salen cada d\u00eda a faenar y a recolectar pl\u00e1stico del mar, \u00a1y llevamos m\u00e1s de 50 toneladas de residuos recogidos! En 2020 comenzamos con los pescadores de Italia y Espa\u00f1a para seguir recuperando los residuos del fondo del mar.\nHasta aqu\u00ed tenemos la parte de recogida y suministro del material, pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo lo transformamos? Comenzamos a trabajar mano a mano con Crazy & Things, nuestros socios en Espa\u00f1a, quienes llevan m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os creando, desarrollando y patentando productos. Recientemente han creado Tecnikoa 3D filaments, donde desarrollan y producen filamentos para impresi\u00f3n 3D. Llev\u00e1bamos ya mucho tiempo trabajando juntos y en ese momento decidimos ir un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 pasando a ser socios en esta aventura.\nJunto a ellos conseguimos la planta de reciclaje en Alicante, que se dedica a limpiar, seleccionar y trocear el pl\u00e1stico que enviamos desde Atenas en copos y granza (trozos muy peque\u00f1os). M\u00e1s tarde nos lo env\u00edan a nuestra f\u00e1brica de Crazy & Things situada tambi\u00e9n en Alicante, donde producimos filamento para impresi\u00f3n 3D y fundas para smartphone.\n\u00a1YA TENEMOS EL PRIMER PROTOTIPO IMPRESO EN 3D CON FILAMENTO DE REDES DE PESCA RECUPERADAS DEL MAR! \nPLAY\n\nCon estos pasos, hemos conseguido tener un modelo de negocio que recicla y reutiliza los residuos del mar para convertirlos en productos de valor, pero nos queda una \u00faltima cuesti\u00f3n: \u00bfc\u00f3mo cerramos el c\u00edrculo? \u00bfC\u00f3mo podemos conseguir un modelo de econom\u00eda circular completo?\nProceso\n\nTodas las fundas que produzcamos y vendamos, una vez el cliente quiera cambiarlas, podr\u00e1 llevarlas a puntos de recogida situados en toda Espa\u00f1a y una vez entregue esa funda, obtendr\u00e1 un vale de descuento para comprar un nuevo modelo de funda Gravity. Con todas las fundas recogidas, volveremos al proceso de limpieza y troceado para darle \"nueva vida\" a los productos de Gravity Wave. \nLa idea de crear la campa\u00f1a de Kickstarter nace para producir 6 moldes, necesarios para sacar 13 modelos de tel\u00e9fono diferentes. Haciendo m\u00e1s modelos llegamos a m\u00e1s personas, a las que ofrecemos una funda sostenible para su m\u00f3vil generando con esta compra un impacto positivo, ayudando a recolectar cada vez m\u00e1s residuos, \u00a1hasta que no quede ni 1KG de pl\u00e1stico en nuestro querido mar!\nEl primer producto desarrollado con este material es LA PRIMERA FUNDA PARA M\u00d3VIL HECHA CON REDES DE PESCA RECOLECTADAS DEL MAR MEDITERR\u00c1NEO. Fundas que no s\u00f3lo protejan tu m\u00f3vil, sino que contribuyan directamente a proteger el mar.\nEn Gravity Wave creamos alternativas sostenibles de productos que consumimos en nuestro d\u00eda a d\u00eda, para que personas como t\u00fa tengan toda la informaci\u00f3n de los productos que compran y puedan contribuir a resolver la crisis clim\u00e1tica. \nNos preocupa la sostenibilidad, pero tambi\u00e9n la calidad. \nCaracter\u00edsticas de nuestras fundas / Cover technical specifications\nComprando una funda de Gravity Wave contribuyes a extraer 3KG de pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, adem\u00e1s contribuyes a la pesca sostenible y responsable, fomentas el reciclaje de pl\u00e1sticos, la producci\u00f3n local, y por supuesto, la creaci\u00f3n de puestos de trabajo y desarrollo de proyectos sociales. \n\n\nEscoge el dise\u00f1o que m\u00e1s te guste y \u00fanete al cambio.

Unbelievably soft, enjoy every activity and everyday in functional comfort with SomerSide. \nPack SomerSide for the day because you never know where the day will lead. From waterfalls and road trips to beach days, you can DO MORE WITH LESS. \nThe only limit on what you can do is your imagination \nEach towel saves 8-14 recycled plastic bottles from ending up in landfills or among our marine friends. \nWe\u2019ve transformed discarded plastic bottles into the more uniquely designed and versatile towel. \nWhy? Because every minute half a million plastic bottles are NOT being recycled and ending up in landfill or our oceans. SomerSide believes strongly in caring for our planet and bringing the most innovative and technology advanced towel to the market. We want to help keep plastic out of our oceans and forests, one towel at a time. We use a high grade of PET to bring you upmost quality.\n The Process\nPLAY\n\nRead the full testimonials further down this page \nThe three designs are given in detail below\n\nAs part of our stretch goals, we've added in the Dreamtime as XL\nSomerSide towels are large with a unique double sided design that you'll want to take with you everywhere.\nHide your valuables, SomerSide is the only towel with a hidden zip pocket. Take a dip without the worry, You never have to worry about asking someone to watch your stuff at the beach again! Carry only the essentials to the beach, perfect for surfers who worry about where to put their key when they're out in the water.\nYou can also put sunscreen, spare bather bottoms, lip balm, a small snack- the essentials and more\nNot a fan of microfibre towels because they often feel like you're drying yourself with paper? SomerSide towels have been designed to be soft against your skin so you can enjoy using it like any other towel. We've used the most innovative technology to create soft thread from recycled plastic with a 15% blend of Nylon for that extra softness.\nSomerSide towels have odor resistant properties so leave your wet towel in your bag for the day without the worry. \nSave space in your everyday bag and luggage. Weighing in at only 400 grams and rolling to the size of a small plastic bottle, SomerSide is the perfect towel for on-the-go, no matter whether you're a roller, folder or scruncher.  \nLeave the sandcastles at the beach where they belong with SomerSide's sand-free technology.  If you ever avoid the beach just because you hate the idea of having sand everywhere, SomerSide towels allow you to have your fun in the sun without worrying and the sand!\nSomerSide towels dry 3 times faster than a regular cotton towel so you can be ready from one adventure to the next. From morning yoga, to a sunset surf and picnic, use it again and again.\nDry off quickly and easily, the water brushes off your skin and absorbs into the towel right away. Whether you're out of the shower, pool, ocean, or any water, Somerside towels are ultra Absorbent.\nSick of throwing your towel on the rack and hope it doesn't fall? Hang SomerSide anywhere to dry for your convenience with our elastic hanging hook. Placed cleverly in the middle of the towel so the bottom of the towel doesn't drag on the floor\nWe are bigger than a regular beach towel and our XL is great for two or for those who like some extra room. The XL doubles up as a picnic blanket for your friends and family! Our XL is currently only available in the Moroccan Mint and Aussie Dreamtime.\nAll our towels come in a pouch made from the same material as the towel so they're eco, soft, quick dry etc. Very handy to put wet swimwear in, easy to wash like the towels, and also a great snack bag for the beach!\nWhether you like the outdoors, travelling , the beach, you're a triathlete, a festival goer, a diver, or just enjoy an active lifestyle, Everyone needs a towel. \n\n\nDELIVERY FOR CHRISTMAS! \n30% more waste is generated on Christmas Day than the rest of the year. This waste is largely related to consumer gifting, Australians alone throw out 20 million unwanted gifts and enough wrapping paper to wrap the earth's equator 4 times. Australia only has 0.33% of the total world population.... not even 1%.We want to help you and the planet by minimising waste this holiday season. Rather than gifting more plastic, gift SomerSide, a present people will love that helps the environment. \nFounder, Gabby giving some behind the scenes information on our manufacturing and timeline\nPLAY\n\nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nNot the number or combination of towels you are looking for? No problems we can add them on manually. Please send us an email at support@somerside.com.au with the subject line 'custom reward' and we will get back to you ASAP! Expect a response within 24 hours. We want to make sure we deliver your order correctly and so we need to make note of all custom orders. \nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nAll our early bird rewards offer discounted worldwide shipping for those backers that have supported us from the start. Our Santa Pack also offers discounted shipping because we want to help all the eco-gift givers out there. \nOur shipping base is located in Melbourne, Australia and will be mailed out from there. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. Aus Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days. We are a small business and unfortunately cannot offer free worldwide shipping at this point in time but we can offer you a great product at an excellent discount. \nCUSTOM DUTIES AND TAX\nCannot mark as gift, this is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.\nOur terms of sale for international orders are FOB Destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter. \nI've always been an adventurous and active soul that can\u2019t quite commit to having my feet in one place. Having travelled for years and worked in the travel and sporting industry, the idea stemmed from the necessity to have a versatile and beautiful towel that could be used for every activity. Personal style has always been important to me and I've combined that with the functionality and versatility of the outdoors. \nSomerSide was created as a more sustainable product to keep plastic out of our oceans and forests. I took up surfing whilst living in Bali, and I quickly noticed how polluted the water was with plastic, it was everywhere. It hit me- literally. I've been hit by nappies, plastic cups, a bag caught on my foot and even have a small scar on my ankle from a sharp piece of rubbish that hit me in the water.  Protecting our environment is very important to SomerSide and myself and we will constantly strive to implement sustainable practices in everything we do. SomerSide is about doing more while using less. \nThank you for support!\nGabriella Samkova\n\nThank you to the Community Creatives for an amazing job in the photography and video production of this campaign", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike a lot of Kickstarter projects, we've put countless hours and our savings into manufacturing and testing SomerSide. The next order which you will help fund will be version 3, which has already been customer tested and all the small kinks resolved. We have a manufacturer that we will be working with and have discussed our timeline to ensure delivery for Christmas. \n\nHowever, things can always happen that are beyond our control, and we do our best to communicate those challenges up front and as they arise as we have from the beginning.

AvoSeedo has been developed to facilitate the germination process of avocados. It has never been easier to grow your own avocado trees!   \nAvocados have been grown as a crop plant since ancient times. Originating from Latin America, the enormous nutritive value of ahuacatl, the Aztec word for avocado, was well known amongst the indigenous population. But it was only a century ago that the avocado found a new home in (southern) Europe. Nowadays, the pear-shaped, alligator-skinned fruits are a common sight in pretty much every supermarket \u2013 and on our tables. Being outright tasty when consumed fresh and raw, they can also be refined with spices (resulting in the famous guacamole) or stuffed with any filling that pleases your tongue.  \nAlthough avocado trees like to be warm and cozy, they can handle lower average temperatures (as in central Europe, the US or Canada) quite well. The seed of every supermarket avocado can be made to germinate and grow to full size (up to 15 meters!). However, merely putting the seed in the ground usually won\u2019t work. Instead, the \u201cpointy\u201d end should be facing the sun (without being exposed to permanent, direct sunlight). At the same time, the flattened end should be wet all the time.  \nThe main challenge when growing an avocado is to keep it wet all the time. If the seed is left high and dry at any time, there\u2019s a chance that the germination process will stop permanently. And this is where AvoSeedo comes to the rescue. \nAvoSeedo is a revolutionary way to grow the perfect avocados without all the usual hassle that it takes to grow these fussy plants. But what\u2019s new with this version of the AvoSeedo?\nThis version will have your kiddies loving growing their very own pet avocados. The AvoSeedo is shaped like a bear, and comes with many different stickers so that they can customize the look of their little pet. \nIt also comes with a bowl for the AvoSeedo to swim in. There is a little cut out that comes with the pot so that kids can make it look like a pool or garden. So much fun!\nAvoSeedo is the perfect little gadget for kids and everyone who loves to grow plants. Avocados are known to be challenging to grow, but with AvoSeedo\u2019s nifty and brand new design, avocados will grow quickly and easily. \nWell for starters, it\u2019s the easiest way to grow avocados. Our new design is sure to capture kids\u2019 attention. The normally very demanding germination of avocados will be a breeze! \nAvoSeedo is a small, yet intricate tool, which works on the same principle as the toothpick method, only better.  Due to its low weight and high displacement, AvoSeedo will remain at the surface all the time. When the water level lowers, AvoSeedo will sink accordingly.  \nCompared to the original toothpick method, there\u2019s another advantage: the avocado seed doesn\u2019t need to be perforated, reducing the risk of damage and injury. \nDue to its smart design, success rates of germinating avocados will increase dramatically. Watering intervals will be reduced, as water levels only need to be checked now and then. \nAs long as some water remains in the pot or pond, the pit stays wet and there is little chance that the seed will dry out \u2013 thanks to the ground hole. It also allows the developing roots to grow and to expand freely. By the way, the hole is not simply round but has the shape of a heart instead. While this may as well add to the cuteness factor of the new AvoSeedo, it is also a functional feature. It makes sure that avocado seeds of all sizes will be held firmly in its place. Even if the seed cracks open during the germination process, it won\u2019t sink.\nThe brand new AvoSeedo is, without a doubt, the easiest way to germinate avocados, and kids will love their new \u2018pet\u2019. \nHere are the main benefits of AvoSeedo:\nEasy to use \u2013 peel the avocado pit, put it into the AvoSeedo and presto, it\u2019s ready to go.\nNo attention needed \u2013 due to the smart design of the AvoSeedo, it requires minimal care and will germinate without any hassles.\nGreat design \u2013 easy to use with a great design that will capture kids\u2019 imaginations.\nHighly durable \u2013 the AvoSeedo will last for years as it\u2019s made from super strong plastic.\nNon-toxic \u2013 it is BPA and DEHP free.\nAll in all, AvoSeedo is simply the perfect tool for you to grow avocado trees at home. The difficult germination period can now be mastered with almost no effort \u2013 giving your new trees an edge right from the beginning!\nAvoSeedo 2.0 is already in the works!\nWe are already working on the injection mold and start testing very soon. This is great news for you as this decreases the time until it arrives in your home dramatically. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk is limited.

Therefore, I have named it, \u201cThe Hawk\u201d.\nOver the past 2 years, I have primarily been working on design & tested various type of knives. I have been working along this line with full commitment and throughout the whole process my priority have been to provide the best possible ergonomic handle and well balanced design for the ease of use. I want to ensure that this knife also meet the highest standards with specific guidelines such as blade, material & resources for better efficiency.\nBLADE:\nThe 330 Layered Damascus blade must impress you as the details are so sharp and beautifully attractive patterns. It is long-lasting due to its rustproof blade making it first choice for any professional chefs.\nHANDLE:\nWalnut wood is extremely tough and therefore, it is the best possible combination to go with Damascus blade. The straight grain retains the traditional look and feel with light to a very deep brown colour.\nI have been collecting knives for many years, I do understand the uniqueness and the highly customised process of creating it. From the design prospective to the actual product, it is where every knife will go through a comparable strength and sharpness test during production to provide you all with distinctive wavy pattern and durability to the blade. \nThe Hawk\nLove for small knives lead us to this creation, a perfect sharp & balanced knife which can be used with fully comfort, indoor as well as out door. \nThere are lots of cheap \"Damascus\" knockoff knives in the market. I have owned few myself previously and one can notice straight away how badly they are made. Most noticeable fact is that the metal has weak spots and is made up from poor quality materials.   \nMy own determination has been over the time to choose the right brand of Damascus and provide you all with something that is pretty and practical in terms of usage. With my knowledge and crafting skills, I'll use durable Damascus that takes time and meticulous attention to detail. Thats the kind of integrity I want to build on this platform.   \nThe Hawk ( 100% Damascus Paring Knife )\nI know the fact that its important to properly heat the Damascus as its vital part of the whole process. Also once its ready, I'll be making sure that every knife has quality the finish, baring in mind that it can rise my costs but it is also my job to provide you with great finish.   \nPLAY\n\nCutting ,chopping ,peeling ,slicing or even dicing with this mini beast.\nFor me, selling online on various e commerce platforms isn't pleasing as I don't feel well connected with the potential buyers. Therefore, I have chosen \"Kickstarter\" platform as my start, so I build upon my knowledge and a direct interaction with you all. \nSince it's my first project in line, consumer feedback is very important to me and thats why I have decided to keep the prices very reasonable. Though, I believe in providing quality, price is just for the hardwork which is going at the background. As you save, I build integrity, relationship and knowledge. \nThe Hawk\n100% Damascus paring knife; Designed & created to serve as paring knife, its simple, elegant & fully comfortable while in hands.\nHawk ( 100% Damascus Paring knife )\n With 330 Layers of steel, full tang & wooden handle \nI am introducing \"The Hawk\" in 2 sizes, (20cm & 24cm) as I feel that will give best combination. I have handcrafted and used traditional skills to come up with these designs. I have given a thought process and attributes which are key, such as;\nHand Forged Damascus Steel\nErgonomics & Well Balanced\nDurable Handle\nSuperior Sharpness\nThe Hawk Pair ( 24cm & 20 cm )\nErgonomically designed Walnut wood handle ensures a firm grip, comfort and add touch of elegance. \nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n The sheaths are of this pattern more or less, the final look may differ a bit but is make of 100% leather.\n Walnut wood & brass pins adds grace to this knife\nPLAY\n\nThis item is produced in limited quantities only. This means that every piece is unique. Sizes & finish may vary lightly from piece to piece.\nPLAY\n\n Smooth cuts with no drag or food stick, easy to clean and stays sharp\n The knife is not a showpiece, its fully functional and heat-treated to take the impact.\nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n Its designed to give comfort to the palm. \n Full tang blade (Its entirely a single length with no soldering ) \nBeautiful design with precious look & sharp with full tang all adds character to this hawkish knife and make it a real Kitchen Hawk. \n There are many things I want to achieve through this platform, For someone new, it does makes it harder to overcome certain aspects of the project.

Gone were the days of carrying your laptop charger, phone charger, power converter \u2013 replace all of these with a single Nimble. \n\n 1 Nimble - 6 devices \nOne adaptor to rule them all - The Nimble can accommodate up to 6 devices at the same time, without sacrificing any charging performance across its USB -A and USB - C ports\nWe rely on the broad range of electronics when travelling to keep us occupied during long journeys. That doesn\u2019t mean you should have to bring broad range of chargers that simply take up valuable baggage space.\n \nIs it the same as the Travel Adapter on Amazon?\nWe have picked some of the bestsellers on Amazon to show you why the Nimble is truly unique with a dedicated USB-C output unlike traditional adapter which will share power across output ports. \n\n\n\nIndependently Powered Ports - Quick Charge and Power Delivery\nImagine if everyone in a large restaurant shared one single waiter.\nThe same way traditional travel adaptors share power across all its outlets. Nimble however, offers each of your devices its own personal service. No compromise. No loss of performance.\nThe Nimble utilizes 2 independent circuit boards to power the main plug, the USB-C PD/QC and the 3x USB-A/1x USB-C output \u2013 resulting in  dedicated power through its USB-C QC/PD port to ensure optimized charging for all QC and PD compatible devices \u2013 traditional chargers will share power between all the ports resulting in slow charging.\n\n\n\nCompared With Other Travel Chargers \n\n\nTravel, Home, Office \nWhether you are travelling long distances or commuting between home and the office, the Nimble fits perfectly into your life without occupying noticeable space. Small and sleek, definitely a charger we are not used to.\n The 35W Power Delivery is perfect to replace those big clunky laptop chargers we are so use to. \n\nUSB-C to USB-C and USB-C to Lightning\n\n\nRewards\nADD On Menu: Because Your Nimble Deserves the Best \nOnce you\u2019ve backed the project, you can add additional cables. Simply increase your pledge by the corresponding HKD dollar amount. When the campaign ends, we\u2019ll send you a survey asking which items you want. \n\n\nDetailed Specs\n\n\n\nCharge Safe\u2026.With Nimble\nPLAY\n\nThe Nimble charges safe with multiple layers of inbuilt protection so you can power and charge your gadgets with no worries. The Nimble uses over voltage protection, current stabiliser and over heating protection - One less thing to worry about when you are traveling abroad. \n\n\n\n\nCharge Like A Local, Travel Like A Pro\nCharge like a local and travel like a pro, never worry about not having the correct adapter as the Nimble covers over 150 countries. Never be caught out again when travelling to another country.\n Prototype \nThe Nimble has been designed by a collective of travellers to be the ultimate travel gadget you need for any type of travel. Next time you set off on a new adventure, travel light, travel nimble and you will not regret it.\nTimeline\nTeam\nIt has been an amazing journey and with your help we can bring this project to life, a simple idea has grown to become something that we honestly believe is the best travel adapter on the market right now.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked tirelessly to deliver our first campaign to the Kickstarter community to avoid any disappointment.

Off course you can enjoy with wasabi tube.\nThe wasabi-yama was created from the thought to have more wasabi more freely.\nWhen people ordered a plate of some mixed sashimi at a restaurant, a little amount of wasabi was offered on the edge of the plate and everyone shared it, picking it with their chopsticks. \nIt was not really comfortable thing to do for each people.\n\u201cAnd above all, there was too little of it!!\u201d\n\u201cHow could I have the delicious dishes with more wasabi, more freely, we wondered?\u201d\nThis \u201cwasabi-yama\u201d came out of these thoughts.\nWhile we were thinking about what kind of plate, people can enjoy more wasabi more freely then, we heard of this talk.\n\u201cPeople in Edo (Tokyo) won\u2019t allow wasabi to soak in the soy-sauce.\u201d\nPic2\nWe were inspired by it and tried to make a \u201cnew plate for wasabi\u201d and this is its shape.\nThe wasabi-lovers who might once have wished to monopolize the wasabi can do it with this one!\nSize: 11 cm diameter x 3.35cm height\nInstruction: Place wasabi on the top of the mountain and pour some soy-sauce around in the plate.\n\u25b2Hizen-yoshida Pottery details http://www.yoshidayaki.jp/process/#prettyPhoto\nIt is made on a one-by-one basis with great care.\nThe white porcelain in the Arita area has a beautiful white color as its character. \nThe whiteness of this plate comes from the clay itself and the glaze which has been used is colorless and transparent.\nSo, the natural whiteness from the clay appears and this pure white texture is there to see.\nFor obtaining this result, good quality raw materials have been chosen. \n\nFor a mass production of the white porcelain, the mold is necessary.\nThere are 3 types of mold, such as \n1 throw away mold (sample mold)\n2 case mold\n3 use mold (a mass production mold). \nThey are needed to be made depending on each stage.\n1. After inventing a design, a mold (\u2460throw away mold) which is used as a sample (master) is made.\n2. Make a mold (\u2461case mold) for verification \u2460abandoned mold as a model and then after checking the repeatability of the size and shape, produce the duplicate mold for the mass production (\u2462use mold).\n3. Pour the fluid viscos called mud in the \u2462 and make an original mold.\n4. Bake it as it is in the mold to stabilize it. (unglazed pottery)\n5. Pour the glaze on the surface of the vessel to make a film on it. \n During the bisque-firing, the glaze melts and vitrifies the surface. \n(glazing)\n6. Then, bake it for 12~14 hours with a temperature of 1300\u2103.\n(high temperature firing in a big kiln)\n *This is the important process which largely influences the glaze, the color of the paint and the gloss.\nThe work of this time is to produce a product made by using a mold, but it is a very delicate process which requires various adjustments according to the weather and humidity of the day.\nIf the glaze isn\u2019t put on evenly, the uneven color appears after a high temperature firing in a big kiln and it is a persevering work which is required to check the mold one by one during the firing.\nIt is the creative world in which the experience of the experienced craftsman is important.\nWe would like to create the enjoyable daily life using the tableware with which you can enjoy your meals.\nNowadays, we can enjoy the nice food anywhere, and we think that people are interested in what to eat, but they are not bothered in what tools to eat them from.\n\u201cWe would like people to eat the delicious foods together with the enjoyable tools.\u201d\nPLAY\n\nThe meals while having fun make daily life rich.\nWe really want to design these kinds of products from now on.\nAlso, we would like to create the environment and the way of economy for not only the hand-craftsmen who create things but also the ones who mine the raw materials and also the ones who manage mountains doing a wonderful work with a fair price through the \u201cproduct design\u201d.\nIt is a set that you can receive and can easily experience the wasabi-yama, just by your initial support as a kickstarter.  \nThe wasabi, wood and soy sauce bottle listed in the photo are not included in this set.

We have tried and tested different types of ink and have chosen the best one for you. It is an innovative system for smooth and elegant writing.

Every pen will come with Schmidt P8126 capless roller ball refill, perfect for writing, drawing and taking notes.\n       If you will need a replacement, you won`t have problems finding it.

So whenever you\u2019ll need it, there will always be a plenty to choose from.\n       We came a long way from first sketches to final prototype. Now we need your SUPPORT to start full production. We need funds for manufacturing, assembling, packaging and shipping to YOU.\nNOTEBOOK COVER.\nPLAY\n\n       To keep your pen and notebook together, we created a simple, yet functional cover. Under its minimalist look there are compartments for the notebook and pen, two slots for cards and a small pocket for some little things that may be handy throughout your day. The cover is also a stylish accessory that's hard to let off your hands, moreover to forget at home.\n       The cover is made from natural vegetable tanned leather to give it strength and a nice texture. It also develops a rich tint as time goes on. The leather is cut with a laser for precision and accuracy that are impossible to achieve while cutting by hand.\n      But the sewing is only done manually \u2013 it is far more difficult, but the stitches come out stronger and last longer. As a final step, we carefully treat the edges of the leather to give the cover its finished look and provide you with a product that is ideal in every detail.\n       Simple like everything ingenious, this set is great to have around. It gives an ability to write down, sketch, plan and organize your plans and ideas to turn them into successful achievements in the future.\nSpecifications:\nVegetable tanned leather\nNylon thread\nHand sewn\nPen sleeve\n155mm x 115mm ( 6,1 \" x 4,5 \" )", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experience with 6 successful projects on Kickstarter, so process of production and delivery is well established.

Providing instant coolness and ultimate comfort.  \nSilver has been used by NASA, US Special Forces, and Olympic athletes to create germ free textiles. Bamboo charcoal\u2019s activated carbon absorb toxins, prevents mould growth and purifies air by absorbing harmful gasses.\nAir Cells increase comfort and breathability that is linked to sweating and snoring during sleeping. The combination of the textiles wick moisture away twice as fast as cotton, reducing the humidity in your bed by up to 50%. \nThe problem with traditional pillows is that they require porous materials to create a soft comfortable feel. In as little as 7 days, millions of colony forming units of bacteria can grow inside this permeable space where mold and other pathogens can thrive. This leads to allergies, skin irritation and many illnesses. \nAlpha's bamboo charcoal infused memory foam allows the pillow to mould into the shape of your head and neck, supporting the sensitive pressure areas to help you relax and help with insomnia. \nImpinged nerves can trigger migraines, ensuring that your spine is alined correctly in its natural position it will minimize nerve irritation. It will also help to relieve muscle tension around the neck area. \nAlpha allows your spine to be alined and it elevates your upper body, unblocking the airways and opening nasal passages so you can breathe easier. Alpha's Dimensions: 60 x 40 x 12 cm.\nSilver binds to essential cell components like DNA to neutralize their harmful effect. The process of minimizing the bacteria helps with eliminating odor, prevents allergies such as skin irritations, pimples, asthma, runny nose, sneezing and more. It has taken years of development for silver fabrics to arrive at this level of quality.  \nThe benefits of silver used by NASA, U.S. Special Forces as well as Athletes, providing effective antimicrobial properties, which means it naturally destroys odor-causing pathogens.\nTo add any of our Alpha\u2122 Collection products,  please click on your \u201cManage your pledge\u201d button (on top side when you open the project page), than click \u201cChange your pledge\u201d and simply add to the total cost.

Australia\u2019s long isolation and vast area has created an ideal setting for nature to express its incredible diversity. More than 90 percent of the 30,000 different plant species found in Australia are found only in Australia! Our aim at NativeRepublica is to bring some of those truly unique flowers and plants to the rest of the world. To share something that will grow and blossom. \nOUR STORY\n....................................\nJust over a year ago my husband and I travelled around Australia camping for 5 months. We set off from my hometown of Newcastle, Australia on what was to be the most amazing adventure. What really struck me about that trip, besides the vast size of the country, was the range of amazingly beautiful, vibrate and burley wildflowers. Colours and forms truly unique to Australia. Mid last year my husband and I moved to his hometown in Switzerland and I began to deeply miss the unique smells and sights of Australia. That was when I decided to bring a little bit of Australia with me. I started NativeRepublica to showcase and celebrate the joyful heirloom wildflowers of Australia and bring their beauty to the rest of the world. We have since been working on sourcing the best native Australian wildflower seeds to share with the world.\nVIDEO\n....................................\nOUR RANGE\n....................................\nWe\u2019ve selected six of the most unique Australian wildflowers:\nTHE PRODUCT\n....................................\nOur eco-friendly packets of native wildflower seeds are sold individually or as a gift pack of three. Each vibrant packet of seeds contains sowing and care instructions, native seeds and a sowing label.\nTHE GIFT PACK\n....................................\nOur gift pack of three individual seed packets. \nAs part of this Kickstarter campaign we are offering a special on our gift pack of Bottlebrush seeds, Kangaroo Paw seeds and Blue Rottnest Island Daisy seeds (special only available through KickStarter).\nNow that we have reached our streach goal we can introduce two new gift pack options!!!!\nTHE FLOWERS\n....................................\n1. Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea\nThe Strut\u2019s Desert Pea is the most iconic and unique Australian wildflower. Not only that, it\u2019s also the emblem of South Australia. I spent a good part of our trip intensely looking for this amazing flower in the wild. Originating from the deserts of South Australia and the Northern Territory the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea eluded me. I can only imagine what Charles Sturt would have though seeing its distinctive elongated red flowers and piercing black eye on his 1814 journey into the depths of Australia in search of an inland sea. Nothing else in the world compares to the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea. The red beauty looks like a tough customer but is actually very endearing. They love to be in frost-free positions with excellent drainage, either in a container or sandy garden bed.\n2. Bottle Brush\nThe vibrant red flowers of Bottle Brush played such an important part of my childhood. The memory of being fascinated by their soft bizarre brush head is so vivid in my mind. This magnificent flower is an iconic plant, well-recognised in Australia and increasingly in gardens throughout the world. It easy to grow, hardy and very adaptable. The vibrant red colour is a magnet for wildlife and birds, they just love it! This versatile plant in also known by indigenous Australians as a beautiful tea, what a superstar!\n3. Blue Rottnest Island Daisy\nAs if Australia was not isolated enough! This little beauty originates from the even more remote Rottnest Island, located off the coast of Western Australia. It\u2019s long slender strokes are topped a striking pincushion like array of petite bluey purple blooms. Insects love the pretty blue flowers including snails so be sure to protect them when they are juvenile. Blue Rottnest Island Daisies are super easy to grow so no garden has any excuse to be without them.\n4. Wattle\nIn Australia you know summer has arrived when you see those big blooms of glowing golden Wattle flowers. I can\u2019t remember a summer where I didn\u2019t stop and admire Wattle\u2019s vibrant presents. This plant has the amazing power of being able to immediately infuse happiness \u263a Glorious Wattle is our national flower in Australia. We even have \u2018Wattle Day\u2019 on September 1 every year! That\u2019s how much we love this plant. Wattle belongs to the same family as the more common Mimosa and Thorntree variety of Acacia. Staggeringly 950 of the 1300 Acacia species abound worldwide are native to Australia. This plant is not just a pretty face, although undoubtedly highly ornamental, wattle seeds plays an important part in ingenious Australians medicine. Easy to grow, this plant is a must in any garden.\n5. Geraldton Wax\nGeraldton wax is having a comeback moment. Its long been appreciated as a hardy plant with profusely long lasting pretty pink waxy flowers. It is an iconic Australian plant and one of the world\u2019s best cut flowers. The aroma when crushing the foliage between your fingers is to die for. This flower is super robust, fast growing and most importantly copes well with irregular watering so its perfect for the lazy gardener ;) Use the cut flowers in the home as they will last up to a week.\n6. Kangaroo Paw\nKangaroo Paw plant is stunning full stop. With its long elegantly flattened leaves and beautiful brilliant green flowers bloom that fans out like a cluster this flower is truly truly unique. Each Kangaroo Paw flower has a bright red ovary which, with the unusual paw-shaped flowers, gives the flower its very fitting name. Its paws are soft and velvety with fine brightly coloured hairs covering the entire surface. This fury little guy sturdy stem is a natural perch for birds. The blooms are long lasting and make amazing cut flowers.\nOUR PEOPLE\n....................................\nGreen thumbs who want a truly unique garden full of heirloom native flowers\nTravellers who want to bring a little unique magic home with them\nGivers of unique eco-friendly gifts. \nPeople who want something uniquely beautiful that will grow and blossom for years to come \nThe Goals\n.......................\nRaise $1,000 AUD to buy supplies and packaging\nThe stretch goals: $2,000 AUD introduce new wildflower varieties to the range $3,000 AUD introduce fruits, herbs and spice plants to the range.\nWILL THEY GROW?\n....................................\nAustralian wildflowers have evolved to fill every available habitat on the huge continent from hot dry to frosty mountaintops. Our range of wildflowers grow naturally in USDA hardiness zones 5-12. Outside of these zones they can be grown in a green house.\nBest of all most of our flowers are perennial! with the exception of Blue Rottnest Island Daisy it is erect annual or biannual. Re-propagation shouldn't be an issue. For more info on the botanical aspects please check out the following link:\nhttps://www.anbg.gov.au/index.html https://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/\nTHE SEEDS\n....................................\nCAN YOU BRING SEEDS INTO THE COUNTRY?\n....................................\nGreat question! Each country has its own rules about bringing in plant and plant products (i.e. seeds). It\u2019s always best to check with your country\u2019s customs and quarantine laws before making a pledge. Most countries allow non-commercial quantities to enter without any paperwork however some require a Phytosanitary Certificate. \nUNITED STATES\nIf you live in the United States, \"up to 50 seeds per species\" can be imported under the Small Seed Lots Permit without a Phytosanitary Certificate. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/permits...\nEUROPE\nSimilarly in Europe \"Small quantities of plants, plant products, foodstuffs or animal feed that their owner or recipient will use for non-industrial, non-commercial purposes or consume during transport\" do not need a certificatehttps://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/non_eu_trade_en\nCANADA\n\"Small lots\" of seed, i.e., quantities of less than 5 kg of large seeded kinds such as peas, beans and corn or quantities of less than 500 g of small seeded kinds such as carrot or alfalfa, are exempted from providing an import declaration or a seed analysis certificate and do not require an ICA. Most seed imported by Canadian gardeners would fall under the \"small lot\" category. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/seeds/imports/small-packet-seed/eng/1470410938949/1470410961778\nNEW ZEALAND\nWe don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to our strict quarantine requirements.\nARE THEY INVASIVE?\n..........................\nEach native environment is unique and diverse. Sometimes introducing a new species into the harmonious balance can result in disastrous results. Our mission is to enhance not destroy the local environment. Whilst each country has its own list, NON of our flowers are classified as invasive species in the US, Canada and Europe. \nUNITED STATES: https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/main.shtml \nCANADA: http://www.rbg.ca/archive/cbcn/en/projects/invasives/i_list.html\nEUROPE: https://www.eppo.int/INVASIVE_PLANTS/ias_lists.htm#IAPList\nBotanical names of our flowers:\nGeraldton Wax CHAMELAUCIUM uncinatum\nBottle BrushCALLISTEMON glaucus \nBlue Rottenest Island Daisy TRACHYMENE coerulea\nSturt's Desert Pea SWAINSONA formosa\nWattle ACACIA drummondii\nKangaroo Paw ANIGOZANTHOS flavidus \nNOTE: We don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to their strict quarantine requirements.\nSTRECH GOALS\n...................\nI'm happy to say we have reached both our stretch goals which means we can introduce three new seeds to our original range of six!\nFirst up is Billy Button!!!\nAvailable as a Combo 'Stretch goal -add on' reward and as part of the 'Multi gift pack' rewards\nAs part of the second stretch goal we are thrilled to introduce a new reward...Bush Fruits and Spice Seeds! Quandong and Old Man Salt Bush :)\nCurious as to how these taste? We've got a tasting rewards lined up as well. Receive these beautifully packaged native bush spices for tasting.\nFirst up is ground Quandong fruit: Funny name, delicious flavour! These sweet, glossy fruits, also known as \u2018wild peaches\u2019, are packed with vitamin C, protein, complex oils, iron and zinc. While you can eat them straight off the tree, our dried ground quandongs are great to add to cakes, juices and fruit salads or with fish and Asian food.\nAnd Old Man Salt Bush Milled leaf: Old man saltbush is salty! Many different varieties exist across arid regions of Australia. Traditionally used by indigenous Australians in dampers, this spices is great as a general spice and amazing with roasted potatoes. Contains 15g. Store in a dry cool place for up to 6 months\nphoto credits: Kangaroo paw- Richard Watson, Bottlebrush - Houzz, Geraldton wax-OzHank, Wattle- Sue Robertson, Blue Rottnest island daisy-Rottnest foundation, Sturt desert pea-Andrew Alderson, opening EUCALYPTUS macrocarpa- Austalian Geographic", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelays in the certificate for export.

This 10\u201d track is sewn into the back of the belt to create over 40+ size positions to adjust with. This means you can adjust your Ultimate belt in \u00bc\u201d increments and achieve the perfect fit. So whether you just ate a big meal, or just started that new diet - your Ultimate belt is going to provide the perfect fit, every time. It's like a giant zip tie for your waist - only more fun to use. As a matter of fact, once you wear an Ultimate belt \u2013 you\u2019ll never want to go back to a traditional belt. To release or adjust the belt, just pinch the small tab under the buckle.   \n        After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nUltimate Belts (1.5\" wide) are constructed using 3 key elements. First, the exterior is a handsome nylon webbing test rated to over 500 lbs. Inside is a poly-urethane core center for added strength and stability to support gear, and yet flexible enough for comfort. On the inside is Super Fiber, a hybrid material that's both extremely durable and water resistant. These 3 elements combined make this the toughest belt you'll ever own and the last belt you'll ever need. \nUltimate buckles and nylon belts are interchangeable with ALL our other EDC (1.5\" wide) belts and buckles featured on our website.  \n\n                 See >>  http://www.KoreEssentials.com    \n                   After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!\n  At Kore Essentials creating innovative, quality products for men is what we do.

These unique, reinforced poly-core belts (1.5\u201d wide) are constructed using top-grade nylon webbing. The back of the belt is a Super-Fiber that's tough and water resistant. The buckles (2.25\u201d x 1.5\u201d) are a high-quality zinc alloy with a hardened gunmetal color finish.

When you receive your new belt, turn it over and locate your Pant Size using the printed ruler marks. Then add 4 inches and cut using sharp scissors. So for example, if your pant size is 36\" - cut your belt at the 40\" mark. Then snap the cut end into the buckle receptacle (teeth) and put it on.  If it's still too big - you can trim off more, an inch at a time. It's liberating to be able to adjust your belt up to 5 inches in either direction \u2013 in or out - in tiny \u00bc\u201d increments.  \n                     \"This is the best fitting belt you\u2019ll ever own.\"  \n   < Backer Comments From Our Previous Kickstarter Projects >\n\u201cI love my Trakline belt! I show it off to everyone. Great product, so glad I became a backer!\u201d - Mike Goodridge\n\n\u201cHave to say the Trakline belt is the best Kickstarter item I have backed so far. The quality is great and is now my favourite belt!\u201d - Thurstan Johnstan\n\n\u201cGot my two belts and buckles and they're amazing. The quality is top-notch.\u201d - Casus Belli\n\n\u201cI love the belt and the quality in manufacturing and design is evident in everything.\u201d - Scott Burns\n\n\u201cSeriously, I can't get over how much I love this belt. I totally forget I'm wearing it because it's so comfortable.\u201d - Thomas Ella \nDespite our success, we\u2019re still a small company and launching a new product requires a lot of resources and funds up front. This means we need your support to help pay for tooling and enough starting inventory to keep the costs down. In return, we\u2019d love to give you one of these awesome new belts, or several if you like. Either way \u2013 we promise you\u2019re going to love it.  \nX2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   Once the Kickstarter campaign is funded, we will send out surveys to all backers to gather reward choices (buckle styles, leather colors, etc.) and shipping address. Once we get the surveys back we\u2019ll commence production. Based on the factories estimate, this process should take about 30-40 days to complete dependent on volume. We're going to make the belts at a responsible factory in China that we've done a lot of business with. One of our partners (Mauro) will personally be on hand to oversee and ensure that the best quality standards are met. Once the production is completed, we will ship the belts to our warehouse in San Diego, California (2 weeks) and then repackage individual orders to ship out to backers (1 week). So all in all, you should get your belt about 60-70 days after the campaign ends.  \n          After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   A number of years ago my wife bought me an expensive belt for my birthday. Unfortunately, my waist was \u201cin-between\u201d the belt holes at the time. We\u2019ve all been there. This time I boldly decided to poke a few holes of my own in the leather and \u201cfix it\u201d myself. Bad idea. I completely ruined the belt. I learned several key lessons that day. First \u2013 belt holes are bad. Second, never puncture a gift from your wife. It never turns out well. The good news - it set us out on a journey to create a better belt for men.  \nOur original Kickstarter Trakline belt campaign from 2013\nFlash forward - after 18 months of designing, prototyping and testing we launched our first evolution of Trakline belts right here on Kickstarter in 2013. We were fortunate enough to attract over 4,000 backers and were on our way. So here we are\u2026 back again to introduce our latest incarnation our new Ultimate belt.  \nX1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n  Karl Kozak: Sales & Marketing\nMauro Bove: Manufacturing & Quality Control\nSteve Olson: Product & Web Design \n\nThe three of us have been friends and business partners for over 13 years now. Here's a little of our background and relevant history. For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing and quality control. As a result, he's manufactured a wide variety of high-quality retail products for some of America\u2019s biggest retailers. Steve on the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in creating our product designs, drawings and the website. My background has been in business management and sales. Over the past several decades, I've successfully launched, grown, managed and sold several companies. Together, the three of us make a great, motivated team that\u2019s focused on creating and marketing great products.  \nOur Pledge Management Partner\n  X1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n As of 2017 we have a total of 5 patents on our unique Trakline ratchet belts including one on a ratchet belt system with reinforced belt core to support gear. Why all the patents ? We\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money perfecting our proprietary technology and we'd like to keep it that way. \n   \n               Visit us online @  http://www.KoreEssentials.com \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n                                THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME & SUPPORT \n           After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n       After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 Kore Essentials, Inc.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter campaign since we launched our original Trakline belt project back in 2013. Since that time we've managed to launch and successfully deliver 6 new products to over 15,000 backers. And I think we can say with some certainty, that we met, or exceeded, most backers expectations in regards to product quality, design and function. \n\nOf course, along the way we've learned a few valuable lessons. \n\nFor example, we make a habit of communicating frequently and openly with our backers regarding the manufacturing progress and shipping status. We do an update every 1-2 weeks after the project is completed. \n\nGoal # 1 is to deliver a well designed, quality product that exceeds Backer expectations and that backers love. As proof with past campaigns - after receiving their Trakline belts over 40% of the backers visited our online store to purchase a 2nd, 3rd and 4th belt .\n\nNevertheless, we understand moving forward this is a new project, with its own set of challenges and that past successes don't eliminate all the future risks involved.\n\nThe biggest challenge as always for us when creating a new product, is timing. We strive to get our projects completed on time, with no snafus. There are molds and tooling to create and we test at each step of the process. But if delays do happen, we keep backers \"in the loop\" as to what's going on and the new timelines. \n\nBased on our track record - we feel like backers can be confident and assured - they're going to get a great product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "EARLYBIRD >> 1 Ultimate Belt", "descp": "Includes 1 Buckle & 1 Belt.

You lay everything out on the counter and reach for a knife - your favorite knife. The one that\u2019s dirty, but you stop to clean it anyway. The knife that makes you a more confident and creative cook. The right knife.\nWe\u2019ve made that knife. By combining the very best of eastern and western knifemaking, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp, beautiful, premium blade - and we\u2019re bringing it to you for a non-premium price.\nThe right blade\nYour chef knife is central to creating nearly every dish. Whether you\u2019re mincing chives, or cutting apart a whole chicken, the chef knife can do it all.\nHowever, your choices at the store are confusing. Cheap knives are clunky to use and dull quickly. Even if you're willing to spend more, unfamiliar features and a wide spectrum of prices can make the options overwhelming. Finding the right blade can be a frustrating experience, but we don\u2019t think that needs to be the case.\n An incredible knife for a fair price \nThe world of chef knives is out of date. The big knife brands are operating on outdated sales margins that inflate the price of knives sold at a retail store. By avoiding the traditional retail sales model and bringing our product to you directly online, we have created a great knife for a fraction of the price.\nDon\u2019t waste your money on a knife block filled with knives you\u2019ll never use. Get the one knife you\u2019ll reach for again and again.\nComparison of the costs that go into bringing you a knife\nOne great blade\nA good knife stays sharp and is comfortable to use. A great knife is the one you reach for.\nWe\u2019ve put a ton of attention into how people hold and use their knives, and we think we\u2019ve designed the ultimate hybrid. A knife that takes the best elements of western and eastern knifemaking, and combines them into one blade.\nAfter experimenting with dozens of blade profiles, grip shapes and types of steel, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp blade that feels right at home in your hand. A long deep belly helps with effortless chopping, while the lowered tip makes slicing and finer work more approachable.\n  Grip & Bolster \nThe grip and bolster are designed with intention. The contour of the grip makes it feel secure regardless of your preferred grip style or the the size of your hands. Olive Wood - a durable hardwood - keeps the handle grippy whether it's wet or dry.\nEven when holding the blade in a pinch grip, a thumb groove in the bolster makes for a more confident and comfortable grip on the blade.\nA well balanced blade.\n Layered Steel\nThe vast majority of stainless steel blades are made with soft steel that won\u2019t hold an edge. Our blade has a cutting core made of Japanese VG-10 steel. This innovative high-carbon stainless steel holds an incredible edge and won\u2019t corrode like other high carbon steels.\nThis cutting core is then sandwiched in 66 layers of alternating stainless steels. This technique - sometimes referred to as \u201cSan Mai\u201d which is used in traditional Japanese sword making - allows the VG10 to be used for the edge while the other layers form a jacket around it. This layering protects the cutting core, while providing a beautiful layered finish on the faces of the blade.\nHow sharp? Very sharp. \nMany knives on the market are sharp, but few stay that way for long. Being as sharp as possible isn\u2019t necessarily best, particularly if you\u2019re trading off the knife\u2019s ability to retain that sharp edge. A scalpel may be sharper than a kitchen knife, but it would dull quickly.\nIf your steel is too hard it becomes brittle, and if your edge angle is too fine it will dull quickly. We experimented until we found the right steel and edge profile that maximizes edge retention. The result is a blade that\u2019s razor sharp and stays that way.\nOur steel is hardened to between 57-59 rockwell hardness, which allows for a more finely sharpened edge. The blade is then tapered to a 17 degree edge angle, allowing you to glide through even the toughest of root vegetables.\n  Testing\u2026 Testing... \nWe\u2019ve tested our blade with both chefs and home cooks to develop something that feels intuitive for everyone. After more than a year of designing, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing samples we\u2019re ready to go to production. Dozens of revisions have helped us to develop a knife we can\u2019t wait to share with the world.\nStretch Goals\nCustom textured ABS Blade Guard. Image is a mockup.\n  1000/6000 combination grit whetstone. Image is a mockup.\nWhy we need your help \nOur knife is ready for production - now we need to raise $25,000 to fund the first production run. All the funds raised will go directly towards sourcing the materials and expert labor needed to create these handmade blades. We have the suppliers and manufacturers lined up and ready to go, we just need your help to bring the blade to life. \nTimeline \nWho are we?   \n  Get Your Project Funded Today!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk is manufacturing delays.\n\nWe already have fully established relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers.

Through attending perfumery classes, and consulting with with some really amazing perfumers, we gained the background we needed to create a line of designer grade cologne scented candles. \nWhile we've done lots of test runs, we need funding to launch our first full scale line of production.  The costs of packaging, vessels, custom wax blends, and most notably our fragrance oils (which are as high quality as any on the market) are expensive and we need funding as capital to place orders.  Once we are funded, and we have the materials we need, we will be hand pouring and packaging each candle ourselves.\nNOTE: the candle glasses shown in our video have changed a bit for the better since we shot it.

In our initial tests, we experienced diminished \"throw\" in a few test candles when we did not allow for the correct amount of maceration time of the oils. Maceration is a technical term that involves giving the various fragrance ingredients time to bond and react. We attempted to rush this compounding process to see if we could get these out the door quicker to you guys but there are no short cuts, and they aren't real great without proper maceration and cure time.

After meeting with our perfumer in the beginning of February, we made a very important decision to make a few tweaks to the fragrances for our first line of candles. We had this discussion prior to placing the bulk orders of our fragrance oils because we felt very passionately that if there was even a little room for us to improve and give everyone the best possible product, we would do it. After meeting with our perfumer, we were hopeful that the delivery of our fragrance oil with the final iterations would arrive towards the close of February 2016. We still felt confident in delivery because we do our own pours and could fulfill the order of 700 candles on our own in a couple days. Unfortunately, delivery of the fragrance oils has been delayed. We are now anticipating them to arrive to us in the middle of March 2016. Our fragrance oils are made right here in Los Angeles so we hope you feel reassured that delivery to us will not take a significant amount of time once completed.

It's most commonly made from of the incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as tar; that's right, TAR! It's a product that is labeled as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nInk isn't only made of pigments, a considerable amount of ink is made up of binders, carriers, and solvents. Most carriers are petroleum oil, while most solvents used in inks are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), all of which have detrimental human and environmental impacts.\nThe Solution\nDevelop an ink that is safe and sustainable. Living Ink is produced in cells using sunlight and CO2 from the atmosphere; its only byproducts are oxygen and clean water. This means Living Ink is actually great for the environment. Living Ink is the first step in weaning the world off of regular ink and moving towards a safe and renewable solution.\nIf you love science too, or want to know even more about the technical details behind Living Ink, shoot us an email. We\u2019re scientists at heart and we love talking shop, anytime.\nWhile researching and developing our sustainable algae ink to replace the regular ink we use everyday something unexpected happened\u2014the ink changed from one day to the next.\nAs scientists, we began analyzing the \u201cproblem.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for us to realize that this \u201cLiving Ink\u201d was really cool.\nAfter sending Grandma Elle a Living Ink birthday card, seeing how much our kids loved drawing their favorite stories, and watching actual artists use it in creative ways, we knew we had to share it with the world.\nWe are here on Kickstarter because it\u2019s a creative community that supports art and science. Until this point, we\u2019ve been deep in the science (something to the tune of 10 years studying and researching algae). But, our goal has always been to see something useful result from all of that research.\nWe know that Living Ink will be incredibly useful to all types of people, but we need help to take this from R&D to actual product.\nThat\u2019s where the Kickstarter community comes in. The majority of funds for this project will go directly to manufacturing the world\u2019s first pen that writes in algae. The remaining pledges will allow us to purchase materials and produce components in bulk, in order to get the cost low enough to get Living Ink into the hands of all you artists, creatives, inventors, DIY'ers, and genuinely interesting people.\nEnvironmental Protection\nIf you haven\u2019t figured it out already, our Living Ink is made of Algae. Algae is the planet\u2019s superfood\u2014critical to the existence of thousands of species, the water we drink, and countless other life sustaining functions. It is our priority to ensure that our ink helps protect the environment through responsible business practices, and through educating our customers about the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.  \nEmpowering Storytellers\nEven before we had ink, humans were sharing their past, explaining their present, and dreaming up their future through stories. The desire to be understood transcends all cultures and eras. It\u2019s our goal to continue to inspire and empower storytellers to excel at their craft.\nSharing Science\nWe believe that science is the most exciting way to improve our lives. We hope that our project will inspire the next generation of scientists to turn research into awesome products that advance society.\nScott and Steve are two scientists who have dedicated the last decade to developing new ways to use algae as ink, to replace the inks we see and use every day. Steve is the mad scientist. For him, if it\u2019s not a well-documented process, then it\u2019s not worth doing. Scott is the Clark Kent of Science. Sometimes he\u2019s just a normal nerdy guy, and then he turns into this scientific super hero of sorts. They teamed up with some of their smartest friends to help them pull off this Kickstarter campaign. Jared and Tyler are the creative force behind this campaign and the products we'll be shipping out. If you spot one of the many small details of awesomeness, it surely was their doing. David brought to the team his proven Kickstarter strategy that he has honed while \"monkii'ing\" around. He tells our story in a way that has propelled Living Ink as a brand and product to new heights.\nMost importantly, it took friends and family to fill in the gaps. Now, we look to the Kickstarter community to join our team and make Living Ink come to life!\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1. Ink formulation stability.\nWe have developed the first pen formulation that is capable of growing and we are really excited about this. We also have added other components to the ink so that you can see where you are writing as you make your masterpiece. These added components disappear from the page under an hour, so that your message becomes a mystery to anyone but you. This formulation has been quite a challenge for us to get perfect, and any deviation from this formulation may change the rate at which the ink grows. We\u2019re constantly working on ways to ensure that this isn\u2019t a problem when we ship out the product and this successful Kickstarter will help ensure nothing but the best product leaves our lab. \n \n2 Variability in growth conditions.\nWhile our inks can grow in low light and cool conditions, they\u2019d much rather have bright light and warm temperatures all day long. Here at Living Ink we are dedicated to clearly communicating how much light is required and the right temperature for your ink to grow the way we say it does. Low light conditions and cooler temperatures may cause your ink to grow slower than expected. While we currently use an algae strain that is sensitive to these changing conditions, we are also researching other species of algae that allow for a much wider range of light and temperature conditions.\n\n3. Shipping logistics.\nWe package living algae cells into the pens that are shipped to your door. These microscopic organisms are very robust, but conditions outside of their comfort level can cause them to die, which doesn\u2019t make for good growing ink. We believe that our scientists have developed formulations that prepare the cells to live in dark conditions for long periods of time, but problems in the shipping process and/or cold weather may cause the ink to improperly function once you start using them. Not to worry, though. We\u2019re on it and believe that when you get your ink, there will be more than enough live algae cells to make your images come to life, no matter how long it takes to get to your door!\n\n4. We're scientists\nWe've never shipped a product before! We knew we had a lot to learn in this regard, so we teamed up with people who have successfully designed products and fulfilled large Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nThroughout the entire campaign, and if/when any challenges arise, we\u2019re committed to being transparent and communicative to our backers. This means you\u2019ll get regular campaign updates and be involved during the entire fulfillment process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Thank you and Remaining Backer Surveys", "update_content": " Hey Backers,\nWhat a crazy last couple months it has been!

As caretakers for kodama, the tree spirits, you must keep the forest a healthy and lush home for your little friends. Over three growing seasons, you must cultivate trees with the right mix of flowers, insects, and branch arrangements to make your kodama as happy as possible. Whoever cares for their kodama best will be remembered for generations!\nFrom the designer of the hit game Kigi, Kodama branches out into a fun new way to play! Grow your tree by placing cards in clever arrangements, being careful to leave room for future growth. At the end of each season, one kodama will award you points for how well your tree suits its needs. With beautiful art and innovative mechanics, Kodama is an inTREEguing game for the whole family.\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the newest Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games, playing in under 45 minutes for 2-5 players. We encourage you to view the videos directly below for more information. Or simply peruse our rule book here.\n \nThe Deluxe Edition of the game includes the below components in addition to the ones above:\nThe story of Kodama is an interesting one indeed. Initially, we sought to publish Daniel's game Kigi, but felt we could help to develop a few elements of the game. Two months later, we realized that we had a much different game than Kigi and Kodama took seed! (You can read more about this here in Daniel's Design Diary.)\nWhile both games come from similar roots, Kodama provides a very different game experience from its predecessor.\nHere are the differences in Kigi and Kodama:\nTHEME: In Kodama, players cultivate homes (trees) for the kodama.\nPLACEMENT: In Kodama, there is no pruning, but rather a 10 point scoring cap for placement that encourages diversity while leaving players with a beautiful tree by the end of the game. Additionally, players now only place branches on their own trees.\nFEATURES: Not only are all of the features updated to help represent the theme, there are now six features as opposed to five.\nGOALS: In Kigi, goals came in the form of Commission cards that were shuffled into the branch deck. Now, players are dealt four kodama cards, three of which they will score over three seasons.\nSEASONS: Play is now divided into three seasons: Spring, Summer, and Fall. At the beginning of each season a Decree will be revealed which will add or amend a rule in the game--adding more replayability and strategy to placement. After placing four branches, players will select one of their Kodama cards to score. At the end of three seasons, players score a final Kodama card and a winner is determined!\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the fifth project from Action Phase Games and was designed by the very talented Daniel Solis. With the successful execution of our first four projects, we have become experienced as publishers. We will confidently execute this project to the same high standard.\nThe deluxe edition, containing additional content and upgraded components, will not be available in retail.\nDaniel Solis has successfully designed a game that is accessible to gamers of all ages and levels of experience. Kodama is innovative while remaining easy to learn and play. Because of these factors, we have every confidence that this game will be played for years to come.\nPeople who have demoed and play-tested this game have uniformly loved it for its original mechanics, charm, artistic beauty, and accessibility. While the game takes under 45 minutes to teach and play, it offers a surprising amount of tactical depth and replay value.\nAll of the art assets (with the exception of the 3 Become a Guardian pledge levels) are complete.\nThe game is full of charming illustrations by the extremely gifted Kwanchai Moriya, with graphic design by the equally talented Scott Hartman.\nNot only do we offer free shipping in the US, but this project is EU friendly, too.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.\nFor example, if you pledge $19 to help back the project \u2014 we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any over-funding goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. You'll get access weeks before it's made available to everyone else!\nPledge levels vary from just $1 to several hundred dollars. And each different level opens up a new creative reward.

We will be in touch with all backers shortly after the campaign has ended.\nThank you all!!\nThe ONELID Team\n\n\nONELID\nThe world\u2019s first truly universal multifunction lid that actually looks good and works like a dream. Once you try this - we promise you\u2019ll never want to go back to using your old lids. Well maybe for drumming that is...\nONELID was originally spawned by the ambition to make a lid that would minimize the risk of over boiling - but along the way we learned there were so many more annoying things related to the regular lids we use, like finding a lid that fits, burning hands and difficulties draining.\nMeet ONELID \n\nThe only lid that is :\nUniversal - will fit most of your pots (up to 22 cm/8.75\" diameter).\nReduces over boiling -  intelligent groove system will let out just the right amount of excess steam.\nHas an integrated strainer \u2013 draining a pot has never been easier or safer, just grab your pot or pan and pour.\n\nDoes not transfer heat - even when boiling for extended amount of time the ONELID handle stays cool to the touch.  \n\nMakes no sound - soft on the outside - yet sturdy on the inside makes for safe handling and silent operation.\nDanish Design at its best - we are pretty proud to have fit all these features into a design this modern, sophisticated and elegant.\nIs dishwasher safe - naturally...\nSo, if you are like us, and would like to get your hands on one of the first ONELIDS, please sign up - and we will do our utmost to make your cooking experience easier, safer and more enjoyable for years to come. For a little more in-depth knowledge - please read on...  \nONELID - HOW DOES IT WORK?\nSIZE - having trouble finding a lid to fit?\nNot to mention the cacophony of noisy metal striking metal when desperately trying to find the right lid inside your kitchen cabinet? ONELID offers 4 ingenious features combined with great modern design in one elegant lid that will fit all your existing pots (up to 22 cm/8.75\").\nEver experienced boiling over?\nDepending on what you\u2019re cooking, every pot will tend to over boil if you turn the heat up too high. The bigger the pot - the more steam is let out. ONELID greatly reduces this tendency by letting out just the right amount of excess steam. The intelligently designed grooves on the underside of ONELID are shaped to match the size of your pot and release just the right amount of steam to prevent over-boiling. Simple :) \nAnd you know the moisture that drips from your current lids onto the stovetop? ONELIDs patented convex underside ensures the drops that form will run back into your pot, so your stovetop stays cleaner.\nDraining  - no more burned fingers or spilled pasta in your sink\nTired of burning your fingers on metal/glass lids during cooking or while pouring? Ever tried sliding your conventional lid a little to the side allowing that boiling water to drain, but ended up soaking your pot holders and getting peas and pasta into the sink? Yeah - who hasn\u2019t!\n\nWell no more. Because of the unique air-vents doubling as strainer (draining) holes, you now have trouble-free draining. ONELIDs silicone surface ensures great friction against the pot so your ONELID will stay centered and safe \u2013 even when held vertically. Your peas and pasta will remain in the pot where they belong.\nPerfect for casseroles too. The ONELID handle have taken many forms to reach this final design. ONELID now boasts superior ergonomics - both for 1 and 2-handle pots. And with a diameter of 23 cm/9\" ONELID will cover all you pots up to 3,5 liters. (covering 90-95 % of all private cooking). \nJust check your old pot diameters before signing up.\nHeat distribution - cool to the touch\nThis FLIR-photo comparison shows how much better the heat distribution of ONELID works compared to a steel lid (and btw. glass lids are the same). Other than the hotter steam areas (away from the handles) the ONELID handle has the same temperature as the room and is barely affected by the boiling process within. No matter where you grip ONELID, your fingers are safe from burning. The better insulation will also save you power !\nEarly tests on temperature...\nPLAY\n\nCHECK OUT THE VIDEO BELOW HIGHLIGTING THE MAIN FEATURES \nPLAY\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\nThe initial idea behind ONELID was spawned by professional chef, and ONELID co-creator, Sylvester Vantore. He observed how chefs would use tin foil as a substitute for the right size pot lid. This simple technique furthermore had the adjustability to let out just the right amount of excess steam in order to reduce over-boiling. Although functional, it\u2019s not very practical nor pretty. Understanding that there must be a better way, Sylvester eventually came up with the idea of an oversized lid (to fit varying pot sizes) designed with under-lid grooves to allow excess steam to escape.\nSylvester brought this discovery to the attention of prominent Danish designer, Martin Sonne. Martin eagerly took up the challenge to make the 'perfect lid'. From that point on, the lid began to evolve, but it would be years before the form and function were perfected.\n\nCHALLENGES PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES\nWe knew we had to let out just enough steam to minimize the risk of over boiling without wasting energy so we added some more grooves and came up with the 'swing' to the channels so the vent holes 'adjusts' to the diameter of the pot. Small pot, small holes - larger pot, larger holes. It was only during early tests that we discovered that the vent holes provided the perfect effect for straining. And again - the bigger the pot the faster the water is let out so it was a win-win.  \nWe also came up with the now patented convex underside in order for the lid to fit multiple pot sizes. This had added benefits too: The lid will 'automatically' center on any pot and stay securely in place - and it takes very little effort to hold while pouring because it more or less 'hangs' from the friction created by the silicone. The condensed steam forming on the underside of the lid will flow back into the pot and not onto your stove top.\nEven though it didn't exactly made things easier, requiring the silicone surface was a big priority. The benefits are many: 260 \u00b0C (500 \u00b0F) heat resistance, non-stick easy clean-up, non-toxic, and very resistant to microbiological growth. Add to that, ONELID makes a fashion statement in any kitchen. It not only looks and feels great, ONELID provides exceptional ergonomics, because the friction created when the lid is on the pot is far superior to metal. You\u2019ll immediately feel the difference when you handle the pot - the lid just stays more securely in place.\nTHE PROCESS\nAlong the way we have tested several designs. Below is an array of the various designs and prototypes ranging from the first 360 degree design through to a more solid design - unfortunately proving impossible to make but leading the way to the beautiful final design we have today.\nTHE PRODUCTION\nFinally we have the details right - It did take us years of work and a skilled manufacturer. A true professional and we even needed to go to the other side of the world to find him. Kenny is his first name, KONG his surname. We call him \"King Kong\" as he helped us nail the final procedure. So we worked out a 4 part procedure to make a lid with 4 functions - makes sense :) \nStep 1 : Mold inner core in nylon with Stainless insert\nStep 2 : Full silicone overmold\nStep 3 : Mold lower handle in ABS\nStep 4 : Mold upper handle in ABS\n\nMount and UV weld, pack and ship to you guys in the sturdy packaging so you too can start enjoying the ONELID life ;)\n\nTHE IP\nONELID holds a patent based on the concave shape and the ingenious groove system on the lower side.\nMore to this we have applied for a design protection since we find it worth the money to try and  protect the signature design by Martin. There will be copies sooner or later - but we aver none with the qualitiy of our design, material composition and finish.\n\nMILESTONES\nSeptember         Kickstarter campaign launch\nOctober              Mold start-up\nDecember          Production 1 roll.\nJanuary 2016     Production start - start shipping\nFebruary  2016  Shipping done \nApril 2016          Shipping Glass lids\nABOUT US\nMartin Sonne - with more than 20 years of designing products and working with visual communication, Martin is still striving for the simplest solutions to the most complex problems. Designing ONELID has been a journey in just that - trying to fit all these unique features into a lid so simple and so clean that one would think it is just another lid. Staying within that comfort zone of what people expect a lid to look like and then add a little evolution on top seemed to be the right approach.\nSylvester Vantore - the man with the 1000 ideas. Sylvester is on a quest to make good things better; To find that little thing that will make a normal item become a unique item. Being a chef and having learned from the best (Rasmus Kofoed - world champion chef 2011) Sylvester knows what makes for good kitchen tools. So it comes as no surprise that he was the man to invent ONELID.\nWe couldn't have done this alone though. With great production expertise and patience from Lars Forsberg (from Danish company Fabrikators) we are now ready to move into production. \nWant to know more about Fabrikators go to www.fabrikators.com\n\nAnd Kenny Kong the man will make sure tooling and production is second to none once we get there. \nSo 5 years down the road and we are ready to let you guys take us the rest of the way. We can't tell you how much we want this to happen. We want to let the world try how cooking can be if you have the right tools. This lid is made like it should have been in the first place - ONELID - is all you need. So please help us get this baby to take its first steps...\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\n40,000 USD     GET'S US STARTED - ITS ALL WE NEED !\nONELID standard edition - comes in pale grey or dark grey\nONELID Kickstarter limited edition\n70.000 USD    GET'S THE GLASS VERSION ON THE POT\nSame functions - same materials - and still have the grooves...only this time with a glass center so you can tell what's cooking'..\nONELID glass edition\nIf we do hit 70k we will do a special Kickstarter version just for you guys.

Islands simply have a set point value that players will score at the end of the game if they control the seas surrounding it. However, whenever you place an island card, you must draw an event card. Events often reward the player with a unique strategic action, but there are three Kraken cards in the deck, and when all three are revealed, the game ends immediately! \nMore game info below in the Overview Section, including a FREE Print & Play, Draft Rules Download, and a Tutorial Video!\nWhy Pledge Now? \nDiscount - By backing Virgin Seas you will get your copy at a nice discount.

Unfortunately he and his crew met their untimely end before being able to retrieve the precious gems! Now you must collect these gems to gain fortune and fame and be crowned king of the Virgin Seas!\nRed Beard's Booty is an exciting expansion for Virgin Seas that adds a fabulous red velvet pouch, 48 beautiful gems (same type used in Dig Down Dwarf), and an instruction mat, all housed in a reusable clam-shell case. Instead of each island being worth the set amount indicated on the card, players now draw random gems from the bag and seed the island. Players draw a number of gems equal to the number on the island card. Each gem scores in a different way and this adds a new layer of strategy and excitement to the game! \nIf we fund, we promise that Virgin Seas will be a thrilling and rewarding experience for you and your family and friends. However, if we over fund we will be able to expand the game in both quality and quantity. You see, the more we raise, the more units we will be able to manufacture. This equates to a lower unit cost. These saving WILL be added back into the game in the form of additional content and better quality components.

We will send out detailed surveys after funding to gather the info needed to customize your pledge. Enjoy! Worldwide shipping included!\nSimply add $20 to any pledge (that includes a copy of the game) and you will have it upgraded to a Collector's Edition! You could even add $100 (5x$20) to the Merchant Pledge level and get 5 copies of the Collector's Edition! Mind Blown!\nThe cost of shipping Virgin Seas is factored into the pledge levels for U.S. Backers. I wanted to explain the shipping costs to everyone, so that you can see exactly where the numbers come from. Below is a nice chart that shows the dollar amount you need to add to your pledge depending on where you live and the shipping credit that is applied at each level. Whatever the cost is to ship within the U.S. becomes a credit that is applied to Canadian, EU, and International shipping. Example: It costs $7 to ship one copy of the game within the U.S. and it costs $13 to ship the same package to Canada, so $7 is taken off the cost for Canadian Backers, thus you only have to pay $6 for shipping instead of the full $15.\n                                                                                                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur goal is to make a quality product and we understand the challenges of doing so.

After the successful funding of nearly $500,000 from our previous campaign, Bomber Barrel, our early Kickstarter backers asked us to make a survival keychain to go with their Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and bracelet. Introducing \u2014 Bomber Survival Gear, Survival Bracelet and Keychain.\nBomber Complete Pack - Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and Paracord Bracelet\nBomber Paracord Keychain\nBomber Paracord Survival Bracelet\nWe wanted to create a timeless piece to accommodate your Bomber Barrel: an accessory that you can bring with you to the city, on hikes, and on all of your adventures. So the conception of the perfect everyday keychain was brought to life.\nFirestarter Paracord Survival Keychain\nBomber Paracord Keychain\nWith its minimal design and effective functionality, the Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain is the perfect addition to your Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and survival gear collection.\nBomber Paracord Keychain\nWe carefully crafted and tied premium quality 550 paracord into the design. The Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain can be used for a variety of emergency situations. \nBomber Paracord Keychain\n                 Bomber Paracord Keychain X MagKey\nEquipped with 3 meters of paracord and fire-starting capabilities, the Bomber Survival Bracelet is not only stylish but practical.  The funding will help us manufacture a second production run of our Bomber Survival Bracelets.\nBomber Paracord Bracelet\nBomber Paracord Bracelet and Keychain\nIn addition to its functional 550 paracord strength, the Bomber Survival Bracelet and Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain both have firestarting capabilities using flint/steel woven within its design.\nBomber Paracord Survival Bracelet\nDue to popular demand, we are bringing back the Bomber Barrel Set with an added bonus: the Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain.\nThe complete Bomber Set includes the original Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag, Mini Bomber Travel Kit, Bomber Survival Bracelet, and Bomber Survival Paracord Keychain.  With your help, we can start a second production run of the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bags.  All of the original tooling and pattern costs have been set up. Now, we're just in need of funding to get started on our production.\nBomber Barrel Duffle Bag, Paracord Bracelet, & Keychain\nBomber Barrel Duffle Bag\nBomber Barrel\nParacord was first used as suspension lines for U.S. parachutes during WWII, but has since proved itself useful in hundreds, if not thousands of other ways. The braided sheath has an incredible number of interwoven strands compared to its thickness, giving it a smooth texture, elastic feel, and unmatched strength. This makes it compact, fashionable, and highly useful in survival and dangerous situations.\nBomber & Company - Paracord Survival Gear\n                                                      Bomber & Company was founded on Kickstarter by you!

Comes in matte black which fits the look of the bag and was developed for military packs and gear. For added versatility it also functions with those standard metal snaps mentioned which you can buy in the sewing section at most stores and they are all military spec in size.

Would you benefit from instruction, motivation, and tuition to help you record the sights you see and the people and places that you visit?  \nAs the answer to this, we at 3dtotal Publishing have created an inspiring artistic solution to enable you to carry your creativity around with you: How to Keep a Sketch Journal. \nThe different elements for the full How to Keep a Sketch Journal package\nA sketch journal allows you to record what you see around you and visualize your inner thoughts. It can offer an opportunity for you to relax and contemplate, a space for you to experiment with new materials and ideas, and a memoir in which to chronicle your progress and store references.\nYou can use a sketch journal to record your pets, friends, meals, family, special events, and occasions; to remember something nice someone did for you today, something that inspired you, something that taught you a new trick; to collect ideas and try new things.\nThis colourful display is by Rhea Dadoo, one of the featured artists in the How to Keep a Sketch Journal guide book\nFollowing the success of the Sketch Workshop Kickstarter campaign, 3dtotal Publishing\u2019s How to Keep a Sketch Journal package will help you follow your creative aspirations and unleash the artist within you. The project incorporates the informative How to Keep a Sketch Journal guide book teamed with high-quality sketch pads, quintessential artist tools, and a soft leather cover to wrap everything up as a compact artistic companion.\nAt 3dtotal we believe everyone has the potential to be creative, so How to Keep a Sketch Journal will help even the most beginner sketcher to unlock their inner artist, teaching you all the essential techniques to get your journal started \u2013 and how to keep it going!\n112 pages of expert advice and stunning images; note that this is a mock-up image\nThe book will consist of four main sections with step-by-step guides covering the basics, watercolour techniques, pen and pencil techniques, and mixed media techniques. The specially selected artists behind the book will offer you advice and insights into their own work, as well as talking to you about some of their favourite techniques. The aim is to encourage you to discover how to keep a sketch journal in your own unique way.\nBook mock-up - Florian Afflerbach\nNot all of us lead exciting lives jetting around the world so How to Keep a Sketch Journal will provide you with plenty of ideas for interpreting the most mundane day-to-day subjects as exciting visual expressions, from annotated sketches to multimedia drawings. \nBook mock-up - Rhea Dadoo\nFor those of you who are lucky enough to have landmarks like the Eiffel Tower at your doorstep, we\u2019ll give you a glimpse into other artists\u2019 sketch journals to give you ideas for optimizing and maintaining your visual diary. With its attractive hand-drawn feel, this A5-size book will give you all the knowledge, motivation, and confidence you\u2019ll need!\nBook mock-up - Florian Afflerbach\nSketch wherever you go and carry your journal, tools, and How to Keep a Sketch Journal book with you! The soft, real leather cover is designed to be light and comfortable for you to carry wherever you are going. Slightly bigger than A5, it will neatly wrap up your sketch journal items while the leather ribbon will ensure your art tools are kept secure.\nOf course, you'll also need your own, blank journal for you to start your sketching adventures in! We therefore have two journals for you to choose from to allow you to tailor the package to your needs and budget:  \nAn A5 hardback journal with 170gsm high-quality cartridge paper, ideal for sketching with pen and pencil - portrait orientation  \nA Monsieur A5 soft leather cover premium journal with 200gsm watercolour paper - landscape orientation  \nJust select the pledge option that best suits you!\nThe landscape premium watercolour journal and the portrait hardback journal\nThe tool set includes the basic HB pencil and a fineliner pen, plus a watercolour set and a water brush pen, so you\u2019ll be able to add colour and your own distinct style to your journal. \nWe\u2019ve carefully selected tools that are high quality yet practical enough to be used on the move. For example the handy water brush pen will make painting on location a breeze, without the inconvenience of having to wipe up spilled water. \nPlus, as part of the watercolour set we'll include handy postcards displaying colour swatches and a colour wheel that can easily be tucked into one of the inside pockets of the leather cover, so you'll have all the essential information close to hand.\nWe created the How to Keep a Sketch Journal package as a beautiful and inspiring bundle for anyone who has ever thought about keeping a sketch journal or who just wants to find a new creative outlet, whatever your skill level.

Please note that we can only reship an order once if it is lost. If the second parcel is lost, we will not be able to offer a refund.\nWith the Sketch Workshop experience now firmly under our belts, we are already hard at work writing and commissioning content for the How to Keep a Sketch Journal book, while continuing to refine and make improvements to the leather cover to ensure it's as comfortable and easy to carry as it is good-looking. If we reach our funding goal in July, we will be able to finalise the cover for mass production, and we expect for our shipments of books and covers to arrive in early December, allowing us to ship to backers throughout the month of December.  \nAs with any Kickstarter project, schedules can change depending on a variety of factors, however we have a lot of experience as publishers and Kickstarter creators, so we are confident we can stay on track. We will of course keep our backers up to date if any changes arise.\nAs a publisher of art books and tools specialising in computer graphics, we love that we can reach a new audience for traditional art through Kickstarter. We have met so many talented and inspiring people through the Kickstarter community already, and we hope to grow that network further still through the Sketch Journal project.

Over the past year Bluetooth LE (low energy) technology, has unlocked entire new categories of tech gadgets, one of which are small tracking devices. We think this technology is really cool but we have yet to find a tracker that we would use on a daily basis. Inspired by the potential of this technology, we decided to design and create our own device. We know people appreciate great quality when it comes to personal items. So we created Loopio, the World's first all aluminium Bluetooth tracker and also Loopio Sport, which has been inspired by the comments we recieced from Kickstarters since we launched our project. Both trackers use our smart antenna design to maximise signal performance and functionality.\nOur frustration with existing products\nHere are the current products available. Most of them are cheap, badly designed pieces of plastic. The truth is the majority of these trackers simply don\u2019t work well enough to be used in every day life. In tests we found the main problems were lack of signal and poor battery life. This is caused by failing to utilise the current low energy bluetooth technology to its full potential.\nWhat we did\nTaking all these factors into account we designed & developed a new device, something that's built for purpose. Loopio has been designed from the ground up to be stylish, high quality and functional.\nWhat makes the Loopio design so unique?\nThe Loopio is made from aluminium. To make this possible we needed a new way to incorporate the antenna, so we decided to add the antenna in the form of a loop. This loop also doubles up as the key loop, or by which you can attach it to anything you like. Our smart antenna design combined with the latest hardware enables Loopio to achieve optimal signal stability for up to a 50m (164feet) range. We then packaged this into the smallest design possible.\nHow the Loopio works\nLoopio is Innovation\nThe Loopio is small and compact\nThanks to its intelligent flexible loop design we also managed to make the Loopio very compact. This means that when you attach your keys to the Loopio, it folds with your keys taking up minimal space, making sure it fits perfectly in your pocket.\nSuper efficient\nThanks to the low voltage bluetooth technology the Loopio is super efficient. The battery lasts for one year and is easily replaceable by the user.\nDesigned to be tough\nMade from aluminium the Loopio is designed to be tough. It's lightweight too, weighing in at just 13grams, It's also water and dust resistant.\nDesigned with attention to detail, we believe in the small details\nThe Loopio has been designed with care and attention to detail. We hope you like the design as much as we do.\n Loopio Colors\nThe Loopio is currently available in silver or black, we will be adding more colors and finishes based on stretch goals and your suggestions.\nTech Specifications \nProject Timeline\nAbout us\nNow that you've learned about Loopio, we'd like to take a moment to introduce the minds behind this project. The loopio has been designed and developed in the UK. The Loopio concept, including the antenna design, has been designed by myself and the development and prototyping stages have been a collaboration with a UK technology & research company. The manufacturing will be outsourced to China, to meet our quality and price requirements needed in order to make this project viable.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are so excited to share Loopio with Kickstarter before anyone else. The reason we have chosen the Kickstarter platform is simple. We have put a lot of time, effort and money into the design and development of our product and we know kickstarter has the potential to give our project the momentum it needs to succeed. \nWe recognise that kickstarter has an important community of gadget enthusiasts, innovators and creators. This is why we want to share our idea with you because we feel your opinions and suggestions can really help us make this product the best it can be.\nYour funding means more than anything to us, and we hope you can all join our exciting journey. All of the funding will go towards vitally important aspects of making Loopio a reality. We truly believe that our product will be in a class of its own.\nThank You!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt has taken us nearly a year to get to were we are today with the design and development of the Loopio. It has been a great challenge to achieve such great performance in such a compact sleek design.\nThe (BLE) bluetooth low energy technology that powers the Loopio is tried and tested, this inherently reduces the amount of risk still involved during the final stages of our project.\nThe largest of our hurdles left is to fine tune and get the antenna design ready for production. To help us with this we have partnered up with a world-class manufacturer leading in implementation of bluetooth technology.\nThe last stages of our project involves final development of our app and then bringing all these elements together including tooling, testing and production. \nThe last challenge will be shipping out the product to each of our kickstarter backers. We have already researched this and have found the right logistics partner to use. We don't anticipate any complications during this stage.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Serge Beynon\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi I'm Serge, a creative designer.

Each year, millions of barrels of whiskey are produced and sold. As part of the distilling process, the whiskey is aged in oak barrels.\nThe whiskey is aged in these barrels for 4 years. The used barrels are salvaged, the steel bands are removed, and the staves disassembled. Finally, the staves are cut into over-sized (7/8in. x 7/8in. x 5-1/4in. minimum) pen blanks.\nMy great grandfather, Stephen Ernest Whidden, was a carpenter. He ran a carpentry shop along with Mr. Decatur and Mr. Smith on the northeast corner of Broad Street and Lincoln Terrace in Peekskill, New York back in the 1920s. My grandfather, Ernest Richard Whidden, built airplanes for a living, but in his spare time he enjoyed carpentry.\nInspired by their legacy, I decided in 2014 to begin learning about woodworking. I purchased a lathe and began to make woodturned projects such as pens, keychains, winestoppers, and bowls.\nOne of the motivating factors at our woodshop has always been using reclaimed, salvaged, and sustainable wood sources. For the most part, I collect my own wood or purchase it from local salvage companies.\nThe wood being used to create the rewards for this campaign is from salvaged whiskey barrels once used by the Jack Daniel's Distillery.\nInitially, pen making started out as a hobby. It has grown from that and turned into a full time family business. We currently run an online Etsy shop and sell items locally, but that isn't enough to provide for our growing family of 6 (and 2 cats).\nKickstarter allows for global exposure and creates permanent relationships with people who are passionate about what we create and also with potential retail buyers.\nOur goal for this campaign is to raise enough funds to fulfill all our rewards, purchase a new lathe and drill press for our shop, and to provide for monthly expenses for our family.\nI enjoy creating unique projects with a story. Each of the rewards for this campaign include an authentic piece of American distilling history. Included with each reward is a certificate of authenticity and a story that you can share with your friends.\nRemember each item is handcrafted and unique! There may be variances in wood coloring and grain. Your particular keychain or pen may look slightly different than the one in the picture. If you would like more or higher resolution pictures of the rewards, please let me know!\n\nRewards will begin shipping in July and continue until completed.\nLevel 1 - $8 Reward: Whidden's Woodshop Tote Bag\nLevel 2 - $18 Reward: Wood Keychain\nLevel 3 - $28 Reward: Ballpoint Pen\nLevel 4 - $43 Reward: Ballpoint Pen & Pencil Set\nLevel 5 - $48 Reward: Rollerball Pen\n Level 6 - $50 Reward: Bolt Action Pen\n Level 7 - $60 Reward: Fountain Pen\nLevel 8 - $200 Reward: Ultimate Handcrafted Bundle\nPens from left to right: Fountain, Rollerball, Pencil, Ballpoint Pen, Bolt-Action, Keychain on top.\nAll of our pens come in a display box with a magnetic closure.
