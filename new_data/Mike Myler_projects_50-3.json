It\u2019s a wacky roleplaying game of action comedy! \nYou can pick up the core rules in PDF for just \u00a37 or softcover for \u00a314!\nHardcover collector's omnibus, softcover rules and adventures, blank ID cards, monster cards, hero role cards, VTT tokens\nAre you a fan of the Ghostbusters RPG from the 1980s? Danger Mouse or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Bill & Ted or Rick & Morty? Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Dracula, or sci-fi adventures on the final frontier? Do you enjoy chortling at TV tropes or chuckling at pop-culture parodies? Then the Awfully Cheerful Engine! is here for you!\nACE! is brought to you by Russ 'Morrus' Morrissey (EN World, WOIN, Judge Dredd & The Worlds of 2000 AD), Dave Chapman (Doctor Who, Star Trek Adventures), and Marc Langworthy (Hellboy, Judge Dredd & The Worlds of 2000 AD). With a foreword by Sandy Petersen, co-author of the Ghostbusters RPG!\nACE! is designed for everybody! From talking animals to pulp heroes to eldritch horrors, kids and adults alike will find adventures to love with the Awfully Cheerful Engine!\nThis tabletop roleplaying game, which we\u2019re calling ACE! with an exclamation point, is one of fast, cinematic, action comedy. To play you need a handful of six-sided dice, a pen, and some paper. Each player plays one Hero, except for one player who takes the role of the Director.\nThink of ACE! as an irreverent, fun-packed movie. You might play as ghost hunters in New York City, a band of plucky galactic guardians, vampire slayers, or soldiers of fortune in the Los Angeles underground. Heck, you might even be cartoon animals. Good grief!\nThis is a multi-dimensional, time-hopping, genre-mashing, pan-galactic portal into any type of adventure you can imagine! Want to play in a fantasy world full of elves and orcs? Crew a starship as it explores the galaxy? Hunt vampires in Victorian London? Play as animal detectives, robot cowboys, wizards, ninjas, or time traveling bounty hunters?\nThe only limit is your imagination, and the requirement that you have fun.\nThis Kickstarter is for the full five-book set.\nWhat? Five books, you say? Fear not -- they're pretty small books! They include the core rules, and four hilarious genre-hopping adventures. Each book is about 30 pages long. Except for one which is longer, but we wrote 'BUMPER SIZE ISSUE' on the front of that, so it's OK. If you\u2019ve ever held a comic-book in your hand, the Awfully Cheerful Engine! will feel very familiar! \nThe core rulebook is just 30 pages in a bright, colorful comic-book sized format. We even gave it an issue number, like a comic-book! After that, each 'issue' is a standalone adventure, designed for one-shots or short campaigns with new characters each time. One week you might be fighting ghosts on the streets of Manhattan, and the next you might be exploring the frontiers of space in your trusty starship!\nYou don't have to play them all, or in order. The standalone format means you can fit them in whenever and however you feel like it. GM can't make your regular game? Go bust some ghosts instead! Pickup game at a convention? Investigate the strange goings-on in a small American town in the 1980s. Running a livestream? Board a starship and fight the Kulkan Empire! Play one of them, some of them, or all of them! It's up to you!\nAre they comics? Or are they RPGs? (They're RPGs)\n ACE #1: Introducing the Awfully Cheerful Engine! With a foreword by Ghostbusters RPG author Sandy Petersen, this book tells you the rules, how to create your Heroes, and gives you a bunch of Extras (NPCs & monsters) to use. By Russ Morrissey.\n ACE #2: Spirits of Manhattan. Strap on your Anti-Plasm Particle Thrower, grab your Electromagnetic Field Detector, and jump into your Ghostmobile. New York City needs your help! By Dave Chapman and Russ Morrissey.\n ACE #3: Montana Drones & The Raiders of the Cutty Sark. At the request of Army Intelligence, Montana Drones and her team travel the globe in search of lost or hidden artefacts, often exploring dangerous sites and racing against hostile enemy agents to keep the objects of their quests from falling into the wrong hands. Striking locations, exciting chases, dangerous enemies and monotonous classroom lectures await! By Marc Langworthy.\n ACE #4: Strange Science. Welcome to Wilden Falls, your average American town in the heart of the country. Surrounded by trees, nature, and there\u2019s a wonderful waterfall that brings the tourists. It\u2019s a quaint little town. Until weird things start happening at the local research facility, people go missing, and there\u2019s a sudden influx of fitness nuts in the town. That\u2019s before we get to the time travel, bodysnatching, and portals to other dimensions. Maybe \u2018strange\u2019 isn\u2019t strong enough a word for it! By Dave Chapman.\n ACE #5: Beam Me Up! These are the voyages of the starship FSS Brazen. Its continuing mission: to recklessly go where plenty of people have probably been before\u2026 and hope a major interstellar incident isn\u2019t sparked in the process. In this highly illogical adventure for the ACE! roleplaying game, you\u2019ll explore frontiers you never thought you had. By Marc Langworthy.\nPlus unlocked Stretch Goals:\n ACE #6: Orcs & Oubliettes. You've played warriors and wizards before. You've delved into dungeons and battled with dragons. But not like this you haven't! Join the Dusk Watch and save the city of Heq Moreveg in ORCS & OUBLIETTES, a Pratchett-esque parody of the world's most popular roleplaying game.\n ACE #7: BITE ME! From Victorian London to the heart of Transylvania, you'll meet werewolves, ghosts, zombies, and worse in your hunt for the legendary vampire himself, Count Dracula!\n ACE #8: Domes of Thunder. Battle mutants in a post-apocalyptic wasteland! Explosions, armored trucks, and villainous cults feature in DOMES OF THUNDER as you fight for limited resources of petrol. Mayhem awaits!\nAnd up next:\n ACE #9: Accidental Anthropomorphic Animal Heroes. Fan of Danger Mouse or TMNT? In ACCIDENTAL ANTHROPOMORPHIC ANIMAL HEROES you'll play a wisecracking animal hero and defend your city's streets from evil villains. Who are also probaby animals. Cartoon action! \nWe give you four adventures to start with, and we have plans for more (see the Stretch Goals, below), but there's also a free compatibility license so anybody can write and publish material powered by the Awfully Cheerful Engine!\nHardy Hobbit. Teenage Samurai. Cheerful Stuntman. Clumsy Vampire. Squeamish Ghost. Who knew you could say so much in just two words? The possibilities are endless.\nIt\u2019s not just Awfully Cheerful! It\u2019s fast and fun, too!\nYou won\u2019t get bogged down in endless rules and character sheets that look like tax forms. Your ACE! ID Card contains everything you need to know, and it\u2019s only about the size of a credit card! But don\u2019t try to spend it. It\u2019s not a real credit card. Honestly, we tried, and it didn't end well.\nYou can download blank ID cards from our website. Don't worry, there's a printer-friendly black-and-white version too!\nMaking your Hero takes about five minutes. And that includes a coffee break. \nYou can choose from an array of talking animals, alien and fantasy species, and occupations from a bunch of genres. Play a cat, a crow, or a turtle. An alien, an elf, a robot, or a vampire. A knight, a pirate, or a wizard. An astronaut, a burglar, a reporter, or a spy. The core book has dozens of Roles to get you started with, and each adventure book introduces more!\nEven better, you can already use our online character builder and make a character in about 30 seconds! It's so quick! Give it a try! And if you felt like sharing your Hero on Twitter with the hashtag #awfullycheerful and a link to this page, well, we'd be most awfully grateful!\nBuild your Hero online!\nAlternatively, each adventure comes with its own selection of pre-generated characters. If you don't want to make your own characters, you can simply use those - perfect for one-shots or new players!\nDownload the pre-gens for all four adventures from the official website!\nIn A.C.E! each Hero (that's you!) has a Role. Your Role gives you a special ability only you can use. Here's a quick look at some of the Roles you can play!\nTalking animals like Ape, Cat, Crow, Dog, Kangaroo, and Turtle.\nSpecies like Alien, Dwarf, Elf, Ghost, Goblin, Golem, Hobbit, Monster, Ogre, Robot, Vampire, and Werewolf.\nFantasy roles like Alchemist, Assassin, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Knight, Ninja, Outlaw, Pirate, Ranger, Samurai, Slayer, and Wizard.\nOccupations like Actor, Archeologist, Astronaut, Athlete, Bounty Hunter, Boxer, Burglar, Chef, Con Artist, Cowboy, Detective, Doctor, Engineer, Gambler, Gangster, Hacker, Hermit, Inventor, Musician, Pilot, Priest, Professor, Reporter, Scientist, Smuggler, Soldier, Spy, Student, and Stuntman.\nEven a couple of superheroes like Speedster and Vigilante! \nYep, you can play a Ghost. You don\u2019t take damage unless its from a holy source or some special sci-fi ecto-gadget. But you also can\u2019t pick things up. So there\u2019s that.\nEach of the adventures adds some more Roles (or recommends some old ones)!\n Spirits of Manhattan adds Ghost, Demonologist, Doctor, Engineer, Exorcist, Inventor, Priest, Professor, Scientist, and Student.\n Raiders of the Cutty Sark adds Botanist, Double-Agent, Socialite, and Witch.\n Strange Science adds Brain, Cheerleader, Outsider, Protector, Radio Presenter, and Tycoon.\n Beam Me Up adds Captain, Chief Engineer, Comms, Hologram, Gunner, Counsellor, and Pilot.\nACE! is a pretty fast, light game. If you played 1986's Ghostbusters RPG, you'll see the influence immediately.\nStats! The AWFULLY CHEERFUL ENGINE! is a d6 dice pool system*. You have four Stats -- Smarts, Moves, Style, and Brawn. If you have a Moves score of 3, you roll three six-sided dice when you try to jump a motorcycle over a ravine. If you roll high enough, you succeed. It's pretty simple!\nFocuses! For each Stat you also have a Focus. For Smarts it might be a science, or chess, or history. For Style it might be bluffing, singing, or fashion, and for Brawn it might be brawling or swimming. You can choose from plenty of focuses. Foci. Focuses. Whatever.  Anyway, if the thing you're trying to do relates to a Focus, you get to roll an extra two dice.\nTrait! You choose a trait, like Angry or Cheerful or Rebellious or Despondent. This, combined with your Role, makes you a Gullible Vampire, a Brave Turtle, or a Squeamish Scientist.\nKarma! Finally, you have a bunch of Karma points. These can be spent for extra dice or to absorb damage from attacks, and they're recovered by using your trait.\n\n*Fun fact -- did you know that 1986's Ghostbusters RPG, by Sandy Petersen, Lynn Willis and Greg Stafford, was the first ever dice pool RPG? Also Sandy Petersen has written an awesome foreword for the AWFULLY CHEERFUL ENGINE!\nWhat, I hear you ask, is a CALAMITY DIE?\nThe Calamity Die is how you find out that your friends really aren't your friends. You see, when you make a roll, one of those dice is a different color, and is called the Calamity Die. And if your roll fails, and also the Calamity Die rolls a 1, your so-called 'friends' decide what happens to you. It won't kill you or anything, but...\nWell, we'll leave that thought with you.\nNooooo! And it was all going so well!\nWe bet you just can't wait to take a peek inside. Well, fear not! We've got some top-secret sneaky previews for you. But sssshhhhh! Don't tell anybody.\n\nWhat game of action comedy doesn't feature an array of colorful monsters and NPCs? Fantasy, modern, or sci-fi, we've got dragons, cops, vampires, wizards, even hunter-killer cyborgs!\nEach book introduces some new Roles for your Heroes. In Spirits of Manhattan you can play a ghost, a demonologist, a doctor, an engineer, an exorcist, an inventor, a priest, a professor, a scientist, or a student. Yes, we said you could play a ghost.\nTake a look at the equipment pages of Spirits of Manhattan -- an array of hi-tech totally reliable (honest) ecto-gizmos designed to help your ghost-hunting. From ElectroMagnetic Field Detectors to \"Spirit Stopper\" Anti-Plasm Particle Throwers, we've got it all! We also have a little rule there which collates the dollar value of all the collateral damage you do.\nRaiders of the Cutty Sark will have you fighting Nazis for ancient artefacts in the late 1930s. From ambassadorial parties to occultists at Halycon Hall to ancient temples and monsters with horrible tentacles, don't leave your whip and hat at home!\nIn Strange Science, your Heroes will visit the town of Wilden Falls in 1984, when the town is being overrun by a host of creepy artificial pod people called Steve... \n... and its precursor, Wildenville, in 1884! Of course to do this they'll need the help of an eccentric scientist and a time machine.\nWe're sure this abandoned mine is perfectly safe. Nothing to worry about there. Nope, nothing to see here. \nIn Beam Me Up you play a starship crew in the Federated League of Planets (FLoP). You'll meet a super soldier out for revenge, encounter a strange, powerful entity called R, and cross blazer pistols with the Kulkan Empire.\nThe crew of the FSS Brazen and its continuing mission: to recklessly go where plenty of people have probably been before\u2026 and hope a major interstellar incident isn\u2019t sparked in the process. \nThis super-special omnibus 7\"x10\" 180-page hardcover collector's edition contains all five books -- and it gets bigger and better as we unlock stretch goals!\nThis book also includes a bonus appendix with pre-generated characters, and full-page maps. \nThe Collector's Omnibus Edition costs \u00a3100. At present it contains ACE! issues #1-5. But we want to make it bigger and better! As we unlock more issues through stretch goals (see below) these will be added to the hardcover. The price will remain the same!\nWe have created three card decks. You can add these decks to your pledge once you have selected your reward tier. To select a physical card deck, you must have selected a physical reward tier. Each deck costs \u00a310 (about $14).\nShipping! Unlike our books, the cards are only printed in the US, and the international shipping fees for cards are pretty high, and beyond our control. We know that sucks, and we're sorry, but we've left the choice up to you. Please make sure you check the shipping cost when selecting an add-on! We've included a 'combined shipping' option for all three card decks to help save on shipping costs.\nCustoms! Cards are not books, so they may trigger a customs charge at your location if you are not in the US.\nPDFs! Alternatively, all three card decks come in a handy PDF format so you can print them out at home. The Blank ID Cards are free in PDF; the other two decks are \u00a34 each.\nBlank I.D. Cards\nA deck of 40 blank A.C.E! ID cards, in four colors (10 each of green, blue, yellow, and black-and-white). \nThese come in blue and black-and-white, too!\nThese are glossy cards. These cards can be written on with wet or dry-erase markers. They can't be written on with a pencil. We also provide free cards which you can print out at home.\nExtras Card Deck\nAlso available as an add-on is an Extras card deck containing nearly 60 cards. This deck contains a card for each of the monsters and NPCs (non-player characters, which we call 'Extras') found across all five books, color-coded based on the book they came from - 22 yellow cards from the core rules, 8 brown cards from Raiders of the Cutty Sark, 11 green cards from Spirits of Manhattan, 8 purple cards from Strange Science, and 6 blue cards (including 3 starships) from Beam Me Up. \nWe call monsters and NPCs 'Extras'. Like in a movie, geddit?\nRole Deck\nFinally, we have a deck for players, with each possible Role on a card. Robots, vampires, dogs, cats, ninjas, scientists, elves, trolls, aliens, ghosts, the whole works! There are dozens of Roles in this deck, from different genres, taken from all five books.\nIt's role-tastic!\n\nWe've written the first 5 issues of ACE! We want to write more and we'll be able to write them if we make certain funding targets. Please help us write them! Here's how it works.\nEverybody who backs the \u00a345 I'm ALL IN! (PDF) tier or higher gets all the unlocked PDF adventure stretch goal issues for free. Yep, you will get more issues of ACE! in PDF format.\nEverybody who backs the \u00a370 ACE! The Full Set (Softcover) tier or higher will be sent coupons which allows them to purchase the softcovers of each unlocked issue at half price plus shipping (plus the PDFs for free of course).\nAll the unlocked adventure stretch goal issues will also be included in the hardcover Omnibus: Collector's Edition. That book will get bigger and better with each stretch goal we unlock.\nEach tier (over on the right) also tells you which stretch goals it includes. \nWe'll reveal the first stretch goal soon. We can't wait! This deal just keeps on getting better... we can't help ourselves! We're so excited, and we just can't hide it!\nStretch Goal Delivery\nWhile the initial 5-issue set will be delivered very quickly (in PDF and softcover format), the stretch goal issues will be be delivered to you one-by-one as they are completed, so you could be be receiving new ACE! issues periodically into 2022 (depending how many stretch goals get unlocked) to add to the five adventures you will already have. It's basically like a comic-book subscription which gets better in value with each stretch goal.\nThe Collector's Omnibus Edition won't be completed until the stretch goal adventures are completed. Because of causality.\nWe've designed the Awfully Cheerful Engine! with one-shots and streaming in mind. It takes a couple of minutes to make a character and a couple more to learn the rules. It's light and flexible, and doesn't need miniatures or battlemaps. And it'll make you laugh. It's the perfect streamable game!\nWe're VTT ready, baby! A character sheet, art, tokens, and maps!\nBut there's more! We know that many of you like to play online using Virtual Tabletops (VTTs). We've made VTT packages for the four ACE! adventures in this Kickstarter. These include dozens of tokens, plus maps and images from the adventures which you can use immediately with any VTT of your choice. You automatically get these free with the adventures. Yep, you heard that right. Free!\nVTT token packs!\nWe've also already made a character sheet available on one leading VTT! You can start using it right now!\nBelow you'll find a one-hour actual play run by Morrus. It features four talking animals (a Greedy Crow, a Fickle Cat, a Despondent Robot, and an Unruly Turtle) as they try to save a department store from a gang of apes! If you prefer an audio format, this actual play is also available as a podcast episode on Morrus' Unofficial Tabletop RPG Talk.\n You can also watch the stream below, courtesy of our friends at Tablestory as they play through a custom adventure of their own making! We'd tell you they weren't paid to say nice things about our game... but let's face it. They were.\nThere's a lot of stuff available in this Kickstarter. 5 softcover books, 1 hardcover book, and 3 card decks, plus PDFs and VTT assets. The image below helps to summarize all that at a glance. We've also provided an \"I'M ALL IN\" reward tier so you can grab everything at once without having to sort through add-ons.\nLet's talk about shipping. At the moment we are shipping to US, UK, Canada, EU, Scandinavia, and Australia. Our books are printed and shipped from the US and the UK. Our cards are printed and shipped from the US.\nWe know that shipping can be a pain point for many, especially those outside the US. Unfortunately, we have no control over the shipping costs. \nYou will be advised of the shipping costs to your country when you select your pledge tier, before you complete your pledge. Generally US is the cheapest, while Australia and Scandinavia are the highest.\nCards! Shipping for cards is very high outside the US. We have given you the option, but reward tiers which include cards will attract higher shipping fees for non-US backers. We also offer PDF alternatives for the three card sets, which can reduce your shipping fees considerably (you can get these as add-ons when you pledge).\nPlease note that cards and books are printed and shipped separately, so pledge tiers with both will add the total for both packages.\nEU! If you're in the EU, you might see extra tarriffs or customs charges added by your country. We can't predict this, and again it's not something we have any control over.\nHere at EN Publishing we have built a reputation over the years for fast and reliable Kickstarter delivery, often fulfilling Kickstarters immediately upon completion. Here's what you can expect from us:\nPDFs of ACE! issues #1-5 will be sent when the Kickstarter campaign ends. Expect those to go out in June 2021.\nOther digital items (card deck PDFs, VTT tokens, maps, etc.) will also be sent out at the same time as the PDFs.\nSoftcovers of ACE! issues #1-5 will be printed and shipped as soon as the Kickstarter funds are collected and cleared, which takes about two weeks. Expect to have those by August 2021.\nCard decks are printed and shipped separately to the books. We'll order them at the same time as the softcovers, but they do take longer to ship, especially outside the US.\nPDFs of unlocked stretch goal issues #6+ will be sent as they are completed over the coming year much like a comic-book subscription.\nThe Collector's Omnibus hardcover will be printed and shipped when the stretch goals have been completed (because the stretch goals are being included in it). Expect to see that in 2022. Obviously the more stretch goals we unlock, the longer that'll be. \nSo you'll be able to start playing the Awfully Cheerful Engine! as soon as the Kickstarter ends! You won't have to wait. And by the time you finish the first five adventures, more will have arrived.\nWe have the proofs already. Just awaiting funding for the print run! See! No waiting!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe PDF versions are ready to go! There's no risk to you, and we'll send the PDFs out as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends. For the softcover version, we will be able to fund the print order as soon as the Kickstarter ends, and will print and ship them to you as fast as possible. The only possible delays would be COVID-related. NOTE: We print EU books in the UK. Brexit may cause delays and additional fees on on shipments to the EU.

In these pages you'll find jackalopes, wampus cats, dreaming trees, and flower mice, plus fey beasts inspired by folklore; and you'll venture into the Hedgegrove, the realm of Princess Dandelion, an immortal Archfey of the Summer Court. This content is brought to you in softcover format for the first time ever!\n\nThis is a \"Quickstarter\" -- it's only here for two weeks, so don't miss out! Note that if you pledge for the digital (PDF) versions, they will be delivered as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends. The softcover booklets will take a little longer.\nHere's a look at the contents of this 33-page book.\n Adventure in the Feywild. An adventure from Kiel Chenier. The adventurers are trapped in a strange land - can they find their way home? And can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dendelion? Illustrated by Egil Thompson.\n From Stranger Woods. Four fantastical new fey monsters for your 5E game! The goat-horned ochokochi with a bony cleaver; the capricious trickster poludnitsa; the angelic-looking samovila, ladies of drought and harvest; and the repulsive via, with their gaze of dread. These creatures are inspired by Eastern European folklore. By Artem Serebrennikov; illustarted by Sade.\n Fearsome Critters. Writer John Bupp takes a look at a handful of fearsome fey critters! The small, apelike agropelter hurls branches from nearby trees; the infamous jackalope can mimic any sound it hears; the short, pudgy puckwudgie can be helpful, but a terrible foe if slighted; and the six-legged campus cat can terrify its prey with its mere gaze. Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\n Beasts of the Feywild. More summer means more fey! This time we have a bunch of new fey beasts for your 5E game - from the Dreaming Tree to the Sylvan Spaniel, from the Moon Horse to the Flower Mouse, these creatures from writer Jason Reilly are sure to enhance your game sessions! Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\nWe knew you'd want a list of the monsters in this book. They range from CR 0 to CR 11.\n Agropelter (CR 1). 3-ft. villainous ape-ducks able to hurl tree branches.\n Dreaming Tree (CR 5). A fey tree which feasts on the dreams of those sleeping nearby.\n Flower Mouse (CR 0). A tiny fey creature sometimes used as a mount by flower fey and faeries.\n Golden Goat (CR 1/4). A radiant creature with a shining fleece. You've heard of this one.\n Hazel Fish (CR 1/2). A shy fish able to grant wisdom to those who eat it.\n Jackalope (CR 4). A rabbit... with antlers, and a talent for mimicry.\n Mirage Butterfly (CR 1/8). Mounts of the flower fey with minor illusion powers.\n Moon Horse (CR 2). The preferred mount of the Summer Court, this horse appears to be made of ivory.\n Ochoduchi (CR 6). An 8-ft tall horned goat humanoid with razorsharp claws, based on a monster from Georgian folklore.\n Poludnitsa (CR 4). A capricious trickster which adopts different guises, based on a creature from Polish, Russian, and Slovak folklore.\n Puckwudgie (CR 1/2). A short, grey-skinned shapeshifter, capable of good or evil.\n Samovila (CR 9). A tall winged fey of drought and harvest with otherworldy features which holds great power in the faerie courts; based on a creature from Serbian and Bulgarian folklore.\n Swarm of Flower Mice (CR 1/4). Flower mice are not dangerous alone, but can swarm their enemies.\n Swarm of Mirage Butterflies (CR 1/2). A swarm of mirage butterflies can combine their illusion powers to greater effect.\n Sylvan Manx (CR 0). These cats come and go as they please.\n Sylven Spaniel (CR 1/4). Companion dogs for fey princes, sometimes used as mounts by tiny fey.\n Viy (CR 11). A loathsome, evil fey with a gaze of dread, inspired by a creature from Ukrainian folklore.\n Wampus Cat (CR 3). A fetid-smelling six-legged black cat with a frightening gaze.\nBut if you buy this book for anything, buy it for the sylvan spaniel. How cute is this?\nIn addtion to the 18 fey monsters, Adventure Into The Feywild is a 15-page adventure by Kiel Chenier included in Into the Feywild. In this adventure for 1st-5th level characters the adventurers are trapped in a strange land\u2014can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dandelion, and find their way home?\nWhen it was originally released for EN5ider's 100th issue back in 2016, the included adventure got some glowing reviews.\n\"If you are comfortable improvising and roleplaying, this is one of the best and easiest modules to run. The charts are amazing, hilarious and lead to some truly great moments. I needed very little prep time which was much appreciated. I think my players will remember this session fondly for a long time.\"\n\"The random tables alone are incredible.  The adventure is great, too, but I'll be re-using these tables!\"\n\"My party loved this adventure so, so much.

As Black men who grew up having to actively seek out information on our historical figures, we understand the significance of sharing these stories with the youth in a way that is both fun and entertaining. \nBlack children need to know that they were more than slaves and contributed heavily to creating what America is today. These aren't just Black heroes, these are OUR heroes. \nAnd we are hoping that you see the value in telling these stories through animation, science fiction and Hip Hop. By creating this pilot episode, we hope to create an entire series on our unsung heroes. \nOur Heroes Rock also has plans to expand and tell the stories of unsung heroes for all minority groups.\nIt's not about making money, it's about making something that deserves to exist.\nConceived as a hip-hop odyssey through Black History, \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d is an animated series that shines a spotlight on history\u2019s unsung Heroes of color through infectious music, stunning 3D animation and a family-friendly, sci-fi-flavored narrative designed to appeal to both parents and kids alike.   \nJoin Electronic Tour guide E-Tour and explore the Heroes of Black History!\nExecutive-Produced by world-renowned talent and TV personality Ettore Ewen, award-winning artist and narrative designer Jonathan Davenport and award-winning sports and cultural historian Andreas Hale, \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d has one simple goal, to create an educational vehicle that\u2019s so visually and musically appealing that audiences would watch it regardless of the content. \nOur aim is to place American Heroes such as Medgar Evers, Ida B. Wells and Nina Simone in the same historical echelon reserved for George Washington, Thomas Edison and Neil Armstrong.  \nEarly concept art of the Hall of Heroes - the Museum of the Future!\n\u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d takes place in a futuristic, hologram-heavy museum known as the HALL OF HEROES (imagine the Smithsonian if it was designed by Tony Stark), where students from all over the world are able to tour the exhibits virtually via robotic avatars called K.I.D.D.O.s. \nCompact and sturdy, K.I.D.D.O.s allow kids to safely explore the vast Hall of Heroes!\nLeading them on this \u201celectronic tour\u201d is E-TOUR, a wisecracking, larger-than-life robotic tour guide! As E-TOUR leads the KIDDOs through the Hall of Heroes, each stop spotlights a single exhibit featuring an American Hero from Black History. When activated by E-TOUR, music starts pumping and the exhibit explodes around the KIDDOs into an immersive music video-style narrative performed by a curated stable of hip-hop artists who tell that Hero\u2019s story through rhythm and rhyme.  \nEarly concept art of E-Tour, your Electronic Tour Guide!\n The lesson we learn from each Hero\u2019s experience will tie directly into an emotional obstacle, fear or insecurity that one of the kids is feeling at the beginning of the episode, summarizing the theme of the episode and illustrating how empowering history and representation can be.  \nEarly concept art of American Hero Ruby Bridges.\nAs creators, we know from our experiences growing up that educational content for its own sake is just not that attractive. As a kid, you can smell it from a mile away. That\u2019s why our goal is to make \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d feel like a show that would\u2019ve been produced on the merits of its visual and narrative trappings alone.  \nEarly concept art of your electronic tour guide, E-Tour!\nElements like VR drones, futuristic settings and living robots are all there to make this series feel more like a theme park experience than a classroom one. Our dream is that this series lives year-round, not just during Black History Month. When \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d is shown in classrooms, we want kids to feel transported rather than talked to. We want parents to NOT have to roll their eyes and cover their ears when their kids want to watch this show in a nonstop streaming loop at home. \nEarly concept art of a few of the KIDDO's many hidden features!\nWe believe we have all the necessary pieces in place and hopefully, with support from our backers, we can make these dreams a reality and bring \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d into the homes, schools and mobile devices of families everywhere.\nWith your help, we can shine a light on unsung American Heroes and Kickstart History!\nOur Goal: (FUNDED!!!)\nMaking an animated short is expensive and a significant amount of work for a small, dedicated team. From the animation to the original song, it's going to take a great deal of effort. We set our goal to $75,000 to make a pilot episode that is 4 minutes long and will cover everything from artist fees to Kickstarter reward expenses. However, we are hoping to raise $150,000 to make the highest quality project that will extend the length of the short and allow us to create a narrative that will truly honor Ruby Bridges. \nReward Bundles!\nAs you may have seen, we\u2019ve also added two new reward tiers with OHR hoodies and socks. We know, you've already supported us and it tears you apart knowing that you can only support one thing.\nWell, what if we told you that we fixed that for those who want multiple rewards?\nWait for it\u2026\nBUNDLES!\nNow you don\u2019t have to worry about missing out on our most popular rewards.\nStarting now you can bundle your rewards together.

Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image. Copy, paste, and post them on your own social accounts to help spread the word. It's as simple as that! \n4. CHECK IN WITH YOUR FELLOW MSTIES.  We don't want you to pressure anyone, but we do hope you'll check in to make sure they know about this Kickstarter.  And when you do, be sure to remind them that pledging even a $1 token pledge will still help us unlock more Challenge Goals, Bonus Rewards, and get them weekly updates all the way through the production of Season 13!\n5. JOIN OUR \"VIRTUAL STREET TEAM.\" If you've got a little extra time, and want to make sure we reach our final goal, there are more specific ways to volunteer and help. If you want to get specific \"assignments\" to help us #MakeMoreMST3K, you can sign up to be part of our elite volunteer team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we learned last time, there are always risks with Kickstarter... and the world is a little crazier right now than usual.

There are 9 other books you can pick up as part of this Kickstarter. Scroll down to check out all the add-ons available!\nThis is a \"Quickstarter\" -- it's only here for two weeks, so don't miss out! Note that if you pledge for the digital (PDF) versions, they will be delivered as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends. The softcover booklets will take a little longer. \n Here's a look at the five dragons you'll find in this book.\n Syndrathrax the Soul Hoarder (CR 27). A mighty CR 27 monster! While technically an ancient red dragon, Syndrathrax\u2019s necromantic transformations and attempted apotheoses have forever altered her. Though she shares the massive size of her fellow red wyrms she is gaunt and skeletal, and her scales sapped of their red luster and now bone white. Thanks to the necromantic energy that permeates her body she radiates a faint spectral glow that she can mask when she chooses\u2014the souls of those that she has swallowed are sometimes seen struggling vainly to escape in this light. By Christopher Rippee; illustrated by Indi Martin.\n Bezkusmet the Unscaled (CR 10). Dragons are known to be terrifying but all pale in comparison to Bezkusmet the Unscaled. As his name suggests there is no hue or substance to his draconic scute leaving his musculature and skeleton bared for the world to see, lattices of finger-thick veins and arteries the size of a human\u2019s wrist inexorably pumping blood across his utterly naked body. Only a thin sheen of transparent magic holds Bezkusmet\u2019s organs and muscles in place, the last of the twisted supernatural energies of his birthright all that keeps him intact. By Mike Myler; illustrated by Claudio Pozas and Ekaterinya Vladinakova. \n Glamdrellyxxana the Gold (CR 19). A gold dragon druid under the influence of an ancient curse, Glamdrellyxxana believes the only way to ensure that the world remains \u2018good\u2019 is to destroy all humanoid life. From her lair in a mountain lake she's amassed an army of plant creatures to sweep down across the world and cleanse it of the blight from meddling civilizations destined to bring ruin with their advancement, yet the dragon often feels melancholy about the need to destroy so many living things. Glamdrellyxxana is resigned to this course of action however, convinced by fell visions of an industrialized future\u2014and distracted by mind-altering plants when the guilt becomes too much to bear. By Will Gawned; illustrated by J\u00falio Rocha.\n Teyladin the Reclaimer (CR 9). There are those among the fey who look at bustling cities and thriving towns, fishing boats, and lumber camps only to see a plague ravaging the natural world, plundering and despoiling its ancient beauty. When those ageless, cunning folk came upon a green dragon egg they knew they held a potentially powerful weapon\u2014thus Teyladin was raised to be a champion who in time will help end the scourge of civilization and return the world to its primal, pristine state. Written by Ben Green.\n The Librarian of Orban Tur (CR 25). According to legend the sigil of the library\u2014a snaking silver dragon\u2014isn\u2019t just for show. Some say the mosaic depiction of the creature (hundreds of feet long with dozens of short powerful legs) comes alive to protect the collection from thieves and vandals. What no living soul knows, though a few of the wise quietly suspect, is that the true Dragon of Orban Tur is the librarian herself. For centuries she has dwelt there collecting histories and writing countless volumes of her own by scrying on those who keep her Library Silvers. In her true form she is an ancient silver memory dragon, consuming the minds of those who provoke her wrath. Written by Ben Green; illustrated by Alba Palacio and Ellis Goodson.\nPlus the book also includes a bonus section of dragon-themed rules and player options from GM Lent! \nThe Marked by the Dragon background.\nVarious draconic environmental objects such as the Draken Sigil, Draconic Obelisk, Vasssal Reliquary, Dragonvein, and Petrified Fundamentum.\nA draconic plot generator.\nA new Inspiration mechanic called Draconic Favor, which grants PCs the ability to activate a dragonvein, roar a draconic curse, be granted a draconic audience, to learn draconic knowledge, to invoke draconic fortitude, and more.  \n Let's take a quick peek inside!\nThis is the 10th in this series of mini-quickstarters. If this is the first time you've seen these books, you can pick up the whole lot by selecting the 'I'm New Here!' reward tier in either PDF or softcover format (which is the cheapest way to get the whole collection). For a full list, scroll down a little and check out the add-ons section!\nThe 9 previous books in softcover format!\n\n10 books is a lot of material, and we understand if you only want some of them. While the  'I'm New Here!' reward tiers (above) are the cheapest way to get everything, if you only want one or two additional books you can grab them as add-ons. Here's how that works!\nSelect an existing reward tier as normal and proceed to make a pledge.\nBefore you finalize your pledge, you will be offered a menu of add-ons from the list above. You can pick and choose which ones you would like, including softcovers and PDFs.\nYou cannot add physical (softcover) add-ons if you haven't picked a physical reward tier. \nEach PDF costs \u00a310 and each softcover costs \u00a320. If you add-on a softcover, you also get the PDF for free, of course.\nShipping for add-ons is an additional \u00a31 (\u00a32 for Canada and Scandinavia) per book on top of your base pledge tier's shipping cost. \nIf you're not familiar with EN Publishing's Kickstarters, prepare to be amazed! We've built up a solid reputation over the last few years for quick reward delivery. There's no waiting around. What that means for you:\nPDFs go out the moment the Kickstarter ends. Literally. \nSoftcovers print runs are ordered the moment the Kickstarter funds clear. \nWe don't add stretch goals, as those would delay fulfillment of the project.\nA small caveat -- if you have ordered PDF add-ons they will go out over the days after the Kickstarter ends. That's simply due to Kickstarter's interface -- the regular reward tier PDF download links we can send out immediately en-masse, but the system makes us send out add-on download links manually one-at-a-time. They will take a few days to work through.\nAt the moment, we can only ship physical rewards to the UK, US, Canada, Australia, Scandinavia, and the EU. If you are not in one of those locations, we encourage you to select the PDF tiers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe PDF versions are ready to go!

You feel softer, lighter. There is something strange going on with this place. There is something strange going on with you.\nMycelium Madness is a mushroom-filled adventure for 5e DnD: the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game. It tasks a group of adventurers with trekking through a blighted and rotting wasteland, exploring a strange town with even stranger residents, and thwarting a sinister plot deep underground. \nBut what even is mycelium? I'm glad you asked! Mycelium refers to the massive networks of thin fungal threads that distribute resources and information throughout entire ecosystems. The threads, called hyphae, are five times thinner than a human hair, and a cubic inch of soil can contain enough of it to stretch for 8 miles. These vast mycelial networks serve many purposes essential to life on our planet, and even act as a sort of internet for intra-ecosystem communication between plants.\n\n\nThe adventure itself is balanced for a group of tier 2 player characters, but can be adapted to suit more or less experienced adventurers. It can be run as a one-shot or spread out into multiple sessions, and can be easily slotted into an existing campaign. \nFeatures Include:\nAn exciting adventure full of exploration, combat, survival, and mystery\nOver a dozen pieces of original artwork\nA host of memorable characters\nA trove of fungal-themed magic items\nCustom battle maps\nA brand new biome: the fungal wastes\nA ruthless new boss monster: the fungal dragon \nWhat do I need to play Mycelium Madness? In order to play through the adventure, all you need is a handful of friends and either a copy of the DnD Player's Handbook, or the DnD Basic Rules which are available for free right here.\n\nThe setting of the adventure is inspired by\u2026 mushrooms! I first got into the world of mushrooms because of my partner. She\u2019s a mycologist: a scientist who studies mushrooms and other fungi. In the spirit of fungus, Mycelium Madness is a trippy and surreal adventure where excitement and mystery is always hiding just beneath the surface.\n\n\nThe Adventure\nThe adventure begins when the player characters are hired to investigate a rural town called Shroomsville and put a stop to whatever strange corruption is spreading from it. Below is a brief overview of the adventure's three chapters. It contains spoilers for the the final chapter, so unless you plan on being the DM, skip to the next section!\nChapter 1\n The smell here is thick and earthy and alive. Millions of tiny spores hang suspended in the air, unmoving except for the disturbance of your breath, and they cling to you like static as you move through them. The ground is littered with decaying vegetation, the rotting detritus of fallen trees, and the occasional decomposing corpse. You have found yourself in the fungal wastes.\nSetting off on their quest, players will encounter their first challenge: a several day trek through the fungal wastes. A massive spore cloud has been spreading from the town of Shroomsville, laying thick and heavy over the land. Visibility is low within the wastes, and navigation difficult. Travelers' minds tend to wander here. There is a beauty in the kaleidoscopic hallucinations, and a sense of dread in the twisting shadows and quietly whispered mutterings.\nThe players must keep their wits about them if they are to explore the wastes and survive long enough to reach their destination.\nChapter 2\nStreets are broken up by mushrooms and lichen punching up through scattered cobblestones. Buildings are moldy and dilapidated. Strangely, the spore clouds are less oppressive here, like the eye of a storm, and patches of open sky can be seen above. \nWhen the party arrives to the town of Shroomsville, they find a population of people that have been morphed by their proximity to the strange spores. The dragonborn barkeep has tiny violet mushrooms growing out from between her scales. Whose portrait does she carry around in that locket? She can't quite remember. An elven woman has lichen growing from her skin. Perhaps you'd like to join her for a drink of mushroom tea. \"It makes you see better,\" she says. Maybe it does.\nSeveral locations and characters will allow the players to begin unfurling the mysteries at the heart of this strange town. They must be careful though, as no one person has all the information, and many are not who they appear to be.\nChapter 3 (Spoilers!)\nThe walls of this chamber seem to throb and pulse in rhythm with your heart beat. Tiny spores swarm the air here. They\u2019re pouring like smoke out of a crevice in the ground: the rift.\nThe players have explored the town, and investigated its secrets. The path forward is now clear. The source of the fungal corruption lies deep underground. The caverns are as warped and twisted as the minds of those living above. The players will have to contend with many dangers along the way.\nIn the heart of the caverns lies the players' ultimate goal, as well as their deadliest foe. The dragon Zandreth lies here, guarding an infernal rift. Once a majestic creature, Zandreth has succumbed to the rift's horrible corruption. Will the players be able to reason with him? Or will it be a fight to the death? Either way, their success will depend on two things: the cunning and bravery of the players, and a roll of the dice.\n\nStretch Goals (All Stretch Goals Unlocked!)\nI want Mycelium Madness to be the best it can possibly be. To that end, I have several stretch goals planned that will improve Mycelium Madness further as the campaign gains more support. The best way to help unlock these stretch goals is to share the campaign with your friends and on social media!\n$1,200 - Bigger Print Run (UNLOCKED!)

This faction, complete with NPC\u2019s, items, and story hooks, can be used as a sort of epilogue for Shroomsville, or inserted into any campaign setting. This zine will be included for all backers.\n400 Backers - 5e Mushroom Hunting Bonus Zine (UNLOCKED!) \u201cIntroduction to Mushroom Hunting in the Unterblack and Beyond\u201d is the life\u2019s work of infamous tabaxi druid Smoke Mountain.

I began writing this adventure as part of the Storytelling Collective's 2020 RPG Writer's Workshop. In addition to myself, I am working with three very talented local New Mexican artists:\n\nMax Bode - Interior Art\nClick the image to see more of Max's art\nHiroshi Sutter -  Sticker Design, Enamel Pin Design\nClick the image to see more of Hiroshi's art\nRewards and Add-Ons\nBy backing this project, you are supporting an independent writer and game designer as well as several young, up-and-coming New Mexican artists. In addition, you can snag some super cool rewards, such as...\nThe Book: The adventure is available in two formats. The digital version will be sent out as a tagged pdf, and includes cool extras like printable item cards, player handouts, and high-resolution maps. The physical version will be a high-quality printed booklet. The book will be 6\u201dx9\u201d, about 48 pages, and perfect bound.\nThe Sticker and Enamel Pin: We are creating a limited run, mushroom themed, 1.5\" soft enamel pin designed by Hiroshi Sutter, as well as a Kickstarter-exclusive die-cut sticker. More details for these will be released as the campaign progresses.\nThe Mycelium Madness D20 (Limited to 100): Custom engraved mushroom themed D20 dice crafted by Q Workshop. The design is below, and the colors will be voted on by backers (see update #7 for more info).\nThe Mycelium Madness Handmade 7pc Set (All Gone!): These super-limited sets are completely hand-made by James Harper of Crunch Dice. The dice feature swirls of earthy green and deep burnt orange, and contain fluffy mycelium, fuzzy lichen, and glittering spores. The result is a dice set that perfectly evokes the atmosphere of the spore-choked Fungal Wastes that surround the town of Shroomsville. Each set of dice is poured, sanded, and polished by hand with care and precision for dice that look gorgeous and feel great.\nThe Fungal Dragon Mini (All Gone!): A 3D printed resin miniature of Schlossbauer's incredible fungal dragon design. This is the perfect mini to use for Zandreth the Fungal Dragon when playing through the adventure. The mini stands at about 90 mm, and will be printed in black, grey, or green resin. The fungal dragon mini can be added as an Add-On to any tier that includes a physical book.\nSchlossbauer's Fungal Dragon Model. Click the image to see more of Schlossbauer's work.\nBecome a Character (All Gone!): Amidst the chaos in the town of Shroomsville, a coven of evil witches have laired in the town's midst. The nefarious trio wish to feast upon the nightmares of hapless townsfolk. Using their occult powers, they disguise themselves to better blend in with the town. Who do the witches disguise themselves as? Maybe you! Backers at the Bleeding Tooth Fungus tier will have their likeness (or that of a loved one) drawn into the book as one of these three dastardly villains.\nGame DM'd by the Creator (All Gone!): Backers at the Golden Teacher tier will be treated to a play-through of the adventure by me, the writer of Mycelium Madness. I will run a mini campaign for you and up to four other players. The campaign will take place online over Roll20 or another virtual tabletop, and should last around three sessions. In addition to being the first backers to play Mycelium Madness, each player will receive a digital copy of the adventure and a custom portrait of their character by Max Bode, artist for Mycelium Madness.\n\n\nProduction\nThe writing for the adventure is nearly complete, and is in the process of being edited and polished. I have also commissioned a handful of very talented artists. I'm excited to share what they\u2019ve been working on as the campaign progresses. As the artists finish up their pieces, I will begin the process of laying out the text and images into a beautiful book that will be just as enjoyable for the DM to read through as it will be for the players to experience. Once the layout is created, it\u2019s off to the printers. All digital items will be delivered at this time. Once the printed books arrive to me, I will begin shipping them out to their new homes.\nThe image shows progress bars for the various stages of the project. Writing is at 90%. Editing is at 60%. Art is at 20%. Layout is at 10%. Production is at 10%.\nThis image shows the projected timeline for the project. Art and Writing should be finished by mid-May. Layout should be finished by mid-June. Digital files should be sent out by mid-July, and physical rewards in August.\n\n\nBudget\nThe campaign goal of $550 covers the cost of an initial print run of the book, the cost of shipping those books, all applicable fees and taxes, as well as the cost of paying the artists. Any funds raised over this amount will go towards stretch goals that further improve the physical quality of the book and add even more content.\nThis image shows the breakdown of campaign funds. The largest portion will go to printing the rewards. The next largest portion will go towards paying the artists. Next will be shipping costs, followed by Kickstarter fees and taxes.\nThank you so much for checking out Mycelium Madness! In order for it to become reality, though, we need your help.

A Mature-rated experience.\nSangrde\nHer unique style as an artist helps separate our vision from other JRPGs.\n Story \nTaking place over 30+ hours of gameplay, written for those wishing to be the bad guy from start to finish. Influenced by ideas such as how playing as Magus in Chrono Trigger would influence the world, the gameplay, and the visuals. What would playing as Kefka change for Final Fantasy 6? How would his madness translate into gameplay, allies, playable characters, etc. If you were Ghaleon in Lunar, would it feel different to experience the same story compared to Alex. \nPLAY\n\n                                         Boss Battle Explained with Story Elements\n\n Combat Key Features \n* Designed to always have max characters in combat. Switch between them at ease, use one character for all your Soul Points (Think Action Points from Shin Megami: Digital Devil Saga), or multiple ones to exploit weaknesses or handle various objectives. No character sits at the castle waiting for their turn in your party.\n* JRPG turn-based combat that is created from the ground up recognizing the best and most influential elements of Lunar, Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Shin Megami Tensei, and Final Fantasy Tactics.\n* Two-tier combat flow in which you cannot mash the A button to attack everything and win. Spells are only useable against enemies that have been \"Contaminated\" with Black Dragon blood, requiring creativity and guile on how to use each character appropriately to both infect and exploit the enemy through their fears.\n * Play as Bosses! As a villain, there will be times you corrupt NPCs and monsters to combat enemies, not always Rubin or Lady Death. These will be Boss fights that you have the option to control! (At this time this feature is not meant to be mandatory, but instead offer additional rewards). \n* Multiple Screens of Combat: Fight from Land, Air, and Sea in the Battle System.\n* Fights known as \"Cinematic Encounter\": A battle that will take place over multiple screens and locations, usually reserved for Boss Fights, but not always.\n\nThe Last Supper of the Blood Glutton\n Horror RPG, not Jumpscare RPG \nHorror will be experienced through visuals, activities, and the world around you. The heaviest influence on the horror elements come from Silent Hill. Our philosophy on horror is that we hope for you to think about what you've done or seen after you put the controller down. \nOne of the Many Atrocities You'll Commit: Turning Many Into One\n\n Character Skins  \nBacker-created Bromides, will influence a character's combat abilities and appearance. \n Lucid Soul's music is composed by Nate Combs, featuring Hayley Nelson of Haylizbeth fame on Youtube,  Diwa de Leon of String Player Gamer fame on Youtube, and Lauren Kinkade from Youtube, The combined force is what we hope conveys the world of Trebezia in the proper light, from mysterious depths of forgotten dungeons, to insurmountable battles testing your cunning and tactics. To Nate and myself, nothing is more important in an RPG's experience than the music, and we hope to emulate the memorable nature of the greats. While Diwa's involvement in the project will be a Stretch Goal at first, we've incorporated him in several songs so as to hear the power of his violin and passion.\n\nBefore we get to the music, first a word from the man, the myth, the legend himself, Nate Combs:\nPLAY\n\n Main Character's Theme Song (Featuring Diwa de Leon on Violin) \n Domain of the Drowned Goddess, Hecuba (Featuring Diwa on Violin AND Hayley vocals) \n Battle Against Heroic Bosses (Featuring Diwa on Violin) *in Lucid Soul you will fight monsters, heroes, Rubin and his party, Lady Death and her party, and even Gods and Goddesses. Our goal is to have music which will distinguish each of the types of combat, this one intended for our first boss music against a Grey Paladin named Ashur. \n Rubin Domingo's Theme *in Lucid Soul you'll be making enemies with this young man early in your adventure, albeit not directly. His story is linked tightly to yours, as is those he partners with to thwart you. Eventually you might even have to resort to nefarious deeds involving his sister... \n Erzbet's Theme (Featuring Diwa on Violin and Hayley vocals) \n A Whisper in the Forest of Delusion \n A Tragic Memory \n A Cryptic Invitation \nThe Alpha, The Omega, THE Castle: Wyrmsgate\n Deathtouched... Those cursed with Black Dragon blood in their veins, whether by bonding with one like the Dragon Knights of Lasserburg do by drinking the contents of the whelpling's egg at birth, or by forced feeding of a living dragon. Whatever the method, the very design of the body is altered from the inside out, all organs cease to function normally, and certain powers begin to flood the embiber. \n Some, not all, are horribly corrupted in the process. Some change appearance completely, some lose their sanity like the Ancient Black Dragon, Malganon, did. All are a threat to life, however, as all must feed off the living, through blood and flesh, to live. \n   It's this need to feed that starts our story and tale of Lucid Soul, the Town of Guillen is housing foolhardy humans that decide it's time to return to harvesting the woods around our castle. Silly little things, but how can they not feel comfortable; the world has Grey Paladins with holy powers governing every hamlet, a Priestess of Medina to relay all activities to others of their order, and above all, no fear of what lies outside their walls. \nThis all is about to change...\n Well... for you at least. I make no promises for the others destined to bleed for our Lord's amusement. Hytwart, King of the Goblins, now known as The Enfeebler, the longest living Goblin in history, is a thirsty deviant and it is... after all... our duty to slake his thirst! Elderly, women, children, all are used to feed the ever guzzling gluttony of the Deathtouched. Don't look at me like that, you'll be given an opportunity few others are given: a rare gift... if you survive the trial... A pit both deep and dark... filled with cadavers and meat from ancient raids and conquest.  \n   A singular Black Dragon Egg, relic of the last known nest of the Dark Lady, Umbryss, second concubine to Malganon... shall be your prize. Oh, and we've chosen others to join you in that fetid catacomb buried within our tower... Do bring an appetite, a strong stomach, and a desperate need to survive, by any... means... necessary.\n\nDragons\nThe Ancient Jewel Dragon - Last of his kind - A hidden reward perhaps at the end of the Campaign?\nBlue Dragon Liza Domingo near her son, Rubin\n Dragons have 6 distinct colors and flights: Red, Green, Blue, White, Grey, Black, and Jewel. Through your journey, you'll interact with many of each flight, save the Grey Dragons, as they're all but wiped out, and see just what's become of those infected with Black Dragon blood from the fights of yester year.\n\nGods and Goddesses\nLaurana, Aldaryn, and Medina Statues in the Town of Guillen\n*Hecuba, The Drowned Goddess\nHecuba and a school of her Aquamazons\n  She, how should I put this lightly... has a rather known disdain for men. A sordid affair with another heavenly being and creating An all-female race of Aquamazons will do that to you. It's widely believed that her sister, Laurana, took her by the throat and dove out of the sky with such ferocity and hatred that she strangled her for several years during the descent into the frothy depths of the sea, and confined her there for all eternity unable to ever breath air again. \n Patron Goddess of the Blue Dragons and Aquamazons\n\n*Laurana, Goddess of Love and Beauty\n They say she's a sight to behold, that no earthly creature can match her beauty, charm, or grace. Now I don't particularly judge beauty by anything more than taste, but I can't argue the statues of worship to her paint her as quite the image. It's said she abhors conflict, but most good stories with the Gods sure seem to involve her at the center of it, either fighting 'for' her or 'because' of her. I consider her the Goddess of Ironies, but I've never met her. \n Patron Goddess of the Humans and White Dragons\n\n*Runefaust, God of... actually I'm not sure? Being Laurana's Husband?\n I know him for only 2 stories, being the husband of the Goddess, Laurana, and for the creation of his brother, Charnel's, physique. I forget the finer details, but they were fighting over something or another, as you do, and his anger and fury escalated to such a degree that he slammed his brother's face into a volcano for so many moons and seasons that the poor God's face actually melted off permanently to expose an ever-flaming skull. Now that's hate! Come to think of it... why are the only stories I know about Runefaust and Laurana that they're married and both committed horrific acts upon their siblings? \n...Oh that's right... Justice. That's what he's known for. I think?\n Patron God of Green Dragons\n\n*Charnel, God of War, Flame, and Healing\n This is one God I can get behind, as I'm a bit fond of the broken and beaten. I can only imagine having my face pressed into a volcano until you start thinking about how to get your vengeance. This God, however, is notoriously calm and rational, despite his suffering and battle scars. Horrible disfigurement is a guaranteed quality among those that worship him. I'm not sure his divine powers are worthwhile though, in order to attain them you need to undergo the Ordeal of Flame, and douse yourself head to toe in oil-fueled fire. I don't consider myself vain but, even I would like to have an arm or two and both eyeballs intact by the end of the day.\n Patron God of the Ithra and Red Dragons\n\n*Aldaryn, The Allfather, the Maimed God, God of Creation\n All I know of Aldaryn is that his prophet is merely a stump of a man; immobile, tongueless, eyeless, and limbless. From his position down to their Grey Paladins, everyone sacrifices some portion of their body, and to rise  through the ranks you offer more and more. The less of you there is, the closer to the God you become, or so they say. The military are well known to be eunuchs.  Oh, one other quirky thing of note: a Grey Dragon is hatched with a part of its body missing or maimed as well. \n Patron God of the World and Grey Dragons\n\n*Medina, Goddess of Fate\nPriestess of Medina\n   Never represented as anything more than a young teen at most. The Goddess is known to be blind, but they say she has one green eye and one red eye; something I heard from a man who knew a woman who knew an uncle that slept with a loose-tongued Priestess of hers. One eye sees only the future, and the other eye sees only the past. The Priestesses, like this Goddess, must always wear a blindfold, and part of their commitment and devotion to her is that they must remove their own eyes, becoming a hive vision through a single thread they put into that blindfold, sending sights to others in their order. \n   Not a patron to any known race or Dragon\n\n*Luta, Goddess of Wisdom and Magic\n I'm not exactly a fan of the slow-moving Lutarians, or their preachy aloof nature. When Malganon's attack ended, they continued as they always had, isolated and separated from the world. The few Lutarians that take their pilgrimage in pairs to witness and record the outside around them don't talk much about the Goddess, favorable or ill. She is known as a female, but under thick robes and a hood, could be a beast and we'd never know it. Come to think of it, I just realized.... Luta... Lutaria... Lutarian... what a vainglorious bitch of a Goddess she is! \n Patron Goddess of Lutarians and Jewel Dragons\n *Side note, Lutarians killed all the Jewel Dragons\n\n*Exodus, God of Death, Madness, Hardship, Strife, Discord, Bickering, Controversy, Depression, Depravity... you get the gist\n   At one time, this God was only known for death. Malganon sort of... changed that a bit, little skew to the far side of what \"Death\" means in our world. Now anytime you think of destruction or a mental illness, Exodus is immediately its patron saint and cause. In lieu of his Black Dragon's little tantrum that reduced much of the world to a blazing inferno of corruption, most statues, if any, that used to pay homage to him are destroyed.\n Patron of Black Dragons... and little else now\n\n Trebezia, the World Around You \n* Humans\nDuke Rachon of the Dragon Knights\n Grey Paladins, Dragon Knights of Lasserburg, Republic of Laurana. These 3 factions in the world will affect your experience the most, as 2 of these groups have become peace keepers against the corrupted blood abominations left behind by the Malganon Wars. What do I hate about the humans? I could call them entitled brats who don't leave the tits of the Goddess Laurana long enough to be killed one at a time... A bit like cockroaches in numbers... but luckily for us... I find them the best tasting of all the races...\n Tastiness Factor, 10/10\n\n* Ithra\n So get this... A desert people who don't identify as humans because they feel they're more children of the God of War, Charnel, the Flaming Skull. Fine fine, I call you 'dinner' but we won't quibble over semantics... Capable of an ancient technique called the \"Fingers of Death.\" If you believe them, it's said they can kill you simply by pointing at you... I believe only one being in this world is capable of that: Synella, and only after she's filled that diaper of hers and points at you to recognize the odious death that's impending.  Oh! Right! The best part... So get this, in their culture, women aren't allowed to be assassins, but they're trained for athletic combat to hone their bodies for, dun dun DUN, breeding!  Don't look at me like that...\n\n*Lutarians\nOne of only two Lutarians I've ever met... *Side note, zero desire to meet more\n Those long ears aren't simply for gripping onto and doing the dirty work of breeding, oh no... actually I'm not even sure if they DO breed... I mean they must but... well one aspect of this fanciful race aside from being taller and thinner than all others, is that they're hairless and slow due to their blood density; is that two aspects?  Wick keeps her ears hidden under that massive hat of hers, but I've seen them a time or two. When born, a Lutarian has a primal element infused into their DNA, altering the hue of their flesh, and determining the magic they're capable of. Our Wick, for example, was born a Fire Lutarian, giving her blood a unique mix of Black Dragon with Fire, and creating the Shadowflame user you see before you. The world calls them patient, but honestly, I call them boring. \n\n* Goblins\n Despite their size, this race is whole-souled on war. Built like roided tiny soldiers of pure fury and muscle, they were once protectors of the world, until Malganon manipulated Hytwart into making them little more than pawns in a global game of death and destruction. Call it a quirk of their creator, or an unnecessary function, but there are no female Goblins... instead Goblins are made from the Spawning Pools around Castle Wyrmsgate. Our King, Hytwart, The Enfeebler, is a Goblin that survived this process in a most unusual fashion. But that's for you to find out...\n\n* Fae\n The adorable all-female race of winged fairykind. One of Malganon's first acts of insanity that, to this day, was considered the catalyst for the maddening, was during a routine diplomatic visit. Now I can't say for sure, wasn't there after all, but the rumor around the castle is, he managed to secure a private audience with their queen, Jolyanna. How or why isn't known, but be certain, the aftermath is. He plucked that beautiful little empress' wings and limbs one at a time until only pieces of her mystical form were left, and he presented them to all, pinning her severed remains to many trees. It's an act no one forgets. Now a Dragon and their Knight are tied by blood to one another, so I've no clue how Malganon managed to subdue Darhyn, but his death was considered even more elaborate. As you may or may not know, Dragons can assume human form at will, before the Gods cursed the Black ones to never be able to 'leave' their human form. I've a suspicion that curse relates to how Malganon disposed of his former master. I'll spare the details of 'how' he gained entrance into the Knight's backside, but once within he made sure to parade him around as a puppet for those gathered by providing another, more obscene spectacle. He transformed during the act, and, well, not to put a fine graphic point on it, exploded the poor helpless human in a shower of gore the likes of which  stain the imagination. Any wonder the Fae hate us?  \n\n*Aquamazons \nDive into the Oceans of Trebezia - Hecuba's Domain\n They don't bother us, and we don't bother them. Never seen one and doubt we ever will. Fish girls aren't really my thing anyway.\n *Side note, known to have a giant fish's tail grafted to the back of their skull, allowing them to swim extraordinarily fast. Since I'm not a great swimmer I doubt I'll ever taste one. If I do, boiling and buttering might be in order.\n *Side note 2, Creep has the likeness of a horribly disfigured one, mutilated beyond recognition, then reconstructed. Will consult The Fleshweaver if such a thing is possible.\n *Side note 3, picturing Creep as even a relative reminds me, if I ever encounter one, never put any part of my body near one of their mouths. I've no desire to join the Grey Paladins as a eunuch.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nExample of Giving the Town of Guillen to Lucretia, the Spider Broodmother\n One of the many ways you'll progress your characters, is after conquering a town or city, you'll have the option of leaving it in the hands of one of the main characters. The above is an example if you leave the Town of Guillen in the hands of Lucretia. When you visit the town again, the visuals will reflect her rule, as you can see a hint of what happens at the town's shrine.\nInfamy Meter\n Infamy is the experience you'll receive as you win battles and perform certain tasks around the world. It will increase the potency of all your Dragon Powers, allow you more Soul Points, and possibly affect many other things in the world around you. \nBromide Examples from Lucid Soul's Art Contest Entries!\n Bromides are Equipable skins that will alter the appearance of your characters, as shown here by our contest winners. They will be able to equip in 2 ways... the Attributes of the Bromide, affecting combat, and the Visual of the Bromide, affecting the appearance. This will allow players the freedom to look how they want but function how they wish as well.\nSouls - Currency and Equippables\n\n\n\n\nYour Character Will Physically Appear (Or non-physically, as it were) As a Haunt in Castle Wyrmsgate\nYou will create an Equipable Icon to represent your Soul\nPoster of Lucretia in front of Castle Wyrmsgate\nAugustinas Raginskis Red Dragon Tier Commission Examples\nSangrde's Red Dragon Tier Commission Examples\nZeitDieb's Red Dragon Tier Commission Examples\n Villain Protagonist stories, written ground up as the one doing evil in the world. To me personally, this is one step that I hope many others wish to see, in which villain protagonists, can be just as compelling or memorable RPG characters as heroes. Morale systems have been around for many years, Undertale a recent example, Knights of the Old Republic, Fable, etc. But what in our opinion has always been lacking, is that these stories are written fundamentally as a hero's journey, with options to be a bastard or kill people sprinkled in. Death to us, is only a means to an end, when it comes to being evil. That is why we hope Kickstarter feels the project is worthy in their eyes, to provide a story that, to our knowledge, doesn't exist in the JRPG world. This is a game dedicated to those of us who got Magus in our party in Chrono Trigger, and just wanted more of him, his story, his badassery. To those of us who wanted a mod to let Cloud wield the Masamune in FF7, while doing more along the lines of Sephiroth (finally answering how he managed to kill that Midgar Zolom by himself). Games like Overlord exist, but they choose the route of cartoony vs maturity. How would a villain see the world, how would a villain interact with it, what would his motives be, and how would he progress to make his journey interesting. This is why we seek you, Kickstarter, each and every fantasy gamer who feels there's a little villainy scratch that craves to be itched. Thank you again so very, very much for making it to this point in our campaign, and don't hesitate to ask any questions as they come up! \nExpenses of Lucid Soul / Where the money will go / Erzbet's Edited Chart", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA moment of sincerity,\nAs this is my first Kickstarter, and my team is putting their faith in me to coordinate and succeed on this project, I feel the best possible way to prove my intent, and reduce the risk to anyone who backs Lucid Soul, is to take accountability on a personal level. I will not be using an LLC or company name to divert any finance to, this will be a complete and utter stake on my personal honor, livelihood, and integrity, to earn respect from the community by providing a finished product the likes of which we saw with Blizzard of yester-year. Delays should be communicated to the backers and fans, but above all, respect of the trust and faith everyone interested in this game has shown to me.

Bird-folk rule in a shaky balance of power between the Aarakocra\u2019s military/agricomplex and the Kenku\u2019s numerological predictive magics. Under the bird-folk, the land-bound races scramble for survival amidst a Pittsburgh that has crumbled and been remade more times than anyone can remember. A troll under every bridge, a danger over every hill, and a mystery at the black and gold heart of the city. Welcome to Blackvale...\n Ok but what is this?\nBlackvale is a campaign setting made for D&D 5e. The zine includes the political powers of Blackvale, religious history, a map of Blackvale, and fully detailed sheets for the major NPCs and relics. It's set in real-world geography, with reference to real-world history, playing with how magic and time might shift the meanings of class, industry, and technology.\n The Powers of Blackvale\nThe Kenku Numerologist and Aarakocra Army hold Blackvale in their talons\n\nThe Aarakocra Military Agricultural Complex- ages ago, the Aarakocra arrived in Blackvale, which they say was a ruin. With their magic and might, they \u201csettled\u201d the land, making it \u201csafe\u201d for land-bound races to live and work. In exchange for the protection of the Aarakocra, the peoples of Blackvale agreed to work the mines for them, and offered their children up to be mages to serve them.\nThe Kenku Prescients- The Kenku are the second pillar of power in Blackvale. They can\u2019t fly, but they have powerful magics that let them see far into the past, present, and future. The Kenku resent their winged cousins and regard the non-birdfolk with condescension. \n\nThe Congress of Trolls- Every bridge in the city is held by a Troll, some only a decade old, others hundreds of years old. They answer only to the Troll Congress, a gathering of the trolls, goblins, and humanoids they command. When people fall through the cracks of society, the trolls will teach them little magics to survive.\nThe Church of Ayn- The Church of Ayn worships strength, individuality, self-possession, self-sufficiency, self-actualization, even self-creation. The Church awaits the prophesied Self Made Man, and any leader in the church must claim to be him. To pass through an area held by a Church of Ayn is to expose yourself to robbery, capture, or death.\nThe Neighborhood of Saint Roger in Friendship- The largest safe place for humanoids in the city is the Neighborhood. It was established by clerics of the god St. Roger, who welcomed all to live as neighbors. Now it is protected by brave warriors and priests and is given a measure of self-governance under the Birdfolk.  The Neighbors can extend shelter and kindness, but never too much too fast, or they would be seen as a threat to the birdfolk, and punished.\n  A Taste of Blackvale\nShortbeak, Kenku Speaker and Talent Scout\n  Shortbeak is the walking embodiment of cunning. He is intelligent and accomplished. He is the most well-known of all Kenku, acting as their ambassador to the peoples of the valley. He is enjoyed by some, feared by more. He walks the streets maintaining relations, predicting weather and crop growth for the people, and bringing in new mages for the ranks of the Kenku Numerologists. He usually travels with an entourage of young numerologists, people hooded so deeply that their faces can\u2019t be seen, and Kenku battle-trancers.\nThe Lost Kenku Eye\nWhen adventurers gain a bit of fame, it's never long before the Birdfolk come 'round asking for favors, or worse, offering them. Shortbeak has asked you to retrieve a mysterious eye that he believes is currently held by a shady woman that the locals just call \"Little Sister\", who lives alone in the north hills. How could a person survive alone beyond the watchful eyes of the birdfolk?\n\n The Lay of the Land\nStretch Goals\nAt 1k, we get to rolling and you get to enter Blackvale/Pittsburgh as it has always truly been.\n4K- All backers will receive a SECOND PDF zine, The Church of Ayn and the Aspirant Kings. This zine will detail out the lives, triumphs, and dangers of the adherents of the Church of Ayn and their brutal religion of the self. If you want to fight GWAR mixed with Mad Max villains mixed with horrible moral objectivism, let's get this bad boy to 4k.\n???-???\n???-???\nWho's making this?\nVILLINI is a small, Pittsburgh-based operation making games and accessories for them. 20 years of RPGs, 15 years of Pittsburgh. Something is definitely haunted in Western PA, and it's always been fun to try to imagine what it was. Making real places into fantasy settings is fun for everyone. If you've ever thought about which kinds of fey live in your neighborhood or debated whether your boss had low Int, Wis, or just low Cha, Blackvale will feel familiar to you.\nHaunted Meat makes comix, zines, games, patches & other dank swag for dungeon punks. They'll be contributing insert art and worldbuilding on our stretch goals.\nsome dope ass Haunted Meat stylings that will stink up this zine\nExalted Funeral (your online home for weird literature including indie RPGs, heavy metal zines, and occult texts) will handle fulfillment, so please do direct all of your important, non-bird-supremacy-related questions to them. Speaking of which, let's talk about...\n\nShipping!\nDomestic Shipping & Handling will differ by tier, but it'll work out to around $4 - $5 per physical zine. You'll sort this all out in pledgemanager after the campaign. \n\nBetween COVID and Brexit and who-knows-what's-coming-next, International shipping is currently obstacle-ridden and outta-whack. We hope that things will be moving more smoothly by the time that Blackvale is printed.

It's because mythical beasts still rove the lands outside the city. But what are these beasts? So I'm developing some monsters, called either Carnechimera or Monchimera (not sure on which name). They're chimeras (of course), with one head of an Appalachian animal, like a buck or a black bear or coyote, and one head of a dinosaur skeleton from the Carnegie Museum, and one \"head\" that's abandoned drilling/excavation/construction equipment. I wish I could include sound in the zine, because the sound of something that roars, rattles, and squeals like grinding steel would make a dope noise. For ease of play, I think I'll just make the heads based on a table, so you can roll to create a monchimera, but I also REALLY like the idea of a sort of Shadow of the Colossus styled 10 Great Monchimera, each one with a unique ability. Breath weapons on these guys? Unsure. If anything,  I think they'll puke some kind of cursed frack-slurry? Or even just mud to encumber opponents?

THESE ARE AN ADD ON OPTION. \n As of the creation of this campaign, the page count is well over 200 pages. \nBUCKSKIN SUMMONING SCROLLS ARE NOW UNLOCKED!\nPLEASE KEEP READING, ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED...\nPLAY\n\n\n\nI started gaming in the early 80's, and I'm pretty sure I started at a way too early age. By the time my friends and I got a handle on how to actually play the game of D&D, the Satanic Panic had hit.  And so like a lot of young players, into a box in the basement my books went, for fear that I might make a pact with the devil with just a simple roll of a D20.\nThe fan-art based books that I create are the types of tomes that I would have loved to have had as peripherals as a young player, and even now more than ever.  I want to create something that makes the game more immersive and cater to the individual player, such as the illustrated spellbooks that are almost at completion for the 8 schools of magic.  (Back issues can be found here -  PhilStoneIllustrations )\nWhich brings me to The Demonology of Lire Goest. \nArtistically, this grimoire is modeled after several books from the past, most notably, The Demonology of King James the 1st (who actually coined the term Demonology), The Grand Grimoire, and The Lesser Keys of Solomon.\nThere are 3 to 5 pages for each named demon or creature complete with stats from either 3.5 or 5e.  There is also a summoning spell and sigil should the Dungeon Master or player decide to make things more interesting during the game.  A personal grimoire is added at the back for your own inscriptions and conversions.\nLire Goest was evil to the point of insanity.  His personal recordings while travelling through the abyss have been recorded on the living skins of the residents of Eastbourne, only to be flayed off the carcass to be used as summoning scrolls for later use.  Lire Goest desired power and infamy.  This is the one and only recorded tome of his existence, his interplanar travels, and his diabolical magic.  It has been so extensive, that two volumes had to be created.\nWHAT IS THIS BOOK, AND WHY IS THERE NO PDF??????\nNo, there is no PDF version of this book.  It is not formatted as a quick reference piece.  It is a grimoire to haunt your bookshelf.  Although there are stats and what not for each summoned demon,  it is not like my spellbooks (which will always have a PDF) where one can pull up something on the fly.  No, I want you to be able to touch it, peruse it, experience it.  This is how I always wanted a Necromantic tome to be.  I want you to hold it, show it off.  I started these projects as immersive peripheral props to be the character that you play.  There are summoning circles, protection wards for those who are summoned, and one hell of a backstory to the most infamous necromancer who started this grimoire.  \nThe Demon List for Vol. 1\nAdaru, Alkilith, Armanite, Babau, Balor, Baphomet, Barlgura, Bebilith, Bulezau, Carnage, Charon, Chasme, Demogorgon, Demonthorn Mandrake, Destrachan, Draegloth, Draudnu, Dretch, Evistro, Fraz-urb'luu, Gadaacro, Glabrezu, Goristro, Graz'zt, Hezrou\n\nSUMMONING SCROLLS\nAt 5k I will unlock the ability to pledge for the one of a kind buckskin scrolls.

By burning designs into traditional brain-tanned buckskin, he sculpts the leather into a three-dimensional relief that brings the images to life! Any color added is done with natural pigments, applied with bone tools.\nScrolls:\nSize- The scrolls are roughly 11x17\u201d in size, but may vary depending on the specific design. Each is one-of-a-kind, and some may have additional pieces attached to them.\nWeight- Roughly 4oz\nTurnaround- Assuming all materials are on hand (quality buckskin can be difficult to acquire), a scroll can take many hours to create, and probably up to 2 weeks per scroll.\nPrice- Each scroll is a 450.00 pledge plus shipping.\nThe scrolls WILL NOT go into production until the money has been collected from Kickstarter. Regular updates will be given as scroll production is ongoing.\nPLAY\n\nAt 10k, we will unlock PRINTS of the scrolls.\nScroll prints are 11 x 17\nEach print is a 20.00 pledge plus shipping\nExample of scroll print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge is not being funded\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hardcover Leatherette copy of the book", "descp": "Get a hardcover, leatherette bound, and foil stamped cover version of the Demonology Grimoire.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["138 backers", "Add-ons"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Enchantment spellbook is live and more!", "update_content": "The feedback through messages and comments for this book have been amazing, and for that I want to thank you all!

There's always that weird noble, right? The one that insists on wearing some obscure scent, or only eats pastries, or refuses to travel without their own carriage, or keeps rust monsters as pets. Eccentric people like Lady Philomina\u2014who keeps rust monsters as pets.

Let's take a quick peek inside!\nOne-page adventures are short and to the point. As an exercise in writing economy, they are distilled down to the very basics. Monsters and NPCs always use standard stat blocks referenced in bold (the usual 5E style), and area descriptions are kept to the bare minimum. \nFor example, Two-Lips' farm in the The Business of Emotion is described thusly: \"Flower fields and a small farmhouse. TWO-LIPS, a gnome noble, directs a crew of six gnome commoners.\"\nThe wonderful writers and designers whose works inspired these One-Page Adventures include Jeff Gomez, Jen Tracy, Aaron Infante-Levey, Nick Cramp, Paul Oklesh, Jacob Gobhar, William Fischer, Kiel Chenier, Esper, Charlie Brooks, Kyle Carty, Cole Grandel, Greg Pest, John Karatovic, Tyler Omichinski, Jim Miles, Chris Rippee, Andrew Engelbrite, Will Gawned, and Jensen Toperzer.\nThere's cartography by Dyson Logos, and art from Claudio Pozas, Phil Stone, Jen Tracy, Sade, Savage Mojo, Ellis Goodson, Xanditz, Rick Hershey, Marcel Budd, Herman Lau, IgorNP, Alba Palacio, Indi Martin, Guilherme Sommermeyer, and Melissa Tillery. \nMost of these adventures are converted from longer adventures I have commissioned from other writers elsewhere (you can see the original creator of each at the bottom of the adventure). The layout is my own work, as is the conversion and distillation. \nNot persuaded yet? Here's one of the 25 adventures. For free!\nThis is the 8th in this series of mini-quickstarters.

With new weapon properties, the new Fisticuffs fighting style, and two new spells, designer Josh Gentry will have your characters brawling in the taverns!

However, due to the use of game settings owned by other publishers, none of these works could be published and brought to the public as a standalone adventure. When Storm Bunny Studios licensed The Game Academy full rights to create and publish within the World of Alessia, they also granted us the opportunity to develop the content for one of Alessia's main continents, Shiran. When presented with this land of verdant forests, frozen tundra, a barrier mountain range, and the frozen wasteland of The Vastness, The Game Academy fell in love and got straight to work. While we are being intentionally vague about the plot of our story (we don't want to ruin it for anyone who desires to play), we will give you a teaser of what you might expect. \nOur story is one that can only happen in Shiran and playing through this adventure will introduce players not only to the land of Shiran but also to its people. The adventure begins in Kulg, a city of contradictions standing firm against the elements on the edge of civilization, protecting its traditions, and preserving its future. Anomalous data readings collected by several factions in Kulg, bring the players together to investigate the source of the readings, and to report back on what they find. \nThe party must navigate their way through The Vastness and find the source of this strange data, so they appeal to a spiritual sect of weaseling Shangpa known as the Seekers of the Sacred Way. This troupe accompanies wayward travelers through The Vastness and strive to keep them safe through the land of ice, snow, and ravaging shard storms. Along the journey, the party has opportunities to meet many people who inhabit Northern Shiran and the reaches of The Vastness. They may find members of an Ancient Order of dwarves given the charge to protect the crystal caves which broach the planet\u2019s magical ley line network. They may happen upon a society of rabbit folk called the \u2018Jir\u2019 who inhabit the belly of giant megafauna that roam The Vastness. Their paths may cross an infamous group of drifter and dasher pilots known as the Frigid Flyers who rove The Vastness and claim it as their home. The adventurers must expect the unexpected while they seek causes to mysterious happenings in a region that few survive, and even fewer understand. What will happen, what will they find, and what does it all mean?\n\nWelcome to Scourge of Shiran.\nScourge of Shiran is an adventure written by The Game Academy, set in the World of Alessia, a 5e-compatible (and soon to be Starfinder) game setting published by Storm Bunny Studios. Scourge of Shiran is the published version of one of four summer adventures to be featured in The Game Academy's 2021 Adventure Gaming Summer Camp. The adventure is designed to be played over 5 to 6 four-hour game sessions with provided 3rd level characters and taking the characters through 5th level. \nThe final published adventure book will be 96 pages for our standard edition, and 120 pages for our special educator's edition, which will feature educational sidebars and call-outs for integrating the events in the adventure with real-world academic STEM subjects. Along with the educator's edition, we are also publishing an accompanying 96-page student workbook for student players to track their progress through the adventure, as well as record their reflections on the educational aspects of the game, and answers to related puzzles and exercises created to blend perfectly between the game and the classroom.\nAlong with our internal staff, and in partnership with Storm Bunny Studios, we are fortunate to include a cadre of RPG superstar writers and developers taking our project into the A-level game. Here's a peek at our epic team of heroes...\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for the Scourge of Shiran Adventure \u2013 an educationally themed space fantasy adventure set in the World of Alessia. Designed for the 5th edition of the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game, this adventure takes player characters out into the Vastness, a dangerous northern wasteland where an alien threat slowly spreads\u2026\nSet exclusively in the World of Alessia Campaign Setting, this collaboration pairs The Game Academy\u2019s organizational goals with Storm Bunny Studio\u2019s vision for Alessia, creating an immersive adventure that teaches while entertaining.\nWhile all good adventures distract us, the Scourge of Shiran Adventure entertains while encouraging communication, collaborative problem-solving, and divergent thinking.\nThis adventure combines top-level writing from a host of industry RPG authors with educational pedagogy and social awareness, creating a tool that educators can use in an academic setting that encourages positive and constructive behavior.\nUsing classic themes adjusted for today\u2019s age, this adventure empowers the heroes to change their environment, the Vastness, and with it, the world.  \n\n Born from the combined vision of game designers Jere Manninen and Jaye Sonia, the World of Alessia is a futuristic utopia whose native y\u00f6kai mingle peacefully with dozens of alien species of which are carefully protected by the divinely crafted Rings of Heaven.\nWith all its advantages, Alessia remains a place filled with threats \u2013 both inside and out. While its Rings of Heaven keep outside invaders unable to penetrate the planet in force, smaller assaults remain a constant threat to the people below.\nAlessia is a rich setting that focuses on the heroic, mixing elements of Wuxia with science fiction to create an alternate, non-human centric campaign setting that encourages the heroic alongside the inquisitive.\nA Different Approach to Conflict Resolution\nAlthough the World of Alessia has many of the same problems of any modern society, the historical struggles of Alessia\u2019s proud y\u00f6kai and their alien allies have given rise to a truly wondrous future \u2013 a future worth defending.\nAlessia\u2019s cultural norms, especially in places like the Empire of Xian and the Free Cities of Shiran, encourage and practice de-escalation techniques whenever possible; in places where the Empire\u2019s Peacekeepers hold the front, this is doubly important.\nEvery encounter in the Scourge of Shiran Adventure has been carefully tailored to showcase the many non-violent solutions available to heroes while still giving the players opportunities to take action when necessary.  \nWorld of Alessia 5e Primer Version on SALE (334 pages)\nWe at The Game Academy (TGA) are a 501(c)3 educational non-profit organization committed to the social, emotional, and academic success of learners of all ages through the use of tabletop role-playing games and live-action role-play. We provide collaborative storytelling experiences that encourage academic and social/emotional skills in youth ages 8-18 and adults through our innovative enrichment classes, summer camps, and custom made curricula for educators.\nWhile we are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, we have been working with educators across the country to accomplish our mission since our inception in 2016. Our staff has worked in education and educational gaming since the early 2000s.  \n Storm Bunny Studios is a small, Wisconsin-based tabletop roleplaying game company that publishes several campaign settings, including the Rhune: Dawn of Twilight Campaign Setting, Mike Myler\u2019s Mists of Akuma, and the World of Alessia Campaign Setting, in which the Scourge of Shiran Adventure takes place.\nFounded in 2012 by author Jaye Sonia, Storm Bunny Studios has maintained an informal relationship with The Game Academy since 2016. They are excited to be officially teaming up to create some world-changing content.  \n\n\nThe Game Academy has served children and adults through their various programs since 2016, continuing the work that the founders Joshua Archer and Bert Holcomb were doing for at least 5 years previously under Iocari Games. In founding The Game Academy, Joshua and Bert adopted a new mandate to bring professional educational tabletop role-playing games to a wider audience, including the underrepresented, economically disadvantaged, and at-risk youth who would not afford the programs run under a for-profit model. TGA operates under the principle of never turning away a child from their programs due to economic hardship. At any given time, 30% or more of the participants are on a partial or full scholarship. \nWith their year-round Enrichment Gaming Program (EGP), Adventure Gaming Summer Camp (AGSC), Winter and Spring Break mini-camps, and their Game Master Training and Certification Program (GMTP), The Game Academy has served over two hundred individual children and adults during their four years of operation, with concurrent enrollment reaching over 100 students at its peak.\nThrough their various programs and offerings, The Game Academy has become a community of participants and their families that supports each member with a safe environment in which they place their trust and find belonging. Over a third of the programs' participants have some type of physical, emotional, or intellectual challenge, which the TGA staff are equipped and prepared to support through normalization and open communication. Every participant has an opportunity to find belonging and support, from which they can build confidence, trust, and deep relationships.\nThe Game Academy has also worked with school systems to create game-based learning units for the classroom. One engagement was a year-long adaptation of a high school Spanish class into a live-action role-play focusing on real-world skills and practices pertaining to life after high school. Another engagement was a ten-day middle school unit educating the class on the American Industrial Revolution. Both projects were well-received and increased motivation and engagement in the materials of the class.\nWhen our nation experienced the shutdown in March 2020, The Game Academy made a hard pivot from in-person classes to an entirely online delivery model within a matter of weeks. We were able to continue our programs with most of our students, and consequently able to retain most of our staff. Through this new model, TGA has been able to reach new populations that live in diverse and remote locations and provide gaming sessions for adults, which offer relief from social isolation and general anxiety experienced as a consequence of living through a pandemic.\nIn many cases, The Game Academy has shown resilience, resourcefulness, and flexibility that has allowed them to continue to serve their community's needs and thrive in times that have been less than ideal. TGA is adept at identifying advantages in times of hardship and strives to provide its community with top-quality educational and entertaining experiences. TGA views the collaboration with Storm Bunny Studios, through The World of Alessia, as a significant advantage in addressing the inequities and social stresses of our current age through the defense and development of a utopian society.  \n\nADD-ONS\nWe have a few add-ons available for those wishing to show further support to our project and to educators.\n$10 - Gift a PDF copy to a qualified educator.\nWe strive to get Scourge of Shiran into as many educators' hands as possible, and with your generosity, we can make this a reality. Pledge an extra $10 and we will give a PDF copy of the Scourge of Shiran to a qualified educator - of your choice, or our own.\n\n$25 - Get your very own  Master Tenzin Tee!\nShow your support for Scourge of Shiran by wearing this high-quality Tee with Master Tenzin\nWhile we will be releasing Scourge of Shiran in October 2021, show your support early by wearing this finely-crafted tee-shirt printed with Master Tenzin on the front. With Master Tenzin, you will never lose your way.\nThe Game Academy and Storm Bunny Studios view our collaboration on Scourge of Shiran as an opportunity to bring educational pedagogy and creative excellence together and produce a top-notch adventure that will be useful in the classroom as well as exciting to play for all.\nAs a non-profit, The Game Academy focuses on the combined good we can do through this project. Fortunately, Storm Bunny Studios shares our values and is excited to work with us on a series of adventures that bring together the industry's best talent and challenge assumptions, introduce scientific concepts, and educate in critical and divergent thinking. Scourge of Shiran serves as our first collaboration of many to come.\nPart of the good we are celebrating in our project is the bringing together of talented writers, designers, artists, and educational experts and collaborating with them on a project of value and principle. We are also committed to putting as much of the operating budget as we can afford into paying our contributors as well as we are capable.\nWe are also committed to providing Scourge of Shiran to educators at as close to production costs as possible. Our launch on Giving Tuesday is an opportunity for early bidders to secure a free copy of Scourge of Shiran to verified educators and moving beyond the launch, we are providing an educator package that will equip them with everything they need to run a successful campaign for their students at a fraction of the retail cost. Each contribution to our project includes an offset amount that pays to supply verified educators with our products for free or at cost.\nDeliverables\nScourge of Shiran (Standard and Educator\u2019s Editions)\n We aim to deliver Scourge of Shiran in October of 2021, avoiding the possibility of spoiling the adventure for the participants in The Game Academy\u2019s Adventure Gaming Summer Camp 2021. We are producing this 120-page adventure with a standard edition as well as an educator\u2019s edition. The educator\u2019s edition will add call-outs and references to educational standards met and individual educational units that tie into the story's plot.\nScourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide\nBefore this, however, we aim to produce and release a Scourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide, which will provide backers with an exciting preview of the things to come in the main adventure. The Scourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide will contain character backgrounds, example characters, extra art, new character classes and options, and details on factions found in Shiran.\nScourge of Shiran Student Workbook\nAlong with the release of the Educator\u2019s Edition of Scourge of Shiran, we will also be releasing a 96-page 7\u201d x 9\u201d Student Workbook. In this elegant workbook, students will:\nTrack their characters statistics, experience, and possessions,\nWrite their character\u2019s backstories and motivations.\nTrack their character\u2019s progress through the adventure,\nTake notes, observations, and reflections, and\nRecord answers to surrogate puzzles and academic word problems used in bridging the content of the adventure and related classwork.\n$20k - Racing The Wind\nOnce we reach the $20k mark, we will produce a 24-page 1st-level Adventure in Shiran - Racing The Wind, to be delivered to all backers at $20 or more as PDF, and for all backers of $40 and more as a softcover print. Racing the Wind features the beast riders of Shiran and introduces many of the factions and locations in the lands below the Vastness.\n$25k - Finding the Sacred Way\nOnce we reach the $25k mark, we will open the \u201cSeeker of the Sacred Way\u201d pledge level. Backers at this level will receive all the perks of the \u2018Shadow Operative\u201d pledge level and will also be enrolled in The Game Academy\u2019s Game Master Training and Certification program\u2019s GMT 101 - Fundamentals of Game Mastery. On successful completion, they will receive a beautifully illustrated and signed certificate commemorating the course's completion.\nOn top of these rewards to you, you will also enable us to pay our writers & artists at a  higher rate. The Game Academy puts human value above all else and is happy to increase the rate for our talented and skillful writers and artists. \nTimes are difficult right now, and we\u2019re doing what we can to help creatives stay employed as creatives. In this way, we are doing our part to support the artists who feed our souls and who also are struggling to survive through the pandemic.\n$30k - Mastering the Vastness\nOnce we reach the $30k mark, we will launch the \u201cMaster of the Vastness\u201d pledge level. Backers at this level will receive all the perks of the \u2018Shadow Operative\u2019 pledge level and will also be enrolled in The Game Academy\u2019s complete Game Master Training and Certification program. Currently, the program consists of four classes: GMT 101 - Fundamentals of Game Mastery, GMT 220 - Storytelling for Interactive Media, GMT 330 - Adventure Production, and GMT 350 - Adventure Publication.\nOn top of these rewards to you, you will also enable us to pay our writers & artists a yet higher rate. The Game Academy puts human value above all else and is happy to increase the rate for our talented and skillful writers and artists.\n$40k - Starfinder RPG Edition\nAt reaching the $40k mark in pledges, we will publish a version of Scourge of Shiran compatible with Starfinder RPG. This will be for both the standard and the education editions.\n$50k - Increasing the Educational Power\nAt reaching the $50k mark in pledges, we will expand the size and scope of our student workbooks from 96 pages to 192 pages, including actual suggested standards-aligned STEM-based problems and experiments at different grade levels to include in your classroom or homeschool work, which mirrors the activities that your students' characters will be experiencing in the adventure itself.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is The Game Academy\u2019s first Kickstarter, but our risks are mitigated by a number of factors, including our own experience writing over 30 large-scale adventures over the last 6 years of our Adventure Gaming Summer Camp, as well as our superior choice of partners in this project. \n\nWe are working in close collaboration with Storm Bunny Studios, who have run and successfully managed 6 different Kickstarter projects. Our creative collaborators are professional writers and artists known for their skill and their reliability, some having worked for established companies such as Wizards of the Coast and Paizo for over twenty years. Additionally, because of our partnership, we will be starting this project with a large asset library which will reduce costs and expedite delivery.\n\nFurthermore, our parallel internal commitment to developing and releasing this adventure in time for our 2021 summer camp season guarantees that we are going to complete the story in plenty of time before we release in October 2021.

So terrible was its might, so bottomless its depravity, that it would lay siege to the very Gates of Heaven! Greatest of them all was Uyu-Yadmogh, First among Princes, Devourer of Children. Now Tzyan is dust and its atrocities long forgotten. But in the darkness something lingers\u2026\nA great quake splits the earth asunder. Hushed whispers in begrimed taverns speak of a necropolis, deep within the wastes. Soothsayers tell fortunes of riches untold, knowledge best kept secret, and evil that never sleeps but rages eternally inside a cage of rotting flesh. Those that would help themselves to the palace's treasures had best move swiftly. Others are coming. Riches, Madness and Death await\u2026in the Palace of Unquiet Repose.\nFirst Level of the Palace of Unquiet Repose\nHi! I'm PrinceofNothing. I am the co-writer of the critically acclaimed Red Prophet Rises, I've been a Creative Consultant on Venger Satanis's highly successful Chaalt gonzo mega-dungeon  and I am the author of the popular RPG-blog Age of Dusk. For years on end I've reviewed countless RPG products. Today I present to you the distilled essence of 2 years of obsessive craftsmanship. \nSeamlessly integrating a uniquely horrific atmosphere with brutal location-based adventuring, Palace of Unquiet Repose is a 50-page thrill-ride taking place in the Age of Dusk setting; a brutal Sword & Sorcery epoch, where the Gods have been slain, nameless horrors prowl the wastes baying for blood, and mankind has been reduced to a dim shadow of its former glory. Your players will face horrors never seen before as they explore the subterranean underworld realm of the Palace of Unquiet Repose.\nPalace of Unquiet Repose is likely to be the most challenging, intense, harrowing and insane adventure your players have ever experienced. They will descend into the mythical underworld of the Glass Waste and come face to face with an evil that time has forgotten. \nYou will begin your adventure in distant Iotha, Pearl of the Desert. In its opium-suffused boutiques and sweltering bazaars you will gather rumors, lies, prophecies and meet ferocious companions; the discerning Shing the Many-Tongued, the enigmatic Rastilir of Muir, the omniscient and abrasive Cent!\nI said Horrors never seen before, and this is no hyperbole. Nearly every monster, magic item, trap or effect in Palace is entirely new, never before seen. Are you ready to face such blood-freezing terrors as:\n* The beautiful but deadly Nzembarian Concubines\n* The enigmatic Azarog, whose limbs are the bodies of Dead Men\n* The reality-devouring horror of the Wolf of Final Night\n* The all-seeing, angle-annihilating gaze of the Sartoom\nThese are but a few of the countless sanity-blasting terrors that await those who dare to venture within the Palace of Unquiet Repose!\nCharacters will have to rely on more then their brawn. Other factions are exploring the Palace. The fanatical Children of the Silver Tree. The invincible Sial-Atun mercenaries. And the Nine, worshipers of old Tzyan, have come seeking for terrible secrets. These will have to be used, betrayed and cast aside to stand any chance of overcoming the Palace's countless guardians.\nIn order to make it compatible with most oldschool games but accessible for newer players Palace has been written for the elegant Labyrinth Lord ruleset and can be easily adapted to both older and the newest edition of the world's most popular role playing game. It is suitable for character levels 3 - 5.\nPalace of Unquiet Repose has the potential to be not just one of the finest modules ever written, but the next evolution in OSR adventure design. Joining forces with Malrex of the Merciless Merchants once again, we have broken our backs and crawled through miles of broken glass trying to bring this monster into being. We have done all we could. The rest is up to you.   \n After two years, the writing is all but complete, the editing almost done, the maps complete, but there's something missing. The art! We want to give Palace of Unquiet Repose the type of art that can properly invoke the otherworldly horror and bottomless antiquity of the Age of Dusk. For that we need YOUR HELP.\nThe Azarog by James Vail\nWith your support, we can afford fantastic artists like Chris Cold and James Vail to bring the Palace of Unquiet Repose to life and give you an adventure that looks every bit as disturbing as it plays. \nA note about the Uyu-Yadmogh Reborn Tier: Anyone who lends their aid to such a terrible endeavor will have their name inscribed forever on the credit section and receive not just coupons of the Print+PDF of Palace of Unquiet Repose, but also Red Prophet Rises. But tread lightly; For each petitioner who reaps such vast rewards Uyu-Yadmogh's hit points will increase by one.  \nPilgrim on the Osseous Road; A true devotee deserves something...special. The deluxe edition of Palace will feature additional artwork and content, including the 5-8 page bonus adventure The Screaming Caverns, and will NOT BE AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE. Tread even lighter; Uyu-Yadmogh's Power will increase by two hit points for every traveler on the Osseous Road! \nFulfillment for digital rewards (PDFs) is handled by DriveThruRPG.

It's all set against a sprawling metropolis in a medieval world and delivered to you as a single-volume hardcover book or PDF. You'll find everything you need to make your next campaign super.\nInside there are thematic subclasses, superhero origins, sidekick options, an epic setting, an adventure or two, supervillain and monster stat blocks, lairs and strongholds, and optional rules to elevate your campaign to heroic levels.\nWhat Is the Setting?\nThe world of Ghaistala was uninhabited until 400 years ago when inter-dimensional portals opened up, drawing people from all over the multiverse to a strange obelisk standing in the center of a seaside valley surrounded by tall peaks. These diverse peoples founded a city and named it Beacon, so called for its power to draw folk to it.\nThe populace of Beacon has a propensity for power. Waves of energy known as arkwaves ripple through the cosmos every twenty years, instilling strange abilities seemingly at random. But beyond that, the people themselves often strive for greatness through engineering and physical prowess. And the obelisk that called people here has mysterious properties and secrets of its own. With all this, Beacon truly is a city of supers.\nToday, Beacon is a shining city on a hill but with a seedy underbelly. Its Protectorate Peaks keep out fearsome monsters abroad, though threats abound in the city as well, from the dangerous steets of Lowcity to the corruption at the highest levels of government. The Portaleers, the premier superhero team, safeguard the city, but even they can't be everywhere at once. And sometimes even heroes fall.\nWill you take up the heroes' call? Will you stand against injustice and criminality? Will you root out corruption and throw down tyranny? Will you fight the monsters threatening at the door and bring down the villains with powers to match your own?\nAll this and more awaits you in Supers & Sorcery! \nStretch Goals\nEach stretch goal gives the writing team a pay increase for their hard work bringing this world to life.

Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.\nNight, however, brings a new terror.\nPlayers take on the roles of members of the Chinese family (mostly from Guangdong province), spanning three generations, who face threats of jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and racism by day. It has players balancing the responsibility of maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the dreaded Jiangshi. This is primarily a game about storytelling. Combat is limited, but horror, drama and sometimes comedy are the primary vehicles for driving the game forward.\nJiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a tabletop roleplaying game which combines elements of RPGs with those of traditional board games. The game can be played as a \"mini-series\" or a one-shot.\nEach game takes place over a number of days (usually five), alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place.  Day and night have different threats - in the daytime, the restaurant may experience racism or gang violence, while in the night time, Jiangshi are seeking warm bodies. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. \nEvery morning, the Game Moderator deals out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Each Restaurant card needs from 1 hour to 3 hours to complete. Usually, the oldest member of the family takes charge and starts delegating the tasks to specific players. Each player uses their Resilience slots to complete tasks, indicated by the time and energy they have available to do it.\nOnce the tasks have been completed to the best of the family\u2019s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant\u2019s slots.\nRestaurant Board\nPrior to starting the morning scenes, the first thing each character must do is see how they\u2019re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters. \nSome of the Mung cards are in color which represent good dreams. Other Mung are in black and white, which represents bad dreams. When a player receives a bad Mung card, they place it in one of the card slots on their Character sheet, covering a trait (Item, Skill, Facet, etc.), in numerical order. While covered, a trait cannot be used. To rid themselves of a bad Mung, a character needs to talk about the bad Mung card with another player character during the afternoon or evening scenes. Once they\u2019ve talked about it, they can discard the card.\nArtwork by Sadia Bies\nAfter receiving their Mung cards, players take turns explaining their dreams to each other and the GM. \nDescribe the dream or nightmare based on the image on the cards\nWhat are these visions like and what do they mean, if anything?\nOn subsequent mornings, any remaining Mung cards from previous rounds are kept as recurring nightmares that continue to plague the player character. They will roll the 1D4 as usual for more Mung cards, but instead of adding that number of cards to their character sheet, the result indicates the maximum number of Mung cards that the player character has to deal with this day.\nCharacter Sheet\nThe Character Sheet has several details about the player character that a player can fill out. During the game, Resilience slots may get covered up by Mung cards or Jiangshi cards. A character takes a Jiangshi card when they take stress or physical damage. When a Resilience slot gets covered by a Jiangshi card or a Mung card, that detail about the PC gets removed from play until they are healed. If a PC gets a Jiangshi card on a slot that already has a Mung card, they will remove the Mung card and replace it with the new Jiangshi card.\nOnce they have all 8 slots filled with Jiangshi cards, the player will then become a Jiangshi and they would flip over all the Jiangshi cards to reveal their new Skills. Though this fate can be terrifying, these cards can be healed and removed through game play. \nArtwork by Steven Wu\nPlayers can create Spirit Papers by taking a slip of paper and writing a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. Spirit Papers can only be used once during the night time phases.\nThe GM must count to ten in secret while the family is thinking of their word or sentence. If the time expires and the family has not yet agreed upon what to write on the Spirit Paper, the Spirit Paper will not work.\nIf the Spirit Paper works (i.e. a meaningful phrase or sentence was written with the 10-second time limit), the Jiangshi has been immobilized and players can move onto healing their family member or evading the Jiangshi they\u2019re faced with.\nThe whole group of non-GM players starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the first day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings levy on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.\nWhen a player is determining the outcome of a challenge they are engaged with, they roll all the dice in the Family pool at once and take the highest single value from one of the dice that they rolled as their outcome. Once per scene, a character can use one of their skills to reroll the dice pool to try to achieve a better result. \nTo determine the highest single value from a roll, complete the following steps:\n Clean house! Check for 4\u2019s in the pool: For every die that is showing a 4 in the pool, cancel out a die from the pool that is showing the highest value in the pool along with the die showing the 4, placing them back on the Day/Night Tracker.\n   Check for highest valued D8 in pool: The higher the die roll, the better the outcome.\nMing is rolling the Family pool to cook a feast for visiting dignitaries on Day 1. Ming\u2019s first roll results in the following: 1 2 2 3 4 4 - their highest result is a 2 as the two 4s cancel out the 3 and one of the 2s, respectively! Wanting to impress their guests, Ming uses their Cooking Skill and rerolls the Family pool, ending up with the following result: 1 3 3 4 7 8. Their highest result is 7 because the 8 is cancelled out by the 4. Wiping their brow, Ming's character breathes a sigh of relief and serves a gorgeous noodle dish to the members of the San Francisco city council.\nArtwork by Steven Wu\n\nThis game rewards player characters for failing, because it makes for a more interesting story! When a failure happens, the player who rolled receives an Individual die. The GM will also give player characters a die towards their Individual Pool when something occurs that makes their character happy or hopeful towards their Hopes and Dreams (labeled on their character sheet).\nWhile the main use of Individual dice is to assist other players, a player character may add any number of their Individual dice to their own Challenge rolls. If they do this, ALL of the dice they use in this way are returned to the GM once the Challenge roll is resolved.\nPlaying a Chinese Character\nThis game isn\u2019t just for Asian-Americans - this game can be played by anyone! Just remember that the topics deal with some very real history and politics (Jiangshi aside).\n\nHere are some tips on how to play:\nAvoid using accents\nAvoid exoticizing the culture - mysticism sometimes paints a culture in a very flat and two-dimensional way, so try to stay away from fortune cookies\nTreating the characters with respect is very important, so try to stay away from stereotypes. Not every Asian knows kung-fu, for example. In fact, Martial Arts is a Skill that only some player characters might have chosen for their character sheet.\nDo a little bit of research before playing. You don\u2019t have to have a degree in Asian studies, but just know what you\u2019re getting into.

YOUR PLEDGE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COST OF SHIPPING.\nWe will be using BackerKit, a pledge manager, to collect information from backers.\nNOTE: The final cost of shipping may differ from our estimations, and there will be slight variation from country to country. We will also be charging applicable taxes based on your location.

With each one we have learned more about the industry and best practices. We are entering this project with the project almost completely designed, and developed, with only our final quantities left to nail down before sending to production. With the things we learned from previous projects, we are confident we can handle this project. Game and a Curry brings a wealth of knowledge to this partnership as well, and we know we'll be able to make this project as good as it can possibly be.\n\nQ: How much of the books are already finished?\nA: The game is pretty much complete and ready to send to production. The text potentially added by stretch goals is not written yet, but the writers will be able to complete their portions quickly. Many of these adventure stretch goals are to be digital goals, potentially collected into another volume later, and will have no impact on the delivery of the main product.\n\nQ: Have you produced all these items before?\nA: Between Wet Ink Games, Game and a Curry, and our production partners, all of these components have been made before and are well within our capabilities to produce using industry best practices.\n\nQ: What if shipping costs increase?\nA: Shipping costs are well beyond our control. We\u2019ve made our best projections and those shipping fees will be collected through Backer Kit. Once that money is in hand, we\u2019ll send the items, even it we end up eating a cost increase.

To ensure that we remain respectful and authentic, we have employed a range of expert cultural consultants: Daniel Kwan, David Pena, Heba Elsherief, Mehr Husain, and Sachiko Burton. We would also like to thank our consultants, Salt and Sage Books, for their services in arranging specialist readers.\nHere are just some of the many mythological figures and maleficent monsters that you will find within. \nThis 230-page full-colour hardcover contains over one hundred stat blocks drawn from myths, legends, and history all across the world, each beautifully illustrated with full descriptions and designer's notes, with Challenge ratings from 1 to 35 (well, we had to include Lucifer, Cthulhu, and Fenrir!) \nForeword by James Ward (Deities & Demigods)\n\nMythological Figures is a weekly column on EN World by Mike Myler. It includes both historical and fictional figures built as NPCs using class levels and standard ability scores, and mythical monsters designed with statblocks that adhere to the stories told about them in our world. A new entry appears every week on Monday. The first entry was Achilles, in March 2018. This book compiles the column with all new art!  \nEntries come from origins as wide-ranging as British, Chinese, Norse, Greek, Japanese, Middle Eastern, American, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, European, and more.   \nThe back cover\nSo, who's in? \nThe 100-or so entries included in Mythological Figures & Maleficent Monsters were those requested to be featured in the weekly column by Mike Myler. They represent a fun and eclectic sprinkling of different archetypes, encompassing myth, legend, and history. Also found throughout the book are over 30 new magical items, such as Excalibur and Mj\u00f6lnir. Mike's column is ongoing, so if there's any mythological figure you'd like to see in the future, be sure to ask him on EN World!\nThe Masterclass Codex\nYou may note that some of the mythological figures in this book use classes not found in the 5E core rulebooks - Billy the Kid, for example, is a gunslinger. We have tried to keep to the core rules, but where the design demanded it, we recruited additional classes from The Masterclass Codex. \nThe Masterclass Codex, was a very successful Kickstarter we ran last year. It had over 2,600 backers, and is a very popular 5E book. You can pick up The Masterclass Codex, which contains 16 classes for your 5E games, right here.\nThis book contains the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, occultist, bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant, and tinkerer classes. \n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Brand new, original and fully developed classes that will make the other players at your table jealous. These are balanced options that feel completely different from everything else out there.\" -Garin J.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"My players have all been loving this book, maybe even a little too much since they keep passing it around the table!\" -Cole Dilworth\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"The classes were well thought out. Not overpowered in any way. Good read and good format.\" -NiceDM\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Well written and an easy read.\" -Jody B\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"New and inventive\" -brettandrewdavey\n Alchemist: Scientific Sorcery. The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new advanced studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\n Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three subclasses: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters.\n Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two dark paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more!\n Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: Beasts, Plants, or Entropy.\n Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three essences\u2014the Doppleganger, thePrimordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire.\n Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\n Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: Abomination, Vampire, or Werecreature! Delve into the dark and secret creatures of the night, cursed to exist as monstrous beings shunned by the world.\n Bloodweaver: Macabre Magician. Bloodweavers fuel their magical powers with their own blood, enhancing their own prowess, healing or bolstering allies, and flaying open their foes. They can sense the presence of creatures of flesh and bone, resist the cold reach of death, and manipulate a target\u2019s blood to spectacular, deadly effect. Choose from the Bloodbinder, Crimson Witch, and Scarlet Reaper subclasses!\n Fatebender: Destiny\u2019s Chosen. At the extreme edges of fate\u2019s tapestry, fatebenders pull upon its fraying threads, tugging at the strands of chance. Fatebenders manipulate their own dice rolls as well as those of allies and enemies, further relying on luck to make uncanny discoveries, avoid lethal attacks, and make the most of their own strikes. Subclasses include the Mascot, Jinx, and Weaver!\n Gemini: Two\u2010Faced Warrior. Evading and confounding enemies, gemini create dangerous semi\u2010real multiples of themselves and copy their foes\u2019 techniques. Their duality affects more than how they wage war however, and each embodies two major contrasting ideals, never certain which will be at the fore the next time they wake. Will you select the Atavist, the Equalist, or the Reluctant Hero?\n Geomancer: Nature\u2019s Hearthmage. These mages turn the surrounding elements into potent weapons and tools and fuel their spells with the primal components of creation. Geomancers can also protect companions from harm and draw upon nature outside of battle to reveal reality\u2019s secrets. Four distinct orders\u2014the Conqueror, the Apothecary, the Architect, and the Rune Knight.\n Gunfighter: Black Powder Desperado. These warriors shoot their way across the field of battle, pausing only long enough to aim their next bullets. Gunfighters are adept with the guns they choose to master, picking off targets hidden behind cover with precise shooting and aiming telling shots that leave enemies with catastrophic wounds. The Bushwacker, Drifter, and Maverick make your choice of subclasses!\n Lodestar: Fractured Soul Given Form. In combat lodestars are poetry in motion, their innate powers bringing both wonder and woe. To keep from unraveling into madness these fractured souls must train and hone their skills, becoming masters of body and mind\u2014and their lodestones, magical spheres used to attack, defend, and more. The lodestar chooses from three methods: Control, Imagination, or Instinct.\n Monster Tamer: Companion of Beasts. Monster tamers bond with monstrous pets, whether beasts, exotic aberrations, slimes, or even draconic in nature! Though significantly weaker on their own, tamers with companions make for a potent and unique addition to any group of adventurers able to tolerate the presence of a monster in their midst. Select from the Animalist regimen, Monstrous regimen, and Oddball regimen.\n Savant: Mind Over Matter. Sometimes saving the day means weaponizing knowledge. Savants are brilliant detectives, iconic martial artists, and adventurous physicians, each utilizing genius where others rely on magic or brute power. Repositories of lore, savants also use canny combat tricks to put enemies at a disadvantage. You might be an Adversary, a Chirurgeon, or a Coordinator.\n Tinkerer: Engineer of Wonder. Tinkerers bring life to impressive contraptions, create incredible devices, and forge legendary destinies! When not making or improving mundane items, tinkerers use their technical genius to unleash elemental fury upon their foes, relying upon their own brilliance to resist any magic that might subvert their will. Steam Knights, Bombardiers, and Mechanics make up the tinkerer's choice of subclasses!\nCollector's Gift Set\nFor collectors, and those looking for a great gift, we are producing a special Collector's Gift Set of both hardcovers with gorgeous faux-leather covers. We will only be doing one print run of these, so get 'em while you can!\nFinal design may change\nBonus Villain Spotlights! \nWe have a collection of additional villainous figures from the pages of EN5ider. Unlike those in the book above, these myths are not from our own world; they're our own fantasy creations! \nThese operate a little like 'stretch goals' -- each of the below Villain Spotlights is a PDF which all backers who have backed \u00a315 or more (the PDF tier or higher) will get for free as we reach certain funding targets. The higher the funding reaches, the more bonus free stuff you get! And not only that...\n... we give them to you as soon as we hit the stretch goal. Not after the campaign. Right away. Just as a little thank you for the trust you put in us and our project.\n REACHED! \u00a310,000 Villain Spotlight: Jaxi the Blightgunner. Although they are certainly places of decay and death, swamps are also home to a great deal of life and they bustle with activity\u2014the popping of gasses rising out of the muck, the chittering of insects ever searching for food, and in Chokewater, the clack of colliding lead firing off an explosive charge from Jaxi's rifle! The Blightgunner has fiercely protected her lair for 16 years now, though she has long since ceased loving her home and desperately searches for a way to escape its influence without giving up the powers it has bestowed upon her. In addition to her statblock (CR 7) this article includes a trio of magic items: an acid bullet recipe, drypowder, and Thorncase. Designed by Peter Martin, illustrated by Herman Lau and Savage Mojo.\n REACHED! \u00a320,000 Villain Spotlight: Rosie Arkwright. Halloween is the theme of this supplement, and to help spookify your games we've got an unassuming horror to titillate, captivate, and eviscerate adventurers: the undead ragdoll Rosie Arkwright. Despite her small size she is durable, deadly, and able to create legions of creatures like herself, vastly outnumbering victims before swarming upon them with mystical needle and thread used to sew up mouths, eyes, and lives! Brilliantly penned by Andrew Engelbrite with a wonderful illustration by Xanditz.\n REACHED! \u00a330,000 Villain Spotlight: Dras'a Wolf. This entry into the Villain Spotlight series is all about the scourge of the seas men know as Dras'a the Wolf, a hobgoblin pirate with incredible ambitions and the cunning to see them through. Originally master of the Drelway Chain of islands, after capturing a learned shipmaker from afar the monstrous buccaneer has been preparing for when his abductee's drafts and designs lead to ocean-worthy vessels, boats that will unleash him and his underlings to become a scourge upon the open waves.\n REACHED! \u00a340,000 Villain Spotlight: Skrivena Moc. Usually found deep within a dungeon near the site of a bloody battle, the blade Skrivena Moc seems at first to be a powerful weapon able to sear foes with fire and strike through even the toughest armor. What more it speaks to its wielders, offering advice and admiration in equal parts\u2014but only to gain their trust, convincing them that their unnatural attachment to it is nothing to fear all the while it slowly consumes their very soul! This devious intelligent magic item and creature was written by Andrew Engelbrite and illustrated by Rachel Maduro.\n REACHED! \u00a350,000 Villain Spotlight: Eshaq the Zealoutous. Eshaq was once the prophet of an evil deity. His reward for a lifetime of faithful servitude was being embalmed and interned in a temple but he was quickly forgotten with the passage of time. 200 years since the last of his disciples have perished Eshaq has risen to spread the gospel of his now dead god. A CR 17 undead creature from Robert Lashley; illustrated by Indi Martin. Also includes details and map of of Eshaq's lair, plot hooks, and the new Zealotous Undead template.\n REACHED! \u00a360,000. Villain Spotlight: Syndrathrax the Soul Eater. A mighty CR 27 monster! While technically an ancient red dragon, Syndrathrax\u2019s necromantic transformations and attempted apotheoses have forever altered her. Though she shares the massive size of her fellow red wyrms she is gaunt and skeletal, and her scales sapped of their red luster and now bone white. Thanks to the necromantic energy that permeates her body she radiates a faint spectral glow that she can mask when she chooses--the souls of those that she has swallowed are sometimes seen struggling vainly to escape in this light.\n REACHED! \u00a370,000. Villain Spotlight: Granny Buccus. Sweet, maternal, a dab hand in the kitchen, Granny Buccus is the heart of the town of Cridhe Briste. As the town\u2019s baker she provides the people with bread, cakes, and pastries\u2014on special occasions she even makes her famous  and beloved Boiled Tarts. The adoring townsfolk don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re under the spell of a succubus, ready and willing to do whatever 'Granny' asks of them!  By Anna Blackwell; illustrated by Alba Palacio.\n REACHED! \u00a380,000. Villain Spotlight: Glamdrellyxxana the Gold. A gold dragon druid under the influence of an ancient curse, Glamdrellyxxana believes the only way to ensure that the world remains \u2018good\u2019 is to destroy all humanoid life. From her lair in a mountain lake she's amassed an army of plant creatures to sweep down across the world and cleanse it of the blight from meddling civilizations destined to bring ruin with their advancement, yet the dragon often feels melancholy about the need to destroy so many living things. Glamdrellyxxana is resigned to this course of action however, convinced by fell visions of an industrialized future\u2014and distracted by mind-altering plants when the guilt becomes too much to bear. By Will Gawned; illustrated by J\u00falio Rocha.\n REACHED! \u00a390,000 Villain Spotlight: Vengar the Reader. Goblins are known for many things\u2014reading is not typically on that list, but it's not like Vengar is a typical goblin. Once a trapfinder for the Chokeleaf tribe, this errant necromancer went entirely off the deep end after selfishly stealing an ancient tome to fulfill his ambitions of power. The cursed book has sucked away his vitality and now Vengar travels from tribe to tribe posing as a shaman, utilizing everything he can to acquire more magics able to extend his piteous life before the dark entities he's pledges his soul to come calling for his debt. In addition to his statistics (CR 5), Vengar has access to a variety of enhanced undead that explode, ignite, poison, become conduits of deathly energies, and even hide other monsters inside their bodies. Designed by Charlie Brooks, illustrated by Renan Moraes.\n REACHED! \u00a3100,000. Villain Spotlight: Ezekial.Ezekial is a minotaur gifted (or maybe cursed) with intelligence and cunning beyond that of most of his kin. Ezekial is the leader of a small band of thieves who are on a crime spree stealing priceless artifacts and rare tomes of knowledge. This article describes Ezekial, his goals and personality, a description of his band of thieves, and lists possible plot-hooks that involve Ezekial.\nREACHED! \u00a3110,000. Villain Spotlight: Bezkusmet the Unscaled. Dragons are known to be terrifying but all pale in comparison to Bezkusmet the Unscaled. As his name suggests there is no hue or substance to his draconic scute leaving his musculature and skeleton bared for the world to see, lattices of finger-thick veins and arteries the size of a human\u2019s wrist inexorably pumping blood across his utterly naked body. Only a thin sheen of transparent magic holds Bezkusmet\u2019s organs and muscles in place, the last of the twisted supernatural energies of his birthright all that keeps him intact. By Mike Myler; illustrated by Claudio Pozas and Ekaterinya Vladinakova.\n\u00a3130,000. Monstrous Menagerie: From Stranger Woods. Four fantastical new fey monsters for your 5E game! The goat-horned ochokochi with a bony cleaver; the capricious trickster poludnitsa; the angelic-looking samovila, ladies of drought and harvest; and the repulsive via, with their gaze of dread.

We knew there was a demand for a more robust storytelling system using the d20 rules we loved, but at the time, we weren't honestly sure how ready the world was for our level of weird. \nAt the time, we were both working extensively with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game as our preferred d20 system. So, we wrote the first edition of Bloodlines & Black Magic as a variant ruleset for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\nShortly after releasing the original Bloodlines & Black Magic in 2018, fans immediately started asking for a version that was compatible with the world's most popular roleplaying game - you know the one. We answered with a couple of class conversions (for the Brawler and Occultist) but realized that we would need to do more with that ruleset if we really wanted to make it work in the modern world.\nWe needed to update the skills, the Feats, the classes, all seven bloodlines, and every single spell in the game. But we also needed to better incorporate our iconic mechanical elements, as well - things like Pierce the Veil and The Arcana were big parts of the game we didn't want to just 'tack on' to a 5e conversion. We also needed to update firearms, armor, and a host of other details, as well. In short, we needed to do more than just convert the old book to a new system.\nWe needed to release a full system that gamers familiar with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, 5e, and other games could pick up and intuitively understand. This would require we create a much bigger book packed with everything you'd want to tell stories in a modern world. \nSo we did.\nWe've been writing, playtesting, and revising the newest edition of Bloodlines & Black Magic since the beginning of 2019. It's been a long process but one in which we've actively involved the larger gaming community. We've run games at Gen Con, GameHole Con, Gary Con, Sk\u00e5l Con, and online. You can see our most recent playtesting episodes, The Houses Of Halifax on Twitch). \nThroughout this process, we've solicited feedback from our previous backers, our fans, our developers, and our playtesters; we've made our active manuscript open and available to private groups who have played on their own, helping us identify elements we could improve, making this game even better. \nWe're pretty happy with how it's taken shape, too. \nNow, of course, it's time to share the game with the world again. We have a lot we want to do with this world and with your help, we can do so much more!\nLore | A Dark Reflection\nSo, what have we made? \nBloodlines & Black Magic is a darker, modern roleplaying game with strong occult and horror elements set in a world that mirrors ours. Unlike ours, it is a world filled with monsters - human and cryptid alike - that lurk in the shadows, just beyond the ken of most of the mortal realms. As such, it is also a game of heroes - calling on the player characters to step into the Invisible World to destroy the things that, left unchecked, would devour the very world they love.\nWant a quick preview? Check out this free PDF. \nBloodlines &Black Magic is also a game about people pursuing power for any number of ends, with some becoming powerful Sovereigns capable of ruling entire Domains inside the Invisible World. Others might take different paths, becoming Travelers who seek out the Invisible City and from there, all of the many Abhorrent Heavens beyond.\nBloodlines &Black Magic is a game about discovery. As heroes seek the truth, they learn to look for clues - Physical, Psychic, and Social - that help them distinguish the difference between the foul influences of the Infernal from the warlike radiance of the Celestial Realms. Of course, this search for the truth is where heroes like the Occultist, the Operative, and the Psychic shine - each of which might call on any number of potent powers or resources to help their allies get to (or cover-up) the truth about the world around them.\nLikewise, Bloodlines & Black Magic is a game about choices - the decisions player characters make directly impact their relationship with the world around them. Using a system of magical attunement, player characters learn to gain power by creating relationships with the world around them, forming powerful bonds with TheArcana, their bloodline abilities, other entities, magical items, magical locations, other people, and even their class skills!\nAs these players form these magical bods, they also begin to cement their place in the lore of the larger world. So, when a player chooses to bond with a powerful magical item, group, or even a powerful entity, that choice matters. \nStory-Focused, Narrative Driven\nBloodlines & Black Magic is a different kind of d20 game. While it uses a mechanical model most GMs will find incredibly intuitive, it does so with a completely different set of mechanical assumptions; Bloodlines & Black Magic doesn't track XP in the way a lot of fantasy roleplaying games do. \nSo, where some games mechanically encourage player characters to lean into combat to earn XP (producing a violent grind to power and wealth), Bloodlines & Black Magic encourages player characters to carefully choose how and when they engage their enemies - as any battle could be their last.\nWhile Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a CR (or Challenge Rating) system to help GMs gauge the power of foes, traps, and similar hazards, it does so only as a guide. PCs instead earn XP by participating in play, engaging with the story, pursuing their character's goals, and by completing episodes with their friends. \nTo help players and GMs alike, Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a unique storytelling deck called The Arcana.\nThis deck has already been proofed and printed. We need only place an order with our printer.\nWhen coupled with the clue cards, GMs can deploy two very powerful tactile elements at the table, giving them even more tools with which to encourage immersion and roleplaying.\nNo Stretch Goals\nTimes are tough right now for a lot of people working in tabletop game design. Shops are closed, distribution is limited, and a lot of smaller studios have suspended work (or laid people off) while we all try and navigate 2020. \nStorm Bunny Studios will be using all of our additional funds to ensure we survive while still being able to pay our favorite game designers. \nIf you want to help SBS weather this difficult time, this Kickstarter is one way to do that.\nShipping Prices & Times\nOur shipping prices are based on our anticipated book weight of 3.6 lbs, shipped from our office here in Wisconsin.

Whether it's exploring strange new worlds or telling tales of gripping battles, these are the frameworks that we use to inhabit powerful wizards, hardened warriors, and battle to save - or destroy - the world that they inhabit.\nToday we're bringing you two volumes - Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might - that greatly expand what's contained in that tool kit. Populated with entirely new sets of magical and martial powers, Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might will change the way you play magical and martial characters at your table forever! With years of development and experience behind it, the Spheres system is making the jump from Pathfinder to D&D 5th edition in a big way, and bringing tons of amazing options for character creation, world building, and storytelling along with it!\nWhat is Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might?\nSpheres of Power was a new approach to magic written for Pathfinder 1st edition in 2013 that changed the way magic-users and magical worlds were built. It took the 'how's' and 'why's' of magic and placed them into the hands of the players and the game masters, freeing them from the base assumptions of the game and giving them the power to create worlds and characters far beyond its common scope. Want to be a candy-mancer? A jedi? A thinly-veiled reference to a favorite anime franchise? All of this and more becomes possible with the Spheres of Power system!\nWith Spheres of Power, the very rules of magic and magic-power creation changed from spell-list based to concept based, allowing for worlds where magic is fueled by blood sacrifice, diagrams and alchemical exchanges, and more. For more information, see this video made for the Pathfinder 1st edition version:\nSpheres of Might was the Ennie-nominated martial book written as a follow-up volume to Spheres of Power, and granted all manner of new tactical prowess to martial characters. With Spheres of Might, combat became much more cinematic, and the abilities of martial combatants expanded to include not only tactical combat where the battlers must out-think each other before landing the final blow, but also expanded what martial characters were capable of outside of combat, granting all manner of powers and abilities one might expect from a real-world knight, scoundrel, or inventor.\nWith both Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might, players and GMs gain a whole host of new tools, allowing for the creation of characters, worlds, and stories beyond the scope of the core assumptions of Dungeons and Dragons and its various editions and spinoffs. \nWhat Is This Campaign Funding?\nWith this campaign we are funding is to fund the layout, printing, and distribution of both the Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might systems for 5th edition D&D. This will be done in two compatible books (one for each system) that will be available in both PDF and print, in both hardcover (for the shelf) and softcover (for rolling up and throwing in a bag on your way to game night).\nWe will also be using this campaign to conduct a playtest; by backing here, you will gain access to the material early and be able to make your voice heard on how the system works for you and how we can make sure not only that the translation is done well, but that the system is meeting your needs.\nWhat Do The Books Contain?\nBoth Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might are set to contain about 200 full-color pages each.

If you already have Drivethru RPG's screen, this add-on would be to get inserts.\nIf you do not want Drivethru RPG's screen, this would get you the second version printed elsewhere. (domestic shipping only)\nIf you don't have Drivethru RPG's screen but WANT their screen, it would probably be best to wait until this campaign is over and order the inserts and screen together later from Drivethru itself; due to the partnering setup they have with the people who make their GM's screen, it would be cheaper and much less hassle than having us try and send you one ourselves.\nGM Screen (vertical or horizontal PDF): $5 each\nGM Screen (vertical, horizontal, or custom print): $10 each\n For this campaign we will be using Drivethru RPG's print services, which not only prints the books, but also includes an almost completely international reach. \nThis means the book can reach a great many countries the world over, and while we cannot promise that it will be able to reach ANY nation, we will put in our best effort to get your books to you wherever you happen to be.

That's about eight hours of entertainment for five people, coming to $2.50 per hour, per person -- and that's not counting all the lower rewards on top of that. \nAt $7000, I will create a dozen new fantasy ancestries and cultures! Each new ancestry and culture will be based on a mythological creature that you will want to play! We're still working on ideas, but right now we are considering bird folk, giantkin, goblins, lizard folk, cat folk, snake folk, shapeshifters, constructs, minotaurs, centaurs, satyrs, medusae, rat folk, mer folk, dryads, dhampir, werefolk, and more! Once we've created them, we'll release it to backers as a separate PDF released to all backers at the $5 and up level.\n Have you ever wondered why there are half-elves and half-orcs in your favorite fantasy roleplaying game, but not half-tieflings, half-dwarves, or half-gnomes? And why only allow orcs and elves to mate with humans and not others? Why can't we play the child of an elf and an orc or a gnome and a halfling? \nWhat's more, what if we want to play a human raised by elves, like Tolkien's Aragorn, or a halfling who grew up among orcs? Wouldn't such characters be different than a halfling who grew up among her own people, for example? It would be a delight to be able play such a diverse cast of characters, with such a wide range of ancestries and cultures. \nWell, now we can! This 32-page zine of rules and original fantasy art allows for the easy creation of a variety of new ancestral and cultural combinations and types, without having to make big changes to the core game rules. What's more, they replace the problematic concept of race as it is traditionally used in character creation. Ancestry provides those heritable traits a character might receive from their parents, such as height, average lifespan, and darkvision, and culture provides such teachable features as weapon training and ability. This frees us up to play the characters we want to play and provides us many more options, just dripping with role-play potential.\nIn addition to the new character creation rules, Ancestry and Culture also features original art by Talon Dunning and layout and art direction by Aaron Acevedo. Talon's art has featured in such games and properties as Legend of the Five Rings, Mage: The Awakening, Mummy: The Resurrection, Scarred Lands, Ravenloft, Kingdoms of Kalamar, Thieves' World, and Mutants & Masterminds, among others. Aaron's layout and art direction work can be found in almost every Savage Worlds product, including Savage Rifts and Deadlands, as well as in TORG, Unknown Armies, World of Darkness, The Yellow Sign, and more. \nHumans and their adopted orc brother\n Why replace the rules for Race in character creation for the world\u2019s most popular tabletop roleplaying game, you might ask? First of all, because it makes even greater characters, more interesting story, and richer role-play possible. Think of the possibilities of playing an orc-elf, or a gnome raised among dwarves, for example. And imagine what diverse communities might be like, where dwarven and elven culture, art, architecture mingle! What would their buildings look like? Their weapons? In short, we want to replace race with ancestry and culture because replacing it is easy and makes for more fun!\nBeyond that, there is a more serious reason to replace the concept of race in your games with ancestry and culture: simply put, because the very concept of Race in this game we love is problematic.\nFirst of all, the concept of race used in roleplaying games comes from the analogous concept used in the real world. Biologists, evolutionary theorists, anthropologists, and race theorists have long since shown that the concept as it was used at least from the Enlightenment forward to the 20th Century is, frankly, bogus. This is not to say there is no such thing as ancestry, heritage, and genetic difference, of course. But those differences simply do not map cleanly onto anything in our biology as simplistic as the concept of race, as it is often used. After all, none but the most flagrant racist in the real world nowadays would say that one\u2019s ethnic ancestry, or race, causes a person to have a lower intelligence or gives them a tendency toward extreme violence or evil, yet our fantasy games employ exactly this concept of race. In other words, race itself is a tainted concept, but the way it is employed in fantasy gaming is an exceptionally bad example. Thus I would prefer not to use it, if I can.\nA tiefling-gnome prepares for battle\nFortunately, it is not difficult to replace Race in character creation in our favorite roleplaying game. As I show in this zine, we can acknowledge that gnomes and elves and humans and dwarves might in general have certain biological markers that distinguish them, such as height and lifespan and darkvision, without also ascribing intelligence or weapon mastery or good and evil to their biology. Obviously, those features are more a result of upbringing than genetics. Why not therefore separate out biological ancestry from cultural heritage? That is exactly what I have done here!\nSome advantages of this are as follows: this separates the value-laden concepts of ability bonuses and alignment from biology; it locates skills, weapon proficiencies, languages, and other behavioral differences where they belong, in one\u2019s upbringing; and these rules do so in a way that leaves the rest of the game mechanics largely intact. Indeed, one should be able to swap out the Race options from character creation for these rules without much change elsewhere at all, though it may change the way the fantasy world is depicted (hopefully for the better). Further, using these rules also allows for a lot of fun new roleplaying opportunities, as you can now have mechanics to account for someone of one ancestry growing up among different cultures, such as a human raised by elves or a gnome raised among dwarves.\nAnd as we suggested, these rules even include ways to create characters of mixed ancestry and unique upbringing. In the original rules, one could create only half-elves and half-orcs (themselves problematic and human-centric \u2013 why not call them half-humans? And why only those two combinations?). With these rules, one can create characters with one human and one elf parent, to be sure, but also human-halfling, dwarf-elf, orc-tiefling, or gnome-dragonborn offspring if you like. Surely a fantasy world with magic and dragons, and one that already contains offspring of humans and elves and orcs, has room for halfling-dwarf children as well!  \nAn elf-tiefling\nHi!

I will also complete the Print-On-Demand version before May, with an absolute deadline for everything of June. I expect the final product to be approximately 32 pages.

Members of the troupe have performed in Callisto 6, Shield of Tomorrow, and Clear Skies, all fantastic shows that showcase this supremely talented group.\nThe Streampunks crew.\nThe Streampunks will create a one shot adventure available to everyone on Twitch and YouTube. For each stretch goal we hit after the first, they will produce an additional episode, up to a full 12 episode season.\nA note on the direct bonuses to our production team: our artists, copy editor, layout designer, web designer, etc, have all been paid a fair wage based on negotiated contracts. But if this project does well, we believe they deserve to be compensated even more for their incredible work. \nOverview\nAt its heart, Descent into Midnight is a game about community, family, and hope. It\u2019s a tabletop roleplaying game that takes place in a technologically advanced aquatic civilization whose culture has never been touched by humanity. Bioengineering and psionic, or mental, powers allow the strange and varied species to communicate and interact with their surroundings no matter their physiology.\nIn the game, players take on the roles of guardians, defending their community from a physical, emotional, and even existential threat. The game focuses on the relationships between the guardians, the inhabitants they protect, and their internal struggles and dreams in the face of a corruption that threatens to change their world.\n\"The thing that we were building together was so hauntingly beautiful, that when something threatened to corrupt and destroy it, I felt it more viscerally than most experiences I\u2019ve had throughout many years of playing and GM\u2019ing games.\" - Jason Robinson, UX Designer, host of The Secret Cellar Podcast.\nMassive crustacean tending to purple coral gardens.\nThe Goal\nOur funding goal for this campaign is $25,000, which will allow us to produce the best quality copy of the game we can. That total includes the initial print run, paying our artists, the entire production team, web designer, Kickstarter, payments, accessibility and campaign consultants, and more.\nThe Book\nWe're producing two version of the book. Both are 6 x 9 inch hardcovers in color, featuring cover art by Devon George. \nMock-up of book with purple seascape and strange aquatic creatures.\nThe first is the standard hardcover copy. This is the version that is available at the $40 tier, and is the same version that is donated to an organization or recipient of your choice at the $80+ tiers. It will feature several full-color illustrations by Devon George and even more naturalist-style sketches by Taylor Livingston of just some of the weird sea creatures you and your group might create at your table.\nMock-up of blue hardcover with crustacean surrounded by kelp halo, in silver foil.\nThe second is the Limited edition, available at the $110+ tiers (which also include a standard copy for you, plus one donated standard copy). It has an alternate blue foil-stamped cover and an integrated purple ribbon bookmark. We will only be producing these in the initial print run funded by the Kickstarter, so once we place the order with the printer, that's it!\nThe Game\nDescent into Midnight uses the award-winning Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) system developed by Vincent and Meguey Baker and used in popular roleplaying games like Masks: A New Generation, Monsterhearts, and Headspace. PbtA is a story-focused system that incorporates the best of both narrative and mechanical gameplay. Though players familiar with other PbtA games will have a solid foundation with Descent into Midnight, we have developed the setting and mechanics to inspire your imagination in new and surprising ways.\n\"All of the things that you think you know about the world completely shift, and so the world building ends up happening on this level of continuous surprise. I don\u2019t think it could ever get boring.\" - DC, creator Mutants in the Night; Narrative Designer, Wizards of the Coast.\nCrab-like Cultivator with kelp growing from their back.\nPlaybooks\nUnlike other RPGs, we have no canon setting for Descent into Midnight. Instead, we help players create the species they want to play, then work with the other players to weave their cultures and histories together to form a civilization that\u2019s entirely unique to their table. Designed to welcome everyone, no matter their knowledge or understanding of our real-world oceans, Descent into Midnight guides you into a new and mysterious world, one that you and your friends help create.\n\"The way [the playbooks] guided me into the character creation was great and let me explore something that I didn\u2019t think I would do on my own.\" - Drew Corkill, UX Designer.\nInstead of classes or point-buy systems, Descent into Midnight uses Playbooks to guide you through character creation and to weave your story into all the others at the table. Each playbook is written around a familiar trope, giving you a narrative anchor in this alien environment, and then uses leading questions and evocative language to seed your imagination with ideas.\nOur playbooks are as much about what story you want to tell, as they are about what you do in the world.\n The Empath - Emotions, memories, and experiences flow through you -- both your own, and those of the inhabitants around you. At one time these energies overpowered you, pouring through the open door to your heart and mind. Now you have learned to ride the waves of emotion, flowing with and redirecting the anger, joy, fear, and corruption of others.\n The Cultivator - Gardener, bioengineer, aquaformer. You coax and shape the world around you to serve your needs, sometimes at great personal cost. You nurture life and those around you, growing the tools you need to solve some problems, and giving of yourself what is necessary to solve the rest.\n The Redeemed - You were created to excel at one thing: conflict. Whether through physical training, bioengineering, or psychic reprogramming, you are the center of the storm when challenges arise. Though your original purpose may have been to inflict terrible consequences on your enemies, the choice is now yours - are you a weapon of war, a symbol of peace, or something else entirely?\n The Awakened - You were once like the rest of your kind. Then you woke up. Some believe the planet chose you, awakening your Echo to fight the Corruption. Others worry you are a child of the Corruption, mutated to serve its ends. Yet something calls to you, from the Far Echo or the deep ocean. You were awakened for a purpose. If only you could find it...\n The Orator - Ambassador, politician, commander, or community leader. Your words, presence, and experiences inspire your community to work miracles. When danger lies at your community\u2019s doorstep, folks look to you for guidance. When people have disputes, they go to you to provide mediation. When the community needs a leader, you are there.\n The Traveler - Where many lives thrive within and around the cityscape, you have spent years, perhaps even centuries, studying the world outside. Whether as scholar, trader, explorer, or bounty hunter, you have collected a lifetime of knowledge and experience, and seen the best and the worst the world has to offer.\n The Muse - Crafters, sculptors, singers, and storytellers, you draw on the thoughts, hopes, and fears of your community and express them for all to see. The manifestations of your imagination exist beyond the physical world, weaving the essence of the Echo into physical expressions of beauty and emotion that live in two worlds, whether through a haunting song, a life-changing story, or an architectural wonder.\n The Specialist - You are an expert at getting your allies into and out of dangerous or questionable situations with skill and grace, whether rescuing the victims of a natural disaster, negotiating a lethal hydrothermal vent field, breaching the biotech security of an ancient civilization, or extracting psychic information from a coral hive-mind.\n The Seeker - The Far Echo calls to you, a current carrying you to the Echoes of other realities. Do you explore those realities for knowledge and insight, or do you draw on their strange perspectives to manipulate and control the inhabitants around you?\n The Touchstone - Corruption can never extinguish the wonder of life as long as life maintains hope. True, deep, and genuine compassion can transform not just a single life, but the world in which it lives. You are the innocent that befriends the grotesque or abandoned; the ally that reminds those around them their unique gifts create a better world; the stable friend providing shelter against the crushing tide of despair.\nLobster-creature radiating psionic energy.\nStats\nIn a game where sapient krakens and microscopic krill can create a complex society, how strong or dextrous you are isn\u2019t as important as the social, emotional, and existential impact of the actions you take. Descent into Midnight is a game about connections, so the statistics we use to describe your character describe your relationship to yourself, your team, and the people around you.\n Hope - Are you a force of optimism and inspiration, or do you struggle with feelings of despair? Hope is the cornerstone of the Muse and Touchstone playbooks.\n Altruism - Do you use your skills and abilities to support individuals around you, or do you struggle between your duties and your needs as an individual? Altruism is the cornerstone of the Empath and Cultivator playbooks.\n Community - Are you deeply aware of how everyone in an ecology fits together and able to see from other\u2019s perspectives, or is it difficult to work with others? Community is the cornerstone of the Orator and Seeker playbooks.\n Calm - Are you focused and at peace during stressful times, or are you quick to react and easy to anger? Calm is the cornerstone of the Specialist and Redeemed playbooks.\n Drive - Are you driven toward success and survival, or do you fold under pressure? Drive is the cornerstone of the Awakened and Traveler playbooks.\nFish with component parts physically separate, held together with psionics.\nWhat People Are Saying\nDescent into Midnight is a deeply personal project for us. Not only does it help us introduce players to the wonder, beauty, and terror of our real-world oceans, it works to build empathy in a way that is critically important to us as designers, and to the world we live in. Here's what some of our playtesters have to say about the game and the impact it has had on them.\n \u201cIt\u2019s very spiritual and very emotional, yet you are playing things that don\u2019t resemble you at all. It\u2019s a fascinating exercise in empathy.\u201d - Devon George, Descent into Midnight artist, www.devongeorgestudios.com.\n \u201cI\u2019m gonna say, my game is really really good, but this game is ridiculous!\u201d  - DC (@DungeonCommandr), creator of Mutants in the Night; Narrative Designer, Wizards of the Coast (creators D&D 5th Edition).\n \"Uniquely brilliant.\"  - Jeff Barber, ecologist, award winning designer of Blue Planet, Upwind, and the highly anticipated Blue Planet: Recontact. \n \u201cDescent Into Midnight achieves a poignance that captivates scientists and gamers alike, over and over. I can't recommend this transcendent game enough.\u201d  -Darcy Ross, biologist, game designer, Monte Cook Games Community Manager.\n \u201cIt's completely changed how I engage with my games and the people around my table.\"  - Aram Vartian, creator, editor, producer GodsFall and DemigodsFall.\n \u201cExploration without combat, co-op through building, not destroying. It allowed me to imagine a world outside our own perceptions. It was simultaneously a game and a meditation.\u201d  - @tembeep on Twitter, marine biologist, co-host @RSSDefiant.\n \u201cDiM is the most strange, beautiful, and emotional games I have ever played. I will remember my first experience with it forever.\u201d  - Playtester @explosiverunes on Twitter.\n \u201cThe playbooks were built in such a way that failure and hardship were exciting and beautiful things, and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it since.\u201d  - @kyle_krueger on Twitter, co-host @RSSDefiant.\n \u201cI playtested DiM at GenCon and it was one of the defining moments I\u2019ve had from ANY con.\u201d  - @billoftheforest on Twitter, Cast member @TalesfromtheGrim @DiceTribe.\n \u201cThe rumors are true. This game lives up to every expectation.\u201d  - @kwiksotic on Twitter, Cast Member #TheDyingKingdom @GreyhawkChannel.\n\u201cI\u2019m seriously missing this game already. Please, Rich Howard, may we have another?\"  - @gnomedic on Twitter, cast member DemigodsFall, Kobold Press Social Media Manager.\n Play the Game Now\nYou can get the Quick Start Guide to try the game right now. It has everything you need to run a session of the game, including the latest version of all ten playbooks. We will continue to update and refine it as we finish the accessible versions of all the materials.\nDescent into Midnight has been in development for the past 3 years and been playtested by game designers, artists, podcasters, streamers, scientists, and con-goers from around the world. We are polishing the current draft of the rules and filling in the sections that will help Guides run the best game possible. This campaign is to provide funds to bring you the best PDF and hard-copy versions of the game we can.\nActual Play & More Info\nWe have had the privilege to be featured on numerous podcasts, both actual play and discussions.\nActual Play:\n Game Closet: actual play with Kat Kuhl, Orion Black, Devon George, Rich Howard, and Richard Kreutz-Landry.(transcript).\n Party of One: actual play with two players.\n Tabletop Squadron (World Building): character creation and world building episode.\n Tabletop Squadron (Adventure): the adventure in the world created above.\n She's a Super Geek: 2-episode run of actual play.\n The RPG Academy (Trials): actual play sessions.\n The Redacted Files: actual play session.\n Nerds on a Roll: actual play sessions.\nDiscussion\n Modifier: discussion about the game with the whole design team.\n Character Creation Cast:  3-episode run of character and setting building actual play, plus discussion about the game.\n Character Creation Cast (Bonus): a bonus episode about the game and character creation.\n Secret Cellar (Weep and Whale): post-game discussion of an especially impactful GenCon 2018 playtest.\n Plus1Forward: combination discussion about the game, PbtA, and a short actual play scene.\n The RPG Academy (Show & Tell): discussion about the game.\n The Secret Cellar (Weaponized Hospitality): discussion about the game, and the creative process. (transcript)\n Table Top Babble: discussion about the game.\n The Roleplaying Exchange: discussion about why we're passionate about the game.\nShipping\nWe\u2019re going to be using BackerKit as our post-campaign fulfillment portal, and will be charging for shipping through them after the campaign. This reduces our costs slightly and gives us the flexibility to adapt to any unforeseen cost issues with shipping.\nFor US backers, we\u2019re going to be charging the full price of shipping and packaging. Because we\u2019re limiting the physical rewards to books, we should be able to take advantage of the USPS Media Mail option, which is very economical. We expect the cost per copy to be $7 or less.\nFor international backers, we\u2019re going to be partially subsidizing the cost of shipping. For each copy, we\u2019re contributing $10 towards the cost of shipping, and the rest will be the responsibility of the backer. Current international shipping rates as of the launch of the Kickstarter for a book the size of ours appear to be in the $22-$27 range. There\u2019s no getting around it. International shipping is complex and expensive, but we wanted to make sure the game was available in hard copy for folks everywhere who are passionate about it.\nRewards\nWe have 9 Reward Tiers. The tier we think many backers will be excited about is the Kickstarter Exclusive level.\n$2 - Thank you - Includes a thank you on our website along with any digital rewards we unlock.\n$20 - Digital Copy - Includes the $2 rewards, plus a full-color PDF copy of the game.\n$40 - Hardcover Reward - Includes the $20 rewards, plus a full-color hardcover copy of the game.\n$80 - Community Reward - Includes the $40 rewards, plus an additional full-color hardcover of the game will be donated to a school, library, after-school program, aquarium, or other organization of your choice.\n$110 - Limited Edition - Includes the $80 rewards, plus a Kickstarter Exclusive Premium Edition copy of the game. This level, and all higher levels, provide 3 physical copies of the game  (Limited Edition Hardcover, Standard Hardcover, Donation Hardcover), plus the PDF. In addition, if the campaign unlocks the streaming episode stretch goals, you'll be thanked in the credits of the show.\n$235 - Character Art Edition - (Limit 8) This includes the $110 rewards, plus you may submit a description for a player species or creature to be drawn by one of our artists to be included in the final version of the game.

In addition to being credited as a Producer, you may submit a description for a cityscape to be drawn by one of our artists to be included in the final version of the game.\n$985 - Executive Producer Edition - (Limit 3) This includes the $485 rewards.

Devon George and Taylor Livingston (Illustrators), Paulomi S.P. (Art Director), VJ Brown (Layout Editor), Tracy Barnett (Kickstarter Consultant, Developmental Draft Editor), Christine \"Rhi\" Scherer (Accessibility Consultant), Aser Tolentino (Accessibility Tester), Tyler Palermo of DOTS RPG (Accessibility Tester), Will Trufant (Web Developer), and I-Hsien Sherwood (Copy Editor).\nWe would also like to express our eternal gratitude to Ty Mabrey and Bang Zoom Studios for their work on our video.\nFor more detailed team bios, check the website.\nAccessibility\nWe\u2019re committed to producing a product that is as accessible as possible. To that end, we\u2019ve hired an accessibility consultant to help ensure the digital documents are screen reader-friendly and are working with blind/low-vision testers who use assistive technology regularly.\nThe Quick Start Guide we have available is not yet fully accessible, but we are in the process of revising and reviewing our playbooks and other documents. As the new documents become available we\u2019ll be updating it and notifying backers.\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding accessibility, please reach out to us. You can message us here on Kickstarter, email us at info@descentintomidnight.com, or message us on twitter @DiMRPG. \nKickstarter Union\nNews came on February 18th that the Kickstarter Union has been officially recognized! This is an amazing accomplishment. Congratulations to everyone who worked so hard to change the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDescent into Midnight has been in development for three years and has been run at conventions and online by both the designers and other Guides. The game works. As with any project, however, there are risks and challenges.\n\nThe core design team all have full time jobs. We are busy people. That said, over the three years of the game's development, we've taken turns driving the project and trust each other's judgment implicitly. Any one of us could finish filling out the text needed to turn the core rules into the book we want in the time allotted.\n\nGood art takes time. Our current projection for the artwork is to have everything for the main book complete by the end of August. Devon and Taylor have been extremely professional, delivering artwork on time and providing estimates that include time for unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, with an experienced art director like Paulomi on the project, we've been able to streamline the art process. \n\nProofing and printing can be complicated. Knowing that, we're working with Jostens for the printing of the books because they specialize in high-quality small print runs and they were recommended to us by others who had used them for RPG printing. We reached out early to the printing agent and are working within the specifications provided by Jostens for the files we'll be submitting to them to ensure they're right the first time.\n\nShipping is complicated and can be expensive. The only physical goods we're shipping are the books (except the origami figures for high level backers), which helps with costs. Shipping within the United States using Media Mail is inexpensive and straightforward. For international shipping, we're paying $10/copy of the shipping costs because those costs vary so much more, and the backer will be responsible for the rest. We would love to offer a flat rate internationally but there's simply too much risk involved to do so.\n\nLarge projects are hard to estimate for. We put together a team of very skilled folks and are paying them fairly, which means overruns on hours are expensive. To offset that, we started with conservative estimates for the hours required and we've built in a buffer in the funding goal for unforeseen costs. Moreover, even in the case of an overrun of a few thousand dollars, the core team is in a financial position to pay the team to complete the work and recoup the costs in long term sales once the book is produced.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "You will be thanked by name in the finished book and on the website.

The numbers aren\u2019t in our favor right now and it\u2019s unlikely to reach the funding goal--but I\u2019m not abandoning this project and you shouldn\u2019t either!\nHere\u2019s the plan!\n1) First of all thank you for backing this Kickstarter! I am deeply invested in all the stories across the Kigari Islands, and I am incredibly thankful that you too want them realized as beautiful printed books.\n2) This Kickstarter is ending but the adventure path will be back! I\u2019ve already learned a lot with this crowdfunding campaign and am revisiting all aspects of the project to fine-tune it. Then in October I\u2019m launching a Kickstarter exclusively for Assault of the Stone Mother, to make it a 100 page book covering all of the Tier 1 (levels 1st-4th) material in the Mother of Monsters Adventure Path. Following that in January of 2020 I\u2019ll launch another project for funding more of the content.\n3) Free Player\u2019s Guide. Instead of the larger Campaign Guide (which is being tabled until a later date) in the next month I\u2019m releasing the Player\u2019s Guide for free on DriveThruRPG to better inform folks about the adventure path. Stay tuned to the Kickstarter project updates here for when that\u2019s available to download!\n4) Join the mailing list so I can reach you when Assault of the Stone Mother goes live on Kickstarter! At the bottom of the ZagoraGames.com website is a subscription form to sign up for the Zagora Games mailing list. The pledge levels are going to be lower (reflecting the reduced scope of the project) as is the funding goal--give me a few weeks to iron things out and I\u2019m positive that we\u2019ll fund the first part of this project in October. If you think you might want to help with the launch day push, definitely get on the mailing list!\nThank you again for backing Mother of Monsters!\nWho We Are\nZagora Games LLC is a tabletop role-playing game publishing company owned by me, Adrian Arduini. To create this product, I assembled a team of published freelance writers who all have experience writing adventures for either 5th edition or Pathfinder. I also looked for the best artists I could find. With affection I call this team the \"Gods of Creation,\" and you can read more about us and view links to our published products at the bottom of the page. \nMy most sincere hope is that you enjoy Mother of Monsters and ask for more\u2014nothing would please me more than to be able to pursue this full-time. \nThis 5th Edition adventure takes heroes from 1st to 15th level, and pits them against the minions of the Mother of Monsters. In this epic struggle the adventurers fight mythical beasts and dark cults, make epic voyages, and delve into the Underworld. If they survive their mythical journey they face off against Naehurdamia herself in a heart-stopping battle that elevates their legend to demigod status!\nThe book for the Mother of Monsters adventure path is approximately 350 pages of excellent Greek-inspired gaming broken down into 8 chapters of content. Each chapter has a beginning and a clearly defined end, so they can be played as part of an ongoing campaign or separated and inserted into other campaigns. Whether using milestones or experience points to level characters, there is more than enough content to smoothly keep the adventurers on track. \nAdventure Summary \nHere's a summary of each chapter. \nStone Mother's Assault\nThe first five levels of the adventure takes place on the island of Boskari where the characters make a name for themselves as heroes and learn about the Cult of Naegara. \nFalse Prophecies \nThe heroes are directed to consult the Oracle of Aelohor for guidance. Instead they find that the region is in chaos! This section is two levels of island-hopping mysteries where the party fights mythical monsters and battles dark cults. \nA Threatened Democracy \nThe party's fight against the Cult of Naegara takes them to the center of democracy and the largest city in the Kagari Islands: Lukatoi. These next two levels are full of urban encounters and political intrigue. \nBosnokan War Machine\nThe heroes are closing in on the leaders of the Cult of Naegara. They now must journey to Bosnoka, the most warlike nation of the Kagari Islands, and convince embattled city-states to make peace. This section is two more levels of high adventure, political intrigue and monster hunting. \nAncient Allies \nThe heroes have ended the war between Bosnoka and Kaluda and stopped the Cult of Naegara; however, they have learned of a greater threat. They now must make an epic journey (like Jason or Odysseus) to seek the advice of an immortal seer that lives beyond known waters. Afterward, they must negotiate with dwarves, elves, and bickering human kings to form an alliance and assemble an army. This section is a level and a half's worth of content starting the party's journey into tier 3 adventuring. \nWar of the Gods \nWar is once again coming to the Kagari Islands\u2014this time in the skies and the ocean depths. The heroes are summoned before the tabiski, the gods of the people of the Kagari Islands. They are drafted into the fight against devils and monstrous sea creatures that threaten all of the island nations. This level and a half of content contains epic battles which will solidify the heroes' names in Kagari legends.\nThe Underworld \nAfter consulting the immortal seer a second time, the party is directed to find and retrieve ancient seals hidden within a vast dwarven ruin deep in the earth. However, they learn that they are not the only ones looking! This section is a level's worth of dungeon-delving excitement. \nMother's Wrath\nThe heroes have the seals to Naehurdamia's prison\u2014now they must get to her to use them. To do this they must navigate a vast underground maze, deal with the tabiski lord of death and then fight one of the most powerful beings in Kagari legends: the Mother of Monsters. This final section is the climactic battle against Naehurdamia, a titan of incredible power. If they survive, the party will take their place as demigods among the pantheon of the Kagari Islands. \nSample Adventure \nHere is a sample of Chapter 1 from Mother of Monsters. In this section the heroes have already made a name for themselves and are summoned before the king to complete several quests.  Click here for a preview PDF from the adventure path! \nThis book of approximately 75 pages details the history of the people of Kagari and gives a world creation story. It includes their legends, the different races that can be found, and gives a full gazetteer of the islands. Each island description talks about its economy, culture, and government structure. In addition, a whole language was created for Mother of Monsters which includes a script and a glossary of terms two and a half pages long. Read about the process behind it here: Worldbuilding: Creating a Language.\nThe Player Options section includes a new human subrace (the piskari); be a warlike pibosnokan or a pikaluda socialite. There's also a new fighter archetype: the phalanx warrior, a combatant that excels in fighting with spear, sword, and shield. The campaign guide also has a strength-focused monk variant with the Pugilist subclass. Be a monk that uses ki to harden the body and take the hit rather than dodge blows\u2014and then deliver devastating strikes with fists of iron! A new feat, Two Weapon Master, equals the playing field for heroes who like to dual wield but have felt overshadowed by great weapon masters and sharpshooters. In addition there are new equipment options like the war spear, penteconter, bireme and trireme, and lastly there are new spells like call companion and steelwood. \nI love a book with good art! I wanted this product to be truly beautiful so I reached out to some exceptionally talented artists. Each chapter starts off with a half or full page of visual scene, and with character portraits, item illustrations, maps, and monster artwork. Mother of Monsters promises to have a piece of original art for every 10 pages of text\u2014for a 350 page book that's 35 pieces of original art! \nThroughout the Mother of Monsters adventure path the heroes are destined to fight on truly engaging battlefields! These maps are rendered in full color for both GMs and players (which will be available as a digital download). \nMap of Lukatoi\nOne of the maps is a fully detailed depiction of the largest city in Kagari: Lukatoi, the center of learning and democracy in the islands. This beautiful map is being crafted by Alyssa Faden, a well-known cartographer with a passion for ancient cities. You can watch her draw Lukatoi on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/alyssafaden/, and see her earlier drawing of Lukatoi here: https://www.facebook.com/pg/AlyssaFadenCartography/videos/.\nHlabon - Citizen Soldier ($2+)\nYou've helped me achieve my dream and for that I thank you very much!

Get lost in the tales of baby-eating manananggals, divine diwatas, and tricksy duwendes.\nWith breathtaking, original artwork, Islands & Aswangs is far from just your supernatural encyclopedia. It's also an engaging reference piece for tabletop roleplaying games with haunting playable encounter stories.\nAt the very minimum, we'll handwrite a thank you to your name.

Postcards! bookmarks!\nStretch goal downloadables include: character sheets, tabletop map, overworld map, and character tokens.\nAs you can see below, most of the funds will be used for printing, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The haunted eyes of past visitors. A missing leader throwing a town into panic. These phenomena lead PCs into a battle against elemental evil \u2013 or, as one character describes it, \u201cPure Sin\u201d. \nThis is the premise of \u201cThe Mirror Tells Her Lies\u201d, a short roleplaying adventure module for the d100 system released under the Open Gaming License. It is also the starting point for Michael Hopcroft Press, a new company I am  founding. I'm Michael Hopcroft, the co-author of HeartQuest: Romantic Roleplaying in the Worlds of Shoujo Manga and The Kevin and Kell Roleplaying Game.\u201cThe Mirror Tells Her Lies\u201d is created under OpenQuest, an open-content version of the d100 rules. OpenQuest plays easily, yet is still compatible with the numerous d100 game systems out there in the wild. \nUnlike a certain set of systems, which I'm pretty sure you already know, d100 games do not have systems that rigidly enforce character morality. Also, for competent PCs death is still in the picture from any combat however one-sided it looks. \n\"The Mirror Tells Her Lies\" takes full advantage of this quality. It is a take on the moral quandaries faced by PCs, in a place where all the dark places of their souls will be used against them. It is a short adventure, playable in one to two sessions, designed for experienced characters and players who love roleplaying their characters as opposed to hacking away at everything they see!\nWhat the Money will be Used For\nAs a startup in a crowded field, I am trying to economize. Since it's a short module, the money will first be used to buy stock art. If enough money is raised, I will be using it to pay for technical assistance on layout. All in all, this will help me put out the module I would like, one I would buy if I were a customer, and the standard of detail expected of this platform.\nIf I get a LOT of money (comparatively), then I wilt make a print version available through DriveThru RPG's Print-on-Demand service.\nFinally, by supporting this Kickstarter you are helping me produce both current and future products. I have plans.\nStretch Goal\n$125 -- Print! If I can reach this amount, I will be making a Print-on-Demand version available through DriveThruRPG's service. I would also add a benefit level that includes it.

The module is written and read for layout, all that is required is a cover, interior art, and the expertise to put it all together in a finished form. Finding those might take a while, resulting in minor delays.\n\nI anticipate releasing the module by the end of September or early October.\n\nMy personal state of health might also delay the project.

Our editors and designers have meticulously studied the Fifth Edition style and mechanics, working very hard to achieve clear, concise language and mechanics for all the creatures, traps, hazards, character challenges and new magic items. \nIn addition, although the encounters are written for Fifth Edition, the concepts, characters, stories and situations can be easily adapted for use with other editions of the world's most popular fantasy roleplaying game, as well as other fantasy themed tabletop RPGs.\n  Out of the Box: Encounters for Fifth Edition contains:\n30 unique encounters \u2014 even more with stretch goals by RPG industry professionals and influencers\nNew monsters \u2014 including new legendary creatures, lairs and regional effects\nNew magic items adventurers will really have to earn \u2014 especially when the monsters are using them!\nMap packs for every encounter to put down on your table\nFlat plastic miniatures for each encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nArc Knight developed a unique print-on-demand process to produce double-sided transparent plastic, leading to the Flat Plastic Miniatures line, and eventually the Roleplaying Spell Effects line.\n                     Enjoy quick reference guides indicate appropriate character level ranges, creatures involved in the encounter, potential encounter locations and treasure. \n\n                    The encounters themselves offer relatable examples to help you understand the dynamic scenarios, guidance and tips for setting the encounter in your campaign world, and a thorough walkthrough of all the moving parts. \n\n                    An addendum for each encounter discusses some of the more unusual complications that might arise from any of these compelling situations.\n\n \nSee some work-in-progress sample pages below!\n    Do you want a gorgeous high-quality map, and durable flat, plastic minis for every single encounter in the book?

That's what you get in The Graverobber's Sword. \nThe Book\nThe Graverobber's Sword is an epic fantasy novel featuring Kera No-Clan, a barbarian living in exile getting by (and getting high) by robbing graves, pilfering tombs, and looting ruins.\n\nWhile digging for fae ash - a valuable narcotic known as \u2018fairy dust\u2019, sought after for its potency and powerful magical side effects - Kera uncovers a living weapon, a psychic sword that calls itself Zephelous.\nZephelous senses a greatness in Kera, and believes she could be the next great champion of light against the forces of darkness. \nKera's pretty sure she can pawn Zephelous for a quick thousand gold pieces, easy. \nOne successful trip to a shady pawnbroker later, Kera celebrates her new-found wealth with a fae ash induced bender. When she finally comes to, she learns that she's wanted for arson. And robbery. And destruction of property, plus about ten other things. Deciding that it's well past time to leave town, Kera also decides it would be a real shame to leave a sword as valuable as Zephelous behind... \nA heist is planned, but unfortunately for Kera it goes poorly - very poorly. More arson is committed, and an innocent young girl is grievously wounded. In short order, Kera finds herself arrested and put in chains, standing before the high priest of Perrus, a man called Speaker Gerhardt. \nThe Speaker gives her an ultimatum; either she agrees to campaign with a motley crew - an irate artificer, his construct companion, a drunken wizard, a representative of Perrus, and the selfsame pawnbroker she tried to rob - with the goal of slaying a dragon to collect it's blood in order to save the girl\u2026\n\n    ...or else she faces execution. \nHaving little choice and armed with Zephelous once again, Kera finds herself finally forced to face the consequences of her actions... and hating every second of it.\nRead the first chapter here\nEd Greenwood approved!\nThe Goal\nMy only goal for this Kickstarter is for it to succeed so I can publish The Graverobber's Sword and begin my career as an author.\nThe Why\nI grew up on fantasy novels. As a teen and preteen, I spent at least as much time on the make believe worlds of Pern, Krynn, Faerun, and Earth-616 as I did in reality, and I cherish every one of the memories that came from them. \nSomewhere between Lord of the Rings and Hexwood, between Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and Kingdom Come, I poked my nose up from the books and said, \u201cI want to tell stories too\u201d, and that was it. I have wanted to be an author ever since. \nTo date, I've published articles, short stories, and a slowly growing pile of TTRPG content, but The Graverobber's Sword will be my debut novel. \nThe Cover\nThe Graverobber's Sword cover, a WIP by Sam Darcy\nWhile the preview image features some lovely stock art, pictured above is the sketch of the book's slated cover. Samantha Darcy, an artist who has kindly agreed to work with me on this campaign, will be providing the art!\nWho is Sam?\nCrafted from only the finest twigs and glamours, Samantha Darcy was well-nurtured in exchange for her father\u2019s freedom. She was beloved by all her neighbors, though her presence would frighten the livestock and cause the room to chill. The families would vie for her attention on the hot summers\u2019 days, and found they preferred the taste of soured milk. Samantha saw her first artistic inspiration behind their straining smiles, and delighted in drawing all their prettiest nightmares.   \nAn illustrator for tabletop roleplaying games, Samantha has risen far above those humble beginnings. She has contributed to works both great and small, including Dragon+ magazine from Wizards of the Coast, the Uncaged Anthology, Rolled & Told, and countless commissions. She currently labors on the Adventurer\u2019s Fashion Primer, a book sorely needed by creatures of every type.   \nSamantha lives in a tower of toadstools and teeth, located somewhere in the strange wilds of Indiana. She dwells there with her loving husband \u2014 a musical clockwork filled with bartered voices, and their darling son \u2014 who she made herself, using only the finest twigs and glamours.\nWork Samples:\nCover, Uncaged Anthology Vol. 1, art by Sam Darcy\nCover, Uncaged Anthology Vol. 2, art by Sam Darcy\nTo see more of Sam's work, click here.\nAs you'll see in below in the breakdown section, the cost of paying Sam to complete the cover art is included in the goal. \nThe Rewards\nWell, for starters, the book! The novel is already written, and digital copies will be sent out as soon as I am physically able to do so once the Kickstarter ends. \nBesides receiving a copy of the book, anyone who backs the project will have their name listed in the back of the book on a special 'thank you' page.  \nThe $$$\n100% of the goal of this Kickstarter go to covering the initial costs of the novel's first print run, as well as paying for Sam's work on the cover art. Funding above and beyond the initial goal would allow me to pay for some advertising, a bigger print run, and maybe some bills so I can write the sequel.\nThe Breakdown\n $2,250.00 USD is the goal for this campaign.\n-$112.50 USD is taken by Kickstarter as their 5% ($2,137.50 remaining)\n-$510.00 USD goes to Sam to pay for her work. ($1,627.50 remaining)\n-$112.50 USD goes to Stripe as their 5% for processing payments ($1,515.00 remaining)\n-$1,515.00 USD goes to Tablo to cover the cost of printing 101 books at the cost of $15.00 apiece. ($0.00 remaining) \nThe Stretch Goals\n If this campaign generates 200 pre-orders, I'll be able to include high quality bookmarks with every softcover order, as well as custom D&D 5th Edition character sheets for each of the main characters with each physical copy. Buying the digital book gets you digital copies!\n If this campaign generates 500 pre-orders, I'll include a limited edition Zephelous item card for D&D 5th Edition, along with a booklet that outlines all the ways it can be used. Buying the digital book gets you a digital copy!\n If the campaign reaches $3750, I'll be able to offer a hardcover edition of The Graverobber\u2019s Sword featuring an alternate cover art. The hardcover will be available for purchase both separately as an add-on, or as an upgrade for softcover pre-orders. \nThe Timeline\n Once the campaign ends, digital copies will be sent out to all backers, as well as submitted to the print team at Tablo. It can typically take 2-3 business days for a book to be approved for printing, and from there the print process takes up to 4 weeks. Once printing is complete, shipping of physical copies and rewards begins, the timing of which will vary depending on your location. While this window is significantly smaller than promised delivery date of November, I'm opting to play it safe and have a chance to deliver early rather than promise maximum efficiency and risk disappointing anyone. \nThe Q&As\nWhere are you getting it printed?\nPrinting is being handled by the wonderful folks at Tablo. I've spoken with their representatives numerous times over the last several weeks, collecting information and learning about the process. \nWho is Tablo?\nTablo is a company that offers many useful resources for authors, up to and including including self publishing services and printing. You can check them out here.\nSeems a little pricey...\nBelieve me, I know. I wish I could make it cheaper, but the book is just too damn thicc.\n\"...The book in its current form is 175,000 words, so it'll be approx 600 pages in paperback. This is lengthy, so prices may be a little high for individual print copies. Printing individual paperback copies will then be between $15 (USD) - $17 (USD) each in print costs for volume runs around the 50-100 book mark... At 200 units the price comes down to $13 (USD) per unit. There are a few volume tiers along the way like this. But you're basically looking at a spread of 50/100/200 being $17/$15/$13 (USD) respectively... At 500 copies pricing drops to $11.70 (USD), and this is the final discount tier for your book :)\" - Ash Davies, CEO and founder of Tablo\nCan I just buy it from you in person?\nOnly if the Kickstarter succeeds!\nCan I just buy it online?\nIf the Kickstarter succeeds, the book will be available for purchase online after the campaign ends and the printing process for pre-orders has been completed.\nDo you make money on this Kickstarter?\nNo, no I do not. However, I will end up with a small surplus of books that I'll be able to distribute to reviewers and bookstores in an effort to get future sales, and -  if I\u2019m lucky - maybe a few extra copies to sell locally (or at conventions). \nAs corny as it is, the Kickstarter succeeding means I get something better than money - I get to achieve a lifelong dream, and that's quite literally priceless. \nSo you don't make ANY money?\nAny books sold above and beyond the initial goal will net me a few dollars apiece, and if the pre-orders are more digital than physical I'll end up with more books on hand - which is good. If I'm lucky, there will be enough physical book orders that the cost of printing will come down a little and I'll be able to pocket a few dollars per copy.\nIf I'm very lucky, I'll find an agent or a publishing deal.\nMy goal here isn't to try to get rich quick on a Kickstarter campaign, it's to establish myself as an author, and hopefully take the first step towards being able to write full time!\nSo... why Kickstarter, then?\nAs I showed in the Breakdown, self-publishing costs money. This campaign represents my efforts to raise that money in the form of taking pre-orders (by backing me at the \u201cSigned Paperback + Digital Copy\u201d level). Of course, I'm not going to lie and say there isn't a not-so-small part of me that hopes I'll sell enough books to be able to pay the bills for a few months, but as I said, my only goal for this campaign is for it to succeed.\nMy main goal, post-Kickstarter campaign, is to get the sequel out in as timely a manner as possible (I'm looking at you, George), and if I'm able to write full-time I could make it happen within a year.\nHow do I know? It took about a year to get this one done, and I'm only going to get better. \nAt the end of the day, this campaign succeeding means that I'll have successfully released my first novel, and that's a big deal. \nMaybe only a big deal to me, but I'm fine with that.\nAre there any more planned stretch goals? \nIf the campaign exceeds the current stretch goals, I would love to be able to fund making more content. Specifically, I'd love to be able to afford to do a comic book or webcomic!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project there are always risks, but in this case the book is already written.

It was incredibly popular, with nearly 2,500 backers. Now we're bringing you the sequel: nine new player classes in A TOUCH MORE CLASS, a 100-page full color book! \nYou can get either or both books from this Kickstarter, plus a unique set of cards for use with the cardcaster class in the original book.\n A TOUCH OF CLASS (REVISED): The original book has been revised and updated, and includes the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, and occultist.\n A TOUCH MORE CLASS: This new book contains the bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant,  and tinkerer.\nPlay as the brilliant savant, the black-powder gunfighter, or travel with exotic animal companions as the monster tamer! Harness the power of your environment as the geomancer, or create wondrous inventions as the tinkerer!\nAs with all of our Kickstarters, the books are ready. You'll get the PDFs within minutes of the Kickstarter campaign ending, and we'll commission the print run for the actual books the moment the Kickstarter funds clear! You won't have to wait for your rewards! \nThese new classes are fully detailed with exciting class-themed abilities! Each of these classes also contains a range of subclasses to further customize them. In this book you'll find the bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant, and tinkerer.\nWant to read more? Find out more over on our website, download this free 12-page preview of the savant from DriveThruRPG, or this preview of the geomancer! \nThese nine classes originally appeared in EN5ider, the 5th Edition patreon. Since their publication we've revised and updated each of them after plenty of feedback from the community, and now they're ready to be presented in a beautiful full-color softcover book! Each is a full class along with subclasses and all the roleplaying information you'll need to play them at the table. \n Bloodweaver: Macabre Magician. Bloodweavers fuel their magical powers with their own blood, enhancing their own prowess, healing or bolstering allies, and flaying open their foes. They can sense the presence of creatures of flesh and bone, resist the cold reach of death, and manipulate a target\u2019s blood to spectacular, deadly effect. Choose from the Bloodbinder, Crimson Witch, and Scarlet Reaper subclasses!\n Fatebender: Destiny\u2019s Chosen. At the extreme edges of fate\u2019s tapestry, fatebenders pull upon its fraying threads, tugging at the strands of chance. Fatebenders manipulate their own dice rolls as well as those of allies and enemies, further relying on luck to make uncanny discoveries, avoid lethal attacks, and make the most of their own strikes. Subclasses include the Mascot, Jinx, and Weaver!\n Gemini: Two\u2010Faced Warrior. Evading and confounding enemies, gemini create dangerous semi\u2010real multiples of themselves and copy their foes\u2019 techniques. Their duality affects more than how they wage war however, and each embodies two major contrasting ideals, never certain which will be at the fore the next time they wake. Will you select the Atavist, the Equalist, or the Reluctant Hero?\n Geomancer: Nature\u2019s Hearthmage. These mages turn the surrounding elements into potent weapons and tools and fuel their spells with the primal components of creation. Geomancers can also protect companions from harm and draw upon nature outside of battle to reveal reality\u2019s secrets. Four distinct orders\u2014the Conqueror, the Apothecary, the Architect, and the Rune Knight.\n Gunfighter: Black Powder Desperado. These warriors shoot their way across the field of battle, pausing only long enough to aim their next bullets. Gunfighters are adept with the guns they choose to master, picking off targets hidden behind cover with precise shooting and aiming telling shots that leave enemies with catastrophic wounds. The Bushwacker, Drifter, and Maverick make your choice of subclasses!\n Lodestar: Fractured Soul Given Form. In combat lodestars are poetry in motion, their innate powers bringing both wonder and woe. To keep from unraveling into madness these fractured souls must train and hone their skills, becoming masters of body and mind\u2014and their lodestones, magical spheres used to attack, defend, and more. The lodestar chooses from three methods: Control, Imagination, or Instinct.\n Monster Tamer: Companion of Beasts. Monster tamers bond with monstrous pets, whether beasts, exotic aberrations, slimes, or even draconic in nature! Though significantly weaker on their own, tamers with companions make for a potent and unique addition to any group of adventurers able to tolerate the presence of a monster in their midst. Select from the Animalist regimen, Monstrous regimen, and Oddball regimen.\n Savant: Mind Over Matter. Sometimes saving the day means weaponizing knowledge. Savants are brilliant detectives, iconic martial artists, and adventurous physicians, each utilizing genius where others rely on magic or brute power. Repositories of lore, savants also use canny combat tricks to put enemies at a disadvantage. You might be an Adversary, a Chirurgeon, or a Coordinator.\n Tinkerer: Engineer of Wonder. Tinkerers bring life to impressive contraptions, create incredible devices, and forge legendary destinies! When not making or improving mundane items, tinkerers use their technical genius to unleash elemental fury upon their foes, relying upon their own brilliance to resist any magic that might subvert their will. Steam Knights, Bombardiers, and Mechanics make up the tinkerer's choice of subclasses!\nAnd if that's not enough, for those who don't already have A TOUCH OF CLASS, we have a revised edition of that book containing the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, and occultist classes!  \nEach class has been tweaked and updated. \nThe cardcaster has been restructured to be more approachable.\nNew archetypes for the occultist and noble.\nExtra flavor and guides for making adventurers. \n Alchemist: Scientific Sorcery. The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new advanced studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\n Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three subclasses: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters. \n Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two dark paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more! \n Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: Beasts, Plants, or Entropy. \n Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three essences\u2014the Doppleganger, the Primordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire. \n Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\n Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: Abomination, Vampire, or Werecreature! Delve into the dark and secret creatures of the night, cursed to exist as monstrous beings shunned by the world. \nA TOUCH OF CLASS got 4.7 out of 5 stars from customers in its initial print run on Amazon!\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Brand new, original and fully developed classes that will make the other players at your table jealous.

When a paladin turns from the light, flaws of aggression, blind loyalty, and na\u00efvet\u00e9 provide corruptions of the virtues of bravery, loyalty, and wisdom.

Deities from ancient cultures\u2014the Aztecs, Egyptians, Greeks, and Welsh\u2014were rightfully wary of the gods of misfortune.

Carving out a domain of your own has been a part of the game since the beginning, and Ultimate Kingdoms is an ideal supplement to cover what your character can do when you get home from that epic journey or drag your loot out of the dungeon. There's more to the hero life than just buying the sharpest sword or the mightiest staff. Your character should really be somebody in the campaign world, make their mark, and build a legacy that will last, and that's where Ultimate Kingdoms comes in! \nThis hardback book contains the rules you need to build a kingdom and a legacy for your character! Legendary Games has compiled over 400 pages of our best-selling Ultimate line to bring you an awesome array of options for your characters outside of dungeon delving, including:\n Kingdoms  - core rules for creating cities, nations, and armies\n Ultimate Rulership  - expanded cities, improvements, edicts, events, governments\n Ultimate Battle - expanded tactics, command boons, terrain, environment, \n Ultimate War  - expanded commanders, sieges, air and sea battles, combined arms\n Ultimate Factions - power and politics, secret missions, alliances, influence, treason\n Ultimate Relationships - build robust relationships with key NPCs\n Ultimate Strongholds - classic castles and fantastic fortresses\n Ultimate Ships - ship-to-ship combat, fast-play fleet combat, ship modifications\n Ultimate Commander - a brand-new character class leading their squad on adventures!\n plus stretch goals featuring brand-new content, including the long-awaited Ultimate Armies rules for mercenary bands, logistics, a bestiary of troops, and more! \nThese rules are a terrific expansion to what's possible in your game, but they also are anchored to the character and party level of a campaign, especially when it comes to rules for ships, fortifications, and how your heroes connect with the key NPCs of their fantasy world! \nIn addition to the complete 5th Edition (5E) kingdoms and warfare rules, Ultimate Kingdoms is also available for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (1st Edition), incorporating all of our amazing expansions to the base kingdom-building and mass combat rules presented in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Campaign, authored by Legendary Games' very own Jason Nelson. It also includes expansions of subsystems from that volume like downtime, buildings, contacts, honor, and more, integrating them into how you run your kingdom.  The Pathfinder version of Ultimate Kingdoms will be a bit smaller than the 5E version, as we won't be reprinting the material from the Ultimate Campaign rulebook. \nAs the campaign continues, the book will get bigger and better with stretch goals aplenty, making the book itself more amazing, unlocking new artwork, and even creating new accessories to make building your kingdom even more fun! And we've got an awesome array of special guest authors lined up, including luminaries from the history of D&D, Pathfinder, and more like Ed Greenwood, Elisa Teague, Jonathan Tweet, and more!\nBest of all, this book is already written! The stretch goals include new previously unpublished material that's already done and new artwork, but our Kings, Queens, and special guests will have their new material in its own chapter at the end of the book, so layout can start while the Kickstarter is already going! You can make this book bigger and better, but it's already ready to rock! \nPledging for Ultimate Kingdoms is pretty self-explanatory: Choose your favorite system and then choose PDF or Print+PDF! That's about it! \nThe King (5E) and Queen (Pathfinder) pledges grant you all the following noble rewards! \n Create your kingdom (600 words): Describe the nation you rule or your own mercenary company, guild, secret society, or religion! \nDesign your own royal crest, flag, insignia, or sacred item, brought to life by our artists!\nCommission a royal portrait of yourself or your favorite character!\nBe listed among the Kings and Queens by your chosen title in the credits! \nHave your book personally signed and numbered!\nLegendary Games swag bag plus unlockable bonus items get added to your pledge FREE!\nBecause of the time sensitivity in getting this book laid out in timely fashion, we ask that you inform us of your choice as soon as possible!

For most domestic shipments, this covers everything and your book will be sent to you as soon as its available. For international customers and backers who pledge for multiple books, this $8 prepaid shipping credit is applied first to their shipping and handling cost and they will be invoiced for any additional amount when the book is ready to ship.  \nYou can find US international postal rates for a 3-pound hardcover to 5-pound multi-volume package here: https://postcalc.usps.com/\nWhy not Pathfinder 2nd Edition?\nThe kingdom-building and mass combat core rules for Pathfinder 2nd Edition won't be published until the end of 2020, so it's too far in the future to be part of this project. We definitely will publish expansions to those rules once they exist. \nWill there be HeroLab support for this book?\nThere will not be HeroLab files created for the new Ultimate Kingdom books at this time. However, you can other HeroLab files like the Mythic Hero's Handbook, Mythic Monster Manual, Mythic Spell Compendium, and Gothic Campaign Compendium from LoneWolf today! http://www.makeyourgamelegendary.com/hero-lab-files/\nHeroLab and Realmworks support for the Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium is in review right now at LoneWolf for both Pathfinder and 5E, but since it is not currently available we are not offering it as part of this project. We will definitely send out a campaign update to all backers linking them to the LoneWolf site as soon as each version is ready!  \nWill there be virtual tabletop (Fantasy Grounds, Roll20, etc.) support for this book?\nKingdoms (5E), which provides the base kingdom-building and mass combat rules for 5E, is available as an add-on to your pledge for $10 (Save 33% off), and is available now directly from Fantasy Grounds - https://www.fantasygrounds.com/store/product.php?id=LGFG5EKINGDOMS.\nWe are looking forward to getting additional kingdom-building and mass combat resources uploaded to both of these systems, and if you are skilled at creating file packets for either Fantasy Grounds or Roll20 we'd love to hear from you at rfvrpg@gmail.com and makeyourgamelegendary@gmail.com!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven that art and writing are complete (aside from any extra items sponsored by backers), the risks on this project are very low. We've taken to heart lessons from prior projects and applied that wisdom here, getting all the heavy lifting done ahead of time. The layout people working on this project also are solely dedicated to this project right now and not multitasking on any other Legendary Games projects, and they are beginning layout now, while the Kickstarter is still underway, rather than waiting until after it is over.\n\nWith a small company, sudden illness or incapacity is always a possibility and could create delays, but reducing the remaining work to finishing layout, adding any sponsored material at the end of the process, and then preparing the print-on-demand files (rather than doing a full print run) greatly reduces any potential for delay.\n\nLegendary Games has run numerous crowdfunded projects before, completing all but two on time or early. Fulfillment of the massive Legendary Planet adventure series is finally nearing completion.\n\nDelays in printing and shipping are always possible but unlikely, as our experience with previous Kickstarters has allowed us to set up several options for getting your books to you!\n\nThe print option we use depends on the response to the project. If we have a low number of print backers, we can have a print-on-demand option available this summer. However, we expect a strong response to this project and anticipate an overseas print run, with print books likely ready to send out to backers by December.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Peasant... for now!", "descp": "Thank you for being a backer, now you can receive updates on this project and make add-on pledges through our backer survey after the project ends!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["83 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Baron (5E)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["238 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Earl (Pathfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Marquis (Both Systems)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["45 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Star Senator (Pathfinder/Starfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\nStar Kingdoms (SF) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Duke (5E)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["395 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Prince (Pathfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["163 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "Royal Court (Both Systems)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["65 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "Star Prince (Pathfinder/Starfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\nStar Kingdoms (SF) Hardback\nStar Kingdoms (SF) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 400 or more", "title": "King (5E)", "descp": "Your Majesty!

The darker the shadow becomes, the world gets until the Destroyer of all Things finally emerges from the Void to swallow the world and everything in it. Are these the end times as foretold?\nPerhaps. Perhaps not.\nAcross the lands of R\u00fbl, great patrons have come forth to answer the threat posed by the Eternal Shadow by throwing back the darkness and sealing the rifts to the Demon Lord\u2019s realm. The Great Druid rouses the forests fight against demon and cultist alike, while the Queen of Faeries rallies the last of her children to make a final stand loosed by the growing unrest. These and others join forces to find the light they need to safeguard Urth for the rest of time.\nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative board game designed by Adam Doochin and Dan Heinrich, where the patrons of R\u00fbl must come together to fight against the Demon Lord before this dreadful entity breaks through the cracks in reality and destroys the world. The patrons recruit heroes to undertake quests in the hopes of gaining treasures crucial for driving back the darkness. The Demon Lord, however, has many agents at its beck and call and sends cultists and demons to thwart these heroes\u2019 efforts. It\u2019s a race against time and the patrons must work together if Urth can be saved. Based on the popular horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord, the board game gives you an all-new way to fight against the apocalypse. \nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative race game for two to five players, with optional rules for one player or six. A typical game takes about an hour to play.\nWe need your help to make this game a reality. Even though the game has been designed and thoroughly tested, We still need to edit the rulebook and cards, finalize the layout, acquire a few more art assets, and, of course, pay for the printing and assembly. Given the expenses involved in these steps, We're asking for your help to bring this game to tables all over the world.\nThe best way to help is to choose a pledge level and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. Provided the project funds, your dollars go toward covering the expenses incurred as we finishing this game. Now, if the unthinkable happens and the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and the project doesn\u2019t happen. I do understand that not everyone can help, but if you believe in this project, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could help spread the word.   \nWant to see how the game works? Sure you do! Grab a prototype rule book here. Note, this is not the final rule book.\n(prototype)\nIn Against the Shadow, you become one of the mighty patrons of R\u00fbl, an individual who ranks among the most powerful in the land. You might become the High Jarl of the Jotun or the Faerie Queen. Each patron has special abilities that give you advantages in play.  \n(prototype)\nTo fight the Demon Lord, you need heroes. You recruit heroes from the land, finding dwarfs and clockworks, humans and goblins, and many other characters drawn from the pages of Shadow of the Demon Lord. Heroes, though, are meant to serve and fighting the Shadow means few will survive!\n(prototype)\nAs a patron, you issue commands that direct your heroes and change the circumstances in your favor, either to give you a much-needed edge against the Demon Lord or to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat! \n(prototype)\nAdventure awaits the heroes under your control. You send them into deadly situations to wrest treasures from terrifying locations and to find the light the world so desperately needs. Beware, though, for the Demon Lord has many tricks to thwart your efforts!\n(prototype)\nWhen your heroes complete quests, slay enemies, and explore the land, they find potent treasures to help you throw back the encroaching darkness.  \n(prototype)\nThe Demon Lord, however, will not give up without a fight. As you play the game, the Dark Lord of the Void places curses on the world, making the game harder to defeat. \n(prototype)\nAgainst the Shadow introduces a number of powerful patrons, each one the great movers and shakers in the lands of R\u00fbl. Patrons of the Demon Lord reveals their stories, histories, motivations, and servants. Packed with new lore, this 32-page PDF supplement is the perfect expansion for creating epic adventure for the Shadow of the Demon Lord roleplaying game.\nStay tuned for details!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the table below.

We're ready to help thousands of children around the world, but we need your help! \nCritical Core is a tabletop role-playing game designed to help kids on the autism spectrum build social skills and confidence. It's a great way for parents to engage with their children at home, and for professionals and experienced gamers to use as a group social skills tool.\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and co-developed with autism advocates, parents, therapists, and educators.\nPLAY\n\nSuitable for cognitive age 9+, including teens and adults.\n2 to 4 players recommended, plus one adult that acts as the facilitator.

Plus a few extra surprises that will unlock at higher levels!\nCritical Core is fit-for-purpose, designed to help neurodiverse players get started and stay engaged. At the same time, facilitators are provided with the right tools to make the experience effective without it 'feeling like therapy'.\nEach encounter the players face is targeted to help build strength in areas that are related to challenges associated with autism spectrum disorder.\nCritical Core is scaffolded around the DIR/Floortime model, and game encounters map to the FEDC framework. (Function Emotional Developmental Capacities)\nBut all of this is under the hood. At its heart, Critical Core is simply FUN.\nPLAY\n\nWhen kids engage in a world of fantasy play they are free to explore new ideas and relationships in a safe and fun sandbox. Skills learned while playing Critical Core can last a lifetime.\n Although designed for kids on the autism spectrum, Critical Core is just as beneficial (and fun) for all kids. It's an easy stepping stone into the fantastic world of tabletop role-playing games.\nCritical Core is built on established developmental frameworks and distills seven years of practical gaming therapy experience into an easy-to-use format. It is an amazing tool that can be used at home, at school, in a therapist\u2019s office, or out in the community. And above all, it's great fun.\nPLAY\n\n\nGame to Grow - Adam Davis (MA Ed) and Adam Johns (LMFT)\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) organization that runs tabletop RPG therapy gaming groups every week.

We also have some final artwork and design work to take care of, and of course there is the physical production.

Kickstarter is important for two reasons:\n First, you are an amazing community, and if anyone can help spread the word about the incredible benefits of role-playing games, it's you!\n  Second, there are costs involved in developing and manufacturing Critical Core, so Kickstarter helps us to produce this amazing project!\nPerhaps you already have a favorite role-playing game and are wondering how Critical Core can fit into your gaming life. Like many of you, we are avid gamers and have many games we\u2019ve loved for years. \nCritical Core can improve the games you\u2019re already playing.\nIf you\u2019re already playing an established RPG with your kids, your students, or your community, Critical Core can still help you improve your game and boost your outcomes. \nCritical Core contains a rule system, designed to be easily accessible to a neuro-diverse population as well as new facilitators, but that\u2019s not all! If you are already established using a game that you enjoy and find effective, you\u2019ll be able to use the other components of Critical Core that are designed to support a game facilitator in helping their players learn and grow.\nCritical Core contains a unique module design where in-game scenarios are targeted to real-world development outcomes. This can be translated to most established role-playing games. Additionally, the Critical Core kit includes a facilitator\u2019s guide which contains the learnings of the past seven years of facilitating role-playing games for social growth.\n  Do I need prior experience with role-playing games to run Critical Core?\n                          No. Critical Core is a 'rules-light' tabletop RPG, and the instructions will be designed to help brand new Game Masters quickly learn how to facilitate games that are enriching and fun. We are also planning to release video guides and tutorials to help you out! \nI'm already playing tabletop RPGs with my kids!\nAwesome! You already know the amazing benefits we're talking about. You also know from experience, that tabletop RPGs can be easy to pick up and play, but learning how to be a great Game Master can be challenging, especially for new players.\nWhy not use an established role-playing game platform?\nCritical Core's rule set is adapted from D&D's 5th Edition Open SRD. We have taken out some of the complexity for new players and Game Masters. Think of Critical Core as an entry-level platform: easier for parents, schools, and clinics to pick up and play.\nAre you trying to replace my favorite game?\nNo way! We see Critical Core as a stepping stone to the wide world of RPG gaming. Actually, we hope that as kids grow familiar and comfortable with the system, they can move on to your favorite platform. If you're already using some of the great games out there, then more power to you!\nSo how is Critical Core different?\nWe have applied our experience and best practices to help children (and caregivers) have the most effective and fun experience possible.\nMeticulously designed adventure content to help empower kids with social and problem-solving challenges.\nGame encounters, guidebooks, mechanics heavily influenced by established developmental frameworks (DIR/Floortime).\nRules have been adapted to be easier for new players and Game Masters to pick up.\nAdventures divided into 'one-shot' chapters that can be completed in 90 minutes.\nGoldilocks Content'  -  not too complex/scary and not too easy/cartoony.

I grew up pouring over and daydreaming about the gods and monsters that filled the pages of the 1st edition AD&D Deities and Demigods.  It was not only one of the foundations of my introduction to Dungeons & Dragons but of mythology as well.  The seeds planted by the pages of that book grew into a lifelong fascination with deities and mythology.  Soon after I had been captivated by Deities and Demigods. I discovered the gloriously bizarre world of Frank Mentzer's Immortal Rules and realized we aren't limited to contemplating the lives of the gods - we could become them!  My goal for Ascension is to bring the wonder and excitement I had for mythic gaming in the early '80s to the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.  Throw in a bit of flavor inspired by the 2nd edition's Legends and Lore/Monster Mythology and 3rd edition's Epic Level Handbook and we have the foundation for the definitive Immortals/Epic supplement for 5th edition!\nSealtiel, the Defender\nWhy Ascension? Ascension offers a new type of gaming for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. Current epic options simply extend the game through feats, boons, and levels; they don\u2019t offer a fundamentally different way of playing the game. Ascension not only delivers epic equipment and monsters that can be used in a more traditional game, it also provides new rules and guidelines to extend the game into new spheres of play. With Ascension you can become gods and explore the multiverse with power and abilities beyond mortal comprehension.  It is a 5th edition epic homage to Set 5: Immortal Rules!\nZehir, the Midnight Serpent\nAscension will be a quarterly RPG zine (old-school black & white, 5.5 x 8.5) focusing on epic and immortal gaming for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.  Each issue will be 32-48 pages of epic and immortal goodness featuring:  rules for playing gods; lore, stats, and art for at least 4 deities/epic monsters; and mythic relics and artifacts for your epic games.  The primary goals of Ascension  are two-fold: \nProvide epic monsters and guidelines that can be used with the standard 5th edition rules and some the existing 3rd party epic supplements.\nProvide a set of variant rules and guidelines for taking characters and monsters beyond the realms of mortals.  Allowing players to grow their characters from mere demigods to the heights of the greater gods or even pantheon heads. These variant rules sit on top of the 5e chassis allowing players to shed the trapping of levels and class and instead embark on the quest to gain epic ranks, worship, and increase their Authority and Influence among mortals and Immortals a like.\nTake your characters and games where 5th edition has never gone before with Ascension \u2013 the Codex of Immortals.\nSample Deity: Athena ( 3 of 5 page spread)\nIs there anything for mere mortals?\nYes, there is! Though most of the content in Ascension is geared for epic gaming, there is content available for lower-tier games. Such as:\n Relics and Artifacts: The epic items are presented in a format that is usable by mortals and gods, with the power of the items increasing with the power of the wielder.\n Deities: Each deity entry has a section on its church and clergy. This section will include the typical classes of the clergy, cleric domains, extra spells granted, and sometimes new spells, class features, feats, or boons. \n Epic Monsters: Not all the monsters presented will be god-level threats. There will be monsters in the CR 21-30 range (including avatars of each god). That can still be a nuisance to a god and a real pain to mortals.\n Minions: There will be, on occasion, entries (lore, art, & stats) for servitors of the gods and other epic entities which are typically in the CR 10-20 range.  For example, there will be lore, stats, and art for warden archons as the prime servitors of Sealtiel, the Defender.\nWarden Archon\nOnce funded and first issue completed, the zine will become available on  DriveThruRPG and other outlets.  Print versions will be available shortly after release of the PDF issue.  Future issues will release at approximately three-month intervals.  Backers get their copy of the PDF and print version at the discounted rate provided by the reward level chosen (included with your reward).

The ultimate race creator lets you quickly make your very own player race. Want to play a were-iguana? How about a robot-scorpion? Elf-ghost with psychic powers? How about a manticore-man? We've done our best to cover just about every trait a character could possibly have. So if you can come up with it, you can play it. The Ultimate Race Creator is compatible with 5th edition D&D but can be easily adapted to other editions or systems.\n What we've done is come up with hundreds of traits. These traits are just like core race ones you're familiar with that define the racial abilities and features of a playable race. Then we've divided all those traits into categories, like mobility, offensive, age, or magic. You select one trait from each category and you've now got the traits that represent your brand new race! \n Well, to start with you have 10 racial points or RP to use on creating your race. Each trait has a cost associated with it, the more powerful the ability the more points it costs. So you'll have to balance your race out with weaknesses if you want a whole bunch of flashy features. Using these built-in checks and balances, these races avoid the min-maxing and common pit-falls that other systems have fallen into. A race made with 10 racial points is balanced with the existing core races, but you can use more for games where monstrous players are appropriate. We won't tell you that you can't make a 40 RP mechanical tiger race with demon powers and chainsaws for hands, but your GM can.\nSo GM's, rest assured that nothing your players make using this book will break your game (unless you decide that would be fun).\nWe started with a set of traits for the \"Beastmen\". It includes 24 pages of traits that cover everything furry, feathered, or beast-like. With it you can play as centuars, minotaurs, satyrs, Kitsune, panda-folk, moose-men, or just about any other variation of man and beast that you can think of. This was our first go at the concept so there's a bit of cleanup and refinement we'd like to do, but it shows off the creator system pretty well and it's completely free! Click the link below and give it a look.  \nFor the second book in the series we wrote the Scalykind Race Creator, 32 pages full of all the traits you need for a zillion varieties of any kind of dragon people, serpentfolk, boggarts, grippli, medusa-kin, hydrafolk, and every kind of reptilian or amphibious traits we could think of. Find it here:  \n We want to provide players and GMs with the widest variety of options available with the Ultimate Race Creator. When funded, the Ultimate Race Creator will include the contents of the Beastmen and Scalykind race creators, alongside 3 new race creator books, Robots, Insects and Gothic.  \nThis race creator will give you all the traits for anything and everything metal and mechanical. You'll be able to play as steampunk automatons, futuristic androids, magic-infused golems, and empty suits of armor. We need this book for the chainsaw hands alone. \nThis race creator gives us all the traits for the creepy and crawly range of the animal kingdom. This is where we'll put all the scorpion tails, the spider webbing, the wall crawling, and the butterfly wings. Play as great big beetle-folk, actual spider men, and mystical moths. Do you want to play as ants? Because this is how you get ants. \nIn this book we will include every trait you could possibly need for anything of the spooky variety. We have lycanthropy, ghosts and spirits, every variety of vampire blood and a ghoulish collection of undead traits like skeletal bodies and zombified flesh. You will find everything related to horror tropes and undead or cursed characters right in here. \nIncludes both the serious horror and spooky skeleton styles.\nWe admit that a spider robot character might not be appropriate for all campaigns. We separated the books like this to allow GMs to easily pick and choose what parts of the race creator to let their players access. It also lets us lovingly spread lore and fluff onto each book, which gives you even more content to add to your world. Each book will average about 30 odd pages, including 4 fully detailed pre-built example races alongside original artwork and in-depth lore.\nBecause having this many options is incredible! As a GM, if you have an idea for a race this book will give you everything you need for a finished and polished race in less time than it takes to roll up a character. Or you can turn it over to your players and just tell them to have fun and create something! You can do all of this without the worrying about balancing or keeping min-maxing in check because it's already been done for you. After all, the whole point of this project is to give GMs and players more options with less work. \nWe're also putting in a bunch of useful extras into the Ultimate Race Creator. \nEver wanted to play a half-orc half-dragonborn? How about a vengeful dwarf ghost or an elvish were-owl? We are going to dissect the core racial traits and give them point values just as if they were made using the Ultimate Race Creator. This allows you to create half-races, create undead and enchanted subraces, or any other mix and matched creation you can come up with.\nWe're also creating a set of 30 playable example races made using the full Ultimate Race Creator, both to show off what the book can do and to supply you with a ton of ideas!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we are adding the Plantfolk Race Creator. It's Filled with all the traits you'll need for Ents and treefolk, mushroom men of countless shapes and sizes, flowering knights, and protectors of the forest. This book will have everything leafy, bark armored, or showering spores.\n If we reach this stretch goal, we will add the Divine-Touched Race Creator. In this book we will be expanding on aasimars and tieflings, and every other race whose fate has been altered by gods or fiends. Have your race infused with a plague demon's curse, or blessed with the judgement of the scales of fate. Do you want races blessed or cursed by the gods? I know I do.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will add the Fey-Folk Race Creator. We will include traits for everything that the feywild holds, including pixies, sprites, redcaps, sinister banshees, and the feymad elven courts. If it's tiny and or whimsical, you'll be able to create it with this book.\n If we reach this stretch goal we will add the Aquatic Race Creator. Merfolk of every variety and traits that cover absolutely everything that swims scuttles or floats beneath the waves. Create crabfolk, stinging jellyfish men, or lure people to their doom with anglerfish-like lures. If it's beneath the waves this book has what you need.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will add Dr. Vanvid's Mad Race Creator. This mad scientist's creations are certifiably insane so your race can have the most bizarre traits imaginable. Make an ooze race, have a race that's just a sphere from another dimension, how about a colony of tiny monsters in a trench coat? This book covers all the traits that just don't fit into anything else, and must have come from a deranged mind.\nIt's the final frontier, there's no stranger traits than alien traits. If we reach this stretch goal, we will add the Alien Race Creator. Including the weirdest of the weird, this book will contain traits for surviving in a vacuum, bizarre space-faring life, colors out of space, and more big gray heads and antennas than you can shake a ray-gun at.\nWe're posting a bounty! If we reach this stretch goal we'll be adding 10 NPCs with races built using the Ultimate Race Creator. This rogues gallery will include everything from serious villains and heroes to bizarre and wacky characters. Each one will include lore, a statblock and an original sketch by our talented artists.   \nI'm really excited about getting to add this one. If we reach this stretch goal we will add the ultimate pet creator! This is an extra rule set that allows you to create your own familiars and animal companions using the traits found in the ultimate race creator! I know I want a pet crocodile-squid, or how about a haunted lantern familiar? I can't wait to get to this one.\nThe core races get their own special backgrounds and feats, why can't yours? If we reach this stretch goal, we will add 2 new unique racial backgrounds and 2 new racial feats to each race creator book. That's a total of 20 new backgrounds and 20 new feats for you to customize your new characters even further!  \nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will add a full page color artwork created by the talented Rachel Maduro and Nick Carry for each race creator book! That's 10 more full color artworks in addition to the full color covers. With those the Ultimate Race Creator will now include 20 beautiful pieces of art depicting fantastical and amazing races for us all to enjoy!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will include a whole new set of mechanics to the Ultimate Race Creator! With all these amazing abilities tied to racial traits, we wanted to use them with existing characters. With the new mutation and augment system, you'll be able to provide magical mutations to existing characters within your campaign or have them gain traits against their will through horrible curses or transfiguring magics. \nThis stretch goal will also include the RANDOM RACE GENERATOR!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will include the random race generator, a series of tables that handle the complex steps of the point system and allow you to create a fully randomized race with a series of die rolls. Create something truly random and see if it sparks your imagination!\nPeople have been asking about it and we aim to deliver. If we reach this stretch goal we will add a physical print option provided using the DriveThruRPG print on-demand service. \nEach backer that at a pledge level that includes the PDF copies of the book (basically all of them) will also receive at-cost print vouchers for those books. \nThis doesn't mean your printed copies are free (we would bankrupt ourselves if we did that) but it does mean you'll be able to get these books for only the cost of printing and shipping them, we don't take a cut. For just the baseline costs of printing you will be able to get freshly printed copies of the Ultimate Race Creator or any of the component race creators!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will create an animation with our favorite DM (voiced by the inscrutable Jeremy Connal) personally thanking each and every backer by name. He didn't think we'd get anywhere near this many supporters so if we reach the lofty heights of 600 backers we will all get to enjoy his increasing frustration with his endless hours in the recording booth. If you want to see that as much as we do then go spread the word! \nSo after some due consideration and a day's worth of brainstorming for more content we've come up with the lore generator! If we reach this stretch goal we will add the lore generator, a set of mad-lib style bits of backstory and lore that you can randomly roll up for your races. We're already providing a ton of lore in each book but the idea of a FULLY randomized race sounds amazingly fun.\nSo Who are You Guys Anyway?\nWe are LootTheBoss!

Altogether, we gave you over 900 pages of incredible material to blow the lid off your Pathfinder campaign with literally thousands of mythic feats, spells, monsters, magic items, psionic powers, class features, path abilities, skills, traps, curses, and more to make your campaign dynamic and cinematic in ways it never was before. It was amazing and we thank everyone who made it possible.\nSince then we've continued creating even more magnificent mythic material, bringing you even more paths, monsters, magic, and more from around the world, and the time has come at last to close the circle and bring it all home to you. Welcome to MYTHIC MANIA II !!!\nMythic Mania II encompasses two books rather than three, and incorporates mythic material for hardbacks like the Advanced Class Guide, Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium, Horror Adventures, Occult Adventures, Ultimate Intrigue, and Ultimate Wilderness, as well as potentially adding in more material from the Adventurer\u2019s Guide, Monster Codex, Planar Adventures, Villain Codex, Book of the Damned, Pirate Campaign Compendium, and more! \nMythic Character Codex \u2013 Three new mythic paths - the bound, mystic, and reluctant hero - along with over a thousand new mythic path abilities, hybrid class features, feats, spells, magic items, and more! \nMythic Monster Manual II \u2013 Over 200 mythic monsters\u2026 and maybe a whole lot more! Plus appendices and bonus content!\nWe\u2019ve had our team working behind the scenes on this project for months now, and we\u2019re pleased to inform you that THE WRITING AND ART ARE DONE. That includes both the primary core of the product and the planned stretch goals. Material for bonus goals is already written - it's just a matter of seeing how big these books can become and how much stuff we can include! There will be no lag time waiting to catch upon things to get finished with the authors. It\u2019s already in the can. The more pledges we get, the bigger the books will get and the more material will be included, but art and text is already finished for all of the material we plan to include.\nPDF-ONLY PLEDGES\nFor those who go PDF only, you have the following choices of which books to get:\n$30 - Monster Master: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Monster Manual II.\n$30 - Mythic Maven: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex.\n$50 - Mythic Master: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex and Mythic Monster Manual II.\n$50 - Monster Master II: You get the PDF versions of the Mythic Monster Manual II and the original Mythic Monster Manual.\n$50 - Mythic Maven II: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex and the Mythic Hero's Handbook.\n$50 - Mythic Maven III: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex and the Mythic Spell Compendium.\n$70 - Mythic Maven Complete: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex, Mythic Hero's Handbook, and Mythic Spell Compendium.\n$100 - Mythic Grandmaster: You get the PDF version of all five books: the Mythic Character Codex, Mythic Hero's Handbook, Mythic Spell Compendium, Mythic Monster Manual, and Mythic Monster Manual II. \nPRINT PLEDGES\nFor those who love print books, you can choose any of the options below. All print pledges also include the PDFs of the books you select. Unless otherwise noted, domestic shipping is included in your print pledge. \n$60 - Hardcore Monster Master: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Monster Manual II.\n$60 - Hardcore Mythic Maven: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Character Codex. \n$100 - Hardcore Mythic Master: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Character Codex and Mythic Monster Manual II. \n$250 - Hardcore Mythic Grandmaster: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Character Codex and Mythic Monster Manual II, as well as PDF versions and signed hardback print versions of the original Mythic Hero's Handbook, Mythic Monster Manual, and Mythic Spell Compendium. Plus a bonus Legendary Swag Pack which includes a red LG dice bag, 3 custom D6s, color changing pencil, and LG lapel pin!  - LIMIT 15 \nThere are also three unique pledges for backers who'd like signed deluxe leatherette versions of the original Mythic Mania hardbacks!  \nPRINTING\nWe\u2019ll be doing the print side of this project as print-on-demand, so the turnaround between completed PDFs and availability of print books will be much faster than with a traditional print run. HOWEVER, we also have a very limited number of print copies of the original three books, including the recent discovery of a few leftover cases of the Mythic Hero\u2019s Handbook (which we\u2019ve been sold out of for some time), and a handful of DELUXE editions from the original Kickstarter. Those books are available in the special deluxe pledges and as add-on pledges (see below), and when they're gone, they're gone. \nOf course, those who missed the original MYTHIC MANIA also can pick up the original PDFs as part of this massive project! PDF never goes out of print! \nWe'll be offering fun expansions and stretch goals to you as we go along to make these books even better. The more you pledge, the more amazing content we can stuff into the pages of these books! \nUNLOCKED! - $5,000 - Mythic Classes: Occult 1 - We add mythic class features for the kineticist, medium, and mesmerist to the Mythic Character Codex!\nUNLOCKED! $6,000 - Fatal Four! - We add four more monsters to the Mythic Monster Manual II, and you help choose them!

If we can do it, we will! \nNOTE: To expedite the layout process all sponsored materials will go into a special Backer Appendix at the end of each book. This is so we can get started with the layout on the rest of the book without waiting on those special items, to make sure everybody gets their books ASAP! You will have a very limited amount of time to turn in your special pledges to us once the Kickstarter ends, and in fact we'd advise you to get your requests in to us before it's over. Get them in so we can get the books out! \n$25 - Mythic Sponsor: Pick any published feat or spell from Paizo, Legendary Games, or another Pathfinder publisher to include in the Mythic Character Codex.

Your name will be listed as a Classy Creator! Note: A mythic class includes only the class features of the base class, not archetypes. Because of our quick time frame for this project, we won't be able to take on highly complex classes.\nFor all sponsorships that include artwork, you'll receive high-resolution files of your sponsored art. \nIn addition to the basic options listed above, we have a limited number of copies of the original Mythic Hero's Handbook and Mythic Spell Compendium: \n$50 - Mythic Hero's Handbook (print/PDF bundle) - Only 25 available.\n$50 - Mythic Spell Compendium (print/PDF bundle) - Only 50 available.\nIf you're pledging for one of these books, please let us know via Kickstarter message at the time you make your pledge so we can keep a running count of how many add-ons remain.

If you'd like to pick up some of the amazing base content enhanced by this mythic project, we definitely encourage you to pick up the following fantastic books:\nGothic Campaign Compendium - $20 PDF, $40 print+PDF\nForest Kingdom Campaign Compendium - $25 PDF, $50 print+PDF\nPirate Campaign Compendium - $30 PDF, $60 print+PDF\nAdditional copies of MYTHIC II BOOKS - $50 Bonus Book - extra copy of the Mythic Character Codex or Mythic Monster Manual 2.

All copies of those books will ship directly from our printer and is considered part of your base pledge. All other print books will be shipped separately and will ship immediately on completion of the Kickstarter and confirmation of pledges. Shipping charge for these add-ons is separate and is $5 per book domestic and $25 per book international.   \nWill you be doing any mythic projects in the future?\nThis project will close the book (literally and figuratively) on our mythic support for Pathfinder, though we also may potentially create a version of the mythic rules for the Starfinder roleplaying game and for Pathfinder 2nd Edition, and possibly even for 5E.

We've taken to heart lessons from prior projects and applied that wisdom here, getting all the heavy lifting done ahead of time. We've also brought on a new developer in Thilo Graf who is handling this project so that it does not interfere with teams working on other outstanding projects, like the 5E and Starfinder teams finishing the Alien Codex and Aethera Field Guide or the adventure team working on the final adventure and compilation of Legendary Planet. The layout people working on this project also are solely dedicated to this project right now and not multitasking on any other Legendary Games projects, and they are beginning layout now, while the Kickstarter is still underway, rather than waiting until after it is over.\n\nWith a small company, sudden illness or incapacity is always a possibility and could create delays, but reducing the remaining work to finishing layout, adding any sponsored material at the end of the process, and then preparing the print-on-demand files (rather than doing a full print run) greatly reduces any potential for delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Monster Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Mythic Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["43 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Monster Master II", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Monster Manual 1 PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven II", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Spell Companion PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven III", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Hardcore Mythic Maven", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex Hardback\nMythic Character Codex PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Hardcore Monster Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Monster Manual 2 Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven Complete", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Spell Companion PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Hardcore Mythic Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex Hardback\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["74 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Mythic Grandmaster", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Spell Companion PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 1 PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF\nMythic Character Codex PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Hardcore Mythic Grandmaster", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 2 Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 1 Hardback, signed\nMythic Spell Compendium Hardback, signed\nMythic Hero's Handbook Hardback, signed\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 1 PDF\nMythic Spell Companion PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF\nLegendary swag pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 400 or more", "title": "Marvelous Mythic Grandmaster", "descp": "Note: Deluxe premium leatherette copies will be signed by Jason Nelson, Owen K.C.

In this game, players assume the roles of desperate people who come forth to fight against the imminent apocalypse promised by the dreaded Destroyer of Worlds, the Hunger in the Void, the being known as the Demon Lord. Since the first Kickstarter campaign three years ago, Schwalb Entertainment has revealed the hidden kingdoms, the terrifying vistas of Hell, the madness of the Void, and has even taken you to a post-apocalyptic world in which the Demon Lord has already won. Now, though, is the time to arm your heroes with even greater weapons so that you can take the fight to the darkness and triumph. \nOccult Philosophy, the first major expansion to this sinister game, offers 800 new spells divided between forty traditions of magic. Whether you are calling down a mountain to shatter the armies of the Witch-King or opening a portal to the ancient past before the troubles began on Urth, Occult Philosophy ramps up the magic in the game. Each tradition receives a considerable expansion, with spell offerings for rank 0 to rank 10, each of which has been tested for use in your campaigns. If you want to master the secrets of Battle magic or plumb the depths of Forbidden magic, Occult Philosophy has you covered.\nWant to learn more about Occult Philosophy? Check out these interviews with Mud & Blood, Tales of Blood and Stone, and TabletopBabble.\nShadow of the Demon Lord is a horror-fantasy tabletop adventure game that presents a world standing on the brink of annihilation. In this game, you and your friends play characters charged with fighting back against the spreading evil, whether that involves tracking down potent relics, exploring ancient faerie ruins, journeying into Hell to bargain with the Devil, or battling demons and the cultists who summon them. \nIf you\u2019re new to this game, check out some of the great reviews about Shadow of the Demon Lord here, here, here, and here, and some live-plays of the game: here, here, and here.\nFinally, you can grab a copy of the quick start rules and a starting adventure for almost free, right here.\nThe book is written and extensively tested, so we\u2019re ready to move to the next stage of production, which involves editing, layout, art direction, and the rest. Given the size of the book and the expenses involved, I\u2019m asking for your help to bring this project over the finish line. The best way to help is to choose a pledge level found below and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. If the project funds, your dollars go toward purchasing art, paying for editing, and covering the other production costs. Of course, if the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and everyone becomes quite sad. If you can\u2019t help out by backing at a pledge level, we\u2019d be mighty grateful if you spread the word to those who can. \n[NEW!] Digital Spell Cards\nOn DriveThruRPG, I've been selling spell cards for most of the spells presented in game. Now, backers at the $50 or higher pledge levels automatically gain digital spell cards for every spell presented in Occult Philosophy to make using this awesome project even easier. How much value does this pledge add to your game? Well, each deck includes at least 18 spells and MSRP is a $1 per deck. At 42 decks, that's a $42 bucks worth of content you get for free!\nOver the last few years, we\u2019ve released a ton of great content for the game. From dozens of adventures to optional rules to new paths, spells, monsters, and more, Shadow of the Demon Lord has the support you need to tell the stories you want to tell. To celebrate the Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019re offering bundles of products at a discounted price so you can catch up on releases you have missed and see what all the fuss is about.\nPoisoned Pages Bundle $12 (normally $22.77)\nFor the sake of completeness, here's the Poisoned Pages bundle. It includes all of the following products: Battle Scars, Children of the Earth, Do We Not Die?, Fever Dreams, Flesh of the Fallen, Insupposable Instruments, Power in a Name, Price of Evil, Riders of the Wind, Tooth and Claw, Unhinge the Mind, Vine and Willow, and Dark Passages.\nCharacter Sheet Pads ($20 US/$35 International)\nPads of sexy new character sheets designed so you can keep track of everything that pertains to your character. Price includes shipping.\nDemon Lord Dice ($25 US/$35 International)\nA set of 9 dice with the Schwalb Entertainment logo featured on the 6. Dripping with evil, the dice set includes 3 white dice (boons), 3 black dice (banes), and 3 red dice (damage).\nDigital Spell Cards ($15)\nYou can complete your collection of digital spell cards, getting all the decks released for the game until this KS for a low price of $15. These decks include all card sets from the core rulebook, A Glorious Death, Demon Lord's Companion, Demon Lord's Companion 2, Exquisite Agony, Godless, Hunger in the Void, Terrible Beauty, and Tombs of the Desolation.\nIn addition to the above add-ons, you can also pick up Demon Lord Turn Tokens and Demon Lord Fortune Tokens.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Turn Token (1) - $10\nThis large 50mm token is 4mm thick, and brings real weight to the table. It can be used to track the Fast and Slow combat rounds, and the token features white enamel letters and red enamel sigils and glowing eyes. Not for the faint hearted. Designed by Lee Smith and made by Campaign Coins under license from Schwalb Entertainment.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Fortune Tokens (6) - $10\nThese tokens are emblazoned with the word Fortune. The top side features the Demon Lord symbol in magnificent 3D, while the reverse has the design in 2D, making it naturally lie flat on the table. Comes as a pack of 6 tokens. Designed by Lee Smith and made by Campaign Coins under license from Schwalb Entertainment.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Dice Tray (1) - $14.99\nThe Demon Lord approaches... your hands are shaking... your character has one chance to live... now would be a bad time to lose your dice.\nThis deluxe pleather dice tray will keep your dice where you need them during your sessions of Shadow of the Demon Lord.\nThe dice tray packs flat with your rulebook and is easy to snap together for play.\nIt features the legendary Demon Lord design by Schwalb Entertainment, printed in stark bone white on jet black pleather. The dice tray is vegetarian-approved (Hail Seitan!)\nApproximate assembled dimensions: 9.5\" (24cm) Length x 6.75\" (17cm) Width x 1.5\" (3.8cm) Depth\nShadow of the Demon Lord dice not included.\nThe dice tray is manufactured by Campaign Coins, as part of their licensed range of products for Shadow of the Demon Lord. C\nShipping\nFor any and all of the Campaign Coins accessories, add $5 to your pledge for US, Canada, and the Rest of the World. Add $3 to your pledge for Asia/New Zealand/Australia.  \nFor now, you\u2019ll pay shipping for printed copies of Occult Philosophy directly to the printer when you redeem your at-cost coupon. If we hit a funding level that allows us to do an offset print run for Occult Philosophy, you\u2019ll pay shipping after the campaign closes through Backerkit. Doing so allows us to avoid distorting the funding levels to give us an accurate estimate of how much money we've raised, and it allows us time to find the best shipping options for the campaign. Typically, I can ship out a book to US customers for about $6 (includes shipping, box, and tape). \nFor international backers (under 4 lb.), we\u2019re in $40-50 range, which sucks on so many levels. Since international shipping rates keep climbing, I\u2019m offering the print-on-demand coupon, so you can receive the book for the cost of glue, paper, and binding. I\u2019ve ordered plenty of hardback books from Lightning Source, and the quality is good. Best of all, Lightning Source has a printer in the UK, which cuts the world-wide shipping costs way, way down. So if you\u2019re not wild about paying $50 for shipping, please, please, please avail yourself of the at-cost print-on-demand coupon. Hail!\nNormally, I\u2019d hide all this stuff, but I think it\u2019s worth getting some of this info out early so you know what you\u2019re getting for your hard-earned bucks. I intend to use this campaign to fund the production of a whole host of new products that I\u2019ve been wanting to design. If you back at the 50 dollar level or higher and funding exceeds the goal, you\u2019ll get the stuff unlocked at no extra cost!

However, things happen. I might die. Art might come in late. Aliens could abduct my manuscripts. The hobo might finally catch me.

Volcanoes erupted, spewing fire and ash across the lands, and earthquakes ravaged the countryside. Entire regions were devastated, villages swallowed whole by the raging earth, forests and pastures incinerated by the volcanoes\u2019 fires, and civilizations propelled to the brink of collapse. Kings and queens struggled to uphold law and order in their realms as panic swept through the populace. Thousands fell victim to the Cataclysm\u2019s wrath, and the world drowned in chaos.\nNow, almost fifty years later, the world has regained a semblance of order \u2013 but it has become a different world. In the wake of the Cataclysm, maps were re-drawn as oppressed populations took advantage of the turmoil and declared their independence from their former overlords. Large swathes of land still lie barren, and the areas around the Cataclysm\u2019s epicenters are burned hellscapes ruled by grotesque creatures that crawled out from the underworld as the earth cracked. Outlaws and monsters roam the countryside and make travel a dangerous affair.\nIt is a world ripe with adventure \u2013 old ruins offer undiscovered treasures, and rulers eager to return law and order to their realms offer rich rewards to those who are willing to brave the dangers of the wilderness. And it is a world of opportunity for those who wish to leave their mark on it.\nThese are the central realms of Argea, and the forsaken badlands left behind by the Cataclysm's raging fury. In this world of squabbling kings and queens, whom will you offer your sword to?\nThe 3.5e System Reference Document (SRD), as covered by the Open Game License v1.0a (OGL) provided by Wizards of the Coast, Inc., allows us to forge a game with a classic character system based on the most popular pen-and-paper role-playing system of all times. It is a familiar and easy to learn system that provides many opportunities for character building, offering different races and classes, dozens of feats and skills, as well as over a hundred magic spells for the player to train his characters in.\nOur world is inhabited by many classic fantasy races, seven of which are playable characters in the game: the prolific humans, the sturdy dwarves, the graceful elves, the inventive gnomes, the savage half-orcs, the crafty halflings and the talented half-elves. Each race comes with its own distinct characteristics, ensuring that the choices you make during character creation matter throughout the game!\nAlong with the 7 different races, the player can choose from 8 different classes for their characters, each offering a unique set of abilities and a distinct gameplay style: \nClick for high-res version\n With plenty of feats and skills to invest in and several special actions performable in combat and outside of it, Realms Beyond opens many avenues for character development. Whether you are a powergamer who wants to optimize his characters or a roleplayer who wants to give his party a personal touch, you can create any type of character you want. In addition to the regular classes, high level characters will be able to pick a prestige class, giving them additional flavor and specializing their role in the party even more.\nRealms Beyond made one significant change to the established SRD 3.5e combat system. We decided to use a hexagonal grid instead of the traditional square grid. \nThis material is published under the OGL\nIf you would like to know more about our combat system, please read our past blog entries. Furthermore, some months ago, we released the video of an early version of the combat system here:\nRealms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen offers a large world for the player to explore. Cities, villages, camps, dungeons \u2013 many places both populated and abandoned await the intrepid adventurer. Our custom-built engine allows for enormous dungeon maps filled with enemy encounters, devious traps and tricky puzzles that require all of the party\u2019s abilities to overcome \u2013 and despite the large size of our maps, loading times are so fast you won\u2019t even notice them!\nDue to our fully interactive environments, almost all objects in the game world can be picked up or manipulated, and even have spells cast on them. Maybe you can open that gate by casting a telekinesis spell on the lever on the other side? Experimentation is key, and an inventive player will unearth many secrets in the depths of our dungeons.\nYou can interact with almost every item in the world\n\n\nIn towns and villages, you will meet hundreds of NPCs to talk to and do quests for. Our dialogue scripting system allows NPCs to respond to your character\u2019s race, class, and even appearance \u2013 and, of course, to your past deeds!\nClick for full-size version\n   Our design philosophy highly values the player\u2019s agency, and so the player is always free to choose whom to work for. The city guard or the criminal underworld? The loyalists or the rebels? The innocent townspeople or the sinister sorceress who wants to turn them into her slaves? Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen never forces the player into a set path. The choice is always yours!\nA part of the mini map of Vedwyd, a harbor town in northern Cormac.You can place your own markers on the map and annotate them!\nOur NPCs aren\u2019t just static quest dispensers, either. They have their own lives, setting off to work in the morning, having a beer at the tavern in the evening, and locking their doors to sleep safely at night. Different NPCs have different schedules, reflecting their personality and position in society. And not every NPC does the same things every day \u2013 most workers will stay at home during the night, and a tavern enthusiast may drink at a different venue every night. The alchemist goes out to gather new ingredients once a week. Our complex and diverse NPC schedules ensure that the world feels alive, and that every character has a purpose in the world.\nSome examples of the many characters that populate the world of Argea\nPlayers who want to go for a more unsavory type of adventuring party have plenty of opportunities to follow their urges, too. With a rogue in your party, you can pick the lock of any home or shop and rob the owner while he sleeps. You can sneak up on NPCs and pick their pockets. But a rogue\u2019s skills can not only be used against innocents: use your rogue to disarm traps in dungeons, sneak past enemies to get into an advantageous position, or even stealthily pour a vial of poison into the bandits\u2019 cooking pot to get rid of them without having to draw your swords.\nThe world of Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen is massive, spanning multiple kingdoms and empires across two continents, and it is completely open for exploration, with no artificial limits to rein the player in. Just like in games such as Fallout and Arcanum, the player\u2019s party can freely travel across the world map and discover new locations through exploration. But when it comes to exploration, not all areas are equal \u2013 your party moves much faster on roads than on open terrain, forests and mountains block your line of sight and hostile environments such as deserts and volcanic ashlands will be a drain on your resources.\nClick on image to open full-sized version\nA successful explorer is a prepared explorer. If your characters go without food and drink for too long, they will suffer from hunger and thirst. If your characters explore icy, snow-covered mountains or the hot, dry desert without proper equipment, the cold and the heat will drain their stamina and make them delirious. And after a long journey, your characters will grow tired and need to rest their feet: that\u2019s where our camping system comes in.\nAt any place in the wilderness, the player can set up camp to grant his characters some rest. But camp time can also be used to replenish supplies: the party\u2019s ranger can be sent out to hunt and supplement the rations, or he can gather herbs to brew potions from. Of course, a deep forest will yield better results than a barren desert \u2013 the environment you\u2019re in always matters, whether you\u2019re traveling or camping. And some of your characters should stand guard at night to avoid nasty surprises\u2026\nClick on image to open full-sized version\nJust as you can travel freely across the world map, so do other characters in our game world. Guard patrols and merchants travel along the major trade routes, peasants travel from their farms to the nearest town \u2013 but not all faces you meet on the road are friendly. There are no random encounters in Realms Beyond. Bandits, monsters, and even other adventurer parties travel across the map the same way the player does, and if you spot a dangerous enemy party in the distance, you can run away from them\u2026 or they can run away from you, if they deem you too strong to engage. This creates a dynamic world map experience where encounters make sense and don\u2019t just hit you out of the blue: trade routes and the immediate surroundings of major cities will be safe due to the presence of friendly guards, while enemy groups are especially numerous around bandit camps and monster lairs.\nOur world map is a persistent and dynamic place in many ways. If the player destroys a monster lair, or drives bandits out of a fortress, no more wandering enemy groups will spawn from these places. Some quests might even change the function a location has on the world map: an impoverished noble has tasked you to drive out the band of outlaws that has occupied his castle, and if you succeed at his quest, the area around the castle will be patrolled by troops loyal to this nobleman and merchants will now travel to the castle and sell their goods there. The player\u2019s actions will have noticeable and lasting consequences that shape the face of the world \u2013 the results of which can be seen directly on the world map.\nTo get from place to place more quickly, the player can buy horses and camels to ride on, and beasts of burden or a horse-drawn cart to carry additional loot. But the most valuable investment is a ship that allows the player to take the shorter and more direct sea routes from harbor city to harbor city! But the waters are not without danger, either \u2013 pirates roam the seas and sea-monsters lurk in the depths, and if such an enemy is encountered, the player will have to defend his ship in tactical turn-based naval battles. To gain an edge in these battles, the player can install cannons and ballistae on his ship to increase its firepower, or reinforce its hull with copper plating to make it more resistant to damage.\nOn our world map, every single tile can be explored \u2013 even the seas aren\u2019t off limits.\nAlong with the game, we will also release our editing tools (the UrWelt Engine) to the players so they can create their own worlds and campaigns. Modders will be able to use the very same level editor and dialogue editor that we are using to create the game, allowing them to forge new campaigns and even new worlds with the same level of complexity as our own.\nIt is also possible to import your own character models, objects, textures and sounds \u2013 so a dedicated team of modders could create a completely different game scenario. We want our modding tools to be as flexible as possible, comparable to the legendary toolsets of Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures and Neverwinter Nights. The core of the UrWelt framework is the level editor, which allows you to create your own maps \u2013 from small ones with 48x48 tiles (about 5,000 m\u00b2) to gigantic ones with 512x512 tiles (about 600,000 m\u00b2). The ground can be raised or lowered to create a flat or hilly landscape, and textured and decorated with decals. Buildings can be constructed from modular walls and objects can be placed freely on the map. To create an encounter, just place a group of enemies on the map and set them to hostile. You can also place sources of light with adjustable intensity and shadows, impressive visual effects, flocks of birds, shoals of fish, lively critters, and ambient sounds to spice up the atmosphere of your map. The editor is easy to get into, and extremely powerful once you master it.\nClick for full-size version\nWith our dialogue editor, you can write complex branching dialogues and create NPCs who react to everything the player is doing and saying. Want an NPC to laugh at the player for wearing a funny hat? You can script that. Want a dialogue option that only appears if the player has a score of 18 in charisma? You can script that. Want an NPC who refuses to talk to you unless you gift her a bouquet of flowers? You can script that.\nClick for full-size version\nWith our modding tools at your disposal, the only limit is your imagination. You can convert your long-running pen and paper campaign to the PC, or come up with something completely new. Share your works with other users through platforms such as Steam Workshop. If you ever wanted to create your own RPG campaign, Realms Beyond will give you the chance to turn your dreams into reality!\nSound FX\nIt\u2019s an obvious thing: Atmosphere is not only a visual thing, and it\u2019s not only created by gameplay. Atmosphere is what you get when you put all the components of a game together and everything fits. Often overlooked, but without a doubt, one of the key elements to create an engaging sense of atmosphere is the sound design. Imagine, if you will, an RPG without driving combat themes, or an epic main theme. It would feel like a movie with the TV muted. Distant, remote\u2026 But not only the music is of importance, sound effects and atmospheric sounds are every bit as important. It\u2019s all in the details.\n\nBut what are those sonic details? Let\u2019s pick one and discuss. If you look back at games like the original Realms of Arkania trilogy (German title: Das Schwarze Auge: Die Nordland-Trilogie) you\u2019ll find that a great deal of detail went into those games. Just take the inventory, for example. There\u2019s even special, unique sound effect playing when you put some new leather gloves on one of your characters. It is details like those, things that don\u2019t make a huge difference in the game as a whole, but add a little special attention to things that we want to achieve in Realms Beyond. \nNaturally, not every item in the game will have its own sound effect (with over a thousand items in the game, that would be an exorbitant number of sounds), but there will be a great many small sounds for several item classes. If you change from a dagger to a heavy sword, you\u2019ll hear the Shing! of steel. Putting on leather gloves will play a different sound than putting on brass gauntlets. \nMusic\nEspecially in computer games music can affect the mood in many different ways. And that\u2019s the reason why we care not only about adequate graphics but also about precisely-tailored music. To achieve this goal, we pay a lot of attention to the creation of the music for Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen.\n\nFor example, to create a tense atmosphere during combat, we decided that we needed not only a few generic pieces, but also several matching themes. The driving force behind this decision was that we felt it was important to underscore different types of combat situations with different types of music. A small skirmish has a very different feel than an epic battle, and the music needs to appropriately reflect that. But it goes beyond that. Skeletons, for example, are very different from human knights. Not only do they look and move differently, they also require a different auditory set.\nExample: Undead Encounter \nExample: Battle versus Orcs\n  Outside of combat, the music in Realms Beyond is intended to evoke the mood of the location and the time of day. Every region in our world has its very own musical style, which can be heard in the variations of each locale's theme. From the resonant horns of the north to the playful flutes of Pyrrhenian shores, Argea's different realms not only look but also sound different.\nExample: A human town in the evening hours\nExample: A haunted dungeon deep below the surface\nExample: Ruins in the forest\n\n (Music by Bastian Kieslinger)\nWhile the engine and systems are mostly finished and implemented by now, we still need to fill the game with more content. Success in this Kickstarter will allow us to hire additional writers and level designers, produce more assets and animations, and create a memorable world that will be a joy to explore.\nThe majority of the funds will be allocated to writing and level design, the core elements of a good RPG. All of our content will be hand-crafted and the player will be presented with non-linear quests and dungeons that require a lot of work to design, implement, and playtest.\n\nTo support the narrative nature of our game, we also want to create more NPC animations for dialogues and events.\n\nBeside content and visuals, the funds will be used for additional sound effects to enrich the immersive atmosphere of our world. To attain the best quality, we will be working with the fantastic people over at Only Sound. \n\nAnd finally, we would love to hire the amazing composer Edwin Pickett to create additional combat and background themes for the game. Here, you can listen to some of his previous works:\nPhysical Rewards\nThe mass production of goods is definitely not our business and we don't want to spend money and time on frivolous consumer rewards. Promotional items such as miniatures, t-shirts, hoodies, USB sticks, etc. often come cheaply produced and are of questionable quality. Since we personally don't like that stuff, it would be wrong to offer it to our backers.\nTherefore we will completely focus our efforts on the production of the game box and its contents. Here, we want to deliver the Ultimate Goldbox standard: Solid cardboard packaging, a coin made of bronze, a map applied on high-quality cotton paper, and a printed manual and spell book. Beside this game box, there will be only one other physical reward: A handmade amulet that refers to a significant item from our game world.\nMore than two years ago, we established Ceres Games for the sole purpose of developing a complex party-based RPG that would resurrect those qualities found in the classics of the 80s and 90s. Led by industry veterans Peter Ohlmann and Timothy Drude, among whose numerous titles include The Settlers II, Knights and Merchants, and the SpellForce series, we found other RPG enthusiasts to join our project early on.\nCeres Games is fully independent and not affilitated with any publisher or investor. A successful crowdfunding campaign will allow us to stay on this path.\nOur team is currently comprised of international developers who love the computer role-playing games of the past. This passion is the guiding force behind Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur lead team members have been successfully developing and releasing video games for more than 20 years, and we have no intention of stopping now. Of course, every production can hit rough water, and it would be naive and unprofessional of us to deny this.\n\nWe have achieved quite a bit in the last two years: The rendering engine, the game systems, and all the required content tools are working. Most of the art assets have been created and implemented. We already have more than 800 items and 2,100 environment objects in the game, but we want to include much more.\n\nOur intention is to include robust content that will greatly satisfy each of our backers. However, the production of a computer game is always challenging, and there can be circumstances that may affect the development process. One challenge could be the number features and amount of content we have planned. Some of these features might be modified or delayed.\n\nWhen talking about game development in general, another production challenge is the release date. We want to release the game in early 2020, but there are always unforeseen factors that can delay the planned release date of any game. This is especially true of role-playing games with massive amounts of content and many gameplay features.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Traveller", "descp": "Thank you for your pledge!\nWe here at Ceres Games are truly grateful and will honor your early support with a special forum badge, an invitation to our Discord and a mention in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nSpecial forum badge and Discord role (Traveller)\nYour name in the credits (Supporter)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Digital Edition", "descp": "The basic digital edition of Realms Beyond: Ashes of the Fallen.

The combat demo is the first taste of the game you\u2019re going to get, and we want to make sure the first impression is a great one. Honestly, we underestimated the actual amount of work the combat demo would require.

As a consequence our first prototype for AI \u2018grew\u2019 with time. At first, all it could do were melee attacks. Then we added ranged attacks. Then we implemented an enemy spell AI for intelligent placing of area spells (trying to maximize hits on enemies and minimize hits on allies). Finally we included rather specific routines (like fleeing) for characters that suffered from spells like fear. We realized that AI has to be able to deal with script spells that are loaded at runtime (a feature that could be interesting for future modifications).

I love doing lineart and inks, and had fielded several requests to pursue one, but I wanted to wait until I found a theme I could really sink my teeth into - I love themes! That theme was Dangerous Women, and 84 wonderful backers helped bring it to life. The original goal was a 24-illustration coloring book, but stretch goals helped bring it up to 40! Since its publishing, it's become one of my best-sellers at conventions. \nI knew I wanted to tackle another coloring book, but again, I wanted to wait until I felt drawn to a theme that could sustain at least 40 pieces. As fantasy illustration has become a larger chunk of my work over the last few years, I knew it would be down that path - and once it hit me, it seemed so obvious. I always joke that none of my dragons look more than tangentially related - they're my favorite creature on which to practice new shading techniques, new shapes, scales, feathers, anything really. For Inktober this year, I wanted to do some of that experimentation, but also drill down a bit and see if there was a recognizably-\"Indi\" dragon type in there somewhere too. It also struck me as the perfect theme for my next coloring book - Dragons & Dragonkin! \nUPDATE: After hitting multiple stretch goals, Dragons & Dragonkin is now a 55-illustration 8.5x11 coloring book (single-sided pages, roughly ~120p book) AND all tiers $19 and up receive three free dragon bookmarks as well! More stretch goals = more illustrations (and other stuff!) for everyone! \nI aimed to keep the tiers on this campaign as simple as possible! See below for a breakdown of each: \n *Note: Final coloring book cover may be different.\nSimilar to the tiers, I aimed to keep stretch goals simple and attainable, and focus on delivering extra value to as many pledgers as possible. Most of the goals directly relate to the size of the book - the more goals we hit, the more illustrations everyone has to color! \n Update 1: Funding goal met! A 40-illustration coloring book is guaranteed! Onward! \nUpdate 2: First stretch goal hit! We are now up to 45 illustrations!\n Update 3: Unlocked TWO additional stretch goals! Now all backers at or above $19 will receive a free dragon bookmark, AND we are now up to 50 illustrations in the book! :D \n Update 4: Five more illustrations added, bringing the book total up to 55 illustrations! Thank you! \nUpdate 5: All backers $19 and up now receive a set of THREE dragon bookmarks! :D\nAdd-ons are available for all tiers HATCHLING and up (any that already receive a shipment)!\nNote: Both the copies of my first coloring book \"Dangerous Women\" and extra copies of \"Dragons & Dragonkin\" are HEAVILY discounted for backers! \nUpdate: Additional watercolor pieces now available as an add-on! Please note that this is a sizeable discount for a 10x14 on thick 300# quality wc paper (normal commission price for this size would be $255 plus any detail charges) - Kickstarter backers can choose a Dragons & Dragonkin page to be painted as a watercolor for only $100! \nTo purchase any of the Add-On items, simply increase your pledge by the amount of the Add-On item(s) that you would like. It'll be sorted out through the post-Kickstarter surveys, and you'll have the opportunity to choose your watercolor as soon as I finish all of the pages and upload them somewhere for you to peruse and choose. :)\n\"Dangerous Women\" featured almost entirely open-linework, and while many pieces in \"Dragons & Dragonkin\" will still adhere to that style, several pieces will feature more advanced detailing. Like DW, the new book will be 8.5x11, with single-page illustrations (empty back pages to help prevent bleedthrough). DW ended up being 40 illustrations in a 96pp book - how big can Dragons & Dragonkin get? It's up to you!

Having featured dozens of writers and artists over the years, including Pat Mills, Alan Grant, Grant Morrison, Mark Millar, John Wagner and Alan Moore, 2000 AD brings you an explosive cocktail of sci-fi and fantasy, infused with a mean streak of irony and wry black humour.\n2000 AD is future lawmen in vast megacities. It is post apocalyptic wastelands filled with mutants. It is celtic barbarians and druids fighting evil drunelords. It is robot warriors taming a lawless Mars. It is ancient accords between the British Crown and Hell. It is intergalactic cargo trucks adventuring through space. It is extra-dimensional agencies who repair anomalies across the alternate realities. It is Houdini, Lovecraft, and Doyle as paranormal investigators in the 1920s. It is alien freedom fighters seeking to end the tyranny of humans on a far future Earth. It is genetically engineered soldiers bred for war. And it is much, much more.\nThe worlds of 2000 AD are diverse indeed. And you can play in them all!\nThis 270-page book contains the following chapters!\nAccompanying the core rulebook is The Robot Wars, a 100-page adventure and sourcebook. This softcover book contains rules for Robot player characters, and two adventures set during the Robot Wars themselves!\n       Judge Dredd & The Worlds of 2000 AD uses the What's OLD is NEW (WOIN) game system. Here are some of the features of that system:\nd6 dice pools. Judge Dredd & The Worlds of 2000 AD uses d6 dice pools to resolve actions. You form a dice pool by adding dice from an attribute, a skill, and equipment. For example, a burglar trying to pick a lock might have 3d6 from her AGILITY attribute, 2d6 from her thievery skill, and 1d6 from her high quality thieves tools, meaning she gets to roll 6d6. The dice are added together and compared to a target number. Detailed rules for simple tasks, extended tasks, and competitive tasks using the same core mechanic allow for a flexible variety of challenges.\nLife-path careers system. Judge Dredd & The Worlds of 2000 AD uses a \"life-path\" system for character creation. You create a character by selecting a number of sequential careers which represent periods of your character's life since childhood. Each career adds to your character's age, and increases various attributes and skills, as well as granting a special ability while adding to your character's history and backstory.\nYes, we have stretch goals!

The Demon Lord, an entity of incalculable power blights the lands with cursed evil, madness and slaughter. The dreadful beings let loose by the Demon Lord reflects this being\u2019s nightmarish essence, the touch of its shadow and its insatiable hunger for all things. \nAlthough the Demon Lord remains outside the mortal view, every new horror connected to him arises from the dirt and bring destruction and new death, also weakening little by little his planar prison, unchaining the constraints that are preventing him to escape the Void and bring catastrophic destruction to the world.\nRobert Schwalb create a world facing the total annihilation, its lands torn asunder by war, plague, and ancient horrors. Urth, the world of Shadow of the Demon Lord, is one of many imperiled by the shadowy menace lurking without and in this game you can play through its final days as embattled survivors fighting against what to many seems to be an inevitable end. \nA complete role playing game in one book, Shadow of the Demon Lord contains everything you need to create characters to confront the hordes of demons spilling in from the Void and to create and play through exciting stories steeped in horror and violence. To make this happen, the game system is easy to learn, plays fast, and requires little preparation to play. All these ensure both novice and veteran players can enjoy the game together. The benefit of short campaigns lets you tell more stories, create more characters, and experience more of the game's options than other game before. As a player, you are encouraged to play several heroes, trying the potential of the path\u2019s engine to create incredible flexible characters. And, as a Game Master, you can run a complete campaign in lesser time than usual, introducing new ideas, places and horrors every time. \nThe horror is perfect when is narrated in short stories, full of madness and fear. These are the only stories that thrive you at night and remain in your memories for long time.\nBlackStar is a whole new game line based on Shadow of the Demon Lord RPG, originally designed and created by Robert Schwalb. Death & Decay, our first release, will depict and introduce new monsters and develop exciting new ways to add fun and terror to the creatures you already know. It will be an immersive, dark fantasy supplement, that gives players and GMs alike new resources for their gaming sessions. \nYou will find plenty of undead out there ready to drain your last breath, coming from the Underworld itself or from the haunting darker places scattered through Urth.\nThe Creature Codex will be a 128 pages book that describes monsters of undeath, creatures of decay and lurking horrors. It presents many classical monsters revisited with new game options that can bring new excitement to your sessions, as well as plenty of new undead monsters of all types.\nFollowing are some of the unique features introduced in Death & Decay:\n\u2022 Presences: Infested dolls, whispers in the night, echoes of battles, doomed crypts and ghost ships! All of these entities can be found all around Urth. Infestations, apparitions, geists and malevolentes, all can be suppressed or banished forever. The task can be easy or hard, but presences might damn you for life. They can come back with renewed strength to drag you to the grave, corrupt your soul or lure you to the edge of insanity. Destroying them or survive can be the goal of an entire campaign. Death can be the minor evil. \n\u2022 Spirits: Spirits or incorporeal undead are a simple form of monsters that cannot follow the cycle of life and death on Urth. They nurture the evil in others and feed on the anguish they create in their victims, the sorrow they cause, the evil they plant, all to feed the Demon Lord and unchain him. Spectral beings and ghosts, shadows in the mists or wraiths can appear everywhere, in lost cairns or abandoned tombs, in attics or cellars, in ancient forests or in the crypt of an important church to carry victims with them and bring, as well, survivors to death in a slow agony for the madness they caused. Spirits alter the land they haunt, so be aware that banish a tortured soul from the living world can be the most terrific experience you may have in your entire life. \n\u2022 Corpses: Animated corpses, zombies, bone constructs, risen and others corporeal beings are the flesh of the hate that the demon lord feel toward the worlds of the livings. This contaminated corpses are risen by his foul cultists to generate waves of destruction, or they rise up by themselves to claim vengeance upon the mortals. Whatever the case, they are unstoppable, and their force can grow more than you can imagine in hordes capable of spread death and burning evil behind them.\n\u2022 Nightmares: Not sure if they are undead or dead at all, nightmares are the immortal visions of thousand mad minds and foul dreamers. A nightmare created lives in a limbo of nonexistence. However, their corruption and insanity can open the gates, and they will haunt dreams during the night; pervade the mind of anyone corrupted or mad so to overwhelm him by supernatural horrors. That said, be aware that your corrupted soul can strive you more than you have imagined until now.  \nAnd if you want more, be sure to support Death & Decay campaign. With your help, more creepy things will rise from the Void in Death & Decay, new forms of undead never seen before. We will investigate through the nature of Urth to find plants, malefic fungi and vermins that can cause decay to the living, or supernatural horrors from the Underworld and the Void. And of course, new players and GMs supplements, villains and adventures, and so on.\nAfter the initial goal is funded, here you will find a scheme of the backer levels with everything included in each pledge to easy understand what everyone will earn from the campaign.\n       Who is behind the veil of darkness?\nRobert J.

It will be USA-, EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. As the production will be european we try to keep it simple, but international shipping can be heavy for a small company. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So, about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that we will try to sell BlackStar Death & Decay through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. The Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the book.

A small settlement of nearly a hundred souls whose primary industry lies on stone mining and hospitality for traveling merchants along the Coastal Trade Route. Its economy relies heavily on travelers moving between the provincial capital of Suworthar and the port city of Relias.\nHowever, recent unrest has caused some instability in the Kingdom, and a window of opportunity has opened for unscrupulous characters to make their move. Merchants speak of increased bandit activity along the Trade Route, and entire caravans failed to turn up on schedule.\nWhile repeated requests to the Guard failed to get through the increased bureaucratic burden in the capital, the village chief of Sanjo has turned to a band of novice adventurers seeking their fortunes in one of the bigger cities. \nWho knows if this might just be a short-term job, or might lead to something greater...\nModule Description -\nThis module is designed to be friendly to new Dungeon Masters and players who are taking their first steps into the Fifth Edition of the world's most popular tabletop roleplaying game! (Can't use them abbreviations!)\nEven though the module comes with names, the low requirements and flexibility means that one will be able to modify and mold it for any setting!\nTips are added into the text for the game masters to craft their experiences, as well as little snippets which might enhance their interaction with the party. Hints on what and how some NPCs might react are also provided!\nRoleplaying games are usually based on three primary elements - Exploration, Roleplaying, and Combat. While most are familiar with the latter, this module makes sure to include the other elements inside, as well as the chance to utilize every character's strengths and weaknesses in a typical party.\nThis module is originally meant to be played over a single game session ranging from 2 - 4 hours, with several side-quests for the prolonging of the session. Each encounter has their own challenges, and no single trick is likely to work twice!\nAbout Me\nHi! My name is Jing Hao and I'm currently the solo writer for this project. Years ago as a teenage student, I worked on a homebrew world based on plenty of fantasy inspirations, only to have lost the data due to corrupted hardware. However the content which spurred me to create such a world lived on within myself, and with the rise of 5E, I've been writing several modules for playtesting while also taking inspiration from the published material by WotC. Being a solo writer isn't easy, but I do have a friendly and helpful tabletop community around me willing to provide their help for this project. Play testing, editing, and adjusting the encounters for balance are elements which one cannot do alone. My D&D group has been extremely helpful in this regard, providing feedback as well as assistance in making this adventure come alive as a simple one-shot. As I am currently working solo, I am unable to provide much art or visual details for the module. However, this might change in the future should the Kickstarter community help to fund my goals, allowing me to invest more time and money into the project.\nThe Preview!\nHi Backers, guess what!\nIn the Updates is a link to the two-page preview of 'A Rude Awakening', for Backers, and everyone else. If you like what you see and would like to support the future of this project, your contribution would be much appreciated!\nAfter successfully playtesting and converting the content from story to actual playing text, the first two pages are free for anyone to download on a PDF format. I only hope that the content be respected as belonging to the original author, and avoid republication under any other name.\nDisclaimer: The font and background are not reflective of the final product, and is purely for reading purposes.\nAlso announcing that this project will be using the Open Gaming License v1.0a released by Wizards. \nStretch Goals - $333 SGD (REACHED)\nSo!

My name is Christopher Knapp. For the past year, I've been writing a blog for the Fifth Edition of my favorite fantasy tabletop RPG as TBM Games, including new character options, monsters, and spells. I've come to Kickstarter to present to you the culmination of a year's work and playtesting - Primordial Power, a mini-supplement of apocalyptic powers for both players and GMs.\n Once More, the Primordials are Loose!\nEons ago, the gods waged war with a chaotic race of elementals, the primordials. Once these fearsome titans were destroyed or sealed away, but now mortal folly may be the world's undoing, as cults to the primordials rise to power.\nPrimordial Power is a small, 26*-page supplement for the Fifth Edition of the World's Most Popular Role-Playing game. \nThe supplement features the following:\nProfiles for five prominent primordials, volatile elemental beings with devastating powers\nA playable genie race, survivors of the primordials' previous rampages\nA new druid subclass devoted to fighting the primordials and staving away their influence on the mortal plane.\nA new scholarly bard subclass who studies the rise and fall of civilizations in the primordials' wake.\nNew spells for all magic users to tap into the apocalyptic powers of the primordials.\nA smattering of primordial-related foes to challenge heroes of any level, such as a versatile Primordial Cultist, the territorial Emperor Cicada, and the noble Ivory Guard.\nA guide to creating your own primordials, as well as a table of extra primordials to get your imagination going.\n*As of reaching our first stretch goal on 7/7/2018, this page count has become more nebulous pending formatting changes. The Version 1 PDF which will be available to backers upon funding will count in at 26 pages including its cover.\nPreviews!\nOver the last year, TBM Games has been working to deliver quality gaming content for Primordial Power, and a lot of content from the book can be seen on the website already to give you a feel for the writing style that this book will contain. That isn't to say that all of it is on there! Primordial Power is the product of iterating upon both these articles and other content never before seen.\nKeep your eyes peeled for updates in this space as the campaign continues! What follows is a preview of what the pages of Primordial Power will generally look like.\nMercury Elementals, one of the many new monsters introduced in Primordial Power\nEmperor Cicadas, once-quiet bugs who might make things difficult for a party's spellcasters.\nXil, the Swarm of Horrors\nWhy such a small book? Why not a full-size campaign setting?\nEven by third-party 5E publishers' standards, TBM Games is a smaller operation, and this will be its first attempt at publishing any material. Being untested in the realm of RPG publishing, we wanted to focus on creating a digestible product which could allow you, as backers, to receive a finished product quickly to see what we're made of.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nCrowdfunding is an incredibly potent platform - backers' faith in a project's ability to be completed is the driving force behind its delivery. TBM Games has come to Kickstarter to demonstrate its ability to deliver quality content, both on this project and future ones, and to share our content with a wider audience.\nFunding Goals\nOur overall funding goal for Primordial Power is tailored to be its bare minimum - a lot of the work for the project has already been funded out of pocket, and we're just looking for that last push to finish and ship the project! Following is the relative breakdown of how we'll handle the funds received from this Kickstarter.\n  As a note, the miscellaneous expenses are for our \"rainy day\" scenarios - unexpected fees or quality issues during printing or shipping or technical issues with digital deliveries, and will otherwise go to cover fees incurred during the crowdfunding process.\nStretch Goals\nGoing above and beyond the funding goal will naturally allow us to make an even bigger and better supplement. If we meet any of these stretch goals, they may delay the final product. If this happens, all backers at the print and PDF levels will receive a download of the current version of the supplement, and we'll go back to the drawing board to deliver the additional content you've unlocked in an updated PDF and physical print.\n$750 - Funding Complete! (Goal met 7/3/2018)\n$900 - Extra Monsters - At the $900 level, we'll be able to expand Primordial Power to include two new monsters! (Goal met 7/7/2018)\n$1000 - Extra Illustrations - At the $1000 level, we'll be able to squeeze enough extra money into the art and layout budgets to add some other small illustrations into the book, just to give it that extra oomph. (Goal met 7/12/2018)\n$1200 - Extra Subclass - At the $1200 level, we'll be able to commit just enough extra money into our budgets to add a third subclass to the book. (Goal met 7/23/2018)\n$1500 - Extra Primordial - At $1500, you've all shown that you want to see more! If we reach this point, we'll add a whole new primordial's profile to the book, 2 new spells themed around that primordial, and at least one new monster.\n About TBM Games\nTBM Games is a blog about role-playing games and a newly-minted company situated in Lincoln, Nebraska. The team currently consists of cousins Christopher Knapp and Abigail Boellstorff, a pair of RPG enthusiasts.\nChristopher Knapp originally was a student of video game design and computer science whose passions gradually shifted towards pen and paper games. He currently studies business administration and entrepreneurship.\nAbigail Boellstorff's earliest experiences with tabletop RPGs was with her father's AD&D collection, drawing monsters that caught her eye. She currently studies art, with her media of choice being marker and paper or or acrylics.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is TBM Games' first foray into publishing a game supplement, there are naturally risks that we'll face that an established company would not. We're playing a lot of things by ear, but we've also put in a lot of effort to effectively deliver Primordial Power.\n\nAs of launching this campaign, the majority of the project has been completed - All of our art is finished, the book's layout has been drafted, and we're just getting our ducks in a row to be able to sell Primordial Power in print and PDF. What this means is that we're still doing some minor layout work which we aim to complete before the end of this campaign, such as making sure that the product is ready for printing as soon as humanly possible.\n\nBecause the core product is practically finished, the largest delay we anticipate is meeting stretch goals, which will require us to make some adjustments to the final format for the printed version of the supplement. If we do meet any stretch goals, we'll distribute PDFs of the current version before moving on to make an upgraded version, though, so you'll have access to content immediately after this campaign ends.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Witness to Cataclysm", "descp": "Every dollar goes a long way to help make this game supplement a reality!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "PDF Backer", "descp": "You will receive a PDF copy of Primordial Power for your digital RPG library.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["52 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Print+PDF Backer", "descp": "You will receive both a PDF copy and Print copy of Primordial Power.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy\nPrint Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Two Print Copies", "descp": "You will receive a PDF copy of Primordial Power and two Print copies of Primordial Power - one for yourself, and one for your favorite GM or player!\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy\n2\u00d7 Print Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (49 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Producer", "descp": "At the Producer level, you will receive a PDF copy of Primordial Power, a Print copy of Primordial Power, and your name will be immortalized along with all the other elemental titans - the credits page shall stand as your domain.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy\nPrint Copy\nProducer Credit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (8 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "Herald of a Lost Titan", "descp": "At the Herald level, you will receive all the rewards of the Producer level - Print and PDF copies of Primordial Power and your name as a Producer in the credits of the book - and Christopher will work with you to add a primordial of your design into Primordial Power!\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy\nPrint Copy\nProducer Credit\nDesign a Primordial", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "1 backer"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Primordials Unleashed!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Hurry Up and Wait!

The Book of Many Things by Samurai Sheepdog is a collection of player options for the Pathfinder\u00ae Roleplaying Game. Inside each volume is a compilation of requests from around the world, written out and made playable for you. Some examples include:\nThe fiari race (Volume 2) has a long history with boars, and some even learn how to become like them.\nHalf-dwarves, otterlings, and vulture-men bring different cultures and character interactions to the table. Play as a nerude: A rotund, cat-like race who prefers to eat and sleep, but will adventure so they can find more time to eat, and sleep. Build characters with familiar races akin to some found in popular media like runekin (master weaponsmiths with an earthy appearance and giant swords), fiari (desert-dwelling thieves and sorcerers with red hair and a flare for the dramatic), and tsura (who commonly dwell in water, offering aid to young heroes).\nArbiters, dalits, skaldaks, and swarmborn make for some curious, nonstandard races.\nDragon souls, god-blooded, and nephilim bring the power of gods and other great beings to bear.\nDwarrow, dworgs, and elflings hail from a dark realm ruled by a fallen god.\nWorld Soul dragonkin, dwarves (bronzemane, ironfire, and wildhill), elves (high, sun, moon, shadow, and star), tech gnomes, minotaurs (bison-fur, elk-horn, and eternal-flame), tieflings (exiled and star-forged), and trollkin (forest) celebrate their MMO counterparts with interesting abilities and traits.\nMinotaurs, leonin (lions), leporine (rabbits), sokari (unicorns), and ursaren (bears) round out a few other anthropomorphic races.\nDryants, manussos, mushroom leshys, xendauni\nThe accelerist (Volume 1) is a fast, active hero who can speed through the battlefield, taking opponents down quickly using velocity.\n                                                                                                                                                        Want to play one of 18+ new classes, including alternate, base, and hybrid classes? Speed through your enemies as an accelerist, take their power for yourself as a battle augur.\nPractice the forbidden arts as an invoker or necromancer.\nHybrids like convokers (paladin/summoner), darkseekers (cleric/rogue), d\u00falra (cleric/druid) and monster tamers (druid/monster trainer) find new ways to experience their parent classes as one solid concept.\nGenerational heroes, midnight legates (inquisitor/range), nature wardens (druid/fighter), truenamers, and witchblades (paladin/witch) take ideas from other editions and sources and expand on them.\nAstrologers (constellation magic), gamers (complex roleplaying and immersion), heirs apparent (wealth as a resource), potentialists (don't move!), and pythia (spontaneous druids) fill in strange concepts requested by fans and made into entertaining new options.\nArchetypes and class options offer a variety of new ways to play both new and classic character classes.\n                                                                           Play a wolf heart ranger, whose expertise lies in alchemy and specialized sigils he can use to create effects that help in battle. Maybe you draw your accelerist powers from time rather than speed as a time render. As a pious thief, you can worship the almighty coin. You could even become a skiprock champion!\nNumerous racial archetypes bring new ways to play as the race and class you want. Including: Archons and bull king's warriors (nephilim arcanists and barbarians), blessed apothecary (farrealmer alchemists), fury warrior (world soul barbarians) monk of the hidden continent (ursaren monks), mushroom knight (leshy fighters), sorcerer thane (fiari magus), and trash witch (dalit witches).\nAt least 1 archetype for every new class, and several for existing classes. These include: necrolyte, predator, and shapeless druids, rangers of the dark path, sanguine gunman gunslingers, time render accelerists, troubadour bards, twin blade generational heroes, vengeful spirit mediums, and wolf heart rangers.\nConvergence (introduced in Volume 1) lets you take a different heroic path during character progression.\n                                                                       The character options chapter in each volume includes other ways to customize a character beyond just class and level. Convergence, for example, allows you to trade some of the gold you would usually gather each level to take a heroic path and change yourself thematically, such as making you more devilish, draconic, of fey-like.\nConvergences also interact with some classes (such as the heir apparent) and magical locations (see below).\nFeats fill in the blanks on characters in different ways. From becoming a masterful assassin to experiencing new multiclassing options.\n Each volume contains a number of new spell lists (for the classes that require them) and new spells that offer opportunities for characters to study different methods of magical use.\nMagic items and equipment give characters new ways to deal with their enemies in combat, travel, or learn.\nIntroduced in volume 2, magical locations take an idea from back in D&D 3.5 edition and bring it to Pathfinder in new and exciting ways.\n Races like the dryant (dryad's who owe their lives to treants), manussos (constructs that absorb the consciousness of other creatures to grow stronger), and world soul dragonkin (dragon centaurs) have found their way into our exclusive content as we've unlocked new stretch goals.\nThe Dreamwalker class lets you explore the realm of dreams and use it to learn new, fantastic abilities quickly.\nVoted for by our backers so far are the life cycle guardians (druid and pythia) and the broom knight (cavalier) archetypes. Once we hit our next goal (150 backers), we can vote on another piece of content to guarantee, such as world soul ogres (a race that once ruled their world, sometimes have two heads), world soul dryants (dryant centaurs who guard the realm of dreams), the ventriloquist archetype (bard), model /s androids (small, armor and combat-loving androids), or some extra, new content for existing classes like necromancers and d\u00falra.\nBroom Knight art by Angusburger @DeviantArt\nThe different reward tiers are structured so that you can pick out the best individual option for you. If you want to get a single volume, you can simply pay the listed price and let us know in your survey which you want once the campaign finishes. If you want both, just double the price, and so forth. Any print copies distributed through the Kickstarter will be hardbound, premium print through Lightning Source and Drivethru RPG. \nVolume 1 is finished now. Volume 2 is available in PDF and expected in print around October. \nIt is stated in the rewards themselves, but Volume 2 is still being updated regularly. Once the campaign ends, anybody with a pdf reward for this volume will receive their link to the monthly update. Once the book reaches between 172 and 200 pages, we will finish cleaning it up and send it out for a proof copy to begin our print run for those looking to keep one on their bookshelves.\nVolume 2 offers playable options for characters based on other popular media.\nRequests for Additional Content and Art\nWe have a print proof ready to go out for Volume 1, but we can add up to 22 additional pages without having to change the layout. If anybody backs at a level where they can add content to volume 1, we will work with them to add it quickly once the campaign ends so we can adjust the print and reapprove it. If you're considering one of these tiers, please be available and ready to put in your request at the end.\nWe have more leeway for Volume 2, since it won't be sent to print before October, but the sooner we can get requests in for this, the sooner we can find an appropriate artist and put the content into the PDF.\nYou can get customized pages of content with a direct thanks to you on the same page!\nHow to Get an Add-On: If you have backed the project here or as part of our extended campaign on Drivethru RPG, you can reach out to me through a direct message on the Book of Many Things Facebook page or the Samurai Sheepdog website (www.samuraisheepdog.com) and we can discuss adding prints of any content (including the campaign exclusive book), or get you set up to join us for our Pathfinder 2 conversion group starting in August.\nAdditional Print on Demand Link ($10): Want to pick up another copy of either volume 1 or 2 as a gift for a friend or family member? You can buy multiple print on demand copies as an addon to any tier for $10 each. \nHard Cover Copy of the Campaign Exclusive Content ($10/$25): Want something truly exclusive to the Kickstarter? How about a Hard cover copy of all of the exclusive content we're putting together? We have enough content already planned (up to 100 pages) to make this a viable option, and each goal we meet from here on will only make it that much better. If you're looking to get a signed copy sent your way, $25 will do the trick.\nSignature Upgrade ($15 USD): If you would like to have a single volume signed and sent to you, you can do so by backing at any print on demand tier and adding $15 USD to cover the cost of shipping it to us so we can sign it and send it out to you. When we send out surveys, you can let us know what volume you want signed ($30 for both).\nThe Book of Many Things Volume 3 ($10-$15): We've been asked if the Book of Many Things will continue after Volume 2, to which we want to say resoundingly yes! If you've enjoyed the work we're doing here so far, you'll love what we have planned down the road. Even better, you can get in on the groundwork now for less than the final cost when it goes live in (planned) 2019. If you add $10 to any tier, you can let us know in the survey it's for volume 3 early buy-in. For $15, you can buy-in now for a print on demand code once that volume is finished as well. We figure most Kickstarters plan out to a year in advance, so this is our reach into that not-so-distant future. We'll look forward to seeing you then.\n We also hosted a Deal of the Day on Drivethru RPG for one of our other titles, which is being added to our final total and already reflected in the stretch goals above.\nAs a result of our efforts, we have so far reached 2 major stretch goals already. PCGen Support and a custom cover for the campaign exclusive content. Here's a link to check out the former, and a preview of the latter. *Cover subject to change as we get custom art completed.\nWe also have several other designers joining us as we meet the content goals, including:\nScott Gladstein: A green-tea fueled writing golem; Scott runs Little Red Goblin Games and has over a hundred published works to his name.

She likes to define herself as, \"a lot wizard, a little oracle, and a would-be bard\" (lately, also a Halfling Librarian), and the greatest challenge she deals with everyday now is finding time to write with an inquisitor of a husband and a little celestial bloodrager and dinosaur\u2013loving skald (Michele and Giorgio) in her life. Her impressive collection of work has been published in Wayfinder, in the Wayfinder Bestiary, and in Yggdrasil #1.

Alessia casts off the traditional fantasy assumptions and introduces players to a wider world with a host of new species, technology, powers, and places to explore - for both Starfinder and 5e.\nA terran monk and his allies battle a summoned servant of the Cult of Galgar\u00e6. ~Illustration by Septimius Ferdian\nThe World of Alessia is a high-fantasy campaign setting that combines Wuxia, science fiction, and magic-driven technology. It is a massive world where magic and technology coexist peacefully, impacting every aspect of life, from the Healing Houses of Sillias to the Great Towers of Xin. It is a land where Fyrean Genies meet with Asrian Wardens and The Gangs of Khatu push their Drifters across the desert sands, seeking resources and victims of every kind.\nMockup image of the Campaign Primer\nThe World of Alessia Campaign Primer is a comprehensive introduction to Alessia. The primer includes details on the world of Alessia, its threats, the factions that drive its politics, and the many people who walk Alessia's streets.\nA host of new familiars grace the pages of the primer.\nBeautifully illustrated with full-color art, the World of Alessia Campaign Primer will inspire GMs while providing players with a host of new options to take their 5e or Starfinder game to the next level.\nThe World of Alessia Campaign Primer brings you:\n11 new races (and more with each stretch goal we achieve).\n4 new classes - the Marauder, the Psion, the Seer, and the Tecker.\nA system of Stunts and Resolve (for 5e play).\nA garage full of new gear, vehicles, armor, and weapons for your 5e and Starfinder games.\nNew rules for attaining unique familiars.\nAnd lots more awesome options for your game!\nTake a peek at the four new classes.\nMarauders are trained to bring the pain.\nA modern-day gunslinger with a penchant for heavy weapons, the marauder specializes in energy and kinetic missile weapons of all sorts; whether using energy rifles or high-powered ballistics, these individuals bring the pain - often from far away.\nTeckers make it happen!\n A step above mere \u201ctinkerers,\u201d teckers represent the inquisitive mind turned outward, specifically toward some of Alessia\u2019s dangerous elements; at 3rd level, most teckers choose a specialty, becoming breachers (magical hackers and intrusion specialists), devs (device hackers and magitech specialists), or speeders (vehicle experts).\n\nA gnole psion enhances his weapons.\nFairly common among the Elathi, the psion is a master of the mind. Psions spend their lives navigating the inner spaces; as a class, psions focus on making excellent use of their natural psychic abilities to solve problems and defend their allies.\n\nAn elven seer plays with the local kaima.\n Seers operate on the other end of the spectrum, working in tandem with Alessia\u2019s spirits, specifically the Kaima. Common among the Celestia, as well as the Elath, Seers spend their days whispering the unseen, either to help or to harm.\n\nAre you ready to learn more about Alessia?\nZhang Wei, Imperial Peacekeeper\nTake a look at Alessia through the eyes of Seirye Qin, Captain of the Skyship Amethyst Myst. When you're done learning about her, take a look at Xei, Dragonsworn Ghost Monk, the honorable Zhang Wei, Human Peacekeeper, or even one of the mysterious Elathi.\nWho are the Ish'ra?\nWhile many of the traditional fantasy races exist in Alessia, some do not. Moreover, the humans of Alessia are not the dominant species on the planet. The humans share that position with their cousins, the Djinnkin, and Terrans. Compared to the Y\u00f6kai and all their lines, the humans are a small line indeed.\nThe Treah are one of Alessia's core races.\n Creatures born to defend the Trees of Life, the Treah are a race of bipedal, humanoids with bark-like skin and fibrous frames. Because of their natural connection to the Trees of Life, Treah frequently become druids and rangers. The Treah have traditions, as well. These traditions encourage the Treah to take up several Sacred Paths, eventually turning these seedlings into Dream Wardens and Envoys of the Green.\nVelestrian elves work hand in hand with the Treah to protect the fabled Trees of Life\n The dominant people of the continent of Velestra, elves have a complex, sometimes confusing social hierarchy that many outsiders find off-putting. Although elves see themselves as a single people, much of Alessia classifies them according to their homeland; Fyreani (widely known as desert elves) roam much of Alessia\u2019s eastern lands, while the Velestrians (also known as green or wood elves) stand sentry for the fabled Trees of Life. The Un\u2019Seeliaha (commonly known as dark elves) are the final group of elves. Rejected by the Trees of Life for reasons known only to the elves, this group of outcasts \u2013 their skins marked with arcane sigils for their crimes \u2013 wanders the southern coasts of Galgar\u00e6, living along the coastlines.\nThe Celestia first appeared after the Old Gods disappeared.\n Beings infused with The Light, the very first Celestia rose from the ashes of the War of Sovereigns like saints among men, taking on the holy charge of The Light and helping to carve out what would later become the Holy Kingdom of Asrai. Naturally biased toward the light, the Celestia resemble Humans or Terrans, often with soft and symmetrical features. Naturally beautiful, these beings have no problem attuning to the Light. Some Celestia (although not all) are born with large, angel-like wings.\nAfter several millennia on Alessia, the Ish'ra now call this pale blue dot home.\n One of Alessia\u2019s oldest races, the Ish\u2019ra were refugees when the Y\u00f6kai were still young; fleeing from the dark spaces beyond the void, the Ish\u2019ra voidship The Enduring Dream breached Alessia\u2019s atmosphere when the Y\u00f6kai Warlords were still in power, crashing into central Elysia and depositing her survivors all along Elysian coasts. Having naturalized to Alessia over their millennia-long stay, the Ish\u2019ra now proudly identify as natives to their new home. Natural psychics with several technical aptitudes, the Ish\u2019ra have contributed to much of Alessia\u2019s progress.\nXei, like all Ghost Blade Monks, stands guard against evil Kaima\n A people torn between two times, the Dragonsworn of ancient Alessia have a developed and evolved culture that betrays all of the outside stereotypes with glee. From their colorful festivals to their colorful scales, Truescales can trace their clutches back to the very first celestial dragons. Their lesser brethren, which shallow individuals call Dullscales, bear no patterns of lineage, nor \u201cany true history of scale or struggle.\u201d Instead, these persons have transformed themselves through alchemy, magic, or science; sometimes all three.\nAn Elathi seer prepares a spell.\nOne of Alessia\u2019s evolved peoples, the Elathi enjoy some of the visual markers of their elven ancestry, though they are not elves. Today, the Elathi divide themselves into two ancestral lines. The Telathians regard themselves as the natural evolution of elves and have crystalized horns through which they focus their psionic powers. The Illathi lack crystalized horns, but instead enjoy a natural aptitude for \u201clight-shaping\u201d and celestial skills.\nA Terran Cleric of the Light\nStanding slightly taller than your average human, Terrans evolved beside side-by-side with their human and Djinnkin cousins in the heart of Fyrea. Expanding rapidly beside their human cousins and enjoying a slight evolutionary advantage, the Terrans of Alessia now occupy every corner of the planet. Slightly stronger than humans on average, Terrans are also adept climbers, as well as wrestlers \u2013 easy tasks for individuals with an extra set of arms!\nA Fengu Ninja draws her blade.\n Native to the lands that existed before The Great Beast Galgar\u00e6 crashed into cold, dark earth, the Fengu are a broken people. Denied flight by evolution, the Fengu have become a wandering people, traveling the broken coastline of their former homeland, battling for resources while actively engaging the Spawn of Galgar\u00e6.\nA Pandren monk readies his weapon.\n One of the few races that might consider being called Onikuma a compliment, Pandrens are large, muscular warriors evolved from Alessia\u2019s native pandas. Prominent members of the Council of Yerwin, the Pandrens sought sanctuary in Pyrrin Isles and remained there until embracing the Empire of Xian.\nThe Weaslings are exceptionally talented, especially when it comes to tech.\nHaving evolved on the eastern plains of Yerwin, the Weaslings are a race of hyper-intelligent polecats whose agility and charm makes them popular entertainers throughout the Empire of Xian. Talented pilots with a natural affinity for technology, the quickest way to encourage violence is to mention its pelt.\nA Djinnkinn warrior leaps into battle.\nThe offspring of the great Lords of Brass and their human servants, the Djinnkin are also known as Djinnkinn or simply \u2018Kin (and informal, casual greeting shared between aligned houses). Born with all the heat, sun, and motivation someone traveling the deserts of Fyrea could want, the Djinnkin are a resourceful people whose magical gifts and love of transforming cultures and places adds guides their slow expansion throughout Alessia.\nThe World of Alessia is a Wuxia-inspired campaign setting with over two-dozen intelligent, bipedal species united together against the encroaching darkness - which Alessia now faces on multiple fronts. On the planet itself, heroes battle extremists, cultists, and stand watch against incursions from the Spawn of Galgar\u00e6.\n In the skies above Alessia, brave Skyship Captains and Imperial Marines work in tandem to keep the Ring of Heaven functioning, so that Alessia remains shielded from the void beyond.\nA terran seer and her Ish'ra ally look down on the gates of the Holy City of Asrai. ~Illustration by Le Minh Hoai Quoc\nWith more advanced magic and technology, the people of Alessia must confront old problems in new ways.\nWhen the last of the Sovereigns departed, they left Alessia with two gifts - the Ring of Heaven and The Light. The ring is a celestial artifact that works in tandem with the light, defending Alessia against her external threats. \nThe Light is a story. \nIn the wake of the War of the Sovereigns, the people of Alessia looked upward and found, for a time, only silence. When the surviving Sovereigns announced their departure from Alessia, they an entity is known only as The Light.\nIn Alessia, the light manifests through younger adults, manifesting in their early teens and empowering them each in unique ways. Deep in the Holy Kingdom of Asrai, the Holy Prophet of Light watches over world events, considering how best to act for her people.\nKickstarter continues to provide us with the best platform for funding and delivering great projects to gamers the world over. This year, we're launching our most ambitious project to date, one we've been working on for nearly a year now.

It is as much inspired by Mesoamerican mythology and spirituality as it is by 80s and 90s mecha series.\nNagual distinguishes itself from other games with it\u2019s very easy to learn, non-intrusive, open, fast-play system, unique mechanics, and its totally novel premise.\nOur Story\nWe are Little Red Goblin Games LLC and we've been publishing role playing games for about 8 years. We have released over a hundred products and have had 3 successful Kickstarters of this scope before!  We've mostly done 3rd party support for Paizo's Pathfinder & Starfinder systems, but we've branched out into our own games like Doodle Dice Monsters, TV the RPG, and Free Wars. We want to bring a new and exciting system and story to your table!\nWhat You Are Funding\nWe are looking for funding for the core rulebook of this game. We believe we should invest into a product before we ask you to so we self-funded a lot of the game's initial development and spent countless hours working on it. All rewards are digital (see FAQ for more information). The book is near completion but we need money for art, to recuperate the funding we have invested already, and to fund future Nagual products!\nWe want to get get artwork for our remaining 8 unit types, some layout assets, add more units to the document, pay Ian for his editing work, Scott for his design work, and Christos for his contributions.\nHere is our spending breakdown\nStretch Goals\n$2,000 (Goal)- Expanded Art: At this goal we will be able to fund the full additional art order we want! This will add designs for all of those not only to the book but also to the digital art packs for the $25+ tier!\n$2,250 (+$250)- Variant Nagual: We will add variant nagual unit types for every major frame! This includes:\n\"Dawn Lord\" aerial-sniper variant for the Quetzalcoatl.\nMixcoatl fire-support variant for the Tezcatlipoca.\nHuracan air superiority variant for the Xolotl.\nChaac siege-breaker variant for the Tlaloc.\n\"Diamond\" solar-weapon variant for the Tonatiuh.\nPatecatl chemical-weapon support variant for the Mayahuel.\nOtomi high-quality officer variant of the Yao.\nMomoyactli electronic warfare/psyops variant of the Pipiltin.\n\"Itzy\" close-combat variant of the Camazotz.\n$2,500 (+$500)- Tier 1 Nagual: We break out the big guns and add several tier 1 frames! These nagual are classified as \"weapons of mass destruction\" and represent the highest level of power available to players! While we are including the Tonatiuh (Aka \"Gold\"), we want to add more! Each will include it's own \"Chosen Nagual\" talent list as well! These include:\nShorn Ones: While officially designated \u201cCuachicqueh\u201d, shorn ones are large, imposing, military nagual whose spirits are as honorable as they are bloodthirsty. They never retreat- always moving forward. They have large displays standing behind them, coming off their back.\nK'awiil (\"Vulture Lord\"): A mysterious and deadly nagual, possessive of an intelligent, mystic, and Machiavellian spirit. It employs various extra-dimensional powers. It protects itself with an armored cloak and moves in mysterious ways.\nOmeteotl (\"Twins\"): The famous two-headed nagual that defeated the first Centzon invasion! It requires two like-spirited pilots to bring out its full potential but it's power is nearly unlimited!\n$3,000- Nagual Strike Force: If we hit this goal we will have funded our 2nd book! This will include rules for some rules for Centzon defectors, combining nagual, rules for \"insane play\" (75+ EP characters), expanded world lore, animal nagual & animal \"pilots\", non-nagual pilot player options, weapons inhabited by spirits, support staff rules as well an expanded roster of variant Nagual!\nOur Team\nScott Gladstein (Producer)\nAlso known as \"Red\", Scott has been developing for about 8 years. He started Little Red during his undergrad and has over a hundred published works, and has freelanced at various companies. He wears a lot of hats at Little Red: producer, designer, layout, and manages the business side of things. He is also co-host on the weekly Professional Goblins podcast and avid fencer.\nIan Sisson (Editor)\nIan is one half of the management team at Little Red. He started as a designer in the early days and worked his way up to head editor. He is a regular designer and has contributed a lot to this project as well.\nRui Ferreira (Artist)\nA frequent collaborator with Little Red, Rui is our Portuguese art angel and all the art for Nagual has been of his creation. He is excited to work on more art for future books!\nChristos Gurd (Designer)\nWhile the great and terrible Christos is taking a sabbatical at the moment (congrats on getting married!) he was a key designer both at Little Red and on Nagual.\nSpecial Thanks To: Endzeitgeist, Lucus Palosaari, Kristopher Cruz, and many more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe development of the core rule book is about 75%-80% done and has been play-tested, received a round of paid feedback from reviews/industry professionals/external players.

This is Everyman Gaming's second Kickstarter and Rogue Genius Games's fourth; our team is experienced in crowdfunding and publishing. We know what we're doing. Everyman Gaming started this year publishing a 1,000 words or more of Third-Party Pathfinder Roleplaying Game content every week, and has continued this trend until August 17th, at which point we began releasing two products a week for a total of 2,000 or more words. Both Everyman Gaming and Rogue Genius Games are 5-Star Third-Party Publishers with plenty of experience.\n\nThe primary risk for the Starfarer's Skill Guide is our author (Alex Augunas) or artist (Jacob Blackmon) being struck by some major illness or injury. In such a scenario, we're prepared to reach out to friends and contacts throughout the industry, from Rogue Genius Games and belong, to complete this project in as timely of a manner as possible.\n\nCurrently, all of the words for the funded level of this book are written; they just need to be developed and edited once or twice each. This is due to the Advanced Skill Guide's status as a compilation and conversion product of sorts. As additional stretch goals are unlocked, however, we may need additional time to get the content written, and will certainly need time to get the art finished.\n\nAnother potential challenge could arise from backers who wish to have character illustrations included in the Advanced Skill Guide if they aren't quick to communicate with Jacob or Akex. Backers who pledge at those levels must deliver text promptly, and it will be developed as quickly as possible.

We have had international best-selling authors and film makers as guests, but also others who are just starting out.\nWe need your help. Your support is invaluable, and it doesn't matter how much you can give, just that we all work together to continue to get the show we all deserve. I want to continue to interact and communicate with each other, creating our unique community and camaraderie. \nTake a look around and choose one of the awesome reward levels, or just contribute a flat amount. I can\u2019t do this without great people, people like you. And it wouldn't be worth doing without you. And most of all\u2026 thank you. \nThank you for your support, and for sharing this Kickstarter campaign with others.\nWhat's your goal?\n  Our base goal is to get a cell/mobile signal booster for my home studio. This is necessary because the internet here is atrocious. We tried satellite, hotspots, etc. We had to fall back on broadcasting from Retro Daddio out of Williamsburg, VA. The owner moved in December of last year, and hasn't been able to get her internet hooked up yet, so Talk of the Tavern has had no place to broadcast from. And though we made temporary measures to keep the show running (after all, the show must go on), we needed a permanent fix. \nMinimum Goal: $605 For that we need a booster. Thus the title of this Kickstarter, plus it \"boosts\" our signal in other ways, and a fundraiser is often called a \"booster\". Triple word play! The booster costs $549.99 on Amazon (Free Shipping with Prime), and we add in the Kickstarter fees of 10%, and get a total of $605.\nStretch Goals\nIf we get more than the minimum, we have a plan in place to use the extra to further improve the show. I will detail it below, but the short version is we'll get an even better booster; then get the co-hosts gear they've been missing to improve the quality of their sound and video, and the show as a whole; a mobile studio for live shows; followed by a mobile PA system so we can broadcast in a larger indoor or outdoor venue without needing extra gear. Oh, and each stretch goal comes with extra rewards for ALL of our Kickstarter supporters. Warning: We dream big.\nFirst Stretch Goal: $990 - We will set it up and get the better Wireless Booster which will cost $899.99 on Amazon.com (free shipping with Prime), plus add in the 10% Kickstarter fees, for a total of $990. And to show our appreciation, we'll add an extra reward which will go out to all of the people who supported us on Kickstarter; A series of eBooks from Travis I. Sivart. We'll also begin to set up a second weekly broadcast... Talk of the Tavern: British Pub, which will feature our European friends as our regular co-hosts and guests, thus bringing attention to our community overseas and introducing the US to new and creative concepts! Other possible broadcasts are Tuesday Tunes (all indie music), Wednesday Game Stream (Video game stream), Two Martini Lunch or Pickle and Beer Lunch (an afternoon drink and discussion).\nSecond Stretch Goal: $1500 - We will shop around for two monitors, two headsets, two webcams, and other needed miscellaneous equipment that is needed to bring Andrea's, Kevin's, and Ed's broadcasting setup to match Travis's. It will also help to cover the cost of website and online fees. The bonus reward for all of our Kickstarter supporters will be a postcard with the autographs of the cast of Talk of the Tavern mailed to you and the possibility of a third Talk of the Tavern broadcast each week. \nThird Stretch Goal: $2200 - If we hit this level, then we're taking the show to the next level. We will shop around and get what we need for a mobile broadcasting studio, including microphones, stands, mixer, cables, etc. This will let us go to a convention or anywhere else and setup for a full show without needing any equipment from the venue. We will also add a phone number/line so that viewers can call in to the live show. As a bonus, all Kickstarter supporters will be mailed a Talk of the Tavern patch, designed exclusively for the Kickstarter.\nFourth Stretch Goal: $3500 - This was going to be our final stretch goal, so we can take the show on the road. If we hit this we will purchase a mobile PA system (like the Fender Passport system), so we can broadcast to a large crowd at any venue. As an additional reward to our supports, we will set up one of the two following special broadcasts; A Live Studio Audience Experience where we invite you to come out and join us in a live show,  OR the All Nighter Show where we broadcast from our usual 8 PM until the dawn's early light. \nFifth Stretch Goal: $6000 - I wasn't even going to put this in, because I consider it a bit presumptuous, but I love the idea of making it to the level, so I will include it. If we reach $6k we will fly our British co-host here to the USA and do a live broadcast with all of us in one room. Oh, since it is the 5th stretch goal, each of us on the show will also get a fifth of liquor and toast all of you with it!\nWhat do I get out of it?\nThe reward levels are explained in brief on the right, but I will expand on the explanations here.\nIf you pledge:\n$5: We will mention a name of your choosing on the live broadcast of the show. It can be your name, or one of someone else, it will be your choice. If we know you (like if you're a regular \"Hot TotTie\"), we may mention you when you first support us, and in the episode after the Kickstarter ends when we mention everyone else.\n$25: You know that box on the bottom of the video when the show is on? The one that has the rotating ads showing our social media, Travis's free ebook, and all that? Well for $20 we will put in either an advertisement of your making (600x600 pixels and 300 dpi in jpg format) or personal message (same size as the ad requirement, and you have to make it) in the slide show rotation for one month.\n$50: Ok, it starts getting really good now. For this level of support, YOU choose a topic and we'll discuss it for 20 minutes on an episode in May or after. We will have one or more shows where we do the topics folks from this level suggest. Now, the topic must be approved by us, and on a case by case basis, there are lines even we won't cross.\n$75: We will review your product, live and on air, and make a YouTube Video Review for the Talk of the Tavern YouTube Channel. If you don't have a product, we can record a video about you, or your dog, maybe your favorite ice cream. We're flexible. But we must approve the topic or product, because we don't just do anything, especially things that will get us banned from our beloved broadcasting platforms.\n$100: Want to come on the show? Talk about yourself, your projects, something you're selling, or maybe just hang out and stare at us and wave at your friends? This is the one for you! You get to make a 20 minute appearance on an episode of our choice on Talk of the Tavern.

I also want both the Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium hardback for 5E and the Gothic Campaign Compendium hardback for Pathfinder. Leaving the reward level still at $50, I add $90 more to my pledge.

It might well contain the usual dead bodies, corpses, and demonical villainy, but in this case you are the corpse, or at least an amalgam thereof.\nIn Frankenstein Faktoria you and your friends play a Frankensteiner. One of the tortured creations of Doctor Victor Frankenstein, created out of a composite of body parts from cadavers and reanimated through science and electricity.\n(Fun Fact: Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" novel was first published 200 years ago on 1st January 1818! Happy Anniversary Frankenstein!)\nFrankenstein Faktoria Cover by David Allsop\nTHE PLAYERS\nThe Doctor, Doctor Victor Von Frankenstein, has constructed a small Factory in the town of Shalleymouth. Here in his infernal facility, unnatural Creatures, denying nature\u2019s laws, Frankenstein\u2019s children, are produced on an assembly line, endlessly, day-by-day.  \nWhy does he do it? Nobody knows. The Doctor appears to have gone completely insane. He has severed his ties with the world outside and has shut himself up inside his crumbling castle alone with his experiments. He does not give his \u201cchildren\u201d much attention, instead he spends his time endlessly experimenting, synthesising chemical solutions, scribbling labyrinthine formulae on blackboards, and tinkering with mysterious devices. He is manifestly uninterested in the operation of the production line. Instead a hunchbacked servant, Igor, adopted by Frankenstein many years ago, oversees the day-to-day operation of the Factory.  \nDuring a Frankenstein Faktoria game, the players take on the role of the tortured monsters created by the Doctor. His hideous Frankensteiners...\nIgor and Frankenstein by David Allsop\nPRODUCTION (AKA CHARACTER CREATION)\nEvery Sunday the loyal Igor brings lovely, \u201cfresh\u201d bodies to the Factory as raw material. These unfortunate corpses are usually collected from the local mortuary, either by Igor himself or the itinerant grave robbers Mr. Alexander & Mr. Dry, but if the need arises, \u201cmeat\u201d is collected directly from nearby villages or delivered, fresh from burial in the cemeteries, or even killed to order.  \nBodies, from which the brains are cut out first, are thrown unceremoniously into an enormous metal funnel, dragged through by gigantic cogs and torn apart into their various sections by the ripping action of the machinery. Limbs thusly prepared are transported on a rattling, creaking conveyor to the next station on the production line. Here Igor selects the least damaged parts with a keen eye, disposing of the worthless ones in great, stinking bins of flesh. Only then does a group of \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s children,\u201d labouring in the Factory, put everything back together again. With makeshift sewing machines, they try to rearrange limbs and torsos into some semblance of humanity. Finally when all the parts are stitched together, as best as they can manage with fumbling fingers, Frankenstein himself arrives. He personally inspects and inserts the new brain into every body, reviving the dead tissue with the electrical means of his diabolical reanimation.\nIgor, supervising the conveyor belt, chooses the least damaged limbs and throws them into huge containers, which are then transported to the sewing room. Will the Player Character be created from \u201chigh quality\u201d limbs or from the torn and decaying parts that miss his eye? That depends on sheer chance.\nWho's There? by David Allsop\n Every Frankensteiner is composed of four basic elements: head, torso, arms, and legs. The player rolls a d3 four times and assigns the resulting values to their chosen Traits.\nThe value assigned to each area determine the following:\nLegs = Speed\nHead = Mind\nArms = Agility\nTorso = Strength\nDuring the game, when players undertake an action, they will need to make a Trait roll to see if those actions are successful. These rolls are made using a number of d10s equal to the value of the Trait involved with a target number required, depending on the complexity of the task.\nSometimes, when appropriate limbs are lacking, Igor constructs makeshift prosthetics of various kinds from whatever he finds lying around the Factory. These might be a pair of scissors, a piano leg with a wheel, or something even more peculiar. Because of this the next step in character creation is determining the origins of specific body parts.\nEach player can choose three types of characteristics, from the lists in the book or ones that their GM invents, and roll on the tables to find out what special abilities, or drawbacks, their Frankensteiner has.\nCharacteristics are split into the following:  \nGeneral Characteristics - such as Natural Smell, Loud Roar, or Additional Brain.  \nHead Characteristics - such as Intelligent Face, Missing Eye, or Sewn-Up Windpipe.  \nHand Characteristics - such as Thief's Hands, Mechanic's Hands, or Long Arms.  \nTorso Characteristics - such as Tattoo, Fish tank Torso, or Subsutaneous Armour.  \nLeg Characteristics - such as Sprinter's Legs, Wheeled Feet, or Monkey Toes.\nMalicious Stare by David Allsop\nExample: Malicious Stare - The eyes implanted in the Frankensteiner\u2019s head once belonged to someone terribly cruel, and now their wild, lunatic stare induces fear even in Igor, who strengthens the grasps on his iron club when speaking to the character. A Frankensteiner with malicious stare adds an additional d10 to his dice pool when making all Persuasion rolls.\nBOLTS\nSkulls do not come in one size. Some brains are larger, some are smaller and still others are missing little bits. In this situation there is no guarantee that the brain will be fully co-ordinated with the body and to solve this problem Frankenstein devised the bolts. An iron band is fastened inside the empty skull and then connected to electrodes. Next, the brain is placed inside the band. The temples are drilled and threaded, and finally the bolts are pushed into the holes.  \nBolts by David Allsop\nWhen the bolts are tightened, Mind Trait is reduced to 1. The Frankensteiner is not able to think clearly or perform complicated tasks. Only when the bolts are loosened is the ability to think restored, sadly at the expense of bodily control. Agility, Strength and Speed are then, in turn, reduced to 1, as the character becomes clumsy, weak, and unbalanced. During a game session the players will be forced to tighten and loosen the bolts constantly to ensure the best possible performance of their minds and bodies. \nSHALLEYMOUTH\nThe Doctor's Castle and Factory are situated on a hill overlooking the town of Shalleymouth. \nShalleymouth by David Allsop\nThe town has never been the same since the Factory appeared on the hill. Murders, mysterious disappearances, strange incidents... all of it made the atmosphere in this town of several thousand souls tense and very troubled. Life still goes on, but it is hardly normal. The people are afraid to leave their houses, venturing out only with great reluctance and then only to walk along the main streets. The school and the church are still open, of course. The stores still prosper, but most of the alleys winding among the old houses are empty and silent. The ghastly howling of the wind and the constant pour of rain streaming broadly down the paving are the only distraction.  \nFigures stalk the darkness.  \nPeople shut doors and windows and lock them tight.  \nMothers can be heard crying, \u201cCome back home this minute!\u201d   \nThe anxiety is palpable.\nShalleymouth is the nearest town to The Factory. Indeed, the Factory and Castle are built on a hill overlooking the town, its presence casting a cloak of malevolence, suspicion and dread across the townsfolk.\nWhilst Shalleymouth is spoken about in the original game there isn't a lot of information available. As part of this campaign we are also looking at producing a new Shalleymouth supplement for Frankenstein Faktoria, which you can pledge for in certain tiers (Visitor of Shalleymouth and above).\nSome of these tiers will allow you to leave your mark on the town... become a citizen or dignitary or maybe even help establish one of the establishments there. Landlord of a pub? The local Undertakers? Matron of the Orphanage? Or maybe a simple Tailor? There are also opportunities for an illustration based upon your likeness to appear in the Shalleymouth book.\nWe will be release two short PDFs (@ 2-4 pages each in length) a month from April 2018 until March 2019, with each looking at a new establishment. Then, once the series has finished, we will compile all of them and send the Shalleymouth backers a PDF containing all 24 establishments plus a voucher to order a physical copy at cost + postage through DriveThruRPG.\nADVENTURE HOOKS\nMost of the Creatures revived by the Doctor do not have any driving goals in their new lives, they just meander around the Factory and do whatever Igor tells them to do. The Player Characters are an exception, they happen to have flashes of Free Will. What are they to do with it, though? The characters may remain in the Factory. This gives them a chance to take part in the guerrilla war being fought between Bonobo and Frankenstein. The character of the Factory itself lets the Games Master introduce interesting logical puzzles, in which case the players will face the villains of the place: queer machinery, mazes of pipes, and dozens of flashing buttons. It might also turn out that they will be forced to fight for their home. The spell of fear under which Shalleymouth townsfolk live can break at any moment...\nFrankenstein Faktoria not only provides the rules and setting information but also includes a selection of Adventure Hooks. Ideas for the Games Master to use as they desire. All the original Adventure Hooks appear in the core rulebook but we hope to bring you more as stand-alone PDFs through the use of Stretch Goals.\nABOUT THE BOOK/PRODUCTION HISTORY & KS TIMELINE\nFrankenstein Faktoria was originally published in 2000 by Polish games company, Portal Games. Portal have produced a number of their own RPGs such as Neuroshima, Monastyr and De Profundis - the latter of which I published a second edition of whilst at Cubicle 7 - as well as having translated a number of English language RPGs into Polish. These days Portal are much better known as a board games publisher having designed and produced games such as First Martians: Adventures on the Red Planet, Cry Havoc, Imperial Settlers, Robinson Crusoe, and Stronghold.\nThe original Polish cover from 2000\n Frankenstein Faktoria was developed as a 'New Style' game. A game which was quick and easy to pick up, rules light and whose rulebook was not overly long. Whilst the book has yet to be laid out (thus the reason for this campaign) I would imagine the final page count will be around 40-48 pages.\nThe game has been fully translated, edited, proof read and all the artwork has been completed. With a colour cover and black & white interior illustrations all produced by David Allsop. This campaign is to raise money for the layout and printing. I already have a layout person, and a back-up layout person, ready to go and printing will be handled through DriveThruRPG. We also need to finalise the character sheet.\nAs soon as the campaign is finished, if successful, all backers at Electrified level and above will be sent the manuscript as a Word document. Thus enabling you to start playing the game straight away if you so wish.... so book your Halloween games now!\nOnce the funds clear from Kickstarter layout will start and we predict the book will be finished and available in PDF and Print sometime in April.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nAll Stretch will be available to backers of Electrified level or above. These will be supplied as PDFs. Where appropriate, backers will also receive coupons to print copies of any stretch goals that are also available in print at cost plus postage through DriveThruRPG.\nUNLOCKED! \u00a31000 - FRANKENSTEIN FAKTORIA FUNDED!!!!\nUNLOCKED!

You won't have to wait around!\nCheck out these interviews and previews at Farsight Blogger, Geek & Sundry, and EN World!\nYou get two books shipped as soon as the Kickstarter ends:\nThe 300-page full-colour hardcover N.E.W. The Science Fiction Roleplaying Game core rulebook, fully updated and errataed, with a special, exclusive Xeno Edition cover. \nThe 60-page full-colour softcover Xenomorphs: The Fall of Somerset Landing setting/adventure sourcebook which describes the setting - including known space, the United Marine Corps, equipment, careers, a pair of iconic starships, information about the different varieties of xenomorph, plus a detailed terraforming colony called Somerset Landing, along with a survival horror adventure set in that colony. Both books are detailed below.\nXenomorphs: The Fall of Somerset Landing was written by Darren Pearce (Doctor Who; Lone Wolf), Angus Abranson (Hillfolk; Cubicle 7), and Russ Morrissey (What's OLD is NEW; To Slay A Dragon).\nIf you already own the N.E.W. The Science Fiction Roleplaying Game core rulebook, you have the option to simply purchase the Xenomorphs: The Fall of Somerset Landing setting/adventure sourcebook on its own. \nWant to see a whole load of previews? Before the Kickstarter launched, we were posting them regularly here on this thread on EN World! Feel free to check them out!\nThis is the Full Xeno Print Set\n  A full-colour 60-page softback setting book which introduces the universe of Xenomorphs, including a 15-page adventure called The Fall of Somerset Landing.\nIt is the late 22nd century. Humanity has travelled some 50 light years from Earth, but has not yet encountered any intelligent alien civilizations. Colonies \u2014 usually financed by the massive Chen Zua Corporation\u2014litter known space, mining, terraforming, and researching, as humanity slowly pushes its frontiers forward. \nBack on Earth, much of the wasted space \u2014 Antarctica, the great deserts \u2014 has been terraformed and the planet is crowded; resources are running low, a situation which is driving the push out into the galaxy.\nThis book is divided into three sections:\nThe setting. The first 24 pages of the book describes the overall setting, its main features, player races (Human Norms, Belters, Jovians, Clones, and Synthetics) and careers, and a brief overview of the section of the galaxy that humanity has explored. You can use this section to run your own adventures and campaigns in this setting.\nThe colony. The next 8 pages of the book describes a sample colony, Somerset Landing, some 12 parsecs from Earth. You can run adventures of your own on Somerset Landing, or you can use the adventure in the third part of this book.\nThe adventure. In the third 15-page section of this book, you\u2019ll find an adventure called The Fall of Somerset Landing, a dark horror adventure in which alien xenomorphs invade the colony...\nPregenerated characters. Plus a 10-page appendix containing a selection of pregenerated characters. Because in Xenomorphs, you might not make it out alive...\nXenomorphs is a gritty, dark, survival horror setting. Known space is largely dominated by a self-serving corporation, and the setting primarily features blue-collar workers or marines. The game should feel claustrophobic; colonies are dark, cold, and hammered with rain. Death is around every corner, whether by an engineering accident or by something else...\n\"Some clever comedian actually put up a sheet metal sign with \u201cWelcome To Somerset Landing\u201d on it in front of the main entrance years ago. Whoever was Commander-in-Chief at the time decided to leave it up and it\u2019s remained in place ever since\u2026 although occasionally we have to put it back up due to a really bad storm.\nSomerset isn\u2019t so bad though. There\u2019s loads to do here beyond all the work\u2026 you\u2019ve got Clancy\u2019s bar and bowling alley, Dymond\u2019s casino, a fully equipped gym, sauna, steam room and pools, entertainment center for those who want a communal movie, lovely green parks and a luxury 18-hole golf course! Oh, alright, some of that isn\u2019t true. The \u2018lovely green parks\u2019 is actually the small public area in the Food Factory and the only golf you\u2019ll be getting round here is either on the VR sets or Ramos\u2019 office golf putting set when the Chief\u2019s not around.\nLife here is tough, gruelling and sometimes dangerous, but we know how to have fun and keep everyone\u2019s spirits up. We might have originated from all over Earth but we\u2019re a community now, surviving and, one day, thriving on this little piece of rock. We\u2019ve not been blown away yet in any case.\"\nCharacters in this setting do not tend to be combat experts. More frequently, they are blue-collar workers, miners, traders, scientists, pilots, and so on. The genre of Xenomorphs is survival horror, and along with that character deaths should be expected. Even a lone xenomorph has the ability to wipe out an unprepared group of characters.\nIn the book you will find 10 pregenerated characters. Why 10? Because the genre of Xenomorphs is survival horror, and there's a good chance your first character might not make it!\nYou can download a PDF of the pregenerated characters right now for free!\nAsha Rosales, an erudite Belter engineer who loves robots. \nButler, a brilliant Synthetic scientist who reads old literature. \nCarl Garner, a tough-as-nails Belter space jockey who loves to travel.\nCarrie Goldstein, an obnoxious Human pilot who resents authority. \nDanny Garvin, a spendthrift Jovian drifter who escaped organised crime. \nGayle Knight, an athletic Clone marine who enjoys sports. \nJason Milic, a clumsy Human gambler who always plays the odds. \nMargarita Orellana, an inspiring Human priest who enjoys singing. \nSebastian Vale, a brilliant Human medic who always tries to help. \nVadim Andreev, a young, rugged Human explosives expert who dreams of space.\nThe Fall of Somerset Landing chronicles the discovery of a new abundant mineral deposit which will make the colony rich and the subsequent discovery of an alien ship that will change everything, becoming a catalyst for the events which plunge the colony into a state of disarray, and lead to an eventual loss of contact.\nThis 300-page hardcover core rulebook details the N.E.W. roleplaying game system, a mid-crunch flexible toolkit designed to run a variety of science fiction genres. This core rulebook will allow you to run any kind of science-fiction fiction game; it is presented here with a special Xeno Edition cover to accompany the Xenomorphs: The Fall of Somerset Landing setting/adventure.\nThis is v1.2 of the N.E.W. core rulebook, and comes fully errataed. Note that if you already have the N.E.W. core rules, you only need the Xenomorphs softcover (above).\nWOIN (which stands for \"What's OLD is NEW\") is a mid-crunch roleplaying game system. It powers N.E.W., the science-fiction roleplaying game, which was released in 2016 and contains rules for playing and running games in a wide variety of sci-fi settings, from hard science fiction though to heroic science fantasy. With this book you will be able to travel the final frontier, explore galaxies far, far away, or hunt alien creatures on dismal, distant worlds.\nWOIN features rich life-path character creation, a d6 dice pool, and innovative features such as its suspense-building \"countdown\" mechanic.\nYou can find out more about WOIN over at the official website, and you can download this free 23-page preview.\nDownload this free 23-page preview of N.E.W.\n  Xenomorphs: The Fall of Somerset Landing is a setting/adventure designed to accompany the core rulebook. Both are included in this Kickstarter so that you have a full standalone package for running adventures in the Xenomorph universe (and tools for running adventures in any other sci-fi universe of your choosing).\nThe books are all ready to ship, and we'll be sending them out as soon as the Kickstarter ends. To be a little clearer, that means this timeline:\nKickstarter ends.\nKickstarter collects your pledges (about a week).\nPDF versions of the books get posted for you to download.\nWe send out backer surveys to get your shipping addresses (we'll give you a couple of weeks).\nWe then ship your books to you (shipping time varies by location).\nYou may receive your two books separately or in one package.\nPlease do respond quickly to the shipping surveys when they go out after the Kickstarter ends. We plan to send the books out straight away, but we can't do that without your mailing address!\nWhen you select your reward, please choose your shipping costs. We do not have any control over the cost of shipping to your country, and we know that to some countries it is much higher than others. We hate that too!\nYour books won't actually be shipped in this Chen Zua Mk 3 Tractor. We'll use more traditional methods like USPS.\n  As with our previous 5th Edition Kickstarter, and our general Kickstarter policy, this one does not have any stretch goals. We do this for a reason: we intend to fulfil the rewards immediately. We won't be complicating things or delaying things with piles of additional stretch goals -- what you see is what you get. Nice and simple. This way we can provide the rewards straight away, with no delays (and we're not distracted from doing that by a list of stretch goals from the previous Kickstarter!)\nHowever, if you're new to WOIN, we do have some sci-fi ADD-ONS you can include in your pledge to bring you up to date with the product line! Many of these are straight from the pages of EONS, the official WOIN magazine. We're offering these as bonus items, and the easy way to grab them is to select either the MEGA PRINT + PDF STARTER BUNDLE or the MEGA PRINT STARTER BUNDLE pledge level. These items are all suited for general sc-fi settings, rather than being limited to the Xenomorphs setting only. \nLike the core set, these are not stretch goals - they are already done. You'll get them straight away!\nUniversal Upgrades ($9.99). This essential manual for sci-fi themed What's OLD is NEW games introduces a range of new alien races, universal exploits, and advanced rules for your WOIN game. 11 new races, nearly 30 new universal exploits, and expanded rules for aging, making the most of your REPUTATION score, and more, make this an essential handbook. Note that this book includes the human variants (Belters, Jovians, Clones) found in Xenomorphs.\nStarship Construction Manual ($12.99). The Starship Construction Manual enables you to design, build, and customize starships for use with the What\u2019s O.L.D. is N.E.W. roleplaying game. Hundreds of components, from FTL engines to control computers, torpedo bays to particle beams, hangars to deflector shields, all combine to create vessels from the smallest yachts to the greatest battleships!\nDeath on Ascalaon ($-). Set a century before Xenomorphs, this adventure features the Chen Zua Corporation. Sent to investigate an accident on a distant space station, the PCs soon become embroiled in a saboteur's plot and illegal human experiments using ancient alien DNA. Can they stop the saboteur before he destroys the station, and uncover the mystery of the Proteans? \nThe Nereid Trilogy ($7.99). This book contains information about the Nereid Sector's 23 star systems, along with three thrilling adventures which form a single trilogy. The PCs will do battle with Ogron Slavers, make first contact with a new alien species, explore an abandoned medical freighter, and infiltrate the mysterious Harvester Moon!\nThe Moons of Boria ($9.99). This fascinating book delves into Borian physiology, culture, technology, and more. Discover more about Borian names and language, diet, and law. Find the answers to everything you ever wanted to know about this diminutive species. This book includes 11 new Borian exploits, a new Borian origin, 3 new Borian careers, a selection of Borian equipment, 3 Borian starships and dozens of new Borian starship components, and 4 common Borian NPCs. \nPremum Non Nocere ($6.99). This sci-fi adventure from writer Jason Watson deals with an abandoned medical freighter and its missing crew. What happened aboard the ship, and can the PCs locate and rescue the crew? Including full colour maps, and a tough new monster (the Kremlin Beast), this adventure is designed for advanced characters of grades 10+. Illustrated by Meshon Cantrill, Indi Martin, Phil Stone, and Egil Thompson.\nAgainst the War Mind ($6.99). This adventure by Mark Kernow puts the PCs on the trail of a renegade AI and a sinister corporation. Will they manage to stop the War Mind before it enacts its deadly plan of revenge? Illustrated by Phil Stone, Sade, and Egil Thompson. Cartography by Michael McCarthy.\nTrailblazer 9 Heavy ($6.99). The Trailblazer Heavy vessels are over a hundred years old and were designed to cut routes through the nightmarish hazards that fill the space of the Cauldron. When TB9H becomes a runaway train headed straight for the planet of Diana, can the PCs figure out what is going on and stop the ship before distaster strikes? By Alasdair Stuart; art by Sade, Ellis Goodson, and Indi Martin.\nThese are the bonus PDFs in the Print + PDF Mega Bundle\n SaveSaveSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run a few Kickstarters now, focusing on providing products quicker and faster with each one.

No matter who you are... \nRPG DESIGN CAMP is here for you! \nThis time we are taking an older adventure, the Silver Box, and letting you adapt, change and add to it to make it awesome! \nIn the Silver Box a thrilling encounter with highwaymen uncovers a missing artifact that hurls the PCs into an amazing adventure. The chase leads them on a woodland pursuit into a cave complex where the mystery only increases with the discovery of a pile of dead highwaymen. Who killed the thieves? And where is the Silver Box? From there the PCs follow clues to a nearby city and a series of thrilling urban encounters. Finally, in the conclusion, the heroes face off against the real thieves of the Silver Box in a dramatic shipboard battle in the city harbor. \nOr does it? Your decisions can and probably will alter the adventure toward new directions. \nPerhaps the whole adventure will take place in the cave complex\nPerhaps the city will turn out to be under siege by a vampire hoard\nPerhaps the conclusion will be atop a floating tower rather than a ship? \nThe options are limitless and the deciding factor is you! Don\u2019t just run the adventure be part of the design process and choose the adventure! \nWhat is Design Camp?\nDesign Camp is a collaborative experience where game designers and interested individuals share the process of RPG content creation-- sometimes that means writing a supplement, or an adventure, or setting material, or, like this project, converting a manuscript from one game system to another.\nThe adventure we're planning to convert is The Silver Box, formerly placed in the Iron Kingdoms setting, and covering a number of urban and wilderness locations with a variety of NPCs. We'll discuss it more in updates.\nHow does Design Camp work?\nWe interact with backers through a Basecamp site on the internet (basecamp.com), using that site's infrastructure to chat, email, host files and communicate. We also post here on Kickstarter to provide redundant communication for the project. \nYou'll have a chance to pitch your own design elements during the process, and vote on submitted elements. If your element wins, you can work with designers to implement it, if you want, or you can leave it to us to make those proverbial donuts.\n\nWe work hard to make sure our process is fairly transparent and responsive to backers and their questions. In the end, we want you to understand and feel comfortable with the process of RPG design.\nOur philosophy?\nYou can do this. We know, because we got our start sitting where you're sitting, and ten years later, we're still designing, publishing, and winning awards. RPGs are for everyone. Designing them can be, too. Hold my dice, I got this. ;)\nFirst, we get together.\nThe brainstorming and discussion portions can be very active, as backers all add their thoughts and ideas to the start of a project. But they're just the beginning. We want you to ride this out to the end, and that means participating as we continue...\nThen, we plan out some stuff...\nOnce the outline is created, the base idea is decided, we start pitching specific ideas-- \"What about a cult? How should we present this material? What do we need to make this as useful as possible at the table? Do you need more detail? Less detail? Some weird details?\" This process is also pretty intense, and a lot of fun. Learning how to pitch and formulate ideas can be very rewarding.\nThen we light the fire and get to work!\nOur roots...\nWe all met and began working together as patrons of Kobold Press' Open Design projects, way back in 2007 and the Empire of the Ghouls. It's been gangbusters ever since, closing down Indianapolis bars and burning down orc encampments while cracking open planar portals to Yggdrasil.\n\nWe've written for Ars Magica, Pathfinder, and Dungeons & Dragons from Third Edition all the way to Fifth. We're familiar with a wide variety of systems and games.\nPledges....\nSo what are the levels you can choose to support? I'm glad you asked...\n  We appreciate everyone's support!\nYour name in glorious, glorious text. Well, maybe just one \"glorious.\"\nNow that's a smart move.\nThese are the goods-- maybe you don't have the time for all that interaction, but you want the final result. This is how you make that happen.\nIf you've got the time, taking a 20 is always the safest bet!\nYou like your games and your options. This is how you can compare the adventure in two systems while crushing the bad guys and looting their stuff.\nThis is the full experience.\nJoin us at basecamp, participate in the experience and get a PDF! This is the primary option, and we're going to work hard to make sure you get your money's worth.\nCohorts; letting GMs play the game since 1974!\nYou want to leave a little bit more of a mark on the project and this is how you're going to do it. At this level, you'll work with us to revise an NPC in the adventure to meet your descriptions. Or you can bring us your iconic player character and we'll include it as a pregen! This can be as hands-on intensive as you want, from saying \"I want a human fighter,\" to having a whole backstory to help us craft the details.\nSo, you want to call the shots?\nChallenge us! We're professionals! We can take it! At this level, you can challenge the designers with your encounter design idea. Bring us your combination of elements such as monster, terrain, location type...etc. and we will make it work! Conversely, you can throw in your idea as one of the Pitch Rounds to challenge all of the backers!\nLet's take a peek behind the screen, shall we?\nWe're always happy to lend our thoughts and considerations about a personal project, or to run an online game for you, and at this level, you'll get that benefit along with your Design Camp experience.\nWhat happens if the community is super generous and we get the opportunity to work with a bunch of you?

Well, one of us could get hit by the milk truck. Unlikely, but possible. Space debris could impact us. Again, might happen. With three of us working on this conversion, it should be able to handle events even as catastrophic as either of these. This manuscript is written and prepared for conversion. As long as one of us survives, you'll get your adventure, it just might take us a little longer.

WOOHOO!\n\nIt's hard to find the words to describe just how overjoyed and excited we are to have the support of our amazing community. Thousands of Pathfinders from around the globe have come together to make this game a reality, and we are eternally grateful to you all! What better way to celebrate than to reveal our next stretch goal?\n\nOur heartfelt thanks for believing in us go out to each and every one of you!\n New stretch goal - New playable race\nUpdate #31: Archetypes are funded! Moving on to Goblin companion!  \nWOW! It took just a little more than one day to fund the Archetypes! You are absolutely incredible!...

Read more\nWhether you\u2019re new to the Pathfinder\u00ae universe or you\u2019re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker\u00ae is the CRPG you\u2019ve been waiting for. \nHere at Owlcat Games, we love and are inspired by classic isometric computer RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Arcanum. Our dream is to rekindle the thrill of playing those games for the first time. Building your hero, exploring the unknown, getting to know your companions, experiencing the adrenaline rush of your first battle (and your last), delving into mysterious dungeons, and\u2014most importantly\u2014seeing your protagonist and your world change through your actions.\nWe've always been big fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\u00ae from Paizo, Inc\u00ae, so we thought: How cool would it be to do this in the beloved Pathfinder setting? Paizo agreed, and with your support, we hope to bring a brand-new fantasy saga to life.\nWhat the press says\n\"If the alpha build was any indication, then there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to shape your own identity and leave your mark on the world.\" - Gamespot\n\"Almost everything I asked about in terms of story seemed to have a layer beyond what I expected--the advantage of having years of tabletop playtesting, perhaps. If these different aspects of Kingmaker can coalesce into a dramatic whole, this could be special.\" - IGN\n\"For fans of the tabletop game, this will be a great opportunity to translate their fantasy adventures to their desktops.\" - Game Informer\n\"First impressions from in and around the bandit lord's fortress; the game looks incredible. The in-progress menus are attractive and orderly, the environments lush and vivid, the character portraits appealing and refined. What voice acting there was, was convincing and professional.\" - mmorpg.com\nThe Game World \nPathfinder: Kingmaker is the first single-player computer RPG based on the acclaimed Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The game invites players to Golarion, a world rich with history, mystery, and conflict, and gives players the chance to claim part of this world as their own.\n\"Follow the white rabbit, Baron\"\nPathfinder has considerable depth, not only in its lore, but also in its game mechanics, and in the freedom it offers you to develop your own unique character. You can customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.\nUse night to your advantage \u2013 and see the world change.\nThe Story\nIn the north lies the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark\u2014by building your own kingdom! To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.\nThe only easy day was yesterday.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo\u2019s award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don\u2019t need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love. Either way, you will experience a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won\u2019t be adventuring alone. Pathfinder: Kingmaker features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\nMore than 10 companions to watch your back\u2026 or stick a knife in it.\nYour Kingdom \nWe chose to adapt the Kingmaker adventure path because it features a host of open-world mechanics, allowing players to experience the story at their own pace as they explore the Stolen Lands, which will challenge you as both an adventurer and a ruler.\nYou never know what's around the next bend.\nMost importantly, the game allows you to claim these lands as your own, letting you carve your own kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and the ability to lead troops in the field are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins\u2014and while dealing with politics in your own court.\nThere are many ways to manage your Kingdom, and many rewards to be gained.\n As you\u2019ll discover, building a kingdom goes beyond simply building a stronghold: Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.\nIf you fail, your kingdom will be destroyed, but if you succeed, you\u2019ll have made a nation where countless others have failed.  \nYour kingdom awaits! Do you have the strength to rule it?\n\nAre you a benevolent ruler or a ruthless tyrant?\n Expanding depth and richness of kingdom gameplay is so important to us that we\u2019ve made it our initial goal for the Kickstarter. Every pledge made toward our initial funding target will result in more features, more content, and more polish for your growing nation. Our goal is to let you build a kingdom that fits your play style. Perhaps you want to control every single activity in your kingdom by yourself, or perhaps you are more of a top-level ruler who wants to spend time exploring the wilderness and fighting dangerous beasts. Either way, we will give you the life you want to live. You are a king, after all!\nWe are excited about the kingdom mechanics and we have carefully planned all the features we would love to implement if you support us. All funds will be distributed according to the following pie chart:\nExpanding the kingdom is our first goal for the Kickstarter, but it\u2019s not going to be our only goal. With your support, we can improve every aspect of game. We\u2019re prepared to announce additional stretch goals to diversify the characters you\u2019ll be able to build, including the introduction of archetypes (at least a couple for each of the classes), additional classes (we have been asked about Magus several times\u2014and some Owlcats really want to play this class!), and additional races. We also want to develop the storyline further, expanding it beyond the Adventure Path, and we would like to include even more companions, each with their own alignment and agenda (including a companion that\u2019s dear to hearts of Pathfinder fans). We also want to bring you even more locations to visit, including an epic dungeon. We want to enhance our game with more voiceover and music. And we want more players to experience our game by adding additional language localizations, and support for OS X and Linux!\nWe don't just want to reward your support through stretch goals alone.

Dining on those meals will provide your party with different small and pleasant bonuses.\nOwlcat Games was formed by developers who have the experience, resources, and - above all - the passion required to make Pathfinder: Kingmaker a truly amazing game.\n We are a new studio, but we are not new to the industry. Many of us worked on these games as part of Nival Interactive and My.com:\nWe can't deny ourselves the pleasure to name just a few games Chris Avellone worked on:\nOwlcat Games team.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker has an existing schedule, an existing scope, and an existing budget, and that budget will allow us to achieve that scope on schedule. We already have a full team of people working on it, and we're committed to doing it regardless of what happens with this Kickstarter. So why are we asking for your help? The answer is YOU\u2014we need YOU to decide how big Pathfinder: Kingmaker is going to be. Success in this Kickstarter will allow us to increase the budget and the scope, delivering a bigger and deeper game on the same schedule.  \nAll of us\u2014RPG fans and developers alike\u2014deserve a game that demonstrates the richness of the Pathfinder universe. There are so many interesting things in the world and in the rules that we can\u2019t fit into the current budget, yet our desire to add them to the game is practically unbearable. We dream of more companions with added depths to their stories, new classes, new dungeons, more wilderness to explore, more kingdom events, and even brand-new quests and custom content by famous Pathfinder and CRPG authors. With this Kickstarter, our only limit is your support and your faith in us. Help us make Pathfinder: Kingmaker the product we all want it to be.

Until recently this could only be a dream!

Oh well, all your dreams can't come true, right?\nWrong. When the issue of porting the game to consoles came up, we realized pretty fast that something had to be done about combat. Micromanaging the party in combat, particularly important at high complexity levels, is extremely difficult when you have a gamepad instead of a mouse and a keyboard. Of course, we could try to improve the artificial intelligence of the player's characters and make it customizable, but this didn't seem a good solution: we'd play AI programming, not Pathfinder."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "Beta Test for Pathfinder: Kingmaker Update 2.1 is now Live!", "update_content": "Pathfinders,\nIt is less than a month until the release of Pathfinder: Kingmaker Definitive Edition for PC and consoles.

Cooking gave us bigger brains and the free time to tinker and socialize.\nIf not for cooking, we wouldn't gather around tables to roll dice, laugh, make stories together, and bicker about attacks of opportunity. So I think we owe it to cooking to make it an integral part of Pathfinder and something that anyone from Grog'Huk the Barbarian and Abracadabra the Wizard can do.\nIn fact, all that is required to utilize the Culinary Magic subsystem is 1 feat and an investment in the Craft (culinary) skill, so you can start making Manticore Chili at level 1.

What better way to enhance your RP than to share with your gaming group the same Breakfast Pizza that your character makes!\nLayout Sample\nWhat are print vouchers?\nWhen the book is finished, eligible backers will receive a link to a Print-on-Demand copy. There, you can pay DriveThruRPG ~$5 + shipping, and they will print and ship the color softcover book to you.\nWhy do print vouchers? \nThey reduce the risk involved and eliminate funding complications from stretch goals and the Head Chef reward. Too many Kickstarter projects collapse from the costs of over-funding. With print vouchers, we can add stretch goals without the fear of increasing printing costs.\nAdd-ons\nIncrease your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on.

Each is a full class, along with archetypes; plus the collection includes a selection of supporting feats, spells, items, backgrounds, and monsters to help make the most from them.

Shields, Phil Stone, Egil Thompson, Jen Tracy, and Shannon White.\nIn these pages you'll find:\nThe Alchemist: Scientific Sorcery. The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new Advanced Studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\nThe Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three archetypes: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters.\nThe Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two Dark Paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more!\nThe Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: beasts, plants, or entropy.\nThe Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three Essences\u2014the Doppleganger, the Primordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire.\nThe Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\nThe Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: abomination, vampire, or werecreature! Delve into the dark and secret creatures of the night, cursed to exist as monstrous beings shunned by the world.\n     But That's Not All! Want 45 New Sub-Classes?\nThat's not all by a long shot! We know that folks love new classes, but they also love new subclasses for their existing favorites. And so, for those for whom 7 new classes just isn't enough, we have a bonus reward tier called THE FULL MONTY which gets you an enormous pile of 45 subclasses contained within a collection of 19 fully-illustrated mini-supplements in PDF format. Just look at them below!

This article explores three new Druid Circles to help bring variety to your game table. Explore the Circle of Birds and Beasts, the Circle of the Elements, and the Circle of Life. By Mark Kernow, and illustrated by Deanna Roberds.\nVolumes of Forgotten Lore: Arcane. From veteran author Ari Marmell (Drow of the Underdark, Tome of Magic, The Goblin Corps, Thief's Covenant) comes this look at new player options for the bard, sorcerer, and wizard. The Bardic College of Names, the Dread sorcerous origin, and the Shadowcaller tradition for the wizard make up this first chapter of forgotten lore.\nThe Art of Peace. In a world of violence and vicious magic, monks of the Shifting Flow and the Watchful Gate audaciously dream of peace. The Art of Peace introduces two new monastic traditions, the all-new Envoy background, and 8 maneuvers for monks who value their karma. By Josh Gentry.\nA Paladin's Dark Vows. Not all paladins are good; some may stray from the true path, while others are pure evil. Josh Gentry presents new flaws and class features for dark paladins. When a paladin turns from the light, flaws of aggression, blind loyalty, and na\u00efvet\u00e9 provide corruptions of the virtues of bravery, loyalty, and wisdom. Additionally, paladins may take oaths of the Purge or Supremacy, or use the new Bloody Hands class feature. Illustrated by Scott Harshbringer.\nVolumes of Forgotten Lore: Divine. In the second of his Forgotten Lore series, veteran author Ari Marmell brings you new divine player options. The Protection, Shadow, and Travel domains, the Urban druidic circle, and the Theologian, a new tradition for the wizard. Illustrated by Jeshields.\nMasters of the Wild.

Kiel Chenier brings us Spirit, a Clerical Domain; Courage, a Paladin's Oath; and the Witch Hunter, a Roguish Archetype. Arm yourselves, because this is gonna be spooky! Illustrated by Ellis Goodson.\nHeroes of the Night. We continue with a selection of horrific new archetypes for barbarians, fighters, and warlocks! Barbarian lycanthropes can master the Wolfsblood path; The Haunted are fighters with spectral companions; and The Evil Eye is a pact for warlocks. By Brandes Stoddard; illustrated by Dan Nokes.\nHeroes of the Blade. An assortment of character options for those who wield the blade! Three alternate class kits, a new Druidic Circle, two new fighting styles, two new maneuvers, and a brand new feat! Discover the battlemage, commander, and scout, and learn how to perform a hamstringing cut or form a phalanx! By John Lynch; illustrated by Egil Thompson and Phil Stone.\nFriends Close, Enemies Closer.  Josh Gentry asks you to sell your soul! Three new warlock patrons include The Sea Lord, The Seducer, and The Trickster, along with six new Invocations. These three patrons represent such legendary beings as Davy Jones, the Leviathan, Dracula, Pan, Loki, or even Rumpelstiltskin. Illustrated by Egil Thompson.\nExplorers of the Multiverse. Meet the Planar Explorer and the Way of Infinite Worlds, two brand new archetypes for adventurers who seek to cross the boundaries between worlds. Whether your preferred destination is the Inner or Outer Planes, a lesser-known demiplane, or somewhere even more unusual, these character options are perfect for those who want just little more than the Prime Material can offer. By Anthony Jennings; illustrated by Ellis Goodson.\nSpeaking With Fists. It's not only monks who fight with their fists - these subclasses for the barbarian, fighter, rogue (and, yes, one for the monk) bring out the pugilist in a variety of classes! The barbarian's fists are as strong as tempered steel with the Path of the Lodestar; the fighter masters the art of the heavyweight boxer as the Pugilist; the monk combines arcane magic and unarmed combat in the Way of the Arcane Fist; and the rogue moves at blinding speed as the Speedster. With new weapon properties, the new Fisticuffs fighting style, and two new spells, designer Josh Gentry will have your characters brawling in the taverns! Illustrated by Jacob Blackmon.\nFell Grafts: Demons & Devils. Have you ever wanted an abyssal hide, balor wings, a devil's arm, a wretch's belch, an imp's eye, infernal horns, or vrock feathers? Of course you have! Or at least, your 5E character has. Right? Designer Mike Myler brings you rules for infernal bodily alterations for those willing to make a deal with a devil! Illustrated by Cat Lu.\nPriests of Misfortune. Fate and luck are double-edged swords. Deities from ancient cultures - the Aztecs, Egyptians, Greeks, and Welsh - were rightfully wary of the gods of misfortune. This article from Dan Head introduces the god of ill-fortune, Jinx, one of the triumvirate which also includes Fate and Fortuna. Also described is the misfortunate domain, information on clerics of Jinx, and new magic items such as the No-Headed Coin. Illustrated by Sade.\nPriests of Elemental Power. Let your clerics embrace the elements and add some new domains to your 5E game - the flame domain, stone domain, water domain, and winter domain. Experience the Flame Cleric's Avatar of Flames, see how Reverent Stones part before your Stone Cleric, and be awestruck by the Water Cleric's Roar of the Waves! By C. Richard Davies; illustrated by Sade.\nCelestial Grafts: Angels & Avatars. Celestial Experiment Feats allow your character to exhibit aspects and abilities of angels and avatars, from Deva Wings to a Unicorn Horn to a Solar Gaze. Plus with the new Oath of the Angelic Avatar, paladins can accept the physical blessings of the divine in ways which manifest in glorious physical changes! By Mike Myler; illustrated by Rick Hershey.\nMagic in the Blood. Writer Anthony Jennings presents three new fey-themed archetypes - the druid's Circle of the Untamed Wilderness, the fighter's Unseelie Knight, and the sorcerer's Fey Blooded bloodline. Illustrated by Egil Thompson.\nThe Charity of St. Nicholas. The holiday season is all about charity, and Jeremy McCoy accordingly presents the new Charity domain for clerics, along with information on St. Nicholas and other saints in your campaign. Illustrated by Ellis Goodson.\nThe Ways of Dream and Nightmare. The cleric's Dream Domain grants revelations and forges nightmares into weapons; the sorcerer's Transcendant Soul origin uses the power of dream to slip across planar boundaries; and the wizard's School of Nightmares uses necromancy and illusion to spread fear. Also here, you'll find 7 new eldritch invocations for warlocks, such as Nightmare Mask, Ominous Dreams, and Word of Doom.

Heroes and villains from Arthurian myth have been reincarnated, coming back to life in the cinematic present. At first, these individuals don\u2019t remember their former lives, but as they begin to recognize each other, old feuds and tragic affairs resurface. Why has the King returned now?  Does some unseen danger threaten? And if the answer is yes, will these legendary heroes be able to put their old grievances aside long enough to oppose it?\nYou can check out an Actual Play of Arthur Lives for Fate Core here.\nThe 1st edition of the game was published in 2009 by Vigilance Press and used the True20 system. This new 2nd edition is a ground-up redesign of the game, capitalizing on Fate's narrative style of play. It includes:\nCharacter creation for knights, damosels, magicians, and kings, allowing you to create modern reincarnations of (almost) every character from Arthurian myth.\nDetailed character creation advice for ten specific Arthurian incarnations, from the famous (Arthur, Guinevere, and Merlin) to the infamous (Balin, the Knight with Two Swords, or Nimue).\nEnchantment, a complete magic system with 15 different magical talents, from Binding to Weather Control. \nMagical treasures and \"echoes\" of Arthurian objects like the Sword in the Stone and Excalibur, Gawaine's legendary horse Gringolet, or even Camelot itself.\nA large bestiary of dozens of fantasy creatures from across the Faerie Veil, supernatural denizens of our world, rival incarnations, mundane threats, and even angels and demons, all to challenge your characters. \nDetailed GM advice for running Arthur Lives! campaigns, including the secret history that explains why all this is happening now. (Hint: it's got to do with Nazis, John Dee, and William Ashbless.)\nJason Tondro, aka Doctor Comics, is the author of The Deluxe Super Villain Handbook and The Great Game for Fainting Goat, a contributor to Stark City, and the author of the True20 edition of Arthur Lives! He has a PhD in Literature from the University of California Riverside, and is the author of Superheroes of the Round Table: Comics Connections to Medieval and Renaissance Literature, where he got to write about Mage and Camelot 3000, among many other things. Jason is the writer of AL! 2nd edition. He gets to teach Arthurian lit and comics every year, and is basically the luckiest guy in the world.\n  PLAY\n\nMichael Kucharski is a classically trained artist and fan favorite whose gaming work includes the Amber Diceless RPG and its spiritual successor Lords of Gossamer and Shadow, and much work for Palladium over the years. Michael's work will introduce each chapter of Arthur Lives! \nDan Smith describes himself as \"the former 90s art nuisance.\" He illustrated In Nomine for Steve Jackson Games, along with many books in the GURPS line. Dan is bringing his bold, energetic style to the Arthur Lives! adversaries chapter. \nJon Gibbons is the artist and co-creator of Extreme Earth, a dystopian superhero setting, and The After, a post-apocalyptic western. Jon will be illustrating several of the Paths and sample incarnations.\nDionysia Jones is the lead artist on Tianxia, published by Vigilance Press. She provided the cover to Arthur Lives! and contributed character designs for several of the incarnations featured in the book. \nOne of our stretch goals is an adventure anthology written by the best minds in the business. Here they are!\nRichard Bellingham is a long-time Fate author and a contributor to many Fate projects; he created The Secrets of Cats and the SF/fantasy epic Knights of Invasion, in which a feudal fantasy world is invaded by high-tech aliens. \nChuck Rice is the creator of AZ: After Zombies and the author of many, many RPG products, including Blood & Fists for d20 and its sequels. He demonstrated his Arthurian chops with Legends of Excalibur, a d20 adaptation of Arthurian myth. \nWalt Robillard is a prodigious podcaster and the brains behind SUPERS!, the Comic Book RPG. He has written adventures for many game systems, including ICONS, White Star, and Savage Worlds.\nRob Wieland is another established Fate creator, and is the author of another Arthurian Fate game: Camelot Trigger. He's also written Save Game and Kaiju Incorporated: the RPG, and contributed to many other projects.\n  The book is written, and is almost 150,000 words. The basic funding goal for this Kickstarter is to pay for layout and writing, and get the book out there to you, the fans and players. If you back the book at $5 or more, you'll get the raw text for Arthur Lives! 2nd Edition immediately, and you can start playing it right away.\nOur first stretch goals add art from Michael Kucharski and Dan Smith, bringing the book to about 250 pages. \nAt $10,250, Jason will write Drakes on a Plane, an introductory adventure designed to bring a group of PCs together and awaken some of them to their true nature as incarnations of Arthurian myth. \nA couple of the stretch goals add play aides: a custom character sheet for Fate Core and AL!, and a handout that illustrates the complicated relationships between the major characters. \nAt $13,000, the folks at Norse Foundry will produce a set of official Fate dice for Arthur Lives! These are handsome metal dice in Arthur's colors: antique gold, with red + and - signs.\nAt $19,000, we unlock the Special Edition, a highest-quality \"Director's Cut\" of Arthur Lives! which will include handwritten notes from the author on every page, as well as all kinds of other goodies like concept art and other stretch goals. \nOur adventure anthology authors join the Round Table at $24,500: Richard Bellingham, Rob Wieland, Chuck Rice, and Walt Robillard, and Jason will write a second adventure to add to that anthology. \nOur final goal is a fiction anthology of tales of modern knights, magicians and damsels exploiting the world of Arthur Lives! \n  Every backer who contributes $5 or more gets the raw text for Arthur Lives! 2nd Edition, and can start playing right away. No waiting! \nYour further support for the project gets you the PDF ($20) or hardback edition +  PDF edition ($50) of Arthur Lives! 2nd Edition. Books are being printed on demand through DriveThruRPG, and you will pay their shipping costs when you redeem your reward.\nAs stretch goals unlock, we'll be able to offer PDFs and paperback editions of Drakes on a Plane, the adventure anthology, and other goodies. \nWe have some exciting and limited reward tiers for fans of our amazing artists -- Michael Kucharski and Dan Smith -- and for those who would like to have some input on the game itself. \nAt $150 and $200 you can get one of the few remaining signed & numbered prints of Michael's Excalibur and Arthur of the Britons. At $250, Dan will draw your character. And at $450, you can tell Jason which Arthurian character he needs to add to the book with special rules and roleplaying advice -- and we'll illustrate that character according to your description. \nExcalibur by Michael Kucharski\n  Arthur of the Britains by Michael Kucharski\nAll of these special reward tiers include everything at the $50 level, so you're also getting the hardback edition, a PDF edition, and PDFs of any stretch goals we reach. \nWhile every tier has been carefully constructed to maximize what we can offer, sometimes there is that odd bit of kit you absolutely must add to your pledge.  As the campaign rolls on, we hope to unlock more of these to offer to you.\nAdditional PDF -  $20 USD: Need an additional digital copy of the completed book for some one at the table?  Add this to your pledge.\nAdditional Printed Copy - $50 USD: Sometimes you want an extra copy of the book at the table or to send as a gift. Add this to your pledge for an additional printed copy (You pay the shipping).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou don't need to worry about the book going unfinished. It's already written. Even a $5 pledge will get you a copy of this raw text. The artists are all pros and their illustrations are already coming in. But we want to take Arthur Lives! to the next level (a printed book) and maybe the next level after that: a special edition with enough Arthurian goodies in it to keep you questing for years.\n\nFainting Goat has a track record going back years, and has put out many RPG books, both through Kickstarter and traditional publication methods. They're the publishers of Stark City, The Great Game, Improbable Tales, and the Deluxe Super Villain Handbook.\n\nHAZARD Studios is running the Kickstarter, and they have a long history of success. In particular, they ran the Super Villain Handbook Kickstarter, which was a rousing success that hit every stretch goal we could come up with.

We'll reveal these as we go along, starting with:\nACHIEVED! 200 backers: We will create a PDF Art and Map Folio including all illustrations in this book plus keyed and unkeyed maps for Cold Mountain and Horns of the Hunted! \nACHIEVED! 225 backers: We will add brand-new bonus tournament events by the awesome and talented Mike D. Welham! \nACHIEVED! 250 backers: All backers at every level get a high-resolution file of our stunning cover artwork by Michal Matczak! \nACHIEVED! 275 backers: We will add a trio of terrifying dark faerie feats by Clinton J. Boomer!   \nACHIEVED! 300 backers: We will begin creating HeroLab files for the book (for the Pathfinder version). You can preorder them as part of the Kickstarter campaign, with estimated completion in Autumn 2017. \nACHIEVED! 325 backers: We will add bonus forest and river magic items from GM Solspiral! \nACHIEVED! 350 backers: PAWNS! We will create a full set of stand-up character and creature pawns using the artwork from the book as an add-on pledge (with shipping included)! Each pawn is durable plastic and comes with a set of 8 reusable bases, and over 60 pawns, including small, medium, and large creatures! \nA set of over 60 pawns!\nACHIEVED! - 375 backers: We will add a set of Lewis Carroll-inspired fairy tale feats by Clinton J. Boomer! \nACHIEVED! - 400 backers: We will create digital pawns for Virtual Tabletops using the art from the Compendium! \nACHIEVED! - 500 backers: We will create HeroLab files for the book for 5th Edition. You can preorder them as part of the Kickstarter campaign, with estimated completion in Autumn 2017.\n Will there be HeroLab support for this book?\nWe would love to provide HeroLab support for those fans who use that software. However, because so many elements of that process are not under our control and because how long it takes is so unpredictable, we are hesitant to promise HeroLab support as part of the project. We are in communication with LoneWolf and will continue exploring it with an aim toward getting it done, but at this time we cannot guarantee that HeroLab files will be available. \nWill you be creating other Campaign Compendiums?\nYes! We looked into whether it would make sense to do a single massive project of multiple compendiums for different campaigns, but the route we chose to go was to do each one separately. That way each campaign can be focused, accessible, and most importantly ready to set up and turn around very quickly. Once each compendium Kickstarter ends, we\u2019ll finalize any bonus content and get things coming your way! We\u2019re still working on the order of which compendiums we\u2019ll do when, but rest assured that more are on the way!\nWill they be for Pathfinder or 5E? \nBoth! Our plan is to create terrific campaign sourcebooks for both systems, and in the case of the horror-themed Gothic Campaign Compendium to bring you a 5E version of this book to complement the classic Pathfinder volume.  \nWhen will you be launching those other Campaign Compendiums?\nOnce this compendium project is completed, we'll start ramping up for the next one. We are still working out the order in which we will create other compendiums, and during this project we'll give our backers a chance to vote on which ones they'd like to see next. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLegendary Games has run numerous crowdfunded projects before, completing all but one on time or early. Fulfillment of the massive Legendary Planet adventure series is still over halfway complete, with a dedicated team focused on bringing the final installments home. \n\nAll writing has been completed for the core material in the Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium, in addition to most of the stretch goals. New artwork has already been ordered, and we have a large stable of artists so that any additional artwork funded as part of stretch goals that is not already done can be completed quickly. We have completed almost all writing for both Pathfinder and 5th Edition, so there should be no delays in production waiting on contributors. \n\nDelays in printing and shipping are always possible but unlikely, as our experience with previous Kickstarters has allowed us to set up several options for getting your books to you!\n\nThe print option we use depends on the response to the project; with a lower number of print backers we'll use a domestic printer and we hope to have print books available by PaizoCon in late May. If the response is very strong, however, we may do a full print run of the books which will take longer, with delivery expected in Summer 2017.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Forester", "descp": "Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium PDF (Pathfinder or 5E)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["172 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Forest Scout", "descp": "Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium PDF (BOTH Pathfinder and 5E)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Fair Folk", "descp": "Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium hardcover plus PDF (Pathfinder or 5E)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["287 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Forest Explorer", "descp": "Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium hardcover plus PDF (BOTH Pathfinder and 5E)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Knight of the Woodland Realm", "descp": "PREMIUM hardcover plus all PDFs.

This project includes mythic versions of the feats, spells, and more from both the and the, allowing you to add dynamic and cinematic sizzle and spice to your campaigns. The mythic rules aren't just for high levels like the old epic rules for 3.5; they are a terrific toolbox for campaigns at any level, allowing you to bring out new and unexpected options for ancient treasures, rare and legendary monsters, or to expand the folkloric roots or the building blocks of your campaign.

An object, tiny at first but over the years growing into a massive black orb larger than our own sun, or any of our three moons. It brought with it catastrophe that plagued us in many forms. The first catastrophe came as a rain of fire and rock that pelted our landscape and destroyed our cities. As the object grew, it began to influence the already dangerous creatures of our world, turning them into stronger, more bloodthirsty monsters that ravaged our lands and killed our people. They say that a third catastrophe is coming. They say that the black sun in our sky signals the waking of the Void. \n And she is hungry. \n352 pages of fully colored, fully illustrated core book\n3 Archetypes, with 5 divisions each for 15 types total\n7 roles each with different strengths and weaknesses\nHundreds of options for character customization\nUnique system with 3d6 pool-style mechanic\nAlternate reality Earth style setting\n100% unique spells and spellcasting system\nIntricate and intuitive crafting system\nNatural character growth - Using skills increases them!\nUnique and epic creatures and adversaries\nSocial combat mechanic - Debate like a champion!\nUnique weapon proficiency system\nMulti-tiered leveling system - Level Your Way!\nGet a feel for the system here.\n  I am very excited to announce the newest game I have been working on called Dhovaine. It is a science fantasy game set in a modern world with hints of futurism and steam punk. The game has a comprehensive rules system based on a 3d6 mechanic that prioritizes storytelling and legendary actions. If you're a fan of unique, never-before-seen systems, dig into comic books like Wayward and Locke & Key and also enjoy settings like Warhammer 40K, Final Fantasy, Witcher 3, Malifaux and World Of Darkness then you're going to love Dhovaine. \nDhovaine is set in a possible alternate timeline to Earth. Much like Earth, civilizations have risen and fallen. Each, of them, having their own cultures, technology, faiths and traditions. Today, the people of Dhovaine possess an advanced level of technology similar to Earth's, if not a little further advanced. Even though mortals of Dhovaine live at this higher level of technology, there is still a great deal that they do not understand about the world. Technology exists from historically significant and technologically advanced cultures that modern people simply do not understand. Some of this mysterious technology is still in use today. Some of that forgone technology has been studied in order to assist in some of the most recent technological advances in weaponry, transportation and communication. Still other bits of this technology is unusable and completely foreign to the people of Dhovaine. Twisted, seemingly maleficent constructs sit completely unused in warehouses as well as old ruins, waiting to unleash heir power. This setting, called Dhovaine, is ready to provide players with all manner of story and challenge to those who would brave it. \nThe game system of Dhovaine is intended to be fast-paced and story driven, while still being involved and complex. It is intended to assist in driving the story that the group would like to create, and to help devise and design the imaginative places and events that the Fatemaster needs to describe as well as the actions and stories of the player characters as they join the Hunters and defend mortal civilizations against the legendary and dangerous monsters that inhabit the world. Everything about the system is devised with those things in mind. \n For more information, check out highergroundspublishing.com. \nThe world of Dhovaine is not Earth, even if it does share a vast number of similarities. If you placed the two planets next to each other, you might think that they were one in the same. It isn't until you look more closely that you begin to realize the differences between your world and the world of Dhovaine. \nThe first thing that one must realize when examining the world of Dhovaine is that magic has always been. It was a driving force in the creation of the world and the inhabitants that occupy it. It is just as much a force of nature as wind or water, and it helped to shape not only the inhabitants but the face of the world itself. Much like water and wind erode the surface of the Earth you know, so too does magic erode and change the face of Dhovaine. Just as evolution and natural selection determine which animals survive into the coming days, so too does magic have its hand in determining the biological fate of all living creatures of Dhovaine. Mortals have always known magic, and continually feel its presence in their lives. While not the only creatures in Dhovaine that can manipulate and shift the ebb and flow of its energies, mortals have perhaps been the most affected by its predations both directly and indirectly. \nMagic has not only directed the biological flow of the creatures living in Dhovaine, but also the intellectual pursuits of the mortals that dwell there. Civilization as mortals know it would not have been possible without the advent of the technology that stemmed from magical knowledge. It was, in fact, magic that became mortals' earliest technology, and from it all modern science and technology was born. Due to the effect that magic has had on natural and biological events and forces in the world of Dhovaine, all sorts of strange and fantastic things exist that would cause it to become unrecognizable in comparison to our own world. \nCurrent life in Dhovaine is not all that different from current life here on Earth. Electricity powers homes outfitted with lights and running water. Vehicles, aircraft and trains allow mortals to commute across long distances quickly. Artisans craft everything from jewelry and furniture to specialty bread and perfumes. Entertainment is had in the forms of home and portable technological devices and music. People read books, talk about politics and live lives much like you and I might. \nLife inside the cities is protected and relatively safe compared to life outside. Great walls hundreds of feet high and dozens thick protect the citizens of the largest cities from all but the strongest monsters. Weather prediction can give enough warning to allow citizens to find safe places when solar storms and inclimate weather systems endanger them. Life inside the cities allows shelter and safety in numbers. \nLife outside the large cities can be extremely dangerous. Still, even outside the cities, mortals tend to gather in small settlements along popular roadsides and resources. These settlements often have very little by way of defense against the elements and monsters that lurk within Dhovaine. These settlements usually thrive near resources. Some farm these areas, others mine or hunt. Settlements such as these are a hub for hunters due to the increased need for the protection they offer. Within the cities, hunters are often seen as rabble. An unneeded relic of a bygone era. Those outside the cities, however, know that they are a much-needed line of defense against creatures much higher on the food chain than themselves. \n But wait!

Before: The system started out as a 3d6 base system that used 3d6 as a base pool. You can add dice to the 3d6 (making it 4d6, 6d6 or even 12d6 or more) using your skills and abilities. You can even inflict penalties against yourself and others in order to hinder opponents or gain certain other bonuses. These additions were limited between resting times, so you would need to rest in order to be at your \"full strength\" for actions. You were always at a 3d6 base unless you were affected by injuries or other penalties. Once rested, your dice pool refills and you can once again add dice to your \"base pool\". The problems arose when I placed that dice roll against a single target number. That target number determines the difficulty of an action. The problem arose because, mathematically speaking, 3d6 does not use a specific percent chance for each number to be rolled such as you use with a d20 (each number has a specific, set percent chance to come up on a single dice roll), a 3d6 system uses a bell curve.

For details about these free Add-Ons, click here and here.\nEdit: Map Alchemists has now donated a 10th free Add-On.\nIF YOU'RE IN A HURRY, CLICK HERE FOR A QUICK RUNDOWN OF WHAT YOU CAN GET AT THE VARIOUS PLEDGE LEVELS.\nIntroducing new battlemap creation software for tabletop RPGs\nHave you always wanted to make your own slick-looking full-color battlemaps, but just don\u2019t have the time or patience to learn to use a sophisticated image editing application like Photoshop or Gimp? Or perhaps you tried anyway but in the end you ran away screaming in frustration because you found it too difficult and/or time-consuming?\nHave you tried existing mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve, the cost, the interface, and/or been disappointed by the results?\nIf the answer to any or all of those questions is \u201cyes\u201d, then my brand new MapForge application is probably just what you\u2019ve been searching for (and possibly waiting for for years).\nWhat will make MapForge special?\nEasy to use\nThe goal is to make MapForge really easy to use, and for a user to be able to start making maps on Day 1 without even bothering to read the User Manual. And by extension, to never feel like you need to re-learn the software even if it\u2019s been many months since you last used it.\nSupport for Add-Ons (both free and commercial)\nMake your maps using top-notch professional Add-On content, or using your own content, or a mix of both.\nLow-cost/Inexpensive\nI\u2019m making the software itself very affordable, so that you\u2019ll have plenty of money left over to purchase a bunch of Add-Ons.\nVersatile\nAlthough it\u2019s primarily intended for creating battlemaps (in any genre), the program will provide enough flexibility that, given the right content, you\u2019ll also be able to create other types of maps, ranging from area maps to deep space. You can use the program to make high-resolution maps for printing, or lower- resolution maps for use in your favorite virtual tabletop software.\nGorgeous and user-friendly interface\nThe user interface for MapForge is thematically generic, but very attractive and modern. And it should appeal to you whether you\u2019re the type who prefers to click on buttons and choose menu commands to get things done, or of you\u2019re the power-user type who likes to use hotkeys to get things done that much quicker.\nCross-platform\nWhether you\u2019re a Windows user or a Mac user, MapForge has you covered. And if you have a MapForge license and someday decide to switch platforms, you can just request a new license code for the new operating system, free of charge.\nHigh-quality results\nThe output is crisp, detailed, and (optionally) high-resolution.\nEmpowering, but with a shallow learning curve\nMapForge will help you unleash your creativity. It\u2019s not intended just for the artistically or technically gifted. It will allow anyone, regardless of their art skills or technical skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, detailed battlemaps. With MapForge, you\u2019ll be able to produce Photoshop-like effects such as bevels, drop-shadows, strokes, glows, blurs, and color adjustments without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires.\nOffers a free level of use\nYou\u2019ll be able to use MapForge to make nice maps even if you haven\u2019t purchased a license. Even use free and commercial Add-Ons without a license (though commercial Add-Ons will require registration). I\u2019m confident that MapForge will earn a place in your mapping toolbox, and I\u2019m optimistic that you\u2019ll find it so useful that you will get a license eventually, in order to unlock the software\u2019s full potential.\nQuicker Map Creation\nWith MapForge, I want to help GMs reduce their session prep time, not increase it. You shouldn\u2019t have to spend several hours or even days creating a decent map for your game session. Using keyword searches and tags, you\u2019ll find that elusive content you\u2019re searching for in no time. My goal with MapForge is to enable you to whip up a great map in under an hour. Sometimes even two maps.\nAnd the most important element of all...FUN!\nOther map-making programs on the market can be a chore to use. It just feels too much like work. MapForge intends to make map-making FUN! Because if you aren\u2019t having fun, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\nThe initial inspiration for this project came from using commercial mapping tiles for tabletop RPGs. I found that the tiles themselves looked fantastic, but that the actual act of putting together a map layout, particularly for large layouts, was painstaking and rather tedious, even though I happen to be well-versed with a professional image editing program (Photoshop).\nGMs who want to print out map tiles that they purchase online or create themselves aren't the only ones affected by this \"technical barrier to entry\". Many people nowadays use virtual tabletop (VTT) software to play RPGs remotely, but VTTs are far from optimal map-making tools. They can be wonderful for having a few objects on the map that the players can interact with, but crafting entire map layouts from dozens or even hundreds of map elements is hardly their forte, and the time and effort required to do so would be inordinate.\nSo I decided to create an easy-to-use computer program that would be the best possible tool I could dream up for the task of stitching together pre-made map tiles and and then populating them with decorative elements (e.g., furniture, treasure, debris, etc.) to suit a GM's particular needs. I'm calling the program MapForge. It is intended to allow anyone, regardless of their art skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, hi-resolution battlemaps. \nWho Is MapForge For?\nMapForge is for any GM who wants to create a drool-worthy tactical-scale battlemap for any genre of RPG. It's also suitable for tabletop miniature games and wargames.\nWhat MapForge Isn't\nHave you tried other mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve and/or the results? That may be because the software tried to be too many things, and ended up not excelling at any one thing.\n\u2022 MapForge is not a general-purpose mapping app; you probably won't be using it to map out continents or entire worlds. It\u2019s narrower in scope, focusing on tile-based and grid-based mapping at tactical combat scale (typically 1\u201d = 5 ft., or 1 hex = 3 feet).\n\u2022 MapForge is not a general-purpose paint program, nor a CAD program. It\u2019s more of a layout and design tool, intended for anyone to use, not just the artistically or technically gifted.\n\u2022 MapForge is also not just a simple \u201ctexture-stamping\u201d program. Some of the planned features are geared towards producing Photoshop-like effects without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires. The software will allow you to create maps by drawing rooms and corridors with straightforward drawing tools (with optional snap-to-grid functionality) and then applying \"styles\" to the walls and floors, including special effects like bevels, glows, strokes, blurs, and drop shadows, and (optionally) textures (e.g. stone, brick, cement, cobblestones, etc.). Some \"general purpose\" styles will come included (pre-configured) with the app, while other styles you will create or tweak yourself to achieve a very specific look.\nTo ensure that great content would be available for use in the program, I formed an alliance with some of my favorite content creators in the field of mapmaking for RPGs. All of them are A-list artists who are well known and respected in the map-making community. They, too, saw the need for such a program, and decided to add their support. Collectively, their published work comprises a vast library of top-notch content that should cover the indoor and outdoor battlemap needs of most RPGs.\nLord Zsezse Works - Zolt\u00e1n B\u00e1r\u00e1ny (see samples)\nBlack Scrolls Games - Antal K\u00e9ninger (see samples)\nHeroic Maps - Joe & Sarah Bilton\nStudio Wyldfurr - Jason Cordwell (see samples)\nDungeonArts - Greg Taylor\nGabriel Pickard - (see samples)\nSteve Gaudreau, Map Alchemists - (see samples)\nBogie\nKepli\nIn addition to your Pledge Rewards, during this campaign you may pledge for the following items. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the cost of the Add-On/s you desire.

But if we can collectively show them that the added convenience of the MapForge Add-On format will earn them more sales, it will validate one of the program's principal reasons for existing.\nIMPORTANT!

This is only for backers who are getting a MapForge license AND/OR paid content Add-Ons. See Update #9 for details. This one-time setup fee is a flat rate, and covers all Add-Ons you get now or in the future. It is being offered so that no one has to buy a 2nd license for themselves or purchase a 2nd copy of their Add-Ons. You may NOT use this allowance to permit someone else the use of your paid Add-Ons.\nGifting a MapForge license to a friend:\nAdd $25 to your pledge (at any pledge level) to get an additional MapForge license for a friend. When the email survey goes out at the end if this campaign, be sure to include your friend's email address so that I can get them their license code. You can even order more than one license to gift, if you desire. Note that any content Add-Ons that you get for yourself will not also be applied to your friend's license.\nAs MapForge's userbase grows, I fully expect that additional Add-Ons will be developed and released in the future, both from the above content providers and from others that will want to service the MapForge community. The above selection of Add-Ons is just the \"first wave\", but should be more than enough for the time-being.\nIf by chance you have already purchased some of the above content in the original PDF or PNG format, you should be able to use it in MapForge, albeit without some of the added convenience provided by the Add-On format. Some of the content providers might be willing to allow free registration of the respective Add-Ons to customers who've already purchased their content in its original format and can show proof of purchase.\nI want the MapForge software to be extremely versatile and user friendly, something you can use without first having to read a dense user manual, or resume using without a hitch even if it's been many months since you last used the program.\nThe user interface will be modern, gorgeous (despite being thematically generic), and will look the same regardless of whether you are running the app on Windows or on macOS. Should you happen to switch operating systems someday, you will be able to continue using MapForge without missing a beat.\nClick to enlarge\n  Click to enlarge\n  I also want MapForge to offer a free level of use, so that it\u2019s usable by anyone, even those who have not purchased a license (albeit with a reduced featureset and a few other limitations). This should allow the MapForge userbase to grow very rapidly, which in turn will make the platform more appealing to content publishers, who may want to make their wares available in MapForge.\nIn addition to using content from pre-packaged Add-Ons, MapForge will also allow you to use your own artwork (either created by you, or downloaded from elsewhere, such as the Dundjinni user forums or rpgmapshare.com).\nI don't expect too many people to back this project on faith alone. Many of you have likely been disappointed by prior map-making software, so a healthy degree of skepticism is expected. That is why I have put together a MapForge demo/prototype, which you can download and try out for yourself, in order to evaluate it and take the program for a short spin to see if this is going to be the program you want/expect it to be.\nClick here to download the MapForge prototype for Windows (Zip, 71.8MB)\nClick here to download the MapForge prototype for Windows (7-zip, 30.8MB)\nClick here to download the MapForge prototype for Mac OS X (Zip, 74.3MB)\nA great many features have yet to be implemented (that's what this crowdfunding campaign is for, after all!), but there is enough there for you to evaluate the proposed user interface, the planned featureset, the performance, and the ease of use. A few bugs are to be expected, as this has not seen general release until now. If necessary, I will update the prototype during this campaign to iron out any show-stopping issues encountered.\nHere is a video that walks you through most of the features in the MapForge prototype. You should probably watch this even if you download the prototype demo, since this explains things you might otherwise miss.\nIMPORTANT! Please do not misinterpret what you see in the prototype app or in the video. Just because it only shows maps being assembled from tiles, that does not mean that it is the only thing the final MapForge application will do. MapForge will be a full-fledged map-making program, offering several different methods for creating maps, and those methods can be used individually, or in conjunction. If you prefer to make your own maps from scratch, that will be possible, too. The prototype and the video both show a paid Add-On being used, which is not included with the base software. If you want that particular Add-On, it's called \"Dark Crypts\", by Black Scrolls Games.\nPlanned Features\n\u2022 Quickly assemble existing map tiles into a large map layout.\n\u2022 Support for layers (to adjust the stacking order of items on a map).\n\u2022 Group layers and show/hide/adjust the entire group as a whole (e.g., the contents of a given room), for greater project organization.\n\u2022 Randomization features for textures (to avoid repeating patterns) and for placed items (e.g. randomly scatter trees, automatically varying their size and rotation).\n\u2022 Adjust the location, scale, rotation and opacity of any placed item.\n\u2022 Toggle between day & night versions with the click of a button.\n\u2022 Media Types: Tiles, Tile Overlays, Items, Textures, Walls, Masks\n\u2022 Ability to mark media that should only appear on the GM version of a map (e.g. room key numbers, traps, secret doors, etc.).\n\u2022 Apply bitmap filters, for special effects such as Bevel, Glow, Drop Shadow, Stroke, Color Adjustment, Brightness/Contrast, etc.\n\u2022 Convenience of the MapForge Add-On format: The software knows how large each tile should be (in grid squares), where the exits are, what tiles can be placed next to it and connect properly, and makes it easy to find content via tags and keyword searches.\n\u2022 Export the entire map at once, or just the parts you want.\nI've spent a month and a half so far to get the program to the stage it's at in the downloadable prototype. I need to devote another 3-4 months to complete the program, and this Kickstarter campaign is intended to finance that development time, as well as the development of the various Add-Ons.\nI have an established track record developing virtual tabletop software for over a decade, with over a hundred releases to date. As a software developer, I have a reputation for being accessible, communicative, open to feedback and criticism, and prolific. I've always provided timely technical support to all users of my software. In short, I deliver, I'm in this for the long haul, I have an established reputation to uphold, and I'm passionate about my products.\nThis project has a relatively short completion/delivery time (about 4 months for the software) because I will be able to re-use a fair amount of code from prior RPG-related software I\u2019ve developed. This puts me in a unique position to deliver a robustly-featured program in a relatively short timeframe, and thus for a relatively low basic funding goal. I will be working on this project full-time.\nI expect the first release of MapForge (v1.0) to be ready sometime in July 2017. There will likely be a couple of alpha and beta releases in the months prior to that.\nMost of the content Add-Ons for MapForge should be released shortly thereafter (and in fairly quick succession), but there will definitely be at least a few Add-Ons available at the time of launch, since I'll need them for testing purposes, anyway. I will prioritize the production order of the Add-Ons based on how many people pledged for each one.\nThe bulk of the money raised by this Kickstarter will pay for the development time that I have estimated it will take to complete the MapForge software and the Add-Ons that will be released for it. A very small part of the funds (a few hundred dollars) will cover necessary software upgrades and software license fees, another few hundred will pay for a nice, quiet place to work at a shared office, and a similar amount will be earmarked for advertising and marketing the final product.\n  All Stretch Goals unlocked (again!)\nSocial Media Goal: Any backer Sharing or re-Tweeting my campaign launch announcements and/or my Updates to this Kickstarter campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ will get early access to a Kickstarter-exclusive Add-On. To be eligible for this reward, you must be following Battlegrounds Games on either Facebook, Twitter, or Google+.\n  In short, this campaign will finance the development of the MapForge software for a minimum of 4 months, working on it full-time (Edit: The funding achieved will now allow me to devote nearly a YEAR to MapForge and Add-On development!). I need your support to make MapForge happen. Help me create the most useful mapping program to visually enrich your RPG game sessions while reducing your prep time. GMs already have plenty of work they need to do to prepare for each game session. Making maps should not eat up most of that time.\nWhether or not you choose to make a pledge to this campaign, I would greatly appreciate it if you could mention this project to friends or family members who might be interested. I've made it easy to do so; just click on one of the buttons below. Help spread the word far and wide.\n      Last but not least, I'd love it if you would follow Battlegrounds Games on any or all of these social media sites, so you can stay apprised of all the latest news and developments.

I think you're really going to like the additional speed boost I've achieved. In prior releases, whenever a tile had to be drawn on a map, MapForge would take the original asset artwork, apply scaling effects to it to account for the map's resolution, rotate the artwork as needed, apply any mirror/flipping effects to it, and then draw the result to the map canvas. But with v1.1.5, I'm having the app dynamically create temporary \u201cproxies\" of the stamped tiles at the current working resolution. These proxies already take into account any scaling/flipping/rotating of the tile, so when the app needs to redraw that particular section of the map after an edit operation, it just loads the proxy and stamps it in place. This reduced work load makes a huge difference when editing your map layouts, which is most noticeable when working with the 3300x3300 pixel tiles in the (e.g. ), because it means that if you\u2019re working at a resolution of 50 (rather than the artwork's native resolution of 330), the app will only be redrawing a 495x495 pixel area of the map when you edit a tile.

DiPesa, Erik Frankhouse, Ben McFarland, Jaye Sonia, and Brian Suskind, Bloodlines & Black Magic is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible supernatural campaign setting that takes place in our modern world. Bloodlines & Black Magic pits rich political elites, desperate cultists, supernatural horrors, celestial powers, secret magical orders, G\u00f6etic spirits, and ancient bloodlines in a deadly war against one another over a reality that nearly all of humanity can neither see nor comprehend.\nBloodlines & Black Magic is Pathfinder compatible!\nHidden from the mundane world, only a rare few individuals ever gain a glimpse of this dimension of supernatural horrors, this realm of human tragedy and desperation, learning secrets that - if spoken in public - would mark them as broken. Aligned with secret organizations or working as individual agents, Bloodlines & Black Magic gives these modern heroes a dark universe to explore, a canvas that is even dimmer, painted in a darker, decayed grey than the colors already coating it.\nEnter a world where seven distinct magical bloodlines - each with its own ties to the supernatural world, positioning themselves in places of power, working from behind the scenes to shape the world in their image. These bloodlines dominate certain hereditary lines, but might otherwise manifest in secret within any area, or any unaware individual. Although these bloodlines only make up a very small part of the global population, they dominate nearly 72% of the globe, secretly running everything from global trade routes to entire countries.\nAn infernal blooded cultist prepares for a ritual...\nThese bloodlines maneuver the shadows of the secret parts of the world:\nFey blooded Delicate and lively, individuals who carry the blood of the fey display strange insights; some even claim to suffer from otherworldly visions of both the future and past. Prominent throughout the Old World, fey blooded individuals often display interests in nature, environmentalism, and history - especially history related to Ireland, Scotland, Gaul, and even some of the Nordic lands.\nInfernal Blooded Cunning and strong, individuals with ties to this bloodline rarely discover the power of their blood until late into their teens, although some don\u2019t manifest their abilities until their mid-twenties. Naturally intelligent, these individuals combine their wit with their strength, outwitting or strong-arming others into following their directions, regardless of their will.\nDragon Blooded Born cold, calculating, and prone to dreams of conquest others can barely comprehend, the dragon blooded are a supremely confident line. Some whisper their heritage is as old as the serpent that encircles the cosmic egg, and although many chuckle at the idea of sleeping dragons, these individuals know all too well their blood is as cold as it is ancient.\nJinn Blooded As passionate and dedicated as any modern dervish, jinn blooded humans have ties that predate the modern Middle East. Their heritage rises from the Assyrian, Sumerian, and Babylonian conquerors who, under a bright, burning sun, worked ancient magic in the earliest dawn of man. Wise and tenacious, these individuals display a resilience rarely found in the modern world.\nSeraphic Blooded Nearly as famous as their infernal siblings, seraphic blooded humans are wise and comely. Many of these seraphic blooded descendants display a natural charisma that reveals their angelic roots, attracting others who simply want to bask in the presence. Attractive to a fault, these individuals display their bloodline in a number of physical ways: bright eyes, angular features, and silky hair that range from the dark of a raven\u2019s feathers to the golden hues of the Valkyries themselves.\nShadow Blooded Of all the bloodlines, those who carry shadow-touched blood are perhaps the strangest. These rare individuals openly display a love of the dark, and many take great pains to avoid the daylight; some of these shadow-blooded suffer from minor medical conditions that discourage daytime activities.\nSpirit Blooded Attuned to a world visited almost exclusively by dreamers, spirit blooded humans have a heritage older than that of any other bloodline. Many claim that their very bodies are the world\u2019s ancient spirits made flesh, while others believe they are the children of the dreaming realms, readily pointing to the Astral Plane as their original home.\nA spirit blooded investigator calls on a favor...\nBloodlines & Black Magic draws liberally from the lore of our day-to-day world, weaving historical facts, modern myths, urban legends, and popular conspiracies into a supernatural world that could be our own \u2013 but only if we had the eyes and patience to pierce the neon-stained billboards which so carefully hides it from our view. Steeped in esoteric lore, popular culture, current events, and empowered by a connected, global community, Bloodlines & Black Magic pushes the boundaries of what we think we know, crashing through the mirror and diving into the deeper parts of the human abyss...\n            A modification of the unofficial Pathfinder E6 system championed by the eccentric and odd minds of Clinton Boomer and Jaye Sonia (with a lot of help from their friends), Occult 7 (or O7 for short) is a new adaptation of that system that combines elements from Occult Adventures, the Advanced Class Guide, Pathfinder Unchained, and dD20 Modern (with a proper nod to White Wolf's original World of Darkness and the games it inspired), combining everything into a simple, streamlined system that eases play and focuses on that gritty, dark modern feel.\nUsing O7 as its base, Bloodlines & Black Magic introduces Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (and 3.5) fans to a darker world heavily influenced by some of the genre's best fiction and media. Mechanically, it gives players a whole new set of tools to play with, including new and updated skills for the modern world, unique character abilities, seven updated character classes (based on classes from Occult Adventures and The Advanced Class Guide), new feats and traits, an expanded library of modern magical items, and a host of new NPCs and locations for GMs to adapt to the world they already know. \nA boy and his dog? Or a Jinn-bound street magician and its familiar?\nBloodlines & Black Magic also introduces players and GMs to several new mechanics, including:\n\n\u2022 Encounter Arcana: Each character begins play with a single trait aligned to an Arcana (a concept). Every encounter in Bloodlines & Black Magic is ruled by an Arcana of its own. When a player's character aligns with that Arcana, they gain a significant boost during that encounter. Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce 40 Arcana for players and GMs to pick from.\n\n\u2022 Breaking Point: Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a new, unique tracking system to track mental fatigue and stress caused from exposure to the supernatural\u2026 and to unlock new, hidden inner abilities!\n\n\u2022 Bloodlines: Instead of using static racial builds, Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a fully modular point-buy system, allowing players to build individual characters who - even when they share the same lineage - are entirely unique.\n\n\nWhile Bloodlines & Black Magic will be familiar to fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, it changes the way adventures are played, and how each play session is executed.\n\nThese differences can be summarized below:\n\u2022 Whispers & Rumors: Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce a season full of shorter companion PDFs (each between 7 and 11 pages in length), each of which includes new NPCs, new monsters, new locations, new secrets, and new encounters. These will launch in October of 2017 and will last a full year. Each new season will begin the following October (more info below).\n\u2022 O7 Episodes: Each season of Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce a full season of short, 4-5 hour long adventures designed to feel like episodes of your favorite supernatural or horror television show. Designed to complement Whispers & Rumors, each of these episodes will slowly peel back the veil, giving both players and GMs a better look at the world beyond.\n\u2022 Player Impact! If we do well enough on this Kickstarter, we may implementing a player feedback/support metric, which allows individual groups to slowly change the way the world unfolds between each season!\nAn occultist works his dark magic...\nBloodlines & Black Magic is not for the faint of heart: encounters in Bloodlines & Black Magic are designed to be challenging, making situations that do turn violent that much more deadly - but also making each victory so much sweeter. Your enemies may look familiar, but they\u2019ve been drastically altered, shaped to fit the myths of this new world\u2026 a world that is eerily similar to the one you know right now!\n                                       Whispers & Rumors will be a new, unique way in which participants in the world can influence it (and later on, even shape it)! Designed as a cooperative online/offline play experience, each issue will include the designers\u2019 notes and insights, and will include new monsters, NPCs, locations, gear, haunts, spells, and more! Every other month, one of the designers will dispatch a new O7 Episode (a mini-adventure with 7-11 pages of content), tailored to suit the current Season. Every other month, designers will send out clues, stories, codes, cyphers, and other material intended to help players unlock the first year's major villain. Players can champion one of the seven bloodlines, or if it suits them, align to a particular organization or even specific kingdoms!\nThis is a production mock up of the new book!\nBloodlines & Black Magic is nearing completion. Although we're not completely finished with the manuscript for Bloodlines & Black Magic, we've written nearly 70% of the main book and expect to be going into layout by the end of this summer. We're running this Kickstarter to help add more art to the book, as well as to potentially add more content to it. If we hit some of our stretch goals, we'd like to move it from a B&W project to a full color, comic-style hardcover - with more great art from some of the industry's best names. If you've followed our other projects, you already know Storm Bunny Studios prides itself on its production quality - this project will be no different.\n  Matt Banach has been a freelance writer and game designer ever since he entered the fray by making the Top 16 in Paizo's RPG Superstar 2009, realizing the possibilities of contributing to the gaming hobbies he'd enjoyed all his life. Working extensively with Rite Publishing for most of the last eight years, Matt has authored several serial RPG projects which have become big beautiful compilations, including the high-octane Faces of the Tarnished Souk: An NPC Collection for Rite Publishing's Coliseum Morpheuon, and the Gossamer Worlds Compendium \u2013 a series of alternate realities for use in the mind-bending multiverse of Lords of Gossamer & Shadow (Diceless). Matt especially loves writing prose and fiction; he authored his first full-length novel, Lost in Dream, for Rite Publishing, and is hoping he can do something similar for Bloodlines & Black Magic. Over the years Matt has also contributed to Darkness Without Form: Secrets of the Mimic, Kobold Ecologies, Adventure Quarterly, multiple short works of fiction, and some soon-to-be-released stuff for Rogue Genius Games. Matt's wide-ranging roleplaying experience and inspirations include D&D's Planescape, White Wolf's World of Darkness and Mind's Eye Theater, Unknown Armies, d20 Modern, and Pathfinder. Matt is extremely interested in the O7 system and the Bloodlines & Black Magic setting because they will combine deliciously dark noir, gritty street-level action, and both post-modern and traditional supernatural horror. This is Matt's chance to join old friends and new to help design the game he has always wanted to play.\nClinton J.

From the moment Green Ronin Publishing revealed it in the adventure, Death in Freeport, it was clear this setting was unique--a pirate city on the edge of the known world, crawling with orcs, gangs, monsters, and servants of dark and maddening gods. Since that first adventure, Green Ronin has released a slew of support products, adding adventures and supplements that have brought this city to life. \nOne of the most appealing parts of Freeport, aside from all the blood, carnage, and madness, was how it could fit into any world by simply dropping it in on the edge of the map. When I was working at Green Ronin, we took this idea a step further and made it possible to drop the City of Adventure into any game by publishing The Pirate's Guide to Freeport--a system-neutral book that could be used with any game, from Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay to Rolemaster, and everything in between. In the Companion Series of Freeport books, the setting has been adapted for use in Savage Worlds, Pathfinder, Castles & Crusades, Fate, and more. Now it's time to bring this classic city to the world of the Demon Lord.\nIn 2015, I launched a successful Kickstarter campaign for Shadow of the Demon Lord, a horror fantasy roleplaying game set in the last days of a dying world. When building the setting for the game, I reserved a small spot for Freeport, a city that will always have a soft-spot in my cold, black heart. Now that I have shipped out all the rewards for Shadow and released 120 titles for the game (including adventures, card decks, sourcebooks, and more), I want to bring Freeport to my world and I need your help to do it.\nThe Shadow of the Demon Lord Freeport Companion will be loaded with goodies for any fan of the Demon Lord. Inside its pages, you'll find two new ancestries--the undine and the mysterious serpent people known as the Valossans. The book offers ten new expert and master paths, such as the drunken celebrant and the vicious pit fighter. Over thirty new spells join the game, all speaking to the darkness of the city and the sorts of adventures one might undertake in and around it. New gear and new rules for underwater exploration, voyages, and ship battles all help you run seafaring adventures in Shadow. This book gives you a ton of characters, relics, new monsters, and a big adventure you can use to kick off a new campaign. \nFor more information on the product, be sure to check out our website. \nIllustration by Jack Kaiser\n   As with my last Kickstarter campaign, I have everything written and ready to move into production. I'm just waiting on the funds to make this happen. I'll be using pledges to pay the editor, graphic designer, and artists for all new art to make this product as awesome and gorgeous as it deserves to be. So I could really use your help to bring this sourcebook out. All you need to do is choose one of the pledge levels on the right side of this page and you're done. As with any Kickstarter campaign, you pay nothing if the project doesn't fund. But if it does fund, you can rest assured that you'll get a kick-ass book that's loaded with great gaming content. \n    Not final cover\n  Not final layout\n      Not final layout\n  Shadow of the Demon Lord has a slew of great support products already, and now is a great time to get caught up on releases you might have missed.

Take a look and leave a comment!\n  What is Spheres of Might?\nSpheres of Might is a new system for handling martial prowess in Pathfinder and other D20 roleplaying games.\nBarbarians, swashbucklers, knights, rogues; in the world of high adventure and fantasy roleplay, few things are as iconic as the martial warrior. From Conan the Barbarian, to Aragorn, or King Arthur and his knights, these champions of steel and valor stand on the front lines, battling foes beyond the comprehension of lesser mortals, and make the impossible seem like child's play.\nSpheres of Might is a book for them. \n  Why a Martial Book?\nWhen it comes to Pathfinder, and sometimes the whole tabletop RPG industry as a whole, it can seem like magic users get all the fun. Those squishy magicians have no shortage of spells and tricks to make their work enjoyable, but too often the warriors wielding swords and spears on the front lines lack the breadth of options afforded their magic-using peers; attack, move, attack, repeat. In real life, though, combat is anything but repetitive; facing an opponent quickly becomes an exciting yet terrifying dance, as combatants dodge, feint, counter, and make split second decisions that can lead to life or death.\nSpheres of Might is designed to change the way martial combat works to make it more visceral, intricate, and cinematic. In this book, we introduce deeper and more robust options for martial combatants, giving them a greater number of tactics to employ each round, and supporting virtually any combat style imaginable from precise one-handed fencing to wild berserking and beyond. Additionally, because these new options build off of the core combat rules presented in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook, anyone familiar with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game will be able to jump right in and begin using these new options without having to learn pages of new rules or terms first.\nHow Does Spheres of Might Work?\nLike our previous release, Spheres of Power, Spheres of Might makes use of the Spheres system: through a system of talents gained by leveling, a martial combatant can unlock powers and playstyles via buying into a series of overarching 'spheres' that map to various techniques and playstyles (wrestling, fencing, throwing, etc.) then further refining these abilities through the selection of talents within those spheres. Each of these spheres provide many options in and of themselves, but are also designed to have high levels of synergy with each other, allowing players to mix the spheres to create their own custom combat styles, from a wrestler who pounds his targets into the floor with flying leaps, to a fencer who lures his targets to attack before taking them down with a powerful counterpunch.\nBy picking and choosing what styles and techniques they can perform, it becomes possible to construct any type of martial character desired, giving them a host of options to perform in and out of combat to fit whatever need may arise. While there are still countless ways to specialize and create a unique combatant, rarely will a Sphere of Might user find themselves without some trick or other up their sleeves.\nJust as importantly as what Spheres of Might does is what it doesn't do; The Spheres of Might system does not add a whole new set of rules and terminology on top of the core Pathfinder rules, instead building off the existing framework in new and exciting ways that are easy for players already used to Pathfinder's combat system to understand and utilize. This has the added benefit of also meaning that Spheres of Might is highly compatible with many other martial augmentation systems, as well as previously-released classes from both Paizo and most 3rd party publishers. \nWhat Will be Included in Spheres of Might?\nIf we are able to meet our initial goal, it will fund the creation of a 140 page, full-color, hardback book filled with new martial options. However, the best part about kickstarter is that the more backing the project gains, the more space the books can contain, adding more and more pages of content! \nIn its current form, Spheres of Might will contain over 20 spheres to provide characters new and interesting options in and out combat, as well as new feats, thematic variants, and 6 new classes custom designed to showcase the new options and bring a great many character ideas to life.\nAmong these new classes will be found:\nThe Armiger: Skilled mercenaries who learn to leverage every trick at their disposal to triumph on the battlefield, armigers learn to quickly and effectively use a variety of weapons in devastating combos.\nThe Blacksmith: Mighty powerhouses, blacksmiths' powerful physiques are complimented by talented minds that allow them to craft superior equipment for their allies, as well as providing them with beneficial buffs by maintaining their gear during downtime.\nThe Commander: Cunning leaders, commanders specialize in bringing out the best in their allies and exhorting them to victory.\nAnd several more!\nFor helping us bring this book to life, we're offering many different rewards packages to reflect whatever method (print, PDF, hero lab) you use to run your games, as well as a few unique rewards as well. For those unfamiliar with the Spheres system who are interested in magic as well as martial combat, we have several reward levels that also include copies of our previous Spheres release, Spheres of Power, as well as Spheres of Power: Expanded Options, who adds many archetypes and abilities to the system.\nMore Details about the various reward levels can be found on the right-hand side of the page.\n         Thank You!\nThank you for looking over our campaign.

It is designed to inspire the creativity in all parts of play \u2013 starting with character creation. The game has been thoroughly tested in campaign play and games at many conventions. It offers a quick and simple d6 mechanical resolution system, while allowing a great amount of creativity in approaches.\nThe core rulebook, which we call ISSUE 0, currently sits at 82 pages (44,000 words) and contains 16 black-and-white illustrations. Supporting this kickstarter will allow us to expand the existing content, both art and text, and provide a quality PDF and Print copy.\nWe are also offering perks that include subscriptions to our first 4 scenarios (Issues #1-4). These are all adventures that have been run previously at conventions and have been very well received.\nSimple Superheroes is an ideal game for veteran players who are tired of overly-complex RPGs and is also perfect for players who are completely new to Roleplaying Games.\nSimple Superheroes runs off rulings, not rules. Rulings are context-dependent. Each confrontation, challenge, story, universe and hero is unique and thus each ruling must be unique. Simple Superheroes gives you the guidance and framework to run exactly the kind of game that you and your players desire.\nStatus of the Current Issue 0 Rulebook\nCh 1 - Characters and System (7,000 words)\ncharacter creation and game basics\n example of character creation\nhow to play the first time\nCh 2 - Rolling Them Dice (5,000 words)\nresolutions mechanics and special actions\nwhen not to roll\nCh 3 - On Powers, Talents and Common Foes (6,000 words)  \napproaches to various common powers, technology and magic\nnormal people: thugs, criminals and police\nCh 4 - On Universes, Stories and GMing (6,000 words)\ncreating your Universe\nplanning your scenario\u2019s\ngeneral Game Masters advice \n3 sample universes in brief \nCh 5 - Enemies and Allies (16,000)  \n14 heroes  \n4 mysterious agents  \n10 villains  \nArt\nBlack and white interior art - 17 pieces\nCover page\nMore about Simple Superheroes ISSUE 0\nISSUE 0 is the core rulebook for Simple Superheroes. It has a double meaning in that ISSUE 0 is the start to all the Simple Superheroes \"Issues\" you and your friends will tell. It is also the first of many Issues to be released by Compose Dream Games.\nSo what are the mechanics of this elegant system?\nThe fundamental building block of a character in Simple Superheroes is the talent. A talent has a rank, which determines its potency, and so the number of dice you get to roll. A talent is put in an ability category \u2013 this helps frame how the talent works. Finally a talent has an intent \u2013 this determines how the talent may be used. For example: Instinct has a rank 4- Mind Blast talent in the Might ability category with an Offensive intent.\nThe name of the Talent, what exactly it does and how it works is left entirely up to the players and Game Master. This lets players create characters very quickly after only a brief explanation of the rules.\nSuperpower Finesse is a measure of related talents and helps guide how broad and flexible your hero's powers are.\nLifepoints are a fairly traditional metric of a character's physical health and capacity to fight.\nStrainpoints are an innovative measure of a character's will to fight on and to push their abilities. As such they may be spent \u2013 although there are some things that may cause strainpoints to be lost.\nRelations and Values are all of the things that tie the character into the game universe. This is the primary means of recovering strainpoints.\nSimple Superheroes is a flexible framework that can create all kinds of superhero characters, supporting many kinds of tropes, atmospheres and power levels. ISSUE 0 does focus its prose on supporting lower-powered heroes as this is the perfect place to start your superhero\u2019s career. However, the system easily handles global and galactic heroes just by altering assumptions at character creation.\nFor more on the mechanics of Simple Superheroes please take a look at the short PDF download The Heart of Simple Superheroes.\nYou may also be interested in our Character Creation Videos and our Mechanics Video.\nMore about Simple Superheroes ISSUE #1-4\nThe first four issues are a set in the city of New Carthage. Set just a few years in the future it is a universe where individuals with powers have existed only for a short time. Most metahumans are connected in some fashion to the now defunct ONEVA project.\nIssue #1 Our Genetics\nProfessor Adrakis, a genetic engineer, is looking for an escaped subject. He may well capture your hero\u2019s loved ones to gain your assistance.\nIssue #2 The Experiment\nDr Newton, is being plagued by thefts.

This has led to a full-scale gang war.\nIssue #4 Saving Innocence\nThe Emerald Hawk and Displacer have kidnapped a 13 year old girl. The ransom is way beyond what the father could possibly pay. What is really going on?\nFuture Issues\nFuture Issues will introduce Blackthorne Correctional Facility for metahumans, more mystically oriented adventures such as A Whirlwind of Stone & Flame and House of Bolchavar, and ones at greater power levels.\nWe also plan on releasing \"Annuals\" that will cover variant rules, play at global and galactic levels and more.\nMore About Compose Dream Games\nCompose Dream Games was created to bring Simple Superheroes and other games to you.

Written by Dr. Jason Tondro and produced by Fainting Goat Games, this book is a treasure trove of knowledge for anyone looking to delve deep into the world of super evil.\nArtists for the Project include:\nJoe Singleton [http://joe-singleton.deviantart.com/] Artist, writer, plotter (evil and general), Defender of Liberty, Holder of Secrets, and Keeper of the Eraser of Doom!\nDionysia Jones [http://dionysiajones.deviantart.com/] I have done interior art and cover illustrations for published RPG books such as Earthdawn, various Mutants & Masterminds supplements, and was the lead artist for Tianxia.\nJacob Blackmon [http://prodigyduck.deviantart.com/]  I draw and I play role-playing games.\nJoe Arnold - Has worked for Jeff Dee on Cave Master\nIt's true, super villains are a secretive lot. Other than the occasional slip of megalomania during world domination broadcasts, most super villains keep the essence of who they are and what they do under tight wraps. Dr. Comics (That would be Dr Tondro... Shh. It's a secret) has tapped every informant, minion, and ex-villainous love interest he could get his hooks into to divulge the secrets of what makes a super villain tick. For matters of security, we cannot reveal his sources. The only verifiable source is his comics dealer (who has since gone missing).\nThe Super Villain Handbook covers forty archetypes for various super villains that one might encounter throughout comics. While the book was created with ICONS in mind, there are many reasons that this is an essential resource for GMs of any superhero game. \nThe book classifies super villains not by what they can do (for example, \"control magnetism\") but by their role in the story (\"I must make the world safe for my people!\"). In such roles, we see everything from the lowly Crime Boss to the Cosmic Menace. This allows villains of all types and power sets to fill different roles at the table without coming across as poorly re-skinned clones.\nEach of the 40 roles also includes game stats for a sample villain in the ICONS rpg. For powerful villains with roles that are more plot device than punching bag, Jason... Er, I mean, Dr. Comics... has added cosmic power levels to the ICONS experience. These levels let the aspiring GM have a benchmark so his heroes can try and punch the hurricane (or other \u201cunstoppable force\u201d ) into submission.\nEach role is a study in evil that gives a GM the tools to construct the villains their heroes were meant to fight. Archetypes start with a quote from a famous character in comics that has filled that role. As you dig deeper into the villain, you discover what makes them tick. This includes classic examples of the role, which roles are related, and even story and plot ideas that the villain usually operates in. From the Assassin to the Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, the archetypes in this book constitute an essential reference to new and old GM's alike.  \nKickstarter is an excellent way to connect with potential fans as well as to distribute coded subliminal messages which activate Sleeper Minions. The basic book is complete. It contains the 40 illustrated archetypes as well as useful tools to expand your evil. Unfortunately, our original minions rage quit after being beaten up one too many times and took our cover.  \nWith your help, we can push the book into lofty new heights of evil. The basic Goal is to fund the book for both an ICONS Assembled and SUPERS! Revised edition. At 3,200, Jason will turn his mind control probe on Ross Payton (Base Raiders RPG), to publish a FATE Core version of the game. 3,800 dollars will see a deluxe version of the book for ICONS where we will see 40 unique villains added to the book, doubling its size. At 4,500, Jason will once again turn on the probe and, if he doesn't fry Walt's brain, we will see a deluxe version for the SUPERS! Rpg as well.  5,000 sees the Deluxe Book get the FATE Core Treatment.\nPledge tiers have been carefully constructed by our team of (kidnapped) scientists to maximize your kickstarter and project experience. Pledges of even a single dollar, immediately get the un-illustrated version of the book. At ten dollars, you get immediate access to the illustrated document as well as any stretch goals that are greenlit. Higher tiers can grab custom characters, games run by Dr. Comics, Jason Tondro, as well as even having a character of your design appear in the book. Please check the side for all tier info. \nOne of the greatest things about this project (aside from the fact that super villains everywhere haven't trained their destruct-o-rays on us yet) is that Jason is crafting a YOUniverse instead of a Universe. A comic book universe usually consists of characters and a world owned by a single company. Dr. Comics is looking to move away from that. The YOUniverse is crafted so that all of the characters funded through the Kickstarter will be released to the public domain, side by side with characters that are already there. In short, the YOUniverse belongs to you!\n From Steve Kenson (of Green Ronin and Ad Infinitum Adventures): Villains are a mainstay of superhero games: Who is going to challenge the heroes from week-to-week if not a reliable rogues gallery of villains? The Supervillain Handbook gives you enough ideas and archetypes for endless game-play and its discussion of classic villain archetypes is useful for all superhero games, beyond just Icons Superpowered Roleplaying. If superhero roleplaying games are your thing, then you want this book!\nFrom Chuck Rice of Mayfair Games (and previously of Vigilance Press and RPGObjects) Jason Tondro continues his amazing work of mixing a scholar's look at comics with great, ready-made NPCs for your ICONs games. This is his best work to date, focusing on the villains that oppose your plucky heroes. Every page is full of plot hooks and character ideas. This book will serve as a tremendous Game Master's reference through countless campaigns.\nThe BAMF Podcast hosts Jason and a round table of Villainous experts as we talk up things like the Super Villain Handbook", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile kickstarter can be a tricky way to produce a book of this type, Fainting Goat Games has teamed with HAZARD Studios to produce this project. Both production houses have run numerous kickstarters and have delivered. Fainting Goat games has produced such works as Stark City, the Great Game, and Improbable Tales, just to name a few. HAZARD has crafted SUPERS! Revised Edition as well as two issues of HEROIC, with their publishing partner Zenith Comics. Even with this in mind, there are always challenges and unforeseen occurrences which can hamper a project.\n\nSome of these challenges include: rival super villains fighting over their positions in the book, a minion drought, or a cosmic threat which slows down internet connectivity.

Having authored over a hundred articles and a dozen adventures for the AAW Blog, Justin Andrew Mason is now tackling a super-sized adventure module inspired by the viking sagas and ancient Norse mythology. \nThe arrival of the celestial event known as the Ohjaslange heralds the return of the dreaded J\u01ebtunn (ice giants) to the lands of Vikmordere. The valley is engulfed by an unnatural blizzard and unending frigid gale of the likes which none living have ever seen. A dark and evil curse has reawakened, after dormant centuries, to cloak the sun and bury the land beneath frost and snow.\nDirected by ancient Vikmordere legend, warriors and shieldmaidens from the many clans have gathered in the village of V\u00f6lsfiheimr on the shores of Serpent Lake to prepare for the upcoming battle. At stake is the very future of their people. As a horde of undying skeletal ice giants begin a long march down from a ruined mountaintop fortress, Vikmordere warriors in the valley resolve their mettle by singing lore of heroic bravery and ancient battles.\nWintery war is looming, and many echo the charge of ancient omens -- the time has come to seek out the lost artifacts of the legendary Jarl Vornig \u2013 for it was he who last quelled the ice giant uprising, felling the great ice giant king whilst wielding a divine sword and magic aegis. If these powerful artifacts cannot be rediscovered, and the power therein harnessed, the Vikmordere warriors stand little chance against the onslaught of the evil J\u01ebtunn.\nDespite the gathering of great warriors, the Ancestor Spirit seems to have other plans to secure the safety of the Vikmordere people... A group of outsiders has arrived at the Great Hall of V\u00f6lsfing upon the eve of battle. The strangers have been guided through the blinding blizzard by a mysterious fire-wreathed ember owl, and are unwittingly about to become epic heroes in a new saga.\nThe Vikmordere are wary of their new guests, yet submit to the will of their ancestors and acknowledge the omen of adventurer's arrival. The barbarian clans place their hopes into the hands of these enigmatic visitors who must now prepare to venture out into the wintery gale in search of the ancient Jarl's artifacts.\nInto the Wintery Gale is a super-sized adventure, and the book will have around 64 pages (likely expanding to 100+ pages depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked) with multiple simultaneous subplots to provide a wide sandbox for player characters to explore.\nAs an adventure that encompasses traversing across the terrain of the Vikmordere Valley during a blinding blizzard, sailing across the icy crag-laden Serpent Lake, and scaling the frozen mountain peaks of Ighdenholm, the book includes multiple dungeons to explore, several landmarks to discover, ancient puzzles and riddles, dozens of new monsters, magic items, and artifacts (and the devious traps securing them), an expanded random encounter selection, and a cast of non-player characters ranging from the proud Vikmordere people and their leaders to ancient godlike immortals and the ghost of an ancient warlord jarl.\nIn addition to an exciting multi-layered adventure, the book also contains in depth sections detailing the viking-themed culture of the Vikmoredere people. Everything from history, lore, tradition and mythology to social structure, clothing, tools, and food preparation are covered in enough detail to bring the barbarian clans to a vivid realism during the adventure.\nComplete stat blocks for more than a dozen new monsters designed specifically for the wintery gale and a slew of J\u01ebtunn ice giants (including berserkers, ice-weavers, whiteworm riders, and the J\u01ebtunn king himself).\nSpecial rules for traversing the wintery white, through the unending blizzard, and sailing across the frigid Serpent Lake, and an assortment of tools (both magical and mundane) to assist the adventurers in their expansive exploration of the Vikmordere Valley.\nNew spells and feats uniquely honed by the harsh environs of the wintery deep freeze and warrior clans of the Vikmordere.\nA plethora of new magic items including powerful artifacts such as the hero's receptacle, the divine sword known as Vilfberht, and the magical aegis called Skjold Rustning.\nDetailed statistics for godlike immortal beings steeped in ancient Vikmordere mythology; these beings come alive to interact with the adventurers and intervene at key points in the heroes' epic quest. \u2013 in Vikmordere the gods laugh, fight, and bleed just as mortals do.\nFour separate mapped dungeons to explore including the Vault of Skjold Rustning, the Vault of Vilfberht, The J\u01ebtunn Pass Outpost, and the Ruined Stronghold of Ighdenholm.\nThe Vikmordere Battlecry is the initiative to get the word out about Into the Wintery Gale Kickstarter.

Only a few hours after launching, Into The Wintery Gale is now fully funded! Many, many thanks for all your support! Such an exciting start! Now, the stretch goals begin to unlock as funding progresses. Keep spreading the word, and let's see how many of these expansions and additional backer rewards we can achieve!\nAchieved! When an adventurer is exposed to the wintery elements for a prolonged period, their core body temperature begins to drop and this will eventually lead to hypothermia and frostbite. If someone suffering from hypothermia is not properly treated, the hypothermia will progressively worsen. A multi-tier (and easy to use) system for managing the progression of a character's exposure to the wintery gale has now been added to the book!\nAchieved! Among the Vikmordere barbarians it is common practice to paint elaborate designs on faces and bodies when preparing for battle or raids. An art form usually reserved for shamans and witches, runepainting is a magical process that requires dedicated practice by skilled magic users. Each rune design is a unique magic item unto itself and imbues the wearer with the ability to wield powerful magic. New feats and associated rules for the painting of runes have now been added to the book!\nAchieved! Ten all new, level-appropriate creatures will be designed to wander through the frigid veil of snow and ice. A section complete with adventure hooks and detailing these new monsters will be added to the book.\nAchieved! Ten additional pieces of beautiful artwork depicting the chilling monsters added with the previous stretch goal have been added to the book!\nAchieved! The V\u00f6lva (shamans and seers) possess secret knowledge that is unknown to many outside the Vikmordere Valley. Optional rules for ancient battle-chants, fortunetelling, and casting stones-and-bones (runestones) will be added to the book!\nAchieved! A selection of brand new magic items honed for Vikmordere culture will be created. We will add a new artifact and three new minor, medium, and major magic items to the book.\nAchieved! The Maidens of Meyla Isle are evil ice fey who are normally forced to retreat to the glacial drifts and mountaintops during warmer months, but the arrival of the wintery gale has now coaxed the Maidens deeper into Vikmordere territory. As their frost-chilled touch begins to freeze the waters of the great Serpent Lake, their mischievous migration begins to wreak havoc upon all who cross their path. Might the icy maidens join forces with the risen J\u01ebtunn? A subplot side-quest involving the Maidens of Meyla Isle is now integrated into the adventure arc and added to the book!\nAchieved! Beautiful isometric maps by Finnish cartographer Tommi Salamaare now added to the book. These maps bring to life many of the locations central to the story.\nAchieved! An additional side-quest adventure has been added to the book!This will be a level-appropriate Vikmordere adventure that can be integrated into the main adventure or function as a stand-alone.\nAchieved! Another optional side-quest has been added to the book; this one with increased difficulty that will add an extreme challenge for the adventurers.\nAchieved! A final optional side-quest has been added to the book; this one introducing an all new location in the Vikmordere Valley with new monsters and magic items included.\nAchieved! We are having new cover art created. We are also adding additional backgrounds and layout elements to further enhance the brilliant look-and-feel of the book.\nBonus! We\u2019ve reached the $5k funding threshold, and as our way of saying, \u201cThanks!\u201d we have added this previously unannounced threshold bonus reward that will be made available to all backers.Thank you so much! We appreciate your continued support!\nDesigned for use with Hammerdog Games GM Screens (TWGS), these interchangeable charts and tables provide everything a Gamemaster needs to run Into the Wintery Gale; right at your fingertips! Available as a printable PDF, this collection of inserts not only cover quick-reference material for the overall adventure in the Vikmordere Valley, but specialized inserts for all included side-quest adventures as well.\nAchieved! A collection of five Vikmordere-themed mini dungeons suitable for use in tandem with Into the Wintery Gale or as stand-alone dungeon delves. These five mini dungeons are provided as PDFs to all backers who contribute $15 or more. In addition to being provided to backers in digital format, this mini dungeon set will also be available for purchase as beautifully colored, two-sided high-gloss 8x10 card-stock prints on DriveThruRPG.com.\nAchieved! A PDF containing a core set of 30 standard-sized printable random encounter cards (plus 1 additional random encounter card for each backer at the $49 Vikmordere Seer pledge level) for use with Into the Wintery Gale (or any other winter-themed Pathfinder adventure for level 10 characters) is going to be provided to all backers of any level. In addition to being provided to all backers in digital format, this collection will also be available for purchase as a printed deck on DriveThruRPG.com. \nAchieved! High resolution digital maps and graphical tokens to represent monsters and items from Into the Wintery Gale and associated side-quests. These resources are the perfect complement to any online adventure (or simply as a resource for the GM to print or reference at the tabletop), and can be used by backers to build their own mods for VTT platforms such as Roll20, Fantasy Grounds II, and 3D Virtual Tabletop. This digital resource pack contains only graphic resources and is not an adventure mod prepared for use on a VTT platform. It will be provided to all backers who pledged $15 or more.\nAchieved! The primary story arc of Into the Wintery Gale focuses on the player character\u2019s thwarting the devious plans of the J\u01ebtunn. But, what if they fail and are forced to face the full brunt of the skeletal ice giant hoard? The Battle of Ighdenholm is an alternate conclusion to the adventure that utilizes the rules for mass combat to pit the united clans of the Vikmordere people against the full force of the returned J\u01ebtunn. Guided by the Northern Fury Council, the adventurers will command bands of Vikmordere warriors and shieldmaidens as they rush alongside them into a final glorious battle to determine the fate of the Vikmordere Valley!\nAchieved! The collection of monsters roaming through the wintery gale is expanded to a total of 30 unique creatures, and becomes a standalone book. Additional chapters in the bestiary book include common Vikmordere beasts of burden, familiars, and animal companions. This book is provided in digital format as a PDF to all backers who pledged $15 or more. The Vikmordere Bestiary book will be available for purchase in softback print after the release of the PDF, and its estimated delivery date is Dec 2015.\nAchieved! The collection of Vikmordere magic items and artifacts is vastly expanded and becomes a standalone book of more than 30 unique magic items and artifacts (and even a couple of cursed trinkets to boot). Additional chapters in the treasury book provide unique charts and lists to help create regionally themed treasures including new gemstones, specific art items that might be found in the Vikmordere Valley. This book is provided in digital format as a PDF to all backers who pledged $15 or more. The Vikmordere Treasury book will be available for purchase in softback print after the release of the PDF, and its estimated delivery date is Dec 2015.\nClarification on content: We have had several comments, private messages and posts on social media inquiring about what \u201cexpanded content\u201d means in relation to the Bestiary and Treasury books achieved with the $8K and $10K stretch goals. We would like to clarify the following points: All content found in both sister books, Winter\u2019s Roar and Raider\u2019s Haul, is allnew content. The monsters and magic items contained within these two additional books are not found in the main adventure book. Any monsters or magic items that were a part of the main adventure book before expanding the content into the new books will remain in the original adventure book. None of this content is being moved from one book to another or being duplicated in multiple books. The reason for creating the two additional books is that we wanted to expand (create new) monsters and magic items that would have otherwise taken up too much space in the adventure book for a viable print-copy page count. Rather than limiting our creativity to the viable print-copy page count of the original adventure book, we chose to keep creating new features for backers by putting the new expanded content into additional books and providing those books in digital format to all backers who are receiving a PDF or print version of the original adventure book. After the additional books containing the expanded content are released to backers in PDF format, those books will also be made available for purchase in print for any who would like to have physical print copies.\nBonus! We\u2019ve reached the $10k funding threshold, and as our way of saying, \u201cThanks, again!\u201d we have added this previously unannounced threshold bonus reward that will be made available for all backers. Thank you so much for your continued support! You all are unstoppable! Designed for use with Hammerdog Games GM Screens (TWGS), our $5k threshold bonus provided you with interchangeable inserts to help with running the Into the Wintery Gale adventure and optional side quests. Well, we return to the GM Screen with our $10k threshold bonus, but on the flipside. Continuous 4-panel full-color artwork in a genre-appropriate style will immerse your players into the Vikmordere setting while they wonder what devious deeds you may be preparing for them behind the screen. Available as a PDF, these panels can be printed and directly inserted into the four transparent flaps on the other side of the TWGS GM Screen.\nAchieved! The Vikmordere Primer & Player\u2019s Guide is a comprehensive introduction to the Vikmordere region and the people who dwell within. The book is focused on topics that would be of general interest to those playing a Vikmordere character or whose character may be traveling through the Vikmordere Valley, but it is immensely useful as a resource for Game masters as well. Each section of the guide provides a detailed overview of various topics including landmarks, climate, ecology, astrology, history, culture, mythology, and more. The book also provides new class archetypes and advanced classes for players to enjoy. When project funding reaches this amount, all backers who pledged $15 or more will receive a digital PDF copy of this book. The book will also be available to purchase in print after the digital release. Its estimated delivery date is Dec 2015.\nAchieved! A lot of expanded content has been added to Into the Wintery Gale by unlocking various stretch goals. At this funding level, even more custom art is created by our masterful and professional artists to make sure the expanded content is accompanied by as much unique artwork as the primary adventure content. The additional art expansion ensures that the entire collection of books are beautiful, top-notch productions just like the main adventure book.      \nAchieved!We will convert Into the Wintery Gale into a fully loaded Pathfinder RPG Fantasy Grounds module for use on the popular virtual tabletop. Maps, tokens, images, and the adventure itself will be included and ready for you to run with your gaming group!\nThis reward will be provided to backers at the $15 pledge level and above.\nFantasy Grounds is the premiere virtual tabletop program and was recently announced as the only company licensed to produce official VTT conversions of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition RPG products and adventures by Wizards of the Coast.\nInto the Wintery Gale Hero Lab files will be produced when we reach this goal and provided to all backers at the $15 pledge level and above. The files will be coded by the same individual who converts all the Pathfinder bestiaries for Paizo so high quality is guaranteed.\nThe shipping cost for all pledge levels receiving a copy of the printed book is $6 in the United States or $20 everywhere else in the world.\nTo help cut shipping costs, we will be fulfilling rewards via DriveThru (see the graphic below):\nMusic:\nFor Honor, For Glory\nby Avery Shen", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor the sake of transparency: AAW Games is still in the process of finishing up and printing/shipping our \"Snow White\" Pathfinder RPG Kickstarter project, which has now progressed to the editing phase.

Take your game westward with unique races, new classes, archetypes, gear, and western monsters, all perfect for a rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 steampunk wild west adventure. The base funding will produce a premium quality, 230-page PDF and print version chock full of Steampunk Wild West goodness.   \nPure Steam:\nOur previous Kickstarter campaign brought Pure Steam to life. Pure Steam is an alternate history campaign setting which takes place in the age of steam. It presented two new base classes, the Gearhead, a tech 'wizard' whose contraptions can bring the power of science to bear; and the Chaplain, whose force of charisma can bolster allies and stifle foes. \nPure Steam presented new steam-themed equipment, weapons, vehicles, and monsters. It has truly become the definitive steampunk supplement for pathfinder. But it\u2019s time to head west.\nNew Stuff:\nIn Westbound, you get everything you need to expand your game to the West.\nNew base classes like:\nThe Marshal, a lawkeeper whose jurisdiction grows with his renown.\nThe Savant, an intuitive contraption builder (think tech 'sorcerer')\nWild West archetypes such as:\nThe Wrangler, who can outrope, outride, and outgun her foes\nThe Gaucho, crazy enough to bring a knife to a gunfight\nThe Gun Devotee, a gun-slinging monk who uses ki for deeds\nThere is expanded support for the Chaplain and Gearhead, like:\nNew Chaplain organizations\nNew Gearhead archetypes like the Arsenalist\nClockwork schematics - expanding your contraption capabilities with options like delayed activation and self-propulsion.\nA bevy of new monsters like the sand troll, the loch satyr, and the eternal soul, all with stunning art.\nNew vehicles to span the desert, like the skiff and the ornithopter.\nWe\u2019ve got a new gameplay soundtrack, too, to evoke the feel of the Ulleran West!\nPremium Quality\nWhat really sets Pure Steam and Westbound apart as a third-party offering is the quality. We\u2019ve got a great team, including dynamite designers and writers, as well as artists--even down to our printer. \nJust like it's predecessor, Westbound is fully compatible with Pathfinder RPG. The book has new races, classes, archetypes, equipment, monsters, factions, NPCs, and tons more!\nWestbound will be at (and above) the same high quality mark we set with our first book, The Pure Steam Campaign Setting, which: \n-has 4.5 stars across virtually every rating site available. \n-is compared to Paizo-level quality in terms of content and production.\n-is a SILVER best seller on DriveThruRPG!\n-is THE definitive steampunk offering for Pathfinder RPG.\nWhy Back Westbound?\nWe have some great rewards for our backers, with benefits you won't get if you wait. For example, our PDF will launch at $20 retail, but backers can get a PDF for as low a pledge as $15, and that PDF will be delivered to backers well before it's commercially available. The same is true for the print copy, which you can snag for as low a pledge as $35 and ship to backers ahead of commercial release, and will retail for $40.\nOf course, there are plenty of great rewards for folks who want to make an impression on the game. You can help design a faction in the game, or be made into a character or deity with artwork, stats, and story.

And then the Empire goes silent. Unlocks when funding reaches $200,000.\nShadow of the Demon Lord is a roleplaying game of dark fantasy\u2014a genre that weaves elements of horror into a fantasy world. In the game, you create and play characters struggling to survive in a land sliding toward oblivion, a place infested by demons, roaming mobs of undead, strange magic, unhinged cultists, and all in the ruins of the last great empire of mankind. If you love Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, the Ravenloft and Midnight settings, Joe Abercrombie\u2019s The First Law series, Glen Cook\u2019s Black Company books, or heavy metal music, then this is the game is for you.\nThe game takes place in a world standing on the brink of the apocalypse.  What is the cause? Who is responsible? The Demon Lord, of course! This being of staggering power and boundless evil authors the catastrophes blighting the landscape. Each new horror released reflects the Demon Lord's approach, the touch of its shadow, and its growing hunger for not only the planet but the entirety of all things. Although near, the Demon Lord remains outside the cosmos, rattling the cage of its prison as it strains to escape the Void to visit catastrophic destruction to your world.\nThe apocalyptic tone is on a dial. If you don\u2019t want to blow everything up right away, tune it down low and the game plays fine as a less perilous, dark fantasy roleplaying game. But if you are inclined to crank up the volume, the game provides several catastrophic templates you can use to model how the world is falling apart. These templates represent the Shadow of the Demon Lord; wherever the Shadow falls, chaos and upheaval are born. The Shadow might loose global pandemics, famines, droughts, earthquakes, demon princes to stomp across the countryside, the living dead, and other world-spanning disasters and threats.\nThe game system helps you tell interesting and exciting stories. To make this happen, the game system is easy to learn, plays fast, and requires little preparation to play. All these ensure both novice and veteran players can enjoy the game together. Here are a few ways the game met its goals:\nEasy to Learn: The GM decides if a character\u2019s action happens, doesn\u2019t happen, or might happen. If it might happen, a roll of the die determines the outcome. You use the core mechanic to resolve any task, whether you're punching a demon in the face, trying to kick down a door to get away from that demon, or dodge the vomit it spews from its mouth.\nYour character develops with the story. Each time your group completes an adventure, the group's level increases. Each increase adds cool stuff to your character. You might learn spells, a trick with a weapon, or some thing else that might help you survive. All benefits you gain come from the paths your character follows. The first adventure you play through helps you decide the first path you will choose. If you spend a lot of time fighting, you might become a warrior. If you cast a spell from a tome bound in human skin and barbwire, you might become a magician. At higher group levels, you choose additional paths that might extend previous choices or take your character in all new directions. You can choose any path you like so you can play the character you want to play.\nPlays Fast: Stories (adventures) are playable in one game session lasting from 3 to 5 hours. Stories are short, covering about one page per hour of expected play. You can also complete a typical campaign (a string of 11 connected adventures) in 11 game sessions. The core book has rules for playing characters up to level 10. This means that if you meet once a week for a 4-hour session each time, you can complete your campaign in about two months. That\u2019s six campaigns a year!\nThe benefit of short campaigns is that the game lets you tell more stories, create more characters, and experience more of the game's options. As a player, you\u2019re not locked into one character for one year or longer. You can have several. And, as a Game Master, it is possible to run a complete campaign in a compressed time span. Best of all, the campaign brevity gives other interested members of the group a chance to become the  Game Master.\nLittle Preparation: You can make a starting character in about 5 minutes. You make one big choice, note the information on your character sheet, and you\u2019re ready to go. And a Game Master can prepare for a game in the time it takes to read a couple of pages of text. \nIf you'd like more information about the game design, please visit schwalbentertainment.com. There, you\u2019ll find news about the game, design diaries, and much more! \nThe game\u2019s complete and ready to move into production. I spent most of 2014 writing, designing, testing, developing, and putting the game in front of hundreds of people. Now I need your help getting Shadow of the Demon Lord into the hands of my editors and then into layout, through printing, and onto your gaming table. It\u2019s ready, but I need your help to make it happen. Backing this campaign will make Shadow of the Demon Lord a reality.

To help the campaign gain achievements, post pics, videos, and other neat stuff on the Schwalb Entertainment Facebook page. Make sure you tag your contributions with #SOTDLKS!\nFollowing Monte Cook Games' lead, we\u2019re not locking you into a single shipping method. Instead, we're offering you some options. All print books include a shipping allowance. This amount covers basic shipping in the United States. So if you\u2019re good with basic shipping, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay a penny more.\nYou can, however, choose a different option. When it\u2019s time to ship your rewards, we\u2019ll ask you how you want your book(s) shipped. You\u2019ll be able to choose a faster or more trackable method, though it will likely cost more. If your shipping allowance doesn\u2019t cover it, you can pay the difference at that time.\nInternational backers have the same options, but the final cost of even basic shipping will require additional payment. As with domestic backers, you choose your shipping method, apply the credit, and cover the difference.\nI'm using Backerkit to manage fulfillment. So if you choose print options, you will get information from them about selecting your rewards when the Kickstarter wraps.\nIf you have surplus bucks from your shipping credit, you\u2019ll be able to apply the remainder to anything else you\u2019d like from the Demon Lord store.\nLast, the estimated delivery date is for the Shadow of the Demon Lord game. Some rewards might come earlier, and some will arrive later.\nAVATARS!\nYou can also help spread the word by grabbing one of these awesome images and using it as your profile pic (and driver's license pic)!\nSpecial thanks to Matt Marson and Larry Howe for filming and assembling the video, Trey Call of Dirty Proper for the music, Dan Heinrich and Andrew Follett for the character sheet, Elizabeth Peterson for the logo, Patrick Parker and Chris Sims for graphics, Hal Mangold for layout, Jared von Hindman for the achievements art, Ivan Dixon and Svetoslav Petrov for the amazing art, and everyone else who helped get this campaign up and running!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI waited to launch this Kickstarter until the game was written for a reason. I am cautious. I didn\u2019t want tragedy, writer\u2019s block, being hit by an asteroid impact, madness, or corruption to interfere with the design. Since I'm here and giving you a chance to pre-order this sexy game, this means the game is written, tested, and ready to go into the final stages of production. These stages include editing, layout, art acquisition, printing, and shipping the printed products into distribution. Though I am using the very best people in the business and I am confident we'll sail through these stages laughing all the way, things happen. To mitigate the risks, I have backup people in place just in case an editor gets sucked into a black hole or an artist decides to change careers mid-way through the project.\n\nThe biggest challenge is fulfillment. The difficulty fulfilling the Kickstarter rewards increases with its size. I will handle shipping the rulebooks to backers with the help of my dear friends and family. Digital products will be available as soon as they\u2019re done. And if we unlock additional print products via stretch goals, they\u2019ll be out as soon as we get them done. \n\nBefore launching this Kickstarter campaign, I received a physical and discovered that I am in fine health and in no danger of succumbing to natural causes between now and the end of the year.

Thanks to the support of the Greenlight community, we'll be releasing the game through Steam!\nIn the game, you are captain of the Indestructible II, flagship vessel of Galaxy Force. Your mission: to explore and survive the dangerous and enigmatic Orion Trail. With the help of your trusty officers, ship, and crew, your success is ensured.\nProbably.\nLike what you've seen so far? Keep reading! If words and pretty pictures aren't your thing, you could also play the prototype we made. We're not picky.\nTry the game before you back it!\nPC GAMER: \"Hey, space is a dangerous place, and never more so than when you're on the Orion Trail.\"\nPixel Dynamo: \"With sharp pixel graphics, a tough learning curve, and a world infused with humor, Orion Trail looks to be an intriguing blend of homage and innovation\"\nindiemag.fr: \"ORION TRAIL, VERS L'INFINI ET AU DEL\u00c0 !\" (ORION TRAIL TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!)\nPixel Tom: \u201cOrion Trail is fun and fast, with a massive chunk of replayability value and plenty of room for expansion...\u201d\nOrion Trail\u2019s gameplay centers around making the tough calls that only you, a starship captain, can make. The galaxy is full of strange, stupid, and terrifying things, and you\u2019ll need to make the decisions that ensure the survival of your crew. Well, most of your crew.\n\"....aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaa.....\"\nEach journey, you\u2019ll pick your captain, officers, and equipment. Each pick will give you a leg up when dealing with an encounter in specific ways.\nHowever, you can't apply all strategies to every situation. Sure, you could stock up on guns and aggressive officers to crush your enemies, but you'll be in trouble when you need to host that alien dinner party.\nLet's see you weasel your way out of this one.\nStarships don\u2019t run on good intentions alone (not the ones you can afford, anyway). Each decision you make will increase or decrease the resources that keep your ship functioning. Run out of any, and you\u2019ll be in deep (space) trouble.\nBefore you begin your voyage, it's important to know that bad stuff can (and will) happen. For example, an unexpected Singularity Fissure could open up in the Deck 12 Latrines, making for an unpleasant bathroom break. Maybe someone could accidentally leave an airlock open as you jump to light-speed, making the inside part of the ship the outside part. Or, your Away Team could inadvertently incur the wrath of a Grobulous Rex while exploring an alien jungle. We're not sure what will happen with that last one, but it's probably not good.\n\nThe point is, no matter how prepared and vigilant a Captain is, the cosmic chaos of the Orion Trail can end a voyage in the disastrous blink of an eye (or four). \n\nBut that\u2019s okay! Orion Trail, by design, is kinda difficult. We want your successful voyage to mean something, so the universe will be conspiring against you every step of the way. Basically, don\u2019t be surprised to see something like this during your first few playthroughs:\n\nTrust us, you really don't want space dysentery.\nTo keep you on your toes (and to keep things fresh), there\u2019s a healthy dose of the unexpected thrown into each adventure. There are over 50 encounters for you to discover, and each one has a variety of decisions that can change based on your current situation.\n\nDon't count on seeing the same choices every time.\nLikewise, while you may steadfastly order your crew to fire all neutron torpedos at the Bul\u2019war Gigabeast closing in on your ship, things may not play out the way you expect. Actions have a range of outcomes that may pleasantly reward or vehemently punish you. Accrue bonuses from your crew and equipment to increase the chance of a successful die roll.\n\nIn the cold heart of space, there are no guarantees.\nSTILL NOT SURE IF YOU'D LIKE THE GAME?\nClick the red button to fulfill your wildest dreams!\nIf you had a chance to play the prototype, you may be wondering \u201cWait, is that it? Do they plan on doing more?\u201d to which we\u2019d reply \u201cGreat questions! No, and yes.\u201d in that order.\nWe think that the prototype is a kernel of something that could be really great, but there are many improvements to make. We\u2019ve done a lot of discussing, late-night thinking, and planning for how we\u2019d improve the game, which we used to arrive at our $90,000 ask to you guys.\nTo give you a sense of how we plan on expanding the game (before stretch goals), here\u2019s a list of changes and improvements we\u2019ll be making to the game.\nMore Content\nThe current prototype has just a fraction of the content we want to have in the game, and we\u2019ve learned a lot about what makes a fun encounter vs. a frustratingly random one.\nDynamic Encounters\nWe want the encounters to react a little more to your previous choices and current circumstances. Certain encounters may have special, and otherwise hidden, options be revealed if you have the right Captain, Officer, or Technology equipped. This adds some fun (and unexpected) twists to your playthrough.\nMore Art\nIf you can\u2019t tell, we love the art style of the game, and we want it to be everywhere. We also want your choices to be visually reflected in more areas of the game, so our current plan is to have the Captains and Officers you pick actually show up on the bridge, along with Away Missions.\nAway Missions\nCurrently in the prototype, we only have encounters that take place in the celestial heavens. In the full game, we plan to have a second type called Away Missions, where you pick an officer and a gaggle of redshirts to beam down to a planet, enemy ship, or other space-thing and embark on a longer set of mini-encounters.\nDuring a foray, your Away Team could suffer mishaps and poor judgement (resulting in a hapless Redshirt biting the dust).  Your redshirts will basically act as the Officer\u2019s health, so it\u2019s up to you whether you want to keep pressing your luck for that ancient alien artifact, or risk losing the entire Away Team (including the Officer)!\n\"I think this is going pretty well...\"\nBetter Feedback for Encounter Results\nA big part of the game is picking an option and finding out how well you performed at your attempt. Right now, we\u2019re not doing a great job at the latter, so we have plans to better inform you whether that 7 you got was good or bad.\nOur soundtrack will feature 12 new songs made by the one and only Rainbow Kitten, an extra-dimensional being of immense power and rhythm. They created the soundtrack for Enemy Mind, and we're excited to go on another space adventure with them. Take a listen to some tracks from our prototype:\nThe music was made with the SID emulation engine on an Elektron Monomachine. You'll recognize the SID's distinctive sound from your fondest memories of gaming on a C64 back in the day.\n(From Left to Right)\nSchell Games (@schellgames) is, well, us. We\u2019ve done a lot of game development for clients, and have launched a few of our own internal projects. Orion Trail came out of a week-long game jam that Schell Games hosts every year, and everyone at the studio is excited to see the game become a reality. \nJesse Schell (@jesseschell) is our fearless leader and the head honcho of Schell Games. You may recognize his name from some awesome game design books, or perhaps some talks. When we brought Jesse this idea, he shook his head in despair. We took that as a yes!\nDave Bennett (@davebbennett) is the designer who came up with the general concept of the game. He was one of the writers for Puzzle Clubhouse, and likes space games a little too much. You can blame him whenever you feel like your inevitable death was unfair.\nEvan Brown (@etb342) was the artist who laid down the proto-pixels of the earliest concepts of the game. He worked on one of our other internal projects, Enemy Mind, which has a whole bunch of awesome pixel art. Basically, he\u2019s responsible for setting the style and tone of all of the art in the game.\nWithout your help, we won\u2019t have enough funding to make Orion Trail the game we hope it could become. Kickstarter also gives you, our backers, a platform to help steer the course of development in a meaningful way.\nThe money raised by this Kickstarter will be used to fund the rest of the team. We'll staff up with additional programmers, artists, writers, QA, a sound person, and a producer to make sure we make the game in a reasonable amount of time.\nHere's a breakdown of where the money will be put to use:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo game development is fraught with the unexpected, and things can often take longer than planned.

Further updates on the project can be found at www.dropdeadstudios.com, where we'll be making announcements, holding forum discussions, and letting everyone know the state of the project as it moves forward.\nSkybourne is a broken world of high adventure that borrows as much from Firefly as the Forgotten Realms. In Skybourne, teams of adventurers seek out the remains of long-dead civilizations while doing everything they can to keep their airship fixed and fueled. In Skybourne, displaced dragons, sentient plants and Aasimar kings all do battle to carve out their piece of a new world order, and any ship crew can traverse the planes in search of glory if they have the guts and the equipment to make the trip.\nThe World of Skybourne\nSkybourne is an adventure setting that takes place at the close of one era and the beginning of another.\nWhen the great forest grew, it destroyed everything that had come before it. Millennia of civilization was irrevocably lost as the entire surface world was consumed. Some fled underground or to the ocean, finding refuge in the kingdoms of the drow or the merfolk. Some fled to the mountain tops, the deserts and the frozen wastelands, finding refuge in terrain where not even the forest could grow. Some even fled across planar boundaries, huddling as refugees in strange and foreign worlds. And others took to the skies, transplanting towns, cities, and kingdoms to the clouds where not even the forest could reach.\nSkybourne is a world where adventurers are the first and last line of defense of a host of emerging cultures, where the battles of Law and Chaos are just as important as the battles of Good and Evil in the fight to control the world's destiny, and where whole worlds' worth of lost wonders wait to be found.\nIn Skybourne, the old world has passed, and the new world belongs to whoever has the strength to take it.\nThe purpose of this kickstarter is to fund the first three books in the Skybourne line: Andrus: The City of Men, Woodfaring Adventures, and The Player\u2019s Guide to Skybourne.\nAndrus: The City of Men: Andrus is the last great city of the planet's surface. Founded in a crater not even the forest could claim, creatures the world over travel to Andrus to discuss their discoveries and seek their fortunes. Demon lords, dragon riders, merfolk traders, sentient plant creatures; anything and everything finds its way to Andrus eventually, and a thousand clans, cultures, and factions are constantly locked in battle for control over this last, great holdout of a bygone world.\nWoodfaring Adventures: This book details the dangers of the forest and the treasures lurking within. From the relative safety of the treetops, to the dangers of the forest floor, to the inexpressible horror of the cryptwoods, this book details monsters, dungeons, and everything else a team of adventurers might encounter as they explore a dangerous new world.\nThe Player\u2019s Guide to Skybourne: The Player\u2019s Guide to Skybourne details airships and vehicles, new skill uses and player options, adventuring equipment, and everything else an adventurer needs to make their way through the world of Skybourne. With both completely new options and expanded and updated versions of some of our previous content, The Player's Guide to Skybourne details a host of player options for spicing up any campaign.\nEach of these books can be used to begin exploring the Skybourne world, or may be easily adapted and applied to a host of other fantasy worlds, plotlines, and adventures.\nStretch Goals\nNow that we have passed our initial funding goal, it's time for stretch goals!\n Add-Ons\nThe following add-ons are available for Skybourne, and more will become available as stretch goals are met. If you\u2019d like any of the following, just increase your pledge by the indicated amount without increasing your pledge level.\nSpheres of Power: $45 hardcover, $35 softcover (both include PDF), $15 PDF alone.\nThis book produced by our last kickstarter details a completely new magic system for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Spheres of Power replaces the entire Vancian tradition with an easily-customizable system for magic that not only allows for customization of casters, but also of the very way magic works in a setting or campaign.\nWizard's Academy: $40 hardcover (Includes PDF), $15 PDF alone.\nThis combination adventure module/bestiary is designed for use with the Spheres of Power system, and details both old favorites and unique creatures converted for the Spheres of Power system.\nShips of Skybourne: $25 print (Includes PDF), $10 PDF alone.\nThis book greatly expands on the airship rules found in the Player's Guide to Skybourne, including expanded airship customization and combat rules, designing your own airship from the ground up, new flying races, and more options to make the most out of your airship adventures.\nExtra print copy of Player's Guide to Skybourne: $25\nExtra Player's Guide to Skybourne PDF: $10\nExtra print copy of Andrus: The City of Men: $25\nExtra Andrus: The City of Men PDF: $10\nExtra print copy of Woodfaring Adventures: $25\nExtra Woodfaring Adventures PDF: $10\nCanvas Map of Andrus: $25\nThis 27x18 in. map of the city is done in a hand-drawn style and is printed on high-quality canvas, making it very durable and perfect for whatever your gaming needs.\nCharacter Write-up: $40\nWith this add-on, you may create a character to be added to the Skybourne mythos, stat'ed out and included in one Skybourne volume (as appropriate for the character) and appearing in future volumes and stories about the Skybourne universe.\nWe've got a variety of ways to say thank you for helping us make this project a reality:\nFollower: $1 pledge\nPerfect for those who want to follow the project before deciding how much to pledge.\nFledgling: $10 pledge\nGain any one of the following PDFs: Andrus: The City of Men, Woodfaring Adventures, or The Player's Guide to Skybourne.\nDelver: $25 pledge\nGain all three of the following PDFs: Andrus: The City of Men, Woodfaring Adventures, and The Player's Guide to Skybourne.\nAdventurer: $35 pledge\nGain all four of the following PDFs: Andrus: The City of Men, Woodfaring Adventures, The Player's Guide to Skybourne, and Ships of Skybourne.\nBackers of this level and above may pitch ideas, participate in surveys, and will actively help shape the future of the Skybourne line.\nHero: $75 pledge\nGain all three of the following PDFs and physical books: Andrus: The City of Men, Woodfaring Adventures, and The Player's Guide to Skybourne.\nPDF of Ships of Skybourne.\nBackers of this level and above may pitch ideas, participate in surveys, and will actively help shape the future of the Skybourne line.\nUltimate Collector: $100 pledge\nGain all four of the following PDFs and physical books: Andrus: The City of Men, Woodfaring Adventures, The Player's Guide to Skybourne, and Ships of Skybourne. \nBackers of this level and above may pitch ideas, participate in surveys, and will actively help shape the future of the Skybourne line.\nGain a 27x18 map of Andrus printed on high-quality canvas.\nVeteran Hero: $125 pledge\nGain all four of the following PDFs and physical books: Andrus: The City of Men, Woodfaring Adventures, The Player's Guide to Skybourne, and Ships of Skybourne.\nBackers of this level and above may pitch ideas, participate in surveys, and will actively help shape the future of the Skybourne line.\nOur artists will create one illustration of your choice for the Skybourne line, and we will send you a copy!

Click the banner above to see a limited group of reward levels you can still get in on until March 13th!\nWe're back!\nThe team that brought you the award-winning Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director\u2019s Cut is back with an all new, full length standalone cyberpunk tactical cRPG set in Shadowrun's magically Awakened Hong Kong of 2056.\nHONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale.\nThe lure of a quick payday draws you from Seattle into the neon glow of Victoria Harbor\u2026 and into a corporate conspiracy nearly thirty years in the making. A terrifying threat looms on the horizon - a supernatural force that corrupts and consumes everything it touches. Dragged into the shadows of Kowloon City, you will need to forge new connections and gain \"face\" to survive.\nHong Kong contains fantastic elements for a new Shadowrun setting: an underworld of triads, tongs, and gangs to navigate, wild magic to harness, and bleeding edge cybertech to equip. Plus, Hong Kong\u2019s culture is steeped in \"guanxi\" - a network of influence and relationships based upon a combination of social status, and prestige. All of these elements add up to a great new setting for running the shadows.\nShadowrun: Hong Kong has everything you expect from a Harebrained Schemes Shadowrun game: strong storytelling and sharp writing, lots of morally gray choices, a crew of memorable characters with distinct personalities, challenging tactical turn-based combat, a robust character creation system, and a one of a kind cyberpunk-meets-magic game setting that\u2019s endured for over 25 years. \nOur Backers voted for Hong Kong as the next city for us to bring to life and we\u2019re excited to be working on it! \nYour New Crew\nJust as in Dragonfall, our Hong Kong story will feature a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that can only happen in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. \nAnd, as introduced in Dragonfall, you'll be able to guide your crew's advancement by choosing special abilities on their Growth Tracks to complement the choices you make for your own character. \nGobbet is an ork street shaman and a follower of Rat. Her devotion to her totem has granted her unique abilities to control the battlefield, trapping her enemies behind barriers of coruscating magic and herding them with clouds of blistering poison.\nTerritoriality Track: Focuses on battlefield control by buffing Gobbet\u2019s barrier spells (increasing damage, increasing the number of tiles affected) and planting AOE damage spells, such as Toxic Fog. She also gains the ability to destroy or consume summoned spirits, eliminating threats from enemy shamans.\nSpiritualist Track: This track focuses on improving Gobbet\u2019s control over summoned spirits. She can reduce the chance that they slip out of her control, and even seize control of hostile spirits summoned by her enemies. Progressing down this track turns Gobbet into a versatile and powerful summoner.\nWu is a veteran security expert with years of sprawl-site combat experience. He has the muscle and the weaponry to either beat his targets into submission or to break them outright, depending on the demands of the situation.\n\nCrowd Control Track: Focuses on a variety of non-lethal attacks that inflict stun (-AP) effects. Progressing down this track unlocks a shock baton, tear gas grenades, and zip ties to subdue stunned enemies.\n  Lethal Force Track: Focuses on inflicting lethal ranged damage. Progressing down this track gives Wu attack abilities such as Mercy Kill, which does additional damage and has a higher to-hit percentage on targets who are close to death.\n\nIs0bel is a dwarf decker with the tools and the expertise to clear her own way to a target mainframe. Trained for combat by a cabal of hacktivists, she\u2019s as deadly in meat-space as she is in the Matrix.\n\nEspionage Track: Increases Is0bel\u2019s decking skills and her Mark Target ability. Progressing down this tree unlocks new custom programs/abilities for use in the Matrix, as well as custom Expert System Programs (ESPs).\n\nSabotage Track: Is0bel carries a sniper rifle for meat-space skirmishes. Her arsenal also includes proximity mines that she can use to create traps for her enemies. This track increases and adds to the effects caused by these weapons, unlocking higher-yield explosives and Flechettes that strip armor from enemies.\n\nWith your generous support, we're adding Racter to your crew!\nRacter is a highly specialized roboticist-turned-rigger who fights with the aid of \u201cKoschei,\u201d his custom walker-form drone. He also carries an engineering toolkit that he can use to repair Koschei and enhance its abilities during combat.\nMangler Track: Makes Koschei into a melee-ranged wrecking machine. Progressing down this track unlocks movement boosts for the drone and bolts close combat weapons onto its chassis, such as rotary saws and clawed feet. These attachments unlock new close combat attacks for the drone.\nPredator Track: Turns Koschei into a walking artillery piece. Progressing down this track bolts new ranged weapons to the drone, such as an auto-shotgun or a grenade launcher.\n\nWith your generous support, we were able to add Gaichu to your crew! And don't forget, now that Racter and Gaichu are unlocked, their COLLECTIBLE FIGURES have been added to THE TALISMONGER Reward Level!\nThanks to his elite Red Samurai training, Gaich\u00fb has access to close combat abilities that are inaccessible to other characters. These take the form of stance-based katana attacks that flow together in sequence, each of which has its own unique animation.\n\nRed Samurai Track: A mixture of offense and defense. Includes additional sword attacks, such as a coup de grace that can be used to dispatch stunned targets. Gaich\u00fb also gains self-buffs that can temporarily boost his armor, or give him the effects of cover when standing in the open.  \n\nGhoul Track: HMHVV infection has its advantages. This track includes a bite attack that inflicts damage and heals Gaich\u00fb, and claw and spit attacks that inflict damage and cause debuffs on enemies.\n\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong contains all the features of Shadowrun Returns and builds upon the engine and gameplay upgrades we added to Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut (including the ability to save your game anywhere). \nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: The Shadowrun series hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart 12+ hour non-linear story with a diverse cast of all-too-(meta)human characters. (Some funding goals will add more hours of gameplay.)\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. \nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions. Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities.\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. \nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\nPowerful Game Editor: Create Your Own Stories! With the Shadowrun Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns. No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor. Our new Hong Kong setting will add tons of new weapons, spells, characters along with oodles of new tiles to the long list of editor assets from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut!\nSoundtrack\nThe music for Shadowrun: Hong Kong will be composed by fan-favorite Jon Everist, composer of the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall -Director's Cut. Here's an example of Jon's work:\nPC Only Release\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is being developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems only. We have elected to focus all our efforts on PC in order to deliver the best game we can without the current processing and memory limitations of tablets. This focus allows us to have higher-fidelity visuals, larger map sizes, and more stuff on screen.\nBecause we want to do more.\nWe're totally committed to making Shadowrun: Hong Kong and we're already several months into development. The project is budgeted, fully staffed, and on-schedule for a mid-2015 release. We also have a story we're really excited about. At our current budget, it's going to be 12+ hours long and at the quality level of Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.\nBut this is Harebrained Schemes and, as always, we have more ideas than we have budget. \nThat's where you come in.\nBy backing the project, you'll increase our production budget and get more features, more improvements, and more game. Take a look at the funding goals below to see all the stuff we want to add.\nNow, we could always talk to traditional publishing partners, but we\u2019re pretty independent-minded around here and we only want to serve one master - our audience. \nWe're gonna ship a great game and it can be even greater with your help. Our last adventure together was a blast and we think the results speak for themselves. So help co-fund our third Shadowrun game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and let's make the best Shadowrun game yet!\n$100,000 - Enhanced Player Controls! In addition to all the new Tech, Magic, Weapons, Consumables, Creatures, and Enemies we're already planning, if we reach our initial funding goal, we\u2019ll add a bunch of interface upgrades. These include the ability to decide which team member picks up an item in free-move mode, item swapping between party members, a player-initiated turn-mode toggle so you can position your team before you enter combat, and a spread-range indicator for shotguns and sweeping melee attacks.\n$150,000 - Animatic Scene Transitions! These are short animated slide shows with voice narration that play at key points in the story - the opening, end of Act 1, end of Act 2, and at the end. \n$200,000 - Racter joins your team of runners! Racter is a Russian rigger with a wry smile who relates better to his custom drone than he does to people. We'll tell you about Racter's unique gameplay abilities and player-influenced upgrade paths when we get closer to unlocking him.\n$250,000 - More Animatic endings! If we hit this goal, we'll be able to create multiple animatic endings for the story to reflect the choices you make in the game.\n$300,000 - Gobbet's personal side mission! Dive deep into the backstory of your team's resident Rat shaman. Gobbet's absurdist philosophy and impulsive nature have led her on a twisting path through life. In her personal mission, you'll get the chance to walk that path with her and see for yourself where Rat takes you.\n$350,000 - More better sound! We can only describe smells (for now) but we can definitely improve on our audio. Dynamic combat music will ebb and flow as a battle progresses, providing more atmosphere and tension. Enhanced Ambient Sound is a catch-phrase for lots of technical babble about making your play environment sound more real and less repetitive.  \n$400,000 - Gaichu joins your team of runners! Gaichu was a member of the Renraku Corporation's elite Red Samurai security force. Infected with the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV) on a mission gone wrong, he was forced to abandon his pure-human unit as the virus slowly twisted him into a ghoul. Now a shadowrunner, Gaichu could prove a valuable ally, but his loyalty comes at a price\u2026\n$450,000 - Enhanced Cyber! If this goal is reached, we'll add a new skill to our character creation system that enhances a character's cyberware and unlocks the ability to install powerful new cybernetic enhancements. This system will further differentiate characters with 'ware from their flesh and blood counterparts. We'll also add cyberweapons that you can install into your characters' arm slots, complete with new animations and visual effects.\n$500,000 - Is0bel's personal side mission! Born to immigrant parents of Somali descent, Is0bel has experienced life in the slums of Kowloon first-hand. Escaping at a young age, she retreated into the cold perfection of the Matrix, but her family still languishes in the depths of the sprawl. Her personal mission will take her back to a place that she barely escaped from - and you'll come along for the ride.\n$550,000 - Expanded magic! If we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll add new gameplay options and equipment for magic-using characters. Shamans will gain the ability to summon Shrine Spirits at specific locations in the Hong Kong environment. These great-form spirits are far more powerful than their mundane counterparts, can\u2019t break away from your control, but are limited in duration. Hermetic mages and physical adepts will gain access to Foci - enchanted weapons and objects that can boost a spellcaster\u2019s magical power or allow an adept to deliver devastating magical attacks.\n$600,000 - Gaichu\u2019s personal side mission! When Gaichu became infected with HMHVV, the Red Samurai code that he'd sworn to demanded that he take his own life. Instead, he took to the shadows, dishonoring himself and the rest of his team in the process. In Gaichu's personal mission, you will square off against a squad of highly-trained warriors who will stop at nothing to destroy their old teammate... and you alongside him.\n$700,000 - Revamped Matrix: Art and Gameplay! If we hit this goal, we'll add more people to the team to revise the look, feel, and gameplay of the Matrix. We want the Matrix to feel more like you're traveling in the digital world. We also want to add new types of Intrusion Countermeasures and new ways of interacting with them so that decking feels more like an illegal entry into someone's system. \n$1,000,000 - Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign! We have our plans set for the story we want to tell in Shadowrun: Hong Kong, but if we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll create an ADDITIONAL 4-5 hour Hong Kong Mini-Campaign that takes place AFTER the story ends. The Mini-Campaign will allow you to IMPORT your high-karma Hong Kong character for a challenge only a prime runner could accept.  The Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign will come out sometime before the end of 2015 and will be FREE to Backers at the $15 pledge level and up. \n\nWe know from experience that fulfilling lots of physical rewards is a big, distracting, and expensive undertaking and we want your funding to go into making a quality game - not into shipping a bunch of tchotchkes. Remember, the people making your game are also the ones making and sending your stuff! So, we created a bunch of cool digital rewards and TWO sweet physical rewards. We hope you like them and we hope you support us. \nHey! Here's a special BONUS for Backers at the $35 Reward level and above!\nEveryone who backs the project at the $35 Reward Level and above will get access to an AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK from the Shadowrun Development Team. Hear the writers, designers, artists, engineers, and composer discuss how the game was made, the challenges they faced, and the fun they had while making the game. The audio commentary will arrive in an update after the game is released.\nAND everyone who backs at the $35 Reward Level and above will also get TWO HIGH-RES DIGITAL POSTERS that, when placed together, combine into a beautiful Shadowrun Panorama. The first poster contains a Timeline of Shadowrun History. The second contains a Glossary of Shadowrun Slang. Tell your friends!\nAll rewards starting at the CHUMMER ($15) level come with at least one copy of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.\nThe actual figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted and numbered!\n Here she is along side a Golem Arcana figure.\nThe power of a Fire Ram is no match for the cunning of a Rat Shaman!\nHer final figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted, and numbered\nCreated over 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of The Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world should have ended on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic returned to end our world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.\nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\n Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere's the good news - we've done this before. More than once. \n\nWe've run successful Kickstarter projects and we've made two Shadowrun games plus a Director's Cut, so we know how to deliver. \n\nThere's always risk in game development, though. In this case, we have a few new team members who need to learn the ropes - but we've got a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people, who go the extra mile for their game and their Backers and they've already distinguished themselves as great additions to the team.\n\nBeyond that, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we need to revise it several times until we're happy. A critical bug could take a whole week to fix while others take ten minutes. \n\nSo while we've done Shadowrun games before and have a solid idea of what we're doing and how our tools work, we haven't done THIS Shadowrun game before and you never know what's gonna happen.\n\nAnd that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "The Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign Is Here!!", "update_content": "We are pleased to announce that the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign is now available as part of a free update to Shadowrun: Hong Kong.This update also adds the developer audio commentary Kickstarter reward and a variety of small game improvements such as new visual effects, updated dialogue, and editor features for User Generated Content.\nSo, we\u2019ve rebranded the title asShadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition to reflect all the new content.

Missed the funding window? Email me john [at] jmperkins.com and we can figure out how you can back the project.\nWait, Play as a Commoner; Why?!?\nNo class is worse than the commoner. Shopkeepers, laborers and other normal folk who were never intended for adventuring and whose stats were included as an afterthought to make \u201creal\u201d Player Characters feel powerful. Why play a commoner? Because it will open your eyes to parts of the game you\u2019ve taken for granted.\nThe wonderful(ly masochistic) thing about playing commoners is that they require you to stretch your creative muscles in ways you\u2019ve never needed to before. Both in and out of combat, you must understand and coax new functionality out of racial abilities, feats, traits, equipment and tactics to stay alive. Are you bored with how \u2018easy\u2019 the game is with a little thought? Feel like the \u2018roleplayers\u2019 don\u2019t take enough time to consider the game and how it works? Feel like the \u2018min-maxers\u2019 strip the game of all its wonder and have a solution to every problem pre-built into their character? Have everyone play a commoner and the game changes completely.\nThe point of the commoner play style is: everything about your character matters. Your minor spell-like abilities are important weapons in you arsenal. That wand that works half the time is a gift from the Gods. A slight improvement to tripping isn\u2019t a nice thing to have, but an essential stratagem that stands between life and death.\nThe Adequate Commoner is about helping you do more with less.\nRejja Ruk-Ruk -Tengu commoner and bounty hunter- tracks a wounded target by the smell of their blood.\nThe Concept\nThe Adequate Commoner is the RPG book for anyone looking to step up the challenge rating of their games, are intrigued by low-magic campaign settings, or want to stop taking game mechanics for granted. Adequate Commoner will allow you to run low-powered, high-tension, tactical adventures that push players' skills to their limits. This volume will collect and highlight the best options and equipment already available to help otherwise outgunned characters take a level in badass in addition to having dozens of pages of brand new material.\nThe Adequate Commoner will collect, improve, expand, and creates new additions to the commoner optimization guide \u2018You\u2019re Going to Die Screaming\u2019 - now available as a pay what you want title!\nGet it here.\nGetava Omak - Half-Orc Commoner and Bouncer doing his best to intimidate his way out of a fight he\u2019s not sure he can win.\nWhat\u2019s Included/Proposed Table of Contents\nWhile it's not completed, and we hope to greatly expand based on Kickstarter funding, a ton of work has been done already on The Adequate Commoner. The basic structure/contents are as follows.\nChapter 1: Getting PC Commoners in Your Game\nOptions for game masters and players who want to include commoners as player characters in their game. The approaches range from 'balanced' options like the 'Gear Hero' or 'Mythic Commoner' which stay true to the commoner concept while creating play balance in unique ways to drawing inspiration from historical ninja, or viewing commoners as a level 0 class to explore ways to include compelling, unbalanced commoner characters.\nChapter 2: Commoner (PC) Class and Commoner Jobs\nA review of the commoner class with a simple modification as well as 'jobs' - options for customizing commoners akin to archetypes including: Servant, Mason, Shopkeeper, Militia Veteran, Temple Keeper, and more.\nChapter 3: Weapons and Armor\nA look at the most effective existing arms and armors in addition to an entirely new class of weapon - the commoner weapon: modified tools like spades, pitchforks, throwing stones, cleavers, and more.\nChapter 4: Making Best Use of Stats, Skills, and Race Selection\nHow to do more with less, what choices can help a commoner and which can't, in addition to new and creative uses of existing options.\nChapter 5: Traits\nCollection of the most important existing traits in addition to over ten new ones including:\nKnow Your Place - You are well practiced in speaking to your social betters: knights, lords, government bureaucrats, and more have all been soothed by your silvered tongue. \nRough Living - In your time, you\u2019ve worked hard every day and often eaten food that would turn the stomach of \u2018softer\u2019 people. You are hale and hearty. \nRevolutionary - Your experience in a peasant uprising taught you how to use a commoner weapon more effectively.\nCover Mockup\nChapter 6: Feats\nA break down of commoner combat 'Styles,' a collection of the most important existing feats in addition to over ten new ones including: \nAnimal Breeder - Your experience working with animals has allowed you to coax more out of them. \n(Un)Common Sense - You\u2019re not sure about all this book learning, but between what your grandpappy told you and the obvious you can suss out some basics on a variety of subjects. \nDon't Know the Meaning of the Word Fizzled - Through painstaking practice, you\u2019ve grown incredibly skilled at coaxing extra functionality from magical devices. \nChapter 7: Consumables and Ammunition \nAn essential selection of existing arrows, crossbow bolts, alchemical items, and magical consumables for the commoner utility belt plus new creations like: rusting powder arrows, flashbangs, and red mist throws. \nChapter 8: Improvised Traps \nA complete new class of traps and use for the Craft [traps] skill: improvised traps are things like pungi pits, deadfalls, snares and more - all assembled out of whatever material is at hand. These oftentimes low cost, low challenge traps can be made incredibly deadly by skilled trapsmiths. \nChapter 9: Wondrous Items \nA collection of the most useful wondrous items (for commoners) and new creations including: \nFidget's Balista of the Hole in the World (a weaponized bag of holding + portable hole combination) \nFeather Token (Cover) \nAlchemist's Sling\nTen Foot Fingers. \nChapter 10: Bringing it All Together - Tactics & Ambush Examples \nA write up of combat bonuses and how low level commoners or other characters can triumph over much more dangerous opponents complete with: step by step ambush examples, notes for GMs on how handle DR and Fast Healing, and advice concerning how players use the environment and props like torch sconces, paving stones, caves and more to their advantage.\nChapter 11: Leveling up Your NPCs\nToo often, commoners and other NPCs are dismissed as 'inconsequential' and beneath notice to players. More to the point, they are oftentimes assumed to be virtually defenseless against adventurers and other 'super-normal' threats. While the rest of the book chronicles how (and why) to make commoner PCs more effective and interesting, Chapter 11 is all about how to make engaging, helpful, or downright terrifying commoners and other NPCs by discussing things like strategic reserves, militia tactics, community defense and development, the commoner mindset, and how they would (potentially) get comeuppance against arrogant adventurers. This chapter is all about how active, engaged 'everyman' NPCs can be a major help or hindrance to the party and potentially the most memorable part of your campaign.  \nChapter 12: Commoner Sample Characters\nIncluding: \nRejja Ruk-Ruk - Bag O' Tricks Bounty Hunter \nGetava Omak - Big Mouthed Bully \nJosom Nightwalker - Hunter in the Shadows \nSnozgrundaheim 'Snoz' Tiykallish - Poor Man's Summoner \nBekan of Rivenford - Grizzled Militia Veteran\nBonus: Commoner Adventure \nBrought to you by the team behind the Kickstarted, supremely awesome Pure Steam campaign setting!\n What do we need money for? \nSnozgrundaheim \u2018Snoz\u2019 Tiykallish -Gnome commoner and \u2018Poor Man\u2019s Summoner\u2019- flubs an attempt to use a magic scroll... enlarge person has become elongate scroll.\nWe intend to use the money to pay for art, layout, coloring, physical printing of the book, and to incorporate even more material to make the Adequate Commoner the best it can possibly be.  \nYou \nFlying the flag to victory!\nYou, as a potential backer, are the entire reason The Adequate Commoner exists. We want your feedback every step of the way, and we want this product to be shaped by what will be the most useful/relevant to you. More than just supporting the project financially, your insight, ideas, and enthusiasm will shape this gaming supplement from the ground up. \nThat\u2019s why every backer from the CONTRIBUTOR pledge level and up will be invited to Misfit\u2019s private forum for our second round of playtesting and your suggestions being incorporated into the final version. Moreover, we have support options to get you into the game: either in an exclusive pitch session to take a contributor role (PITCH(FORK) WIELDING pledge level and up), get you or a loved one statted out as an iconic Commoner Character (at the exclusive LEGENDARY pledge level) or even become a Deity (at the one of a kind TRANSCENDENT pledge level).\nKnow a reward, or seen one elsewhere, that you'd like to get from us? Feel free to ask, and we'll see if we can set you up.\nExtras \nEvery backer over the EQUIPPED pledge level (pledges at the $40 level and higher) level will also receive a of Misfit\u2019s Studio\u2019s Superior Synergy and The Spellweaver supplements. Both supplements fit perfectly with The Adequate Commoner - one by looking at making better use of complementary skills and feats to draw out new bonuses, and the other providing a rework of the magic system to make it a perilous, skill based system built on hard work rather than a mystical gift limited to only a select few classes.  \nFrom their product descriptions: \nSuperior Synergy: Fantasy brings the concept of game mechanic synergy back into your favorite fantasy role-playing game system. The idea that some game mechanics (such as skills) are innately compatible with other game mechanics in ways that can influence the game without choosing additional elements (such as feats) to permit their use makes a comeback in a greatly expanded and revised way. \nThe Spellweaver presents an alternate magic system that transforms arcane magic into a matter of skill and not just level climbing. Using the new spellweaving skill, a spellweaver is able to manipulate the threads of magic that spread throughout Existence like an infinite web of arcane energy. Using this system, arcane spells of any level may be cast so long as the character is sufficiently skilled and willing to risk the hazardous repercussions of failure. Inside you will find instructions on how to integrate this new form of skill-based magic into your game setting, or how to replace the existing magic system outright. The simple rules for doing so are presented in easy-to-read tables that can be used for converting third party spells to spellweaving DCs. \nAdd-Ons\nADD AN EXTRA PDF COPY - $10 For every backer at $15 and over, add $10 dollars to your pledge for an extra copy of the pdf for a friend or $35 for 4 extra pdf copies so you can get one to your whole gaming group.\nADD AN EXTRA PRINT COPY - $20  For every backer at $50 and above, add $20 dollars to your pledge for an extra print copy for a friend, or add $70 for 4 extra print copies so you can get one to your whole gaming group. \nStretch Goals\nIn addition to the two bonus books from Misfit Studios, if we reach our stretch goals we\u2019ll be offering even more amazing books to expand your gaming library and create even more awesome Commoner adventures.\nWe put our goal at the bare minimum to get this project finished, but with your support we think we can do truly amazing things. As such, here's a plan for to take The Adequate Commoner all the way to level 20. All books from other publishers + additional supplements will be given out to all backers at the EQUIPPED pledge level and above.\n          $6500 Every backer at the EQUIPPED pledge level and above receives a copy of Mundane No More - Text and Tomes from Christina Stiles Presents. A literate commoner is a powerful commoner. Texts and Tomes provides characters with the ability to retrain skills, feats. class features, and more, as well as providing a unique crafting recipe system that adds depth to the any game but is especially useful for commoners.\nLevel 3 - Use a Scroll of Enlarge Kickstarter\n$8000 - Art Upgrade: All art in full color (note, printed editions may still have B&W Interior art depending on our choice of printer)\n$8500 - Full integration and specialization of skills synergies into the text of The Adequate Commoner.\n$9,000 - Every backer at EQUIPPED and above gets a copy of Cooks' Day Out - an original module about a group of failed commoner adventurers turned cooks who keep getting forced into new adventures.\n$9,500 - Every backer at EQUIPPED and above gets a copy of The Mansion of Felix Feckle - an original module about navigating the horrendously dangerous mansion of the the most successful (and most tremendously insane paranoid) commoner adventurer ever.\n$10,000 - Every backer at EQUIPPED and above gets a copy of 101 Uses for the Traveler\u2019s Anytool & Fidget\u2019s Advanced Anytool - a supplement reviewing and expanding functionality for the single most versatile magic item in fantasy role playing games.\nPARTY BREAK\n$10001 - Party!

Perkins stops all gainful employ and becomes a game designer full time.\n\nWhat are People Saying?\nTake one of our favorite writers and pair him with one of the best publishers around and you get a great idea with some truly interesting gaming direction. - Robert Hemminger (Lead Designer - Avalon Games)\nThis is going to be amazing!!! - Mitchell (Advanced Playtester)  \nJ.M. Perkins has created the definitive resource on the tactical use of nursemaids. If setting out to sack a city with two knaves and an eel-monger, you'd be a fool to do so without The Adequate Commoner; The Adequate Commoner is superlative. - Brett Jackson (Creator, BEDTIME FOREVER)\nThe idea of guerrilla warfare in a fantasy setting is very exciting - Andrew (Advanced Playtester)\nI've always loved tabletop gaming, and in his new Kickstarter campaign, author J.M. Perkins is taking on a burden most honorable on a quest most memorable -- that of rehabilitating the reputation and usefulness of the legions of shopkeepers, smithys, barkeeps and other average folks who populate the streets and byways of the various landscapes of role-playing games. Me, I'm eager to see this Kickstarter succeed so fans of Pathfinder and other RPGs can play these underrated characters. \u2013 Robert J. Peterson (Owner, California Coldblood Books)\nThis book will help players go beyond playing a mere role and step forward into playing a character. - Matt Lemke (Editor, Through Gamer Goggles)\nWhen John approached me with the idea, I thought it was a fun novelty. Once we got it on the table, though, I realized he had taken Pathfinder to a new and wonderful place. Parts of the game I\u2019d taken for granted for over a decade were suddenly life-or-death important. Playing commoners increases the challenges, yes, but also the satisfaction of a game well-played in a way I didn\u2019t think possible. - Rich Howard (Lead Designer-Mundane No More: Texts and Tomes)\nThe Team\nJ.M. Perkins - Writer: A fiction and game writer with over ten years of experience. His short fiction has appeared in dozens of anthologies, podcasts, and magazines including on Public Radio International. In addition to creating the Adequate Commoner for Misfit Studios, J.M. Perkins writes for Avalon Games and his credits include Bite Me: Player Options for Lycanthropes (Misfit Studios) and Ultimate Options: Story Feats (Rogue Genius Games). \nRich Howard - Developer: Rich Howard's obsession with gaming started 35 years ago and he's been writing and playing ever since. In the past year he's contributed to projects from Misfit Studios, Rogue Genius Games and Christina Stiles Presents, as well as become both lead designer on Misfit's Ultimate Shaman and lead developer for the upcoming storytelling boardgame, LUCID. \nSteven Trustrum - Layout and Quality Control: Steven Trustrum is a freelance writer, small press publisher, owner of Misfit Studios, sometimes-graphic designer and digital colourist, and SEO warrior. \nMisfit Studios - Publisher: Misfit Studios is a small press role-playing game publishing company begun in 2003; established as a third-party provider of useful products for popular game lines.

We always bring a deck of cards with us on our trips, but wanted something more - yet didn't want to bring a second deck to play our old favorites. Thus was born GoCache, a geocaching-themed, draw-driven card game that doubles as a regular deck of cards! All cards feature original art by artist Indi Martin of Tortoise & Hare Creations. \nIn GoCache, you search for Urban and Wilderness cache cards using your GPSr device and Transportation cards. You can use Lifeline cards to help you on your way, but watch out! Your opponent will be throwing Muggle cards at you to throw you off course! \nThe basic GoCache card game includes 54 poker-size cards with original art and text in a clear plastic case. One of our first stretch goals is to be able to throw in a custom, fully designed tuck box for the game! Currently the cards are printed on high-quality, smooth cardstock, but we would also like to upgrade them to the covered linen cards prevalent in many poker-style decks. Share the project and help us deliver some awesome quality leaps to all backers!\n As a reminder, the expanded rules can be found at http://gocachegame.blogspot.com , especially if you have any questions about the geocaching terms used!\nWe're starting the campaign off with a bang! All tiers that receive a copy of the game (except \"The Distributor\") will also receive an exclusive AND trackable extra card! Watch this space for more exclusives as we unlock stretch goals.\n The more the campaign makes, the more Kickstarter exclusives we can offer our backers, thanks to the economy of scale. Check out some of the stretch goals we're offering and share our project with your friends and family to help bump GoCache up to a higher tier! Stretch goals deliver extra rewards to every backer tier that receives a physical copy of the game. \nWE ARE FUNDED!!!!!! Now it's just stretch goal time!!!!! :D \nStretch Goal Unlocked! Custom icon at geocaching.com for GoCache! Now all of the exclusive trackable aces of spades will have a recognizable GoCache icon on the website, instead of the standard icon! \nStretch Goal Unlocked! Mini-prints of \"Anubis\" and \"Lucky Cat\" Card Art! All backers receiving physical rewards ($17 and up) will receive a 4x6 print of both pieces, original watercolors by Indi Martin. The prints are on high quality photo paper and will be shipped alongside the decks!\nStretch Goal Unlocked: Three New Bonus Cards! At $3500, we achieved the \"Timey Wimey\" bonus! All Kickstarter backers of $17 or above will receive three bonus cards. These are marked with an expansion symbol of a stopwatch clearly on the card so they do not impact the traditional playability of the base game (all expansions will have a similar marking). The cards included are: Time Machine (Transportation card), Alien Tech (GPSr card) and ET Highway (Hybrid Urban/Wilderness card). This is super exciting, because these cards introduce a few new mechanics that we can build on in future expansions. The \"Hybrid\" card type acts as both an Urban and a Wilderness card for bonus purposes. And we introduce a \"steal\" mechanic that will be very fun, and is sure to throw your opponents into a tizzy!\nStretch Goal Unlocked: Upgraded Linen-Covered Cards!\n All backer tiers that receive a physical copy of the game will receive all stretch goal exclusives!\n *Event Host tier levels can choose to have their Event Card added to additional decks purchased via Add-Ons for no additional cost. We'll verify with you at the end of the Kickstarter whether you want standard, or your modified decks.\nShipping of all tiers is free to US residents!\nEach tier level lists international shipping additional charges - please add the international shipping charge to your pledge level.\n Rule & Icon Cards (Jokers).

In 2011, Indi Martin joined forces with writing partner and idea-generator William O. Billman II to create Tortoise & Hare Creations, into which the two could pour their creative heartblood and - through alchemical equations and dark, rum-based magic - produce stunning projects. Indi is best known for penning the Gina Harwood novels, a paranormal investigation series, as well as Dissolution: A Graphic Novel, a mature-content, experimental graphic serial. Together with Will, she has illustrated and co-created the Cobalt modern noir comics, and the Fern Sea steampunk children's comic world. Indi has supplied paintings for Rogue Genius Games' Pathfinder supplements, including the Book of Eight Restful Retreats. Additionally, she offers her original and fan art prints as well as commissions.

The driving force behind many of THC's projects, Will began the company by approaching Indi to illustrate Fern Sea Chronicles, a fantasy children's book and comic series that put THC on the map. He followed this up by the modern noir comic Cobalt, published by THC the following year to rave reviews. Most recently, he has written a prequel comic treatment to the upcoming game Shroud of the Avatar titled \"New Beginnings.\" Check out all of THC's projects at http://www.facebook.com/tortoiseharecreations\nHuge thanks to:\nOur playtesters!

If they survive their first nights on Abaddon, they should reach 9th level by the adventure\u2019s conclusion.\nWho is Cassandra Papacis? More importantly....can she be trusted?\nPart 1: Havoc of the Mind\u2019s Eye  - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages\nBLOOD AND TERROR AWAIT\nNothing is as it seems in the blasted countryside surrounding the insular fortress\u00adtown of Lockgate. For weeks, the people there \u00ad\u00adlocals and outsiders alike\u00ad \u00adhave been terrorized by a creature they only know as the Beast. It strikes fast and vanishes, leaving behind mutilated corpses to find. The town\u2019s lord has issued a reward for the death of the beast and a band of monster hunters have answered. The seer traveling with the PCs leads them straight into the heart of this mystery where it becomes quickly evident there is more at work than a simple ravaging monster. Can the PCs unearth the true source of Lockgate\u2019s horror?\n\nHavoc of the Mind\u2019s Eye is an investigative horror adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The scenario is designed for four 9th level PCs, and is suitable as a single horror tale or as the second episode of the Cross of Fire Saga. By the end of the adventure, the PCs will either die screaming or reach 10th level.\n\nPart 2: Ravagers of the Shadow Black - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages \nFALL TO SHADOWS\nTwo lost Osirian civilizations fell deep within the earth during the Cataclysm. They struggle to survive at the expense of fey calling the subterranean tunnels home. When a strange plague of poisoned light corrupts the land, the desperate people starve and turn upon one another. Can a small group of heroes return the peace and cleanse the blight, or are they doomed to die in the lands of endless shadow?\nRavagers of the Shadowfall is an adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It can be played as a unique scenario for 10th level characters, or as the third episode of the Cross of Fire Saga. The adventure includes 32 action\u00adpacked pages filled with dark artifacts, gremlins, survivalist adventuring, and a challenging new underground setting! Players can expect to reach 12th level or a shallow grave by the time they complete this adventure. \nWill the PCs be pawns in Baltazar's deadly game?\nPart 3: Raiders of the Cataclysm - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages \nAS BELOW, SO ABOVE  \n\nHigh atop the Amaranth Glacier lie the ruins of long\u00ad abandoned Qhazlor . A band of sorely tested travelers seeks a unique path home, away from the strange mountains and salted valleys of Abaddon. Equipped with half of the ancient tools they need to escape this hell on earth, they encounter another party much like themselves. The adventurers must survive on the harsh plateau long enough to overcome a wrecked band of crosstraders who also seek a way home, or convince them to share the power that they themselves are only beginning to understand.\n\nRaiders of the Cataclysm is a scenario for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and the penultimate adventure in the Cross of Fire Saga. It includes several dangerous encounters, a description of the mutinous crew of the Endurance, and a pair of climactic battles that will test the PCs\u2019 outer limits. Those who survive are likely to reach 14th level.\n\nIs this kaylethon mercenary friend? or foe?\nPart 4: Crusaders of the Cross of Fire - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages\nLEAVE ALL HOPE OUTSIDE\n\nArmed with four mighty relics, a beleaguered band of adventurers arrives at the doors to a place known only as the Crucible\u2014an abandoned adamantine mine once worked by disciplined, benevolent monks. None doubt that terror and death wait within, but the path home requires the PCs to take up sword and spell once more and face the dark truth concealed within an ancient monastery. Who can withstand the shocking truth, or the vessels of evil that lay it bare?\n\nCrusaders of the Cross of Fire concludes the disturbing story of the Cross of Fire Saga. Within its pages are more than a dozen traps, haunts, and monstrous encounters devised with the express intent of keeping the PCs\u2019 corpses trapped within the Crucible forever. Though the depraved powers will more than likely claim their souls, characters who survive should reach 15th level before the final encounters.\n\nThis man saved the world from a tyrant once. Will you pay the price he requires to return home?\nThe Cross of Fire itself!\nBackground: Since 2000, the d20 System gaming license and the Open Game License (OGL) have allowed publishers to share a common framework for creating roleplaying games using the System Reference Document (SRD), which contains the same core mechanics as those found in Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition. Under the OGL, third-party publishers use the SRD as the basis of many different games. Paizo Publishing expanded the concept of the OGL with their creation and development of the Pathfinder Resource Document (PRD), and in turn made a successful open gaming system.\nPatronage and Funding: Our project initially funds at the $8,000 level. We intend to achieve this goal in a little over 40 days\u2014from 25 September to 4 November. This amount covers the costs to write and produce the product for the backers, and gives us a head start on backing the retail level. Of course, the project is impossible without our backers, so backer levels allow an impressive amount of retail product for much less than the expected retail cost for the adventures and their support product.\n\nProcesses: Louis Porter Jr has produced fantasy roleplaying games and support for those games for 15 years. Our commitment to our backers, in addition to high quality and impressive value, is to have the materials we publish to you finished and shipped on time. We are grateful for our backers and will continue our commitment to timely delivery of a unique professional product.\n\nThe Pathfinder community has loyal fans and creative designers. Backers at certain levels earn the right to also submit professional designs for publication in an advanced stretch goal. Becoming a patron on this project is a great way to gain a design credit on the book, which in turn is a great way to gain experience and build a resume for those interested in pursuing a career in game publishing!\n\nWhat are you backing?The funds form the kickstarter campaign allow us to produce high-quality professional products, including materials to provide to retail vendors. At the successful funding level of $8,000, each backer receives the product their backer level implies, but the funds only pay for the printing of the first adventure. Beyond that point, the addition of several exciting stretch goals allow us to finance the retail expense for the remaining products.\n\nWhere is the money going?\n Back it for a Buck (B4$) Challenge\nAre you a fan of LPJ Design and want to see this kickstarter succeed?

Thank you, thank you, thank you. :) After the campaign closes, stay informed by reading the kickstarter updates or the official Five Moons RPG blog!\nOctober 28 Update: We hit the $35k funding goal, so the Monster Guide is pre-funded! As a special bonus for that stretch goal, we're adding a free PDF of theMonster Guideto every print Monster Guide reward.\nOctober 22 Update: Here's an example-of-play video demonstrating the skills, combat, and using the \"boost\" game mechanic for various effects.\n  Five Moons is a fantasy RPG designed by me, Sean K Reynolds. Its play style will be familiar to fans of D&D and the Pathfinder RPG, but colored by my experiences in the tabletop, card, and video game industry over the past 19 years.\nDo you spend more time creating a character than actually playing that character? Does the minmaxer in your group hog the spotlight instead of being a team player? Do you think spellcasters are too good compared to fighters and rogues? Does your character's dependence on magic items feel like a \"Christmas tree\"? It's time to reboot your playing experience. \nWith Five Moons RPG, you can play a character that's fun and successful without having to focus on combat math. You can choose skills that make your character well-rounded--without making you vulnerable. You can wear magic items that are fun and flavorful instead of just being a source of plusses. You can defeat opponents using diplomacy or intimidation, and not just with one all-or-nothing roll.\nThis is a game that mixes old-school simplicity with the customizability of a modern RPG.\nThe goals for this game are:\n* Create a book that's easy to read, understand, play, and reference, like the Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box (a product I wrote and am very proud of).\n* Make characters less dependent upon their gear to survive and succeed.\n* Elevate martial characters to have parity with spellcasters, but still maintain fun and distinct flavor for each class. (caster/martial disparity blog #1) (disparity blog #2) (wands obsolete skills blog)\n* Reward roleplaying, teamwork, adventuring, and social interaction instead of focusing on damage output in combat. (teamwork blog)\n* Create a longer play experience in the leveling \"sweet spot\" (the D&D/PFRPG equivalent of level 6 to level 12) and allow characters to level more frequently so they don't remain exactly the same for many game sessions. (leveling \"sweet spot\" blog)\n* Simplify scaling monster encounters against various character levels.\n* Allow for pseudo-medieval fantasy without \"realism\" hindering characters. (fantasy physics blog entry)\n(The above links point to specific blog entries I've made about those points on the Five Moons RPG blog.)\nThe target funding level of this campaign is to create two initial books:\nFive Moons Corebook: A 128-page hardcover book containing player and GM info, such as classes, races, character creation, skills, combat, magic items, environment, and running a campaign. Also known as \"the Corebook.\"\nFive Moons Player's Guide: A 64-page trimmed-down version of the rules, providing everything a player needs to create a character and play the game.\nStretch goals beyond this will fund the creation of additional books, starting with the Monster Guide, a 32-page book of monsters (see Stretch Goals, below).\nSome of the rewards for this kickstarter are multiple books grouped together into bundles. To keep the different rewards and add-ons from getting confusing as stretch goals add more to each backer level, each backer level grants you a specific bundle, and the bundles are described below. This lets you select what set of rewards you want with one bundle instead of having to manually specify add-ons to your reward levels.\nFor example, the \"Ultimate PDF Backer\" bundle offers you the Corebook PDF, Player's Guide PDF, Monster Guide PDF (the first stretch goal), and PDFs of all other books that are unlocked as stretch goals. Bundles will grow larger and more valuable if we reach the stretch goals we have planned.\nConfused? Check out this handy chart! The columns are the backer level, the rows are the rewards, and the dots mean you get that row's reward if you select that column's backer level. Note: I'm committed to this project and these books. Even if we don't pre-fund a book as a stretch goal, the book will get made, so there's no reason not to pick a reward that includes the later books. I'm a game industry pro, I've been making RPGs for almost 20 years, and self-publishing for more than 10 years.\nHere's a description of all the backer levels, unlocked books, and the bundles.\nAdventure #1 (locked stretch goal): Cavern of the Venomous Pillar, a 32-page adventure.\nAdventure #2 (locked stretch goal): A 32-page adventure.\nAdventure #3 (locked stretch goal): A 32-page adventure.\nBook of Treasures (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook of new magic items.\nCharacter Options (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook of new classes and player character abilities.\nCults and Guilds (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook about factions, religions, and organizations in the World of Five Moons.\nCorebook: The Five Moons RPG Corebook.

Some of the design decisions for the game were made with a new setting in mind: the World of Five Moons.\nIn this campaign setting, various civilizations are spread out over many islands in a flat sea. Circling above are five large moons (each representing a powerful god-like entity), and below is a cloud of ether inhabited by alien shapechanging dragons. Magical barriers prevented the civilizations from mixing for decades, but the barriers recently collapsed, allowing a new era of exploration, trade, and conflict between peoples.\nYou can run a campaign in the World of Five Moons as a straight-up adventure-based setting with humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, lost civilizations, and all the fantasy trappings you are used to. Or you can look deeper and delve into who created this world, the reason why its various humanoid races can interbreed, and address the question of what it is to be \"human\" in a world where people can alter their shapes as an act of will or in response to environmental factors. Here is an in-character overview blog post about the setting.\nNow that this project has hit its $25,000 funding goal, we can reveal stretch goals here that'll fund the creation of additional books for the game.\n(Keep in mind: I am committed to making all of the books listed as part of this project, whether or not we hit these stretch goals. Having them as stretch goals just means they're pre-funded, which means I can pay the designers, artists, and editors sooner rather than later.)\nStretch Goal #1: pre-fun the Five Moons Monster Guide: Achieved! Now everyone whose backer reward includes this book in print also gets it in PDF.\nStretch Goal #2 (unlocked at $45,000)\u2014Cavern of the Venomous Pillar: A 32-page introductory adventure for low-level characters.\nWe're in the process of determining the cost of add-ons like dice and t-shirts. In the meantime, you can select the following add-ons by manually increasing your pledge, including multiple copies.\n(Be sure to add the listed extra shipping cost for physical items, which are listed after each item.)\nPlayer's Guide PDF: add $7 for each PDF.\nPlayer's Guide in print: add $20 for each book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping.\nCorebook PDF: Add $14 for each PDF.\nCorebook in print: add $35 for each book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping .\nMonster Guide in print: Add $7 for the PDF, or $12 for print+PDF (buy it in print, you get the PDF for free). Add $5 for USA shipping or $20 total for international shipping. (If your reward includes the Corebook in print or Player's Guide in print, you do not need to add anything for shipping the Monster Guide, as it'll all go in the same shipment.)\nAdventure #1 Cavern of the Venomous Pillar: Add $12 for each print book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping. Add $7 for the PDF. (If your reward includes the Corebook in print, Player's Guide in print, or Monster Guide in print, you do not need to add anything for shipping this adventure, as it'll all go in the same shipment.)\nSolo Portrait: Add $75 for a one-third-page black & white illustration by artist Gerald Lee. In this illustration, Gerald will draw one character from your gaming group (or fantasy versions of you or someone you know) in a standing pose or ready for action. This illustration will appear in the Corebook and Player's Guide, and will include a caption with the name of your character (or the player it represents). You will receive a high-resolution image file of this illustration.\nT-Shirts: Not technically add-ons, but JBM Press will be making Five Moons t-shirts using official art! You'll be able to order them directly from jbmpress.com. \nAs other books are unlocked, they'll also be added to this section (mainly for people whose backer levels don't automatically include those books).\nYou can help spread the word about this project by using these badges and this Facebook cover photo on social media. And here is a one-page flier you can hang up at your local game store (get permission first!).

Went to Gen Con. Came back from Gen Con. Waited to receive the confirmation email that the cover had been approved. Finally emailed One Bookshelf (OBS) to ask if the cover had been approved. They said yes it had, and also told me that didn't have to wait for the confirmation email, I could check that online (even though every time before this I got a confirmation email). I checked the interior pages one more time, caught a few typos, uploaded the interior file again. Waited a couple of days and checked online to see if the interior file had been approved. Saw that the interior file had been rejected and so had the cover (even though the cover had been approved earlier and I hadn't changed it since then). Talked to OBS, they saw that the interior pages' bleed (how much blank space is around the edge of the page) was insufficient, even though it was the same setup as the last interior file I submitted. They weren't sure why the cover was rejected after being approved and they said they'd talk to Lightning Source (the actual printing company that OBS uses) about it. Got the interior bleed fixed, uploaded, and approved. Got the OK from Lightning Source and OBS about the cover. Decided to order one more proof copy to make sure the cover looked right (as I didn't want the cover art to be shifted off the page on every single copy sent out to you). That proof copy arrived today, and it looks fine (photo attached below). So I'm going to upload the shipping addresses of print backers into the OBS site and order your print copies tonight! In my experience that's taken about a week to process the order, and another week or two for them to print and ship out the books\u2026 but it's finally happening!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "June 2019 Update: Monster Guide and Player Guide", "update_content": "I was out of town for a week and the new print proof of the corebook arrived while I was away:"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 247, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seankreynolds/five-moons-rpg-by-sean-k-reynolds", "project_name": "Five Moons RPG by Sean K Reynolds"}}, {"backer": "Mike Myler", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "$97,000+ and over 1,000 backers? I'm floored. \nThank you so much for all your support. With your help, we've shown that fantasy rpgs can thrive outside the realm of European legends, in lands both wondrous and filled with high adventure.\nBacker Reward Levels: This project has grown quite large for an RPG project, and some stretch goals expanded well beyond the original plan, especially the Ten Arabian Nights (which was previously 7, 8, or 9 Nights!). Because Kickstarter doesn't allow us to edit the rewards listed on the right hand side, we recommend scrolling down to the pledge table instead, which lists rewards for each level.\nIf you missed the Kickstarter, it's not too late--you can still get the books! Use the preorder links below to reserve your copy.\nSouthlands Hardcover in Full Color\nSouthlands Bestiary in Full Color \nSouthlands 7-Dice Set\nNothing says adventure quite like lost cities, tombs buried deep beneath the desert sands, and pirate ships sailing along a serpent-infested jungle coast. And nothing makes fantasy heroics quite as great as the graves of lost gods, mighty viziers commanding the charge of camel-riding cavalry, or enormous elemental lords trampling entire cities into ruin.\nKobold Press is bringing high adventure back to the tabletop, with a full-color book of ancient hieroglyphic magic, powerful genie lords, and monsters that would give Sindbad nightmares\u2014all compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (and a great sourcebook for any fantasy RPG).\nWith your support, we've already added more than 40 extras from art to bonus PDFs to big expansions to the core book. Explore the ruins and reap the rewards in the Southlands!\nThe Southlands takes you to the great empires and wealthy kingdoms of the hotter climates, drawing on fantasy traditions from the Arabian Nights to Egyptian mythology. Imagine the Scorpion King, Conan, and Sindbad joining forces to find a lost treasure, and fighting genies and were-hyenas along the way\u2014not to mention six-armed demon lords!\nPlayers will find many new character options for Pathfinder RPG. GMs will find kingdoms, treasures, monsters and adventure hooks for desert, jungle, and tropical mountain adventures. There\u2019s also vast reams of esoteric lore for those who seek the knowledge found only within the most ancient papyrus scrolls.\nSouthlands Core Book: People, Places, & Monsters\nLost cities, deadly ruins, and a wealth of new character options\u2014from werelions to insect folk to jinnborn heroes, as well as black lotus magic, incantations, and demonic cults. \nThe Southlands offers tools for better games, such as the flavor and character of the City of Cats, as well as a heavily playtested Bestiary stuffed with creatures written by Paizo staff, professional freelancers, and project backers. Join the tradition of Conan, Aladdin, and Sindbad, and bring a touch of wild adventure into your game!\nThe Southlands core book uses the Midgard Campaign Setting; but its cities, lore, peculiar creatures, and characters are easily portable to any campaign with Southlands themes and climate.\nDesign and Publish \nThe current draft of the Southlands book includes 20 new fantasy monsters, suitable for populating wide deserts, mountain shrines, and lost temples. These monsters include giant abominations, tropical lycanthropes, and even subtly malevolent undead. It will offer everything from highly magical creatures to natural horrors, and far beyond, because of the wide net we're casting for monster designers.\nBackers at the Beast Master level and above can submit their own monsters. Creatures that make the cut will be included in the Bestiary section of the book, with full-color illustrations that bring all their wonder and menace to snarling life.\nNew Player Character Options\nSouthlands also includes new races like the tosculi insectfolk, expanded material for aasimar and detailed gnoll PCs, plus additional options for humans, dwarves, and others. It expands the options for fighters, clerics, wizards, and many others with a dozen archetypes, including the sword dancer fighter archetype, the face of Bastet for clerics, an aeromancer wizard, and deep explorer rogues. \nOriginal racial archetypes for dwarves and gnolls are also included, as is new gear, new magical items, and new spells and magic, such as the 2 new domains for Bastet, the goddess of cats.\nSouthlands Bestiary (UNLOCKED!)\nThe project has unlocked a separate Southlands Bestiary volume, so we will be publishing many monsters designed by backers. After seeing the range and quality of the backer spells for Deep Magic, we\u2019re confident that some amazing monsters will find their way into the book.\nMonster books are always art-intensive and require careful development, so we know this is going to be a big addition to the project. Thank you to everyone who gave us the chance to add this treat to the project!\nBackers, for more details on submitting your monster for design review, check the FAQ. We'll also be posting about the design submissions process in a locked post for backers.\nEXCLUSIVE: Ten Arabian Nights\nKobold Press published a volume of six adventures set in and around the free city of Siwal in 2008 for 3rd Edition D&D under the OGL. These adventures have been revised, expanded, and updated to Pathfinder RPG rules by Paizo freelance designer and developer Jim Groves, who is also adding a new adventure to the book--and we've added three more all-new adventures thanks to your support.\nIt includes:\nDivided Hearts, by Jim Groves: Nothing is as it seems when the PCs are hired to recover the Sultan's talking monkey. The divs make their debut in Midgard in a plot to destroy true love and the Free City itself!\nThe Gravebinder\u2019s Daughter, by Wolfgang Baur:A local gravebinder's daughter has gone missing in Siwal's necropolis, a graveyard precinct that neither sleeps or rests quietly.\nThe Sand Pirates, by Clay Fleischer: The Sultan requests the heroes wrest a legendary and magical sandship from a crew of nefarious pirates who contest his dominion over the desert sands.\nOasis of the Blood Moon, by Jeff Grubb: The heroes are drawn by chance into a kidnapping by undead fiends with the power to masquerade as the living.\nCult of the Howling God, by Wolfgang Baur: A assassin-acolyte of a profane cult strikes at the righteous and the pious for revenge, and to unleash an unimaginable horror upon the citizens of the Free City.\nWishbound, by Joshua Stevens: The laws which govern djinn nobility are strict and unforgiving, and the best of intentions lead to damnation. The PCs are hired for a mission of reconciliation\u2014and if they're lucky, redemption.\nBottled Desire, by David \u201cZeb\u201d Cook:When the 3rd son of wealthy merchant falls in love with a janni, the bride-to-be elects to assume the identity of a fictional ship's captain from far away. The PCs discover the hard way, the only thing worse than evil spirits and hyena men are your future in-laws.\nTomb of the Elephant God, by Mike Shel (FUNDED Stretch Goal): Long ago, the tomb of the Elephant God was built, and the god's son interred there--and all who know its location died. Now, though, the tomb is rediscovered. What remains within?\nTomb-Palace of Nakresh the Many-Handed, by Amber Scott (FUNDED Stretch Goal): The patron god of thieves and wizards has a sacred tomb-palace, and many wonder what plundered treasures lie within. Surely no one is foolish enough to steal from the demon-lord of thieves?\nAgainst the Serpent King, by Mike Welham (FUNDED Stretch Goal): The characters must stop an insidious plot to convert an entire city's populace to serpentine slaves, just the first step in the master villain's plot for world domination!\nThis adventure collection is exclusive to the Southlands Kickstarter, and it is not available anywhere else. \nSpecial Editions\nThe leatherette and leatherbound editions of Southlands are available at some reward tiers. Each of these versions has a heavier, higher-quality cover, foil stamping, bookmarks, endpapers, and improved bindery and care. These premium editions are only available through Kobold Press and this Kickstarter (some retailer tiers also gain access to these editions).\nThe special editions will be limited in quantity.\nCoins of the Southlands\nBladesmith Todd Gdula will be minting some ancient-looking coins for Southlands. The process is labor-intensive, but it\u2019s worth it for coins that are not machine-made. These bronze coins look and feel ancient, and we\u2019re very happy to offer a touch of another world with these coins. \nThese coins make perfect props, like the ones common in the markets of Siwal and the distant oases and jungles, and in the fists of caravan masters. More details to come on these.\nThrough the Red Portal\nThis Grimoire of Nuria Natal is a lorebook that addresses the history and lost magic of the first wizards and god-kings, describe some of their peculiar talents, and offers a glimpse behind the masks of the gods of Midgard. It makes great reading for anyone looking for an undead necromancer-king, a mummy struck by divine madness, or the curse of the eldest theurge.\nThe text and illustrations are done in an archaic style, and Through the Red Portal will be printed as a letterpress book, from cast metal type on a hand press. Also in the old style, there will be no PDF version of this book.\nStretch Goals\nGiven the chance to expand the project, of course, we\u2019ll do so. Some of the stretch goals are hidden but we have unlocked more than a dozen stretch goals since hitting our primary funding goal (an up-to-date list is present in the FAQ). These include additional books, more art, new PC races, extra adventures, demonic cults, and other rewards for adventuring under a pitiless sun!\nAnd just a hint of what is to come...\nSupporter Goals: We reached ALL of our supporter goals, which were unlocked by the number of backers, not the number of dollars pledged. Thank you for your continued support!\nWe\u2019ll ship your Southlands core book together with the Ten Arabian Nights adventure collection and Southlands Bestiary. The special Through the Red Portal booklet will most likely ship separately, as will the Southlands dice and coins.\nFor international backers, we\u2019re working with a European partner. This means that the costs are somewhat better than shipping from the US directly, so we have lowered the overall cost to you. \nCanadian backers, your shipping works out slightly higher than listed (at the expected weight). However, we're absorbing that cost rather than adding more expensive Canadian-only reward tiers.\nThe various stretch goals include some that unlock certain add-ons that will appeal to some but not all backers. These include extra books, maps, Hero Lab data files, and other items. \nPlease note that some add-ons will be delivered separately (in some cases, months earlier). These have separate shipping costs.\nSouthlands Core Book $30: Add a second copy of the core book shipped in the US for just $30 (you save by combining shipping). For international backers, an extra book is $40, including combined shipping with existing print rewards. Note that this add-on is $39 if you are a US backer with all-digital rewards, or $49 if you are an international backer with all-digital rewards. Ships July 2015.\nSouthlands Hero Lab Data Files $9: Add the Hero Lab files for all the archetypes, monsters, feats, spells, and more from the Southlands to your pledge. \nSouthlands Bronze Coin $19: A hand-forged, hefty bronze coin from the Southlands, added to your pledge. Includes shipping.\nSouthlands Bestiary PDF $12: Add the Bestiary PDF to your rewards.\nSouthland Bestiary Print $29: Add the full-color, printed Bestiary to your rewards. Includes shipping to the US for print backers. International shipping is a bit complex, but it will be available for combined shipping with other print books.\nSouthlands Bestiary Print+PDF $39: Add both the print and PDF Southlands Bestiary to your rewards, and get a break on the price of getting them separately. Includes US shipping for print backers; international shipping still in flux, but this title will be available for combined shipping with other print books.\nSouthlands 7-Dice Set: Add-on available for $14 for the US (includes shipping), and $28 internationally (includes international shipping--we're working on a solution to bring that down for European backers).\nDeep Magic Book+PDF $55: Our most recent Kickstarter book. For international backers, Deep Magic is $76 (including separate shipping). Ships November 2014.\nDeep Magic Special Runebound Edition + PDF $130: Leatherette cover with foil stamp. Only 6 copies available (our reserve against missing/late backers from Deep Magic). Separate shipping is included for 2014 delivery. First come, first served.\nMidgard Hardcover, Autographed, +PDF $50: Get a signed copy of the Midgard Campaign Setting. For international backers, Midgard Campaign Setting add-on comes to $69. Ships in November 2014.\nNew Paths Compendium, Exclusive Color Edition, and PDF, $40: New classes, feats, and magic for the Theurge, Shaman, Spell-Less Ranger, White Necromancer, Savant, Battle Scion, and more. This exclusive color edition is available only directly from Kobold Press. For international backers, this add-on comes to $54 with shipping.

The creative team is experienced, so the primary risk on this project is that one or more of the key creative partners will fall ill or suffer some injury that prevents their completing their portion of the work in a timely way.\n\nFortunately, much of the Southlands setting, race, class, and adventure design, development, and editing work is already done; we worked hard in spring and summer. Right now, the majority of the book is in editing and some is ready to be laid out. Likewise, we already have cover, maps, and interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book.\n\nThe other challenge will be in gathering, choosing, developing, and editing monster text from backers, and in doing the same for new design work from stretch goals. Backers who pledge at those levels must deliver text promptly and it will be developed and edited fairly quickly. While theoretically one backer could hold up the project, in practice if a backer fails to deliver a monster for inclusion in a timely way, we'll move ahead on deadline rather than hold up the entire project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "Southlands Archetypes and Magic in New Paths Compendium", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "Yggdrasil Fanzine and Midgard Revised", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Expanded Demon Cults Ends Monday", "update_content": "It's true!

Win the round to get your hands on the most valuable loot, but beware! Just because you claimed the loot does not mean you get to keep it! Pirate Loot will come in a convenient 2-part box, holding all 108 cards you need to play and the rulebook. Inside you will find the following:\n23 Loot cards, from a crate of monkeys to a golden peg leg\n77 Draw cards, each one representing a pirate you can recruit. Each pirate belongs to one of four factions: brutal, clever, greedy, or lazy.\n4 rank cards, for breaking ties at the end of the round.\n4 ship cards, used to store your ill-gotten gains.\nA simple sheet explaining the rules of the game.\nPirate Loot can be played in as little as 20 minutes, but a full game should last about an hour. You can check out the complete rules below.\nPirate Loot is being produced by Minotaur Games. It is designed by Jason Bulmahn, a veteran of the gaming industry, with art by Scott Kurtz and Dylan Meconis and graphic design by Mari Kolkowsky.\nLearning to be a pirate is easy, but winning this cutthroat game will take both strategy and a bit of luck.\nEach player is dealt a hand of 5 draw cards, each one representing a pirate you can recruit to your ship. On your turn, you select one of these cards and put it into play next to your ship, then draw back up 5 cards. While every pirate has a value they add to your ship, some also have effects that trigger when they come into play, such as forcing other players to discard cards or even stealing loot. Some pirates also have effects that last as long as they are in play, granting you a lasting edge.\nPlay then proceeds to the next player until someone draws the \u201cSet Sail\u201d card. Once that card is revealed, each player gets one more turn before you figure out who gets the haul!\nOnce the ships have sailed, you compare your crew to determine who has the best crew on the high seas. That player gets the loot, but in games of 3 or more, other players might be able to claim a lesser prize as well! You then deal out the cards and keep playing until one player has claimed enough loot to satisfy their scurvy crew and become the pirate admiral.\nTo read the complete rules of the game and download them as a PDF, click this link!\nYou can also play download and play a 2-Person Demo of Pirate Loot!

At this level, the game will have a light art approach, with each most cards in a suit sharing the same piece of art.\nStretch Goal #1: Full Art ($20,000)\nOnce we reach $20,000 we will be able to afford unique art for nearly every card in the deck. The only exception is for a small number of cards that are duplicated in the deck (where it is better to have the same art so that they are easily recognizable).\n Stretch Goal #2: Bonus Cards ($30,000)\nWe will print 6 bonus loot cards to add to your game. These will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above.These cards will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nStretch Goal #3: 6 Player Expansion ($40,000)\nIf we can raise $40,000 we unlock an entirely new deck of cards. This 55 card deck will include TWO entirely new suits of pirate to add to your game, allowing it to be played with up to 6 players! The first suit is UNDEAD pirates, allowing you to add a horde of shambling zombie pirates to your game. The second suit is SNEAKY pirates! These shadowy pirates let you flip some of your crew face-down, to keep the other captains guessing! This deck will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above.\nStretch Goal #4: Bonus Cards ($50,000)\nAt this level, we will add 6 bonus crew cards to the game. These will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above. These cards will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nStretch Goal #5: Challenge Deck ($60,000)\nThe high seas are a dangerous place and with this 54 card expansion deck, you can pit your crew against all manner of threats, from the King's Navy to the deadly Kraken! During the game, you can take on these challenges by getting a crew of sufficient strength, allowing you to claim the card and gain a bonus for the rest of the game! This deck will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above.\n Stretch Goal: 1,000 Backers!\nA horde of Pirates! If we can reach 1,000 backers for Pirate Loot, we will add 4 BONUS PIRATE CREW CARDS to every backer at the Gunner Level and above! If we also hit $40K and unlock the 6-Player Expansion Deck, this number will jump to 6 bonus cards! Each one of these cards will be called the HORDE and you will get one for each faction. These cards will be an exclusive to Kickstarter backers!\nBeyond the Horizon\nWho knows what hides beyond the horizon, but it is sure to be exciting!\nCosts\nCreating, printing, and shipping games is not cheap, but with your help, we can make a game that will be a treasured part of your library. Your pledge will make that happen and here is how. To fund the basic version of the game, we need $16,000. After the Kickstarter fees that leaves us with around $14,500. Here how the costs approximately break down:\n$5,000 \u2013 Art, layout, and design\n$6,000 \u2013 Printing\n$3,500 \u2013 Distribution and shipping\nThese budget ratios should hold up well beyond our initial funding goal. The cost to print a copy of each game will go down if we increase the size of our print run, but we expect those savings will be offset by the increased cost of shipping all those games to you!\nProcess\nOnce we hit our funding goal, the creation process will get underway as soon as possible. Art and design should take about three months total to get the game ready for print. This process might take a bit longer if we unlock the expansion decks and bonus cards. Once the files are completed, they can be shipped to our printer, who has already given us very competitive bids for the printing of the game and any bonuses. The printing and shipping process will take approximately four months. Assuming we do not get held up, our fulfillment partner, Card Kingdom, should be able to ship your game to you shortly thereafter.\nRetailers\nWe know that retailers are a vital part in supporting any game and we want to make sure that Pirate Loot can become an attractive part of your store's offerings. We plan to make Pirate Loot available through the common distribution channels (ACD, Alliance, Diamond, etc). In addition, we are hoping to create a retailer kit with special \"Store Only\" promotional cards and rules for running Pirate Loot in your play space.

Woot! Thank you!\nLove and hate are the most powerful emotions\u2026and that\u2019s why we are toying with them for the sake of amusement in Love 2 Hate: A Party Game for Inappropriate People! The game is designed and ready for production. We just need the money to print it, which is where you come in!\nLearn How!\nLove 2 Hate is the card game of finishing sentences (and laughing at the result!). The rules couldn't be simpler.\nThere are two types of cards, sentence starters and finishers. At the start of the game everyone draws a hand of 5 finishers. Players then take it in turns to act as the judge. A judge draws the top starter card. Example starters include Cosplayers, Moist Towelettes, Crabs, and Mimes.\nThen the judge has a decision to make: love or hate?! Let\u2019s say the judge draws the Hippies card. That can be played one of two ways:\nI love the way hippies\u2026\nOr\nI hate the way hippies\u2026\nThe remaining players now look through their finisher cards and chose one to play, face down. The judge reads these aloud and then chooses the best one. What does best mean? That\u2019s up to the judge, so know your fellow gamers! It might be the funniest, craziest, or most outrageous, depending on the judge, so choose wisely!\nFinished sentences then look like this: \nThe winner keeps the card and play continues until one player gets 5 cards. Easy, right? And fun!\nThe Game\nLove 2 Hate is a party game from designer Colm Lundberg. At the lowest level of funding, it will include 254 cards, but we have 324 cards ready to go so that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for (stretch goals willing). If the game funds, we will be selling it to book and game stores as we do with our regular product line. However, we are doing a Kickstarter exclusive expansion deck of 60 cards as something special for the early adopters of Love 2 Hate. Better yet, you've got an opportunity to contribute a card to the expansion! See the Party Lover reward tier for more info on that.\nShipping\nShipping prices suck. There are no two ways about it. We are partnering with a company that has warehouses in the US and England to try to keep these costs down as much as we can, and we are subsidizing shipping a bit. The downside of our shipping arrangement (from a Kickstarter clarity point of view) is that we've had to create three versions of each reward level. So Pirate Lover USA, Pirate Lover EU and Canada, and Pirate Lover International all have the same rewards, they are just priced differently for shipping purposes. Pick the International option if you live somewhere other than the USA, EU, or Canada. \nStretch Goals\n$20,000: We will add 35 more cards to the core game.\n$25,000: We will add 20 more cards to the Kickstarter exclusive expansion.\n$30,000: We will add 35 more cards to the core game.\n$35,000: We will add 20 more cards to the Kickstarter exclusive expansion.\n Walk the Plank\nSeveral reward levels give you the option of getting our Walk the Plank card game in addition to Love 2 Hate for the crazy low price of $5. Walk the Plank is a trick-taking card game so easy you can play it with your grandma or your kids (and this has been tested with actual grandmas and actual kids).

Your mission is to find the optimal series of commands for the robot so it can execute its job.\nBefore Algo can reach the exit, it will have to carry around toxic containers, store them away safely and rely on the help of other robots when there is more work to be done than it can handle by itself.\nHere\u2019s an example of a very easy level and 2 different solutions. The first solution is to put all the commands one after the other in the main line of commands (not very efficient) and the second way is to use a function (a set of commands) to optimize Algo's laziness factor. In other words, the shorter the main line, the higher the score.\n\"Algo-Bot is there to entertain *while* training in the sort of basic Jedi mind skills involved in making notoriously weak-minded computers to do what you want them to do\" said our backer, Tom Kiefer\nAlgo-Bot has been Greenlit by the community on Steam! All we need to do now, is to finish the game.\nFor every new pledge we\u2019ll donate one license to a student.\nRegister your school here.\n The most important thing we learned about Kickstarter is that social networking is everything. Each backer that shares our Kickstarter page can bring us more backers. That's the reason we'd like to encourage you to share our page and tell your friends about it! \nEvery time the page reaches a Social Goal, backers receive the extra gift associated with that goal (if funded). Backers of digital pledges will have to pay 10$ of shipping if they want to receive physical gifts. \nThe gameplay has been imagined by Guillaume Bouckaert who was the crazy Level Designer on Shifting World. If you know this game, you'll probably understand what I mean.\nCore gameplay, background story and characters\nWelcome to Algo Corp, assistant! It's your first day on the job and I bet you don't understand anything of what exactly you have to do. Let me give you a tour.\nMy name is Tina, I am the mechanical engineer of this power plant. My job is to make sure that you don't mess up my robots. They are delicate and cost an arm and a leg. Secondly, I am here to explain what your job is and how to do it properly. \nRobots are machines and like all machines they require commands to function. That is where you come into play. Your job is to give orders to these robots -- not to destroy them, please, the last assistant was terrible and the power plant lost a fortune. \nSee the blue round robot? That's your main robot, Algo. Help him find the shortest path to the exit represented by the red node to win the level. Keep in mind that you will only be able to exit the level if the node turns green. To make this possible, you'll have to sort all the crates, represented here in green and violet. Pick up a crate from a spot and leave it on a node of the same color set. Doesn't seem too complicated, what do you think? \nPLAY\n\nCollection\nAlgo Corp likes to reward its employees when they are doing a good job. Sometimes, you can complete special missions to unlock skins that can be used on Algo. \nAt the $250 pledge level you will be able to create your own skin for the release version of the game.\nThe commands\nThey are quite easy to understand. \nThe first group is for directional/actions purposes: straight, left, right and activate.\nThe second group contains the functions. A function can be used to program a set of orders and to execute this set multiple times without duplicating it.\nThe third group is made of variables and conditions, you\u2019ll use these in more advanced levels of the game.\nThe last one is for control: Cancel/delete a command from the command lines, start/pause the robot and also change its speed.\nDear programmers, this part is specifically dedicated to you. You are probably wondering what Algo-Bot has to offer, for both beginners and veterans alike, from a coding point of view. In other words, this game is a tool that allows you to play around with your programming logic, no matter which programming language(s) this is. You will play with the programming basics, such as functions, variables, condition, loops,...\nBeginners\nOk, so you are a brand new coder. Welcome! You have to know that there's no place like 127.0.0.1 :-) and there's no place like Algo Corp to learn the basics of coding efficiently. \nMore than teaching you, Algo-Bot is doing it in a fun way while sparing you from hours of book reading. Moreover, we can guarantee that the teaching process is working. The game has been tested in a training center and received very positive feedback. The difficulty curve is quite well balanced but stills needs improvement. But don't you worry! We will strive for perfection so YOU can become a good programmer by bringing you challenges at the right moments.\nExperienced\nWhat will this game offer you? First of all, fun!  It can also test your knowledge and see how good you actually are. Algo-Bot is part of our recruitment process, here at Fishing Cactus. Will you be better than our programmers who created it?\nAfter nearly a year of production, the game is at a working alpha stage with a level editor, a lot of assets produced and a very clear idea of where we are going. The Alpha is already available if you pledge $35. At the $75 pledge level, you'll have access to our level editor with the ability to submit levels for the final version of the game.\nLevel Editor  \nWe want to deliver our backers with early access to a level editor that we are currently using internally to build levels (Tiled). You will use it to send us your levels that can be included inside the final build of the game!\nIn-game coding \nThe initial steps of the game are about learning the logic behind coding: usage of loops and functions, juggling with variables and ultimately synchronize several entities together (yes advanced parts of the game will allow you to control more than one robot at the same time). Once you have played enough with all those mechanics, it would ultimately be good to take a peek behind the scene and view the real code of every single gameplay block. We also want you to be able to manipulate high level code and create new gameplay blocks to be used in the game to some extent, modding. \nPolish-Polish-Polish \nWhile the gameplay is in a rather well defined state now, the overall aspects of the game still require some more polish. We want to improve the sounds, tweak the UI, integrate a better lighting system, add a bit more juicy effects, increase the reactivity of the game and finally extend the story of the game to make it more interesting in the long run.\nPorts \nThe game already runs on Windows but we will port it to Mac and Linux when the specific stretch goals are met. If the campaign goes further than that, we will add even more platforms!\nLocalization\nEnglish, French, German.\nWe already have a running alpha version of the game. You will receive it with any pledge over 35$ but to make this game a successful release, it still needs a bit of graphic design, a full UI revamp, extra animations, testing, better sound design and an in-game editor with Steam Workshop integration. This will allow players to easily build, share and play custom-made levels.\nActually, we would like to have your support so we can fully embrace the game as imagined in the first place. Not to dumb it down like those \u201cOkIlearnedsomethingandsowhat?\u201d games you may have already seen.

We released it in Technobel, a training center and people really liked it. More than just played with it, they learned from it.\nFor every new pledge we\u2019ll donate one license to a student.\n\nRegister you school here\n\nAlso one of the very specific goals we are setting for this project is the free school license. Yes, we would like to offer a free license of the game to all the schools around the world! It might sound crazy but we feel programming is something that impacts everyone, young and old. Learning it will never have been so easy, all thanks to you, for backing us on this project.\n\"I've played through several levels, and so far I can tell that Fishing Cactus has a good thing going (...)

So, we shoted it as often as possible to to a wide variety of audiences.  \nAt first, we showcased the game at Indie Prize where indie-developers and others found it very interesting and enjoyable to play. After that, we had to be sure that Algo-Bot was a good product educationally speaking. So, we submitted it to the Serious Game Expo 2013. The competition was fierce but we won.

Providing logical puzzles that will prove experts they can still learn things. But on the other hand, we need to make the game simple enough for people who don\u2019t know anything about programming.\n\nWe\u2019ve been working on the game for more than a year now and it has been playtested several times in real-life conditions with great success. Core game mechanics have already been developed and the level editor is powerful enough to create hundreds of levels (the game currently features 60 of them).\n\nAs you may have spotted in the video, Fishing Cactus is not a one-man studio.

The event will be in Atlanta, Georgia, and it\u2019s designed from the \u201cground up\u201d to shock your senses, challenge your mental and physical capabilities, and demand every ounce of courage, strength, and skill you can muster to survive.\nPICK YOUR MISSION TYPE:\n1  -  Hunt down and Battle Zombies & Mutants in a \"undead\" infested, Ultra Scary, Horrific, Top Secret Government Laboratory.\n2  -  Hunt down and Battle Insurgents and other Special Forces Teams in a War-torn Urban Battlefield.\nHave YOU ever wanted to be the HERO in your favorite action movie or your favorite action First Person Shooter (FPS) game\u2026 in Real Life?  Now\u2019s YOUR chance!\nBGnG is an \"In-Person Experience\" with the ultimate in realism, weapons, environments, survival situations, and \"REAL PAIN\" that the user can adjust to their liking. (see video below).  Mix in Hollywood style special effects with incredibly horrific and challenging environments that will test you to the core, and you get a combat / horror experience like you've never seen before.  This is NOT a haunted house so you can\u2019t just close your eyes and run out.  You\u2019re going to have to fight for survival every step of the way through.  If you can!\nHow do we do accomplish this?  Read On!\nREAL GUNS\nA completely new weapon system is changing the face of training for our Military and Law Enforcement today.  The primary weapon we use is a tactical IR based M4 that is fully functional, is the exact same size, shape, weight, and operates exactly like the real M4 assault rifle.  This weapon includes recoil, realistic sound, select fire, changeable magazines, and muzzle flash!  It attaches to your combat vest via a military style combat sling, and is incredibly accurate through haze, fog, smoke windows and even weak barricades!  Be careful what you decide to hide behind!\nThis weapon system is available as a long barrel sniper rifle with an available long range scope, a medium barrel assault rifle with an assault scope, or as a short barrel close quarters combat (CQB) version with a micro red dot holographic sight.  \nThe Secondary Weapon is based on the widely successful IR Glock 17 handgun. It features the exact same size, shape, weight, and full functionality as the actual weapon.This includes 80% recoil, realistic sound, safe / fire selection, changeable magazines, and muzzle flash!\nREAL PAIN\nWhen You get shot\u2026 and You will;You\u2019re Gonna Feel it!\nEveryone wears a Pain Belt that you can adjust to your level or feedback, (Players, Actors, Insurgents, Mutants, and Zombies).  Everyone feels the action!\nThe Pain Belt (Penalty Action Includes Nerve Stimulation) will give players an adjustable electric shock from small \u201cHey, what was that?\u201d to \"OMG\"   -  \u201cMedic!\u201d, as a \u201cPenalty\u201d for being \u201cShot or Attacked\u201d by the undead.  This is adjustable to your liking and provides a very real incentive to avoid the Un-Dead and other Combat Teams, while also heightening the intensity of the game.  \nVideo Courtesy Paintball Extravaganza 2013 Trade show\n You can Dish it out but can YOU take it?\nREAL ENVIRONMENTS\nAtlanta is home to the incredibly successful \"Walking Dead\" series and has one of the largest Zombie loving populations in the world.  This provides numerous teaming relationships with production and support companies as well as supporting cast actors who work with Hollywood on an everyday basis. \nBGnG is collaborating with two companies who are currently working with the \"Walking Dead\" series during filming sessions to provide: art, set design and production, props, sound, lights, special effects, and makeup.  With teaming agreements in-place, we will achieve the absolute maximum in hyper realistic environments and special effects for this event.  These guys are real professionals and know how to bring your worst nightmares to life.  By using the best in the industry, we will create incredibly challenging dynamic environments for the Apocalyptic Horror and War-Torn Urban Battlefield tracks.  These environments will be like nothing you've ever experienced before. \nSince conception, and numerous planning sessions with our team, consultants, and partners, we have completed the storyboards, story line, set design, individual room layouts, action sequences and timing, and all initial drawings and scripting for the two individual tracks. We are currently working on the props, models, puzzles, secrets, and dynamic mission elements for each section, and coming up with some of the most gruesome and challenging situations ever put into production.  Your entire team will be tested on many levels and we\u2019re sure you're going to hear one of them say, \u201cI\u2019m not ripping his eye out for the Retina Scanner so we can get the door open\u2026You do it!\u201d \nREAL MISSIONS\nThe Apocalyptic Horror Combat Survival track is so horrific, that we expect at least 20% to ring the \u201cI Quit\u201d Bell\" rather than continue to battle their way through the environment.  There is no doubt that this will be a tough challenge both mentally and physically.  This mission is based on the story line of a pandemic virus outbreak which has caused unbelievably horrific conditions and thrust society to the brink of extinction.  Your team will have to break into a huge secret government lab facility that is heavily infested with Mutants and Zombies.  Your mission is to search for and destroy any undead inhabitants, solve numerous room based puzzles and secrets, rescue the scientific team that\u2019s feverishly working on the cure, and ultimately deliver the viral antidote to the city\u2019s main water supply; without getting infected or killed.  Expect this mission to last over an hour with total experience in the 3 hour range.  By the way, the facility's new inhabitants have turned this place into PURE HELL as the darkest, creepiest, nastiest place you've ever seen.  If the inhabitants don\u2019t get you, the environment will.                              \nThe War-Torn Urban Battlefield Combat track has been designed with direct input from brave warriors who fought throughout multiple recent combat operations to be as accurate and challenging as possible, while recreating the stress and physical demands of a hyper realistic military training session.  This will include numerous dangerous missions from, one shot and you\u2019re out, to rescue, search and destroy, attack and defend, domination, and capture the flag based scenarios, while battling with insurgents and the other team.  If you choose this track, you and your team will have the options of either working through several different time based scenario matches or battling through the same scenario for the allotted time period.  These periods will run between 1 to 2 hours depending on mission type, time of day and conditions in the environment.  Your total experience will be in the 3 hour range with suiting up, getting weapons, briefing, and debriefing.  These will include day and night missions with varying weather conditions created and controlled by Headquarters. No two battles will be alike. \nREAL COMBAT\nBGnG features an all dynamic experience that is affected by the choices you and your team make. How you interact with other Players, Mutants, and Zombies, and how you attempt to solve Puzzles and Mission Goals, will directly affect the non-linear level design.  Make the wrong choice and you could be opening the wrong door to an all-out Horde attack.  \nIn this Experience, two teams enter the Facility at the same time from opposite ends, creating a changing dynamic combat scenario.  The choices are yours alone as how Your Team will work together to achieve Victory, who you will partner with, who you will save, and who you will let the Zombies and Mutants eat.\nDon\u2019t worry, we will have plenty of Nurses handy should you need to be Ripped up\u2026 Uh, I mean, Stitched up.\nREAL STATS TRACKING AND LIVE ONLINE REPORTING\nYou and Your Team will be pitted against other Teams from all over the Country and will Battle through HELL and back, to see who is the best.  And YES, we Track, Score, and Rank all Your Stats including:\nTotal Shots Fired\nTotal Hits & Misses\nAccuracy of Hit (Head or Body)\nTotal times You\u2019re hit\nWhere You\u2019re Hit\nHow many kills you have\nHow many times you died\nYour Kill / Death ratio\nPuzzles solved\nSecrets found\nMission Goals Achieved\nTime & Effectiveness\nAnd even Your Heart Rate!\nEach individual is ranked and tracked against all other payers, as well as, team against team.  All \u201cStats\u201d will be available online for all to see.  Do you have what it takes to be one of the best?  Will your team win the Ultimate Competition and bragging rights that go along with being the best?  Will you be ranked as the best real-life player in the world?\nWhy Stats really matter?\nPRIVATE WINNERS ONLY LOUNGE\nWinning Teams will get to hang out in the Winners Lounge.\nWorking together as a cohesive team is paramount to success and includes the privileges that go along with winning.  Each night in the Winners Lounge there will be \u201cSpecial Incentives\u201d based on the night. \nEnjoy hanging out with Actors, & Actresses from the event, jamming to the beat of pumping music, grabbing a beer (21 years and older), great food, pool tables. video games and chilling out with your Team relaxing as Winners.

We can\u2019t tell you who but you\u2019re going to be impressed!   \nEVENT KICK-OFF BY REAL U.S. SPECIAL FORCES OPERATORS!\nTo kick off the event, we have invited a real U.S. Special Forces Team to come in and set the bar for all other teams to be measured against.  If you can beat their high score, you get a FREE ROUND on the house.  At the end of the event, we will invite the Top 3 teams back to face the real Special Forces Team, head to head in a challenge of \u201cthe Best of the Best\u201d.

Pick your Pledge Level and secure your spot.  Then, form your team, pick your experience (Battlefield Style Combat or Apocalyptic Horror Combat), and get ready to go to WAR!  The Hordes are coming and they are all HUNGRY, MEAN, and NASTY!\nNo, we\u2019re NOT responsible when a Big, Bad, Scary Zombie shoots you in the face, covers you with Bloody Guts and Gore, and you go running home to your mommy!\nA similar project was completed down under in Melbourne, Australia, where over 6,000 warriors braved Hordes of Zombies in an abandoned warehouse.  We have designed Blood, Guts, 'n Glory to be a vastly superior, fully immersive, and more horrific as an all ADULT Combat / Horror Survival experience.  We are taking this to a whole new (Ultra-Realistic) level like has never been seen before.\nCAN MY LITTLE SISTER OR BROTHER GET IN?  \nYOU MUST BE 18 or older to experience BGnG.\nJust in case this is a little too much for you, what can you do to get out alive?  Every room will have an \u201cI QUIT Bell\u201d.  Ring the Bell and you will be escorted out of the event.\nWith BGnG, you can interact with the experience in numerous ways:  Be part of a 5 man team and fight together as a cohesive unit or be part of the Horde as one of the Undead and fight as a Mutant or Zombie with Butchering & PAIN weapons.  You can also take part in the mission itself as an Actor or Actress in a \u201cMan-down / Woman down\u201d scenario / rescue mission.\nHow you will face the experience is up to you.  Will you work with your team mates or go rogue?  Will your team work with the competing team as you cross paths? Will you solve all the room based Puzzles and Secrets and lead your team to victory?  \nAFTER THE KICKSTARTER:\n$100.00 for a Main Ticket on a first come, first serve basis, get in early, and save HUGE!\nWHAT WILL THE USER EXPERIENCE BE LIKE?\nCount on 3-4 solid hours for your one of a kind participant experience\u2026. plus the food, stats, ranking, gloating, boasting, bragging, and music.  \nYour experience will begin with a Safety Briefing, waiver signing, and getting suited up for combat.  Next, you\u2019ll get instructions and training on the Combat, Weapons, and PAIN gear that you will be using.  From there, you and your team will attend a \u201cSituational Briefing\u201d on just how Hard and Horrific this thing is going to be.\nFollowing the Situation Briefing, you will attend an Intelligence Briefing to get your team up to speed on the mission goals and what MUST be accomplished to successfully complete your objectives.  These are constantly changing.  Your Intelligence Officer will be your Support Personnel (SP) for the entire mission and will help and direct you, as needed, throughout the mission.   This may be a nasty Drill Sergeant, a Geeky Nerd, or a Beautiful Woman!  Each has their own unique advantages!\nNOTE...If your Support Personnel (SP) dies during the mission, Your Team loses 50% of their points and (IF) Your Team wins the match, Your Party Time in the Private Winners Lounge is cut in half. \nTHE EVENT PLAN - HOW IT ALL WORKS\nBGnG is opening for a limited season of (8 weeks) with limited space.  If this campaign is not successful there will be no event, so pledge your support today for one of the HOTTEST tickets listed on Kickstarter. \nBGnG is scheduled to kick-off on Wednesday, October 29th and go through Sunday, December 31st.  Our season will run on Thursday & Friday nights, and all day Saturday & Sunday.\n\nEach ticket (except The Actors) comes with a Primary Weapon. You can choose either the M4 Carbine Assault Rifle, M4 Sniper Rifle, M4 CQB Rifle, or the Glock 17 sidearm as your Primary weapon.\nSome ticket levels offer a Secondary weapon (it \u201cmay\u201d be possible to choose 2 M4's, however you can always Rock with double Glocks!).  You can always upgrade or add-on to your weapon load-out package at the event, as well.  If you choose a ticket without a secondary option, these can be added to your load-out when you book your playing time or on the day of your game.\nUPGRADES INCLUDE:\nRifle Scopes  -  (Sniper, ACOG or Hologrphic Red dot).  \nFront/Forward Grips for Rifles.  \nGrenades Simulators (Smoke, Concussion and FRAG).  \nGoPro Camera Rental to record your experience.  \nBGnG T-Shirts.  \nReal Custom Dog Tags with your name, team name and team slogan.\nIndividual and Team Portraits with the BGnG Hot Babes\nComplete custom made DVD movie to capture, document and record your team's entire experience, from the initial briefing to partying in the Winners Lounge.

And Head shots = Double Points!\nHOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED\nBGnG was founded with the creative idea of being the most realistic In-Person ultimate real-life entertainment experience and we need Your Help to bring this Ultimate Combat / Horror Event to life.\nThe funds we raise in this Kickstarter Campaign will be used for the Facility, Setup, Production, Props, Engineering and Construction cost, and the Weapons Systems.  This build out will support both Horror & Combat tracks.\nThe more we Raise\u2026the Bigger, Bad\u2019r & Cooler the Experience we build.\nMaking the Kickstarter Goal is the first thing we need to do to get the ball rolling, and to get You in the Greatest Real-Life In-Person Combat Horror Survival experience of your life.\nWHAT DO WE GET FOR REACHING THE GOAL?\nWe have set the minimum Kickstarter Goal at $125,000 which will allow (4) - 5 man combat teams plus actors and support personnel, to enter the facility and fight their way through the Battlefield or the Horror tracks together, or in competition! New teams will start every 15 to 30 minutes.  \nExpect a 3\u20134 hour total experience!\nThe Holy Grail will be to exceed the final stretch goal which will allow us to maximize the fidelity, realism, and user experience used throughout the facility. This will include additional rooms to explore, secrets to uncover, more puzzles to solve, and a much larger Horde of Mutants and Zombies to kill. This level will also increase the overall size of the Battlefield arena with more bases, obstacles, and mission goals to complete.   \nWill YOU be too Scared to enter? \nWhen we meet the Stretch Goal of $250,000.00, we will expand to (8) - 5 man teams and add the Command and Control Facility, which will also be used as an Attack and Defend and Rescue Mission Base. \nWhen we meet the Stretch Goal of $500,000.00, we will expand to (12) - 5 man teams and add the \u201cBlood-Tower\u201d Facility, which will allow Repelling and Zip Lines and increase the number of rooms to navigate in the Horror track, as well as, additional props, actors, Zombies and Mutants, and puzzles to solve.\nWhen we meet the Stretch Goal of $750,000.00, we will expand to (16) - 5 man teams and add the Top Secret Government Laboratory facility. This level will include the complete scripted story line and secret laboratory facility build out of Dr. Marianne Nettles and her research team, as they work desperately to develp a cure for the outbreak.\n...Dr. Nettles is the last known research scientist in mTOR (Survival Gene) research. Her team is racing against time and circumstances to create the mTOR Anti-Serum before all humanity is lost for good.  Dr. Nettles and her team have fled their overrun facility at the Center for Disease Control in downtown Atlanta. They have restarted the Anti-Serum production process at a Top Secret classified Government facility on the edge of the city. Time is not on their side as the Hordes have infested the facility and breached most of the security barriers, killed many of the workers, and turned the place into a true, hellish nightmare. The last panicked communication with Dr. Nettles was garbled but stated \"we are under attack and moving from the incubation center to the main laboratory\" to finish the Anti-Serum. She estimated less than an hour before the undead would breach the final barriers and reach them.\nYour mission as an Elite, U.S. Special Forces team will be to breach the facility through the main Security section and work your way to the team, destroying any undead inhabitants along the way. There will be numerous barriers and rooms you must penetrate to reach Dr. Nettles' team at the heart of the facility. Once Dr. Nettles and her team are secure and the Anti-Serum has completed the processing cycle, your team must get it to the city's main water supply and infuse the Anti-Serum into the main pumping station. There is very little power at the facility which will help your team of Special Forces Operators remain hidden under the cover of darkness from much of the infested population. One wrong step could spell disaster for you, your team, and the entire mission.  Thus, it\u2019s imperative that you are successful. Humanity is depending on your courage, bravery, and unstoppable will to succeed.\nWhen we meet the Stretch Goal of $1,000,000.00, we will expand to (20) - 5 man teams and add the War-Torn Urban Battlefield District battleground. This will include the complete scripted story line and facility build out of the Urban district with multiple levels, static and moving targets and vehicles, and introduce booby traps and laser triggered explosions. This level will also introduce the Insurgent teams (actors) who will know the facility inside and out and work to take you down any way they can.\n...July 4th, 2016, 0500 hours - What\u2019s left of the War-Torn Urban District is a broken city in the Western province of Anci Bahara, located roughly 129 kilometers west of Euphrates River.  The city dates from Babylonian times and was host to important Jewish academies for many centuries.\nFollowing several prior battles, elite American Special Forces warriors are back again fighting to secure the province from the hostilities of tribal insurgents and the Mujahedeen, commonly known as Jihad extremist.\nThe insurgents and Mujahedeen enter what\u2019s left of the destroyed city from the West while the U.S. Special Forces move in from the South. Each side is fighting to reach secure bases along the perimeter and capture the remnants of the main command base at the city's center; where women and children are hiding in an abandoned mosque, clinging to their very lives.\nIn addition to the approaching forces from the West, Intel reports from friendly tribesmen indicate possible improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and imbedded supporters (insurgents) to the extremist facet and are an immense threat to the US teams.\nIt is H-Hour and the clock is ticking. The results of this critical mission will go down in the history books for future generations to read. Will they read that you were a hero? \nHOW DO WE GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED AND MEET ALL THE STRETCH GOALS?\nDown-under, they raised $243,480 with 688 Supporters (0.015 success), out of a population of approx. 4 million and had 6,200 people attend the event.  That averages $353.89 each.\nWithin 100 miles of Atlanta there\u2019s approx. 11 million people.  To meet our Largest Stretch Goal of $1,000,000, using the same (0.015% success) 16,500 supporters, we only need to average $61.00 each.\nWE CAN DO THIS!!\nPlease Pledge Now and send this project to all your friends.  \nTogether we can make this happen!  \nThank YOU from the BGnG Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk and Challenges:\n\nLike all business ventures there are associated risk and challenges that must be identified and handled on a timely basis. This project, while it seems huge in scale, is mitigated by working with a select team of industry professionals that do this everyday. BGnG has teaming agreement in place with 3 very large commercial companies that will handle the bulk of the design, fabrication, production, installation and setup. These companies do much larger projects on a regular basis for the filming industry and are currently working directly as contractors on the The Walking Dead series.\n\nBy teaming with professional contractors and mitigating risk through detailed design, modeling and pre-build setup and testing, we will work to drive the risk and challenges to a minimum.\n\nIn the end there will be things that come up but both our teaming partners and the contractors we'll use, are used to working through these challenges and keeping projects on track. Most importantly, we'll keep our community and customers updated with regular progress updates and a Live Forum, to allow for all to follow along as this project comes to life.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Tejay Beauparlant\nFirst created \u00b7 5 backed\nFor the last 24 years I have worked as a Technical Leader and engineer in the communications fields and have focused on bringing people...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "We have been published on Engadget!", "update_content": "***    Quick Update    ****\nGreat news everyone!\nWe were published on Engadget last night.\nPlease see the article HERE\nThanks for everyone's support and get ready....

I live in Minnesota, but I was born and raised in the mountains of Kentucky. I am an ordained Baptist minister. I am a husband and have been blessed with two wonderful children. I lead a small home based church mainly comprised of my family and extended family. I am passionate about God and His Word and spreading the truth of the gospel of Jesus. Growing up in the 21st century and having been a player of games like Super Mario Bro, Tetris, and doodle jump, I thought why is the entertainment area of our lives mainly dominated by secular, non Christian and non Wholesome games? Television has recently been adding more wholesome Christian movies and shows done by Christians, but video games keep getting more and more sexual, magical and violent. One of those Christian filmmakers is my father in law, Stephen Orsatti of Six Days Studios, who is currently in the process and raising funds for his documentary called \" Mystery of Noah's Flood\" you can visit his web site and contribute at MysteryofNoahsflood.com.\nI have started the foundations for a Christian Wholesome RPG (role playing game) that involves biblical teaching and life lessons for the player or \"main character\", excluding the sex, violence and magic of modern video games. The games title is Soul Sword RPG and is themed from Ephesians 6, where the Apostle Paul speaks of spiritual warfare and putting on the \"Whole armor of God\" that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil! Let's make entertainment that is available to both the Christian and the world that teaches and points to Christ. Contributing to this cause will make a remarkable impact on the world!\nI am asking contributions for this game which is already in the first baby stages of development for:\nResources, music packs, tilesets, advertising expenses, creating an LLC for the game and web hosting for a website where the game can be purchased and downloaded when completed. \nI know you may be thinking, who wants their child sitting in front of a video game all day whether its wholesome or not. I agree, this game will be intended only for children 13 and older. I plan on incorporating set points in the game where it will be suggested for the player to quit the game and go outside, play with friends and family. As a parent, I would also monitor and set time limits to game play and that it come only after school work. And of course God should always be put first before anything. (I speak of myself also)\nThe games artwork, Villains, map layout and story will be done mostly by me and some of my friends through the RPG maker program on windows and will only be available for play on windows. Our company I call 4-8 Games, 4-8 from Philippians 4:8. I plan a release date with the help of funds in the Summer of 2016 at the latest, or possibly earlier. My main goal is getting the word out through advertising. When completed, the game will be available for download on the games website or you can purchase a disk copy. Those who contribute the $20 or more will get a free physical copy of the disk. If this first game is successful, I'd like to make future games for IOS, Android and other gaming systems. Making more wholesome video games available to the world.\nAny amount you would be able to give would be helpful. Whether you are able to contribute or not, your support and prayers are greatly appreciated. Be sure to spread the word to your friends and family. Thank you and God bless.\n If you have any questions or comments you can email soulswordrpg@gmail.com\nBe sure to visit the official Soul Sword RPG facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/soulswordrpggame  for more details, pics and current progress of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are several risks involved such as finding and getting permission to use certain music and tilesets for the game if all else fails i may have to create every element myself if that happend I would work hard with my team to overcome them and complete the game by the release date of Summer 2016\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Paul Perkins\n3 created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi, my name is Paul Perkins.

Nice to meet you!\nWhat is Ninja Bros / Ninja Bros Academy?\nNinja Bros / Ninja Bros Academy is a series of games in development to teach math, science, language and more to elementary, middle school, and high school students. Ninja Bros Academy is the educational side, and Ninja Bros is the name of the collection of characters in general. \nWhich specific Ninja Bros game is this kickstarter for?\nThis is for Ninja Bros Academy : Learn a Language. We will be releasing with French, Spanish, and German as the first run, hopefully more following soon afterwards.\nHave you done anything I'd know?\nWe've previously finished and released a game called Ninjabra. Ninjabra was released in 2012, and was a tower defense style game that taught algebra concepts. Due to the fact that most parents saw the name Ninja+bra, they didn't realize it was algebra, and thought the game was about bras and breasts, which it definitely was not about. We've since then changed to Ninja Bros and Ninja Bros Academy which tested better with parents, and we're moving forward with Ninja Bros as the main name for the series now and in the future. On a side note, the project also used the working title \"Dragon's Blade Academy\" which we did make some appearances at comic conventions under that name, but for legal reasons with Naruto: Dragon Blade Chronicles, and another game titled Dragon's Blade for the Nintendo Wii, we wanted to avoid legal conflict before it happened. \nWhat do you plan on using the money for?\nRight now there is enough assets to finish the game as we stand, but with limited funding, there's limited content and a limited amount of creativity that can be achieved. There are some things we're not happy with: \nHaving to use royalty free assets in the environment, rather than custom designed levels with unique and fresh environments\nLimited Characters and content. There's so much we want to do and include, different levels coming from different books and different concepts\nAudio (sound effects, ambient sound, professional character voicing)\nContent (hiring competent professional translators to voice over the content)\nWhy is the cost so low? Video games take a lot more than $12,000 to develop. \nThey absolutely do, however I'm putting \"my money where my mouth is\" and taking money out of my own personal savings and credit cards etc. The entire game takes well over $12,000 to develop, but there's already assets that have been developed, as well as more funds in the bank for this as well. \n... and you're using money to pay yourself, right?\nNope, aside from going through me temporarily before the checks get written to the freelancers, the money doesn't stay in my account. Every penny is going out to freelancers, mostly for 3d modeling, some web design and marketing, and sound engineering. I'm personally financially sound, as well as putting my own money from my own pocket into the game as well, I'm not looking for someone to help fund my lunch. Kickstarter money is for the project, it is -NOT- my money for my pocket.\nBut I'm a 3d-modeler/level designer/etc, couldn't I just help you develop the game?\nHeck yes! If you're involved in 3d-modeling, and level design especially, we'd love to hear from you. If you'd like to contribute with your talent and skillset, by all means get in touch with us. :)\nIs there something I can see of the game that's currently being developed?\nI'm glad you asked...\n....and you can check it out at http://demo.ninjabros.com. Please understand that NinjaBros.com is not currently up and running yet, but you can check us out @NinjabraGame on twitter. \nPLAY\n\nIs this a legit kickstarter?\nYes, 100% legit. I wanted to make sure I've included enough to let you know it's already in development. It's taking longer than I'd like, but I've done this before being managed and funded by myself, as well as worked in the game development industry previously at Disney for smaller titles like the Spy Kids game (I hate admitting that), and Fisher Price. \nWill you be working on more games after this one?\nAbsolutely. The next project after this one is changing up the gameplay dynamics of our Ninjabra game that we previously released as a straightforward non-math tactical tower defense game, and submitting to Steam for approval to sell on their store as the title \"Ninja Bros: Tactics\". After that, we'll be working on a science title as well.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges? I could go on for hours. Modeling & Animation teams dropping out, problems with incorrect licensing of assets, or people reselling assets they don't own, people misunderstanding the name of your game (read \"Have you done anything I'd know\", lol).

We wanted to give a view of our game as played by a group of different ages.  Michael, from the center, wrote us this morning on how the game went.  Here is what he had to say:\n\"The game is easy to set up, and a blast to play. It just doesn't reverse the role of the player, playing as the Risen, instead of the Living, it puts choices on the table that could make or break your game. If you pick the wrong Living card to fight, you could be giving the easier cards to your opponent, which you want to avoid. It's more than just flip a card, add some numbers, and deal with it. It makes you make choices that affect the outcome, on different levels. Not a braiiin burner, but it makes you think more.\nFrom the students, the overall feeling was \"Can we play again?!\" They loved it. They enjoyed the ability to basically pick the Living that the opponent would have to deal with.\n\"I like playing as the zombie, but I like how we have to pick our obstacle.\"\n\"It's fun to think about which would be easy for you, but to make sure that the other players don't have it easy, either.\"\n\"It's a lot of fun, and I want to reshuffle and play it again, right away.\"\nThe replay-ability of the game, not only of the two different decks, but of the different characters, lends itself to multiple plays without the possibility of repetition. It's random, and the decks either hate you, or draw in your favor, but either way, it's a blast to play\"\nThank you Michael Guigliano, and the kids at the tutoring center, for your feedback and helping with the game!\n Click the link below to take a look at the rule book. \nhttp://firesquadron.com/brains/Rules.pdf\nHere is a game play Video explaining the rules:\nEach game released by Fire Squadron is \"Fire Tested\u201d. \u201cFire Testing\u201d involves a two step process:\n1.

You can still get the book here!\nSnow White is an adventurous fairy tale compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, designed for four to six 6th-8th level characters.\nLove is firmly in the northern air of the Klavek Kingdom, as what started as a marriage of political practicality has turned into the real thing. The Prince of the mighty Klavek Kingdom has met the true love of his life, Lumi Valtatytar, daughter of Lord Herttua Valta of Morsain.  Lumi is loved by everyone for her intelligence, kindness, and not least, for her grace and beauty (which are beyond compare).\nBut the path of true love rarely runs smoothly; the PCs, initially there to help at the wedding, find themselves involved with assassination attempts, political intrigue, dastardly machinations, insurgents, and even murder! At every turn, someone or something seems determined to stop the party from getting Lumi to the church on time. Who is behind all these devious mischief and can they be caught? There\u2019s plenty for the PCs to reflect on as they make every effort to ensure the marriage of the year goes ahead, while fighting to clear their names at the same time.\nSuddenly and without warning, Lumi disappears; the party is responsible for tracking her down and returning her safely to Castle Morsain. Their quest won\u2019t be easy as they must first enter the dreaded Haunted Forest and deal with the seven short folk responsible for Lumi\u2019s abduction.\nDuring their journey the PCs must evade a bottomless pit ravenously following them through the woods, explore the fabled Feyglade, and escape a forest maze and its minotaur guardian. Then the party will come face-to-face with the short folk and a wizened crone before rescuing Lumi and returning to Morsain, where they find themselves under attack as someone tries to prevent them from getting back to the castle. \nSnow White spans over 200 pages (more with stretch goals) and includes:\n\u2022 Multiple paths to reach each stage of the story\n\u2022 Detailed cartography mapping of a full-scale castle\n\u2022 A new multi-stage poison, \u201cAssassin Vine Cocktail\u201d\n\u2022 Rules for running a high speed chase on horseback through a forest\n\u2022 The Alchemist's Journal, detailing the various flora & fauna in the Haunted Forest\n\u2022 New creatures, including the Twisted Treant, Bottomless Pit and Gravewrap\n\u2022 Fairy tale-themed traps, such as the Binding Rocking Chair\n\u2022 New magic items, including the amulet of sleep, bed of alertness and orb of misleading\n\u2022 Multiple possible endings to the tale, depending upon the players\u2019 actions throughout the adventure\n\u2022 Game mechanics for falling in love \u2013 the heart rules the head!\n\u2022 Gorgeous maps by Tommi Salama & Jonathan G. Nelson\n\u2022 And of course, all those essential fairy tale elements; a beautiful heroine, a prince, a queen, a magic mirror, and a hidden cabin in a haunted forest \n\n\u2026and that is just the beginning; the rest is up to you.\nTop 10 Roleplaying Game Product of 2013\n\u201c\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Snow-White is a tour de force through the realm of folk-lore's ballrooms and dark forests - a diverse, challenging quest breathing both the spirit of the classic fairy-tale and more authenticity than 'Grimm' and 'Once Upon a Time' combined, while at the same time adapting its source-material to the medium of role-playing games in a masterful, true and most importantly, extremely fun manner.\"\n-ENDZEITGEIST, Paizo.com\n\"\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - A true joy and delight, mixing a little whimsy and a touch of classic fairy stories into well-resourced fantasy adventuring.\"\n-Megan Robertson, RPG Resource\nSnow White by Adventureaweek.com\nWhy its good: A lot gets said about Rise of the Drow but to me Adventureaweek.com at its best is the Snow White adventure.

It\u2019s tailor-made for games where the player-characters already know each other\u2014from fantasy adventurers to star marines, from supernatural beings who share the same city to global-hopping troubleshooters. \nThis deck of cards works well with most roleplaying games, including GM-less ones. It also includes how to directly integrate Backstory Cards into Fate Core and Fate Accelerated's character creation.\nIf you're already a backer, check out update #1 for the downloadable sneak preview right now!\nHow to Use Backstory Cards\nYou start by coming up with your character concepts and a few elements of the setting\u2014up to three individual NPCs, groups, places, and events. You can come up with the setting elements ahead of time, or create them during the Backstory Cards process. We even have some pre-made settings for you to use right away or to use as examples.\nTaking turns going around the table, each player draws a Backstory Card and answers the prompt on the card. Prompts incorporate random setting elements and other PCs, leading to unexpected situations. You all do this a couple times and you've got some great backstory!\nWhy You'll Love Backstory Cards\nHave you ever run into the \"you all meet in a tavern\" problem? None of the characters in this situation have any real history, but they're expected to work together. Why should they go on an adventure? Backstory Cards help solve that problem with rich prompts to help get the creative juices flowing.\n\nAnd if you're an expert at coming up with interconnected characters, Backstory Cards is still great for you because it'll create questions and situations that you won't expect. It also serves as a backup for when you generate some backstory but are drawing a blank.\n\n\nYou can use Backstory Cards to instantly give one-shot and convention games a living, breathing history, allowing for deeper story and more player engagement with minimal preparation whether you're creating characters before the session or creating them together at the table.\n\nBackstory Cards are useful anywhere that creating relationships between characters is an important step.\n\n\"But I want to see it in action!\"\nOh, don't worry. We've got you covered!\n\nIn the coming weeks, Tim and Ryan will be hosting more live demonstrations in different settings and systems over Google Hangouts on the Air, and will invite people to ask questions afterward! And since they'll be Hangouts, they'll be up on YouTube shortly after broadcasting, so you can check them out at your leisure. The first demo is using the OmegaZone setting for Fate Accelerated Edition.\n\nThe second demo video is now available and focuses on building out backstory in the midst of a game. This demo showcases using Backstory Cards with Dungeon World.\n\nThe third demo features Trail of Cthulhu. This demo focuses on characters who are individually complete, but are otherwise disconnected before bringing backstory cards into play. This video also features a preview of brand new cards from the \"Unseen Threats\" expansion!\n\n\nAbout the Rewards\n  Behind the Scenes ($1)\nBecome a backer at any level and download the pre-production alpha PDF. We'll be offering some other sneak peeks and goodies behind the scenes as backers-only updates. Tim will also video and post online high-fives with you (using a stunt hand).\n\nCyber Digital Intertube Hacker ($8)\nPrint & Play! We'll get you a PDF via the Brooklyn Indie Games webstore, where you'll always be able to find it. All backer levels above this one also include the PDF. The PDF also includes a digital copy of all three  expansion packs at no extra cost.\nThe Deck ($15)\nThis is the main reward level. The Backstory Cards deck contains 54 cards covering instructions and tips, prompts, a few blanks to write your own, and a little extra info about other games we've made that you might enjoy. Want more than one deck? Just add another $15 to your pledge. This level also includes all of the Backstory Cards digital rewards.\n\nMake Me One With Everything (Digital) ($15)\nThe discerning digital citizen knows a deal when they see one. In this package, the all-digital Print-and-Play PDF of Backstory Cards and all the expansions is joined by an even cheaper copy of the Brooklyn Indie Games Grab Bag. Save $5!\nExpand Your Horizons ($30)\nOne deck of Backstory Cards and One Expansions deck including \"Distant Worlds,\" \"Unseen Threats,\" and \"Wicked Shadows\" genre. This level also includes all of the Backstory Cards digital rewards.\n\nExpansion Deluxe with The Works ($50)\nThe complete package. One deck of Backstory Cards, One Expansions deck including \"Distant Worlds,\" \"Unseen Threats,\" and \"Wicked Shadows,\" 2 Backstory Dice, and the Brooklyn Indie Grab Bag. If we hit the $17,500 stretch goal, this will come in a Limited Edition Box (details TBD) at no extra cost. This level also includes all of the Backstory Cards digital rewards.\n\nAdventuring Party ($90)\nWith a certain amount of volume, we can afford to offer FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING. Just organize some friends or other local gamers to take the extra copies off your hands. Mix and Match up to six Backstory Cards or Collected Expansions decks. This level also includes all of the Backstory Cards digital rewards.\n\nEat Our Brains* ($150)\nWe're making ourselves available for 2-hour personal consultations aimed at helping you design or clarify your ideas for a setting. This will take place via Skype or Google Hangouts at times convenient to all parties. This reward level includes one complete set of physical rewards (deck, expansions, dice), plus all of the Backstory Cards digital rewards.\n\nInterdimensional Humans of Mystery* ($300)\nYou like to play games? Us too! Let's play a game! Organize a few friends and we'll make time to play some kind of game with you, using Backstory Cards to make it the best game we can. Give us a heads-up about what kind of game you want to play - system, style, etc. and we'll create a completely new setting grid just for you. This reward level includes four complete sets of physical rewards (deck, expansions, dice), plus all of the Backstory Cards digital rewards..\n\n* For the rewards that involve Tim or Ryan doing a Hangout with you, we'll want to schedule those for sometime between late-August and mid-November. (Some blackout dates apply due to conventions, Ryan's upcoming wedding, and other life events.)\n\nAdd-Ons\nMORE STUFF. A lot of the Add-ons we're doing as freebies, just for you showing up. \n\nThe Expansions are included with every digital copy of Backstory Cards automatically. They are three genre-focused additions to focus on more specific directions for your game. \"Distant Worlds\" which focuses on Sci-Fi and Space Opera, \"Unseen Threats\" for Investigation and Horror narrative themes, and \"Wicked Shadows\" for Cyberpunk and Noir themes. Get all three with your deck of Backstory Cards for the complete experience!\n\nBackstory Dice are a fun accessory. The die is multi-coded to inform you whether to look one or two people to your right or left/across/any (you pick) as per the arrows on the cards, then also as 1/2/3 to pick the entry on the relevant setting grid.\n\nThe specific Grab Bag contents are currently being finalized, but will definitely include: Hyperreality RPG, Feed the Birds board game, and party game Plato's Cave. These three alone would be at least a $30 value when formally published. Get them ahead of time (with all future updates) for only a dollar each. Further, If you're adding this on to a multiple deck group-order, you are welcome to share the digital files.\n\n\nStretch Goals\nThe siren's allure. The mystery of what could be. Well, we've put some thought into it, and we're doing incremental goals in two forms. One ladder based on number of backers, and one based on overfunding. We'll reveal the next goal when we hit the current one.\n\n\n About the Team\nRyan Macklin\nRyan Macklin is the creator of Backstory cards.
