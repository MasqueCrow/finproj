[{"backer": "douglaslyon", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "BLUEVER Hello X2 is an easy-to-mount and simple-to-use peripheral that is used on any standard desktop monitor or laptop to instantly transform it into an interactive touchscreen with extra functionality. \nWith the help of its built-in camera and infrared light bulbs, BLUEVER Hello X2 detects your moving finger towards the monitor and translates it into touch and drag mouse actions with high accuracy and no latency. It makes your work and fun more efficient and engaging.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 works with any average laptop or desktop with Mac or Windows OS and a monitor screen size starts from 10\u201d up to 27\u201d, and converts them into fancy touchscreens.\nIt makes the interaction with your computer more intuitive and instinctive, therefore your life and work more efficient and easier.\nHello X2 magically sprinkles touchscreen features to your monitor which detect and actuate various finger gestures, including click(short press), double-click, right-click(long press), swipe, touch and hold, touch and drag, draw\\sketch\\write with finger.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 is easy to mount on monitors of all sizes from 10\u201d to 27\u201d. It clips onto the upper right corner of the monitor and you should be able to find a firm fit by turning the screw by hand to adjust.\nIn case you switch to a new computer or monitor of different size or thickness, you can still use your BLUEVER Hello X2 with it. It won\u2019t occupy any extra space on your table, and is so small and lightweight that won\u2019t add a bulk of burden to your monitor.\n *The clip can be adjusted between 1 to 28mm. It also comes with a removable soft grip which allows for a secure and scratchless attachment to your monitor.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 is configured with a camera and infrared light emitter. Any disturbances towards the invisible laser web caused by the movement of your finger in front of the computer screen will be detected by the camera and translated into accurate and immediate mouse actions.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 has a feature called accidental touch protection that prevents sleeve touch or swipe, so no actions of your clothes will be inadvertently made.\n\nThe BLUEVER Hello X2 doesn\u2019t require a bare finger to detect touch. Gloves, paintbrushes and stylus will all work.\nIf you\u2019re anyone who desperately misses a touchscreen on your MacBook Pro 2020 such as a photographer, a graphic designer, a presenter, a gamer, an editor or an artist, you will find Hello X2 extremely practical and useful.\nOnce attached, turn on your computer and plug BLUEVER Hello X2\u2019s USB connector into it to power up. The first time you use BLUEVER Hello X2 with your computer, it is important to calibrate it correctly. The process can be easily done by following the instructions given by the application installed on your computer. It takes just a few steps of about 1 minute and you only have to do it once. Power on/off, sleep/wake or upgrade systems on your computer won\u2019t affect the performance of BLUEVER Hello X2.\nPLAY\n\nThe LED on BLUEVER Hello X2 clearly indicates its working status for your convenience:\nGreen - normal operation; \nRed - to be calibrated/driver to be installed or run; \nYellow - sleep.\n*Any change in the physical position or location of BLUEVER Hello X2 on your monitor or uninstall its software application requires a re-calibration.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\nBLUEVER was established in 2019 and is a team dedicated to design lifestyle tech products that help people to transform into a smarter life.

With a powerful flashlight on one end, and a mini pry bar on the other, this is an essential keyring tool that's always there for you when you need it, and won't get in the way when you don't.  \nCrafted from premium quality titanium, the keychain design allows you to attach your flashlight to almost anything. Keys, zippers, backpacks, and more, you\u2019ll always have it on hand to light your way.\n\nFlashlight & Pry-bar in one\nHUNT3.0 is a brilliant flashlight and EDC companion in one. But where we\u2019ve really upped the game is with the light options you now have available. \nLight Everything: Three LED Color Options\n White \u2013 100 lumens \u2013 The Pathfinder is our super-thin SMD LED module that offers brilliant light with a lower energy consumption. Last longer, see further, and take it anywhere.\n UV \u2013 50 lumens \u2013 The Explorer is a compact EDC UV light that\u2019s perfect for verifying currency and ID, or protecting yourself with germ and fluid detection. Stay safe, and uncover a hidden world.\n Red \u2013 65 lumens \u2013 The Survivor is designed to help you operate stealthily in the dark. Soft red lighting allows the human eye to keep your pupils dilated, retaining and boosting your ability to see in low light conditions. Perfect for stargazing, navigation, and reading at night.\nWaterproof\n\nUV LED\n\nRed LED\nMini Pry Bar Functionality\nHUNT3.0 enables you to perform those everyday tasks that would normally have you rummaging around in the bottom of your toolbox. Whether you want to eliminate the need for carrying a full-size tool, or you just want to maintain a low pocket profile, HUNT3.0 has you covered.\nPractical Everyday Uses To Make Your Day Easier\nLight-duty prying\u2014open those sticky can lids\nOpening taped boxes\nScoring materials\nWorks as a flat-head screwdriver\nOpening bottle caps, wherever you are\nWon\u2019t damage products inside packages.\n\nKeep Your Hands Clean\nNow more than ever we\u2019re conscious of what we touch. HUNT3.0 lets you go about your day while keeping your hands to yourself.\nYou can use it when you\u2019re out and about in the world to press buttons, operate keypads, tap car park ticket machine buttons, hit elevator buttons, and much more\u2014all without making direct contact with your hands.\nHUNT3.0 is your everyday carry hands-free companion.\nBetter way to press public buttons\n\nMade from Titanium And Built To Last\nTitanium is among one of the strongest and most durable metals on the planets\u2014which is why we chose this material for HUNT3.0. Designed for rugged outdoor use, just as much as around the home, you can take it anywhere.\nTitanium coatings are known to chip off and wear down over time. So, we chose a natural, uncoated, raw finish for HUNT3.0, to give each product that timeless look that stays clean and looks great for years to come.\nWhat We\u2019ve Improved With HUNT3.0\nHUNT3.0 is the exciting evolution in our HUNT EDC flashlight series. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new.\nWe added a red light option for better nighttime vision\nWe\u2019ve improved the design and the appearance, making it easier to rotate when turning on or off, and when using the pry bar\nBased on feedback from the backers of our previous-generation products, we\u2019ve improved the size and strength of the pry bar, making it a more durable and robust everyday tool  \n Specifications\nBody Materials\n100% Grade 5 Titanium\nLED Specs\nSMD LED Bulb \nBuilt-in Resistor To Prevent Overheating\nBulb Lifespan 30,000 - 50,000 hours\nAlkaline Battery Life - Up to 60 hours\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur team started back in 2019 after our very first Kickstarter project. So to us, this platform simply feels like home.\nWe don't have (or ever want) any investors, so we bring our new products directly to the Kickstarter community. With your help we\u2019re able to bring our products to life, and make unique products that are built to last.\nWe love being an active part of this community, and wouldn\u2019t be here without our wonderful backers.\nTimeline\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fifth Kickstarter project, so it\u2019s safe to say that we know we\u2019ve got what it takes to bring this project to successful completion.\n\nThe only risk we foresee is the chance of shipping a little bit later than the estimated dates, due to the project being extremely over-funded. It\u2019s not a bad risk to have! So we\u2019ve factored in extra time to account for this, as large-scale productions involve considerably more planning.\n\nWe\u2019ll provide you with regular project updates, so should any production or shipping delays occur, we can let you know about it ASAP.\n\nPlease note that the flashlight shown in images and video on this page is our functional prototype, and we reserve the right to make minor design alterations to all elements as needed.

Using its new and improved sensors, Arsenal 2 fine tunes your camera's settings by analyzing 22 different environmental factors. The result is great settings for any shot.  \nArsenal 2\u2019s Deep Color uses a neural network to intelligently develop each photo. Deep Color is not a look or a filter. Instead, it produces a set of adjustments custom to each photo. The results are balanced yet powerful, rendering bold images that flatter every photo without being over the top. See the difference below compared to a camera's built-in colors. \nSee our \u201cHow it works\u201d section below for more details.\nArsenal 2 controls your camera over USB and automates some of the most powerful photography techniques. The onboard GPU automatically stacks photos and sends them to your phone\u2014or saves them to Arsenal 2\u2019s micro SD card slot (See FAQ for details). \nNight photography is notoriously difficult. Arsenal 2\u2019s Night Assist makes it easy. It can focus on the stars with a tap*, then calculate the perfect settings to get sharp, detailed night photos.\n*Night focus times vary by camera and lens. Night focus normally requires between 30 seconds and 2 minutes to get stars in perfect focus. See the FAQ for lens compatibility.\nPanoramas make for powerful photos, but there\u2019s too much guessing involved. With Arsenal 2\u2019s live panorama, you can be sure you didn\u2019t miss anything. The Arsenal Phone Mount accessory (sold separately) holds Arsenal 2 and your phone, so you can watch the panorama build as you shoot. When you\u2019re done, crop the final output and it's ready to share.\nIn some locations, there will always be someone in your photo. By combining multiple shots, Arsenal 2\u2019s new Crowd Control feature can automatically remove people and other moving objects from your photos.\nArsenal 2 ships in Standard and Pro versions. Both have the same software features (and support the same cameras), but Arsenal 2 Pro brings even more performance improvements, added weather resistance, and USB-C connectivity. \n*Micro SD card sold separately, see the \"Accessories\" section below\n\nArsenal 2 automates advanced photo stacking techniques to help you capture scenes with High Dynamic Range (HDR). In seconds, Arsenal 2 takes multiple exposures and blends them into a single shot capturing details in both bright and dark areas of the scene.\nWith Arsenal 2, you can create long exposures that capture rich color and dramatic motion blurs...without buying expensive neutral density filters.\nWith focus stacking, you can get your entire scene in sharp focus. Arsenal 2 calculates the ideal aperture, takes shots at different focus positions, and merges them into one crystal clear image.\nWe love timelapses, so we spent five years designing the ultimate timelapse tool. Start your timelapse with a tap...or set custom parameters. Arsenal 2 will intelligently manage the exposure to create a smooth day-to-night transition. You can even preview your timelapse while it\u2019s being recorded. You (and your phone) can leave. Come back any time to change settings or check progress.

After our first campaign we delivered over 100,000 Arsenals to our backers across the globe. And along the way we built up tools, relationships, and expertise that will help us to deliver Arsenal 2. \n\nFrom a technology standpoint, much of the work that went into Arsenal 1 can be reused as a foundation for Arsenal 2 (both Standard and Pro). A lot of the work required to get Arsenal 1 out the door wasn\u2019t feature specific, but involved things like camera integration, mobile app communication and deployment, firmware management, user interface design, bug tracking, etc. Having that foundation means we can spend more time optimizing performance and testing features. \n\nFor Arsenal 2, we\u2019ve completed all of the hardware development, and our manufacturing partners are already established and ready to go to production once parts are in.

Pero turns your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device. Now, you can control the cursor and input commands with this single device so that you can focus more on getting the job done. \n\nAAD function | Active Applicaiton Detection\nPERO can perform Active Application Detection through the User Custom Program. You can send separate commands according to each application, even with the same gesture.\n\nProvide customized settings according to gesture usage patterns\nOur \u201cUser Support Program\u201d analyzes your natural gesture habits and patterns to learn your command preferences. Instead of fitting your needs to predefined shortcuts, make your own shortcuts that meet your exact needs!\n\n\n\n\n\n Pero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.\n\nPero lets you control the user-interface with just your gestures alone. \nYes, just like Minority Report but better. Since this is real. Turn your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device.\n\n We manage applications by type. \nUCP can manage many applications easily by dividing types according to popular shortcuts and commands. And new applications can be updated faster. These advantages, combined with the AAD function, help effectively control the commands of the application through the Pero. \n\n\nUpcoming Supported applications \n\n * Pero is not fully compatible with drone control at the moment. The video above is a demo test.\n\n\n\n\nPero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.\n\nPalmcat\u2019s Gesture Sensing Algorithm detects movement on the back of your hand while the touch panel strapped around the palm tracks the pressure from each of your fingers. Combining these two factors give you an almost unlimited choice of combinations! For example, even if you swipe your hand horizontally, it\u2019ll carry different meanings depending on which fingers you place on the touch panel.\nComfortable Wrist\nThe positioning of the arm while using Pero prevents the build up of pressure and pain in the wrist. But Ordinary mice force the wrist into a bent shape  which causes discomfort and pain over time\nWhen working with a mouse, you have to always work in the same pose and posture. However, you can work in a variety of poses and poses.\n\n PERO does not need space to control the cursor.\nSo Pero reduces the time you spend moving between the mouse and trackpad. It also helps you use your computer efficiently even in a desk-free working environment.\n\n\n\n\n The movement of the hand is captured by the IMU sensor located on the back and the movement is detected through gestures through Palmcat's GR algorithm. The GR algorithm is a technique that can calculate each gesture in a lightweight chipset environment without the need for a separate analysis process or system by utilizing the advantages of the Palmcat hardware.\nThe thumb button was designed to work like a mouse click. It\u2019s placed right next to your thumb so all options to click, right-click, or drag are within finger reach.\nOur fingers do a lot more than we give them credit for.  \nThink of the diverse purpose that each finger serves. The subtle differences in a tap, press, and pinch. The array of meanings they convey. We took the admiration of our nifty fingers to heart by utilizing their full potential in Pero. Its highly sensitive touch sensor recognizes each individual fingertip and when they\u2019re being pressed down.\n\nSimply connect it just like connect your wireless earbuds, easy and effortless! No external receiver needed. And PERO uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). So you can use 37 hours on a 30-minute charge. \n\n\n\nSetting appropriate commands in advance according to the user's gesture usage pattern, \nImprove the accuracy by grasping the position of the finger touching the palm, \nIt detects the application you are using and delivers the command.\nIt helps you set the commands you want in gestures.\nUCP is our team's best gift to PERO buyers.\n\n\n\nYou could be typing away, drinking coffee, or chatting with your coworkers. Thanks to its 4mm-thin palm strip, Pero remains unobtrusive for you to wear as you carry out the rest of your day\u2019s tasks.\n\nThe hardware was created by molding liquid silicone, a high-precision method used to create cutting-edge medical tools and kitchen appliances. You don\u2019t have to worry about feeling discomfort such as tension, over-heating, and sweat accumulation.The hardware was created by molding liquid silicone, a high-precision method used to create cutting-edge medical tools and kitchen appliances. You don\u2019t have to worry about feeling discomfort such as tension, over-heating, and sweat accumulation.\n\nAre you one of those people frantically looking for the answer to: \u201cwhat about if you\u2019re left-handed?\u201d Don\u2019t worry, we got you covered too! Whether you're right-handed, left-handed, or ambidextrous, Pero works for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an IT engineer, I used to work in small and confined spaces which forced me to use the trackpad or track pointer because I didn\u2019t have enough room for a mouse. However, when I was working with a lot of cursor control, I gradually began to experience more pain in my elbows up to the point where it was difficult to move my arm. This led me to imagine a device that could recognize the movement of my hand.\n And so, after years of research and development, I came up with a device that could recognize gestures and translate it into specific commands. This is how Pero was born in 2017, but the current version of Pero is the most popular version among the people who participated in our user experience research tests (28 touch panel silicon insertion tests, 28 touch panel types, 9 product designs, 8 board modifications, and 8 sets of molds produced). We are doing our best and will continue to work hard in order to create innovative products that will provide incredible value for anyone!\n\nProcess of developing the touch panel\nIn order to make a recognition panel that can accurately recognize gestures even when worn roughly, a capacitive touch sensor was included in the design. However, it was necessary to make a panel to block the natural static electricity that can form in the palm while simultaneously recognizing the static electricity on the fingers. Eventually, we were able to succeed and ended up creating a thin but powerful discernment panel that accomplished everything we wanted it to accomplish.\n\nSoftware\nUser support software is where we focused a lot of our efforts in order to make it easy and simple for anyone to use. In the future, we planning on further developing the software so that more third-party applications are integrated and that additional customized gestures can be recognized. In order to reach this next step, we will try to develop motion recognition optimization by making sure that Pero outputs can be analyzed by 2,800 data bits per second.\n\n\nThis campaign is managed by Altos, a product launch consulting agency that specializes in helping global tech startups launch their product in the United States.

The duo had a great affinity for plants and gardening, which was hard to maintain with their busy travel schedules. To cope, they installed a commercial outdoor irrigation system in their greenhouse to automatically irrigate the plants. They used a water bib and a timer but their indoor plants couldn\u2019t be automatically irrigated due to a lack of a water source. The pair couldn\u2019t find a device for their living room that would automatically irrigate their plants.\nIn 2014, Dr. Caceres sought out to create the solution. He took a submersible water pump and placed it in a decorative vase filled with water in the middle of the living room. He connected the pump to thin pieces of tubing pulled from his greenhouse irrigation system, made a series of connectors, and paired the unit to an electrical timer. This early prototype was able to irrigate their plants automatically, intermittently and silently. It worked daily, not only when traveling, and only needed to be refilled every 3 to 4 weeks. Thus, Riego was born.\nWe can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Riego a reality.\nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or pre-order Riego, if you\u2019re a supporter of Riego, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this.

Designed to sit comfortably by your bedside, enjoy a fresh cup of English breakfast with fresh milk, or a delicate green tea from the comfort of your covers.\nDesktop Brewer when you WFH\nCalming Bed-time Brew\nEstablishing nightly & morning routines \nThe Barisieur encourages a night-time routine which helps you wind-down and prepare for sleep. You are more likely to fall asleep faster, get a better night's rest, and then wake up more easily, becoming alert faster.\nCompared to the beeping of a phone alarm or the luminescence of a \u201csun\u201d alarm clock, they both lacked two important features for us:   \nAroma & Taste\nBeing stimulated by multiple senses helps you to focus and wake up more gently. A delicious smelling brew is a great way to do this. No one looks forward to that cold kitchen floor facing you and your first cuppa in the morning.   \nFunctional Tray\nYou only really need to wash the cup and the Brew Chamber for the next use. However, if you decide to clean all the accessories now and then; the timber tray lifts off effortlessly to help transport. \nFunctional tray for transporting the accessories all at once\nBrew Chamber Technology\nThe Brew chamber features on the Barisieur 2.0 or with our Manual kitchen brewer to help you make a perfect cup of coffee or tea every morning.\nTea Gate\u2019s Unique Design\nDue to its cylindrical and conical shape, the gate provides a perfect seal when in position in the glass chamber. Simply lift the strainer up to release the brew directly into your cup.\nThe Manual Brewer\nTake your brew chamber off the Barisieur and use it in the kitchen with our specially designed brew stand. (Available in Walnut & Blond Wood)\n\nImmersion Coffee with the Manual Brewer\nPLAY\n\nCold Brew with the Manual Brewer\nCoupled with the Brew Stand, the Brew Chamber makes cold brew quick and easy.\nPlace 1 or 2 servings of ground coffee in the chamber\nTop up with cold, filtered water.\nPlace in the fridge for 10-16 hours\nTake out and serve!\nEnough for 2 cups of cold brew\nPLAY\n\nThe Double Walled Glass Mug\nKeep your brew hot when you hit the snooze button. The insulated mugs keep your brew at drinking temperature for 15 minutes longer than with regular mugs. \nAvailable for all pledges - Add +\u00a37 to your pledge to add one to your order!  \nA perfect fit for all Barisieurs\nThe Wireless Charger\nDesigned to add wireless charging to your Barisieur by plugging directly into the USB port in the back. It also works perfectly by itself. \nWalnut Wireless Charger\n\nINVISI-GRIP - Secures your phone whilst it charges so it's less likely to slip off accidentally. Invisi grip gives you all the benefits of a rubberized top plate without comprising on design and aesthetics.    \nOur Wireless Charger secures your phone with the Invisi-grip Lining\nCold Milk How?\nThe Barisieur uses a solid-state cooling unit called a peltier cooler. Unlike traditional fridges, it has no moving parts and doesn\u2019t use hazardous substances. \nBy the magic of the thermoelectric affect - one side of the fridge goes cold and one side gets warm. Resulting in the milk fridge staying at 2\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C all day, every day.\nInfrared Technology, Auto-Activates Fridge\nWhether you have milk with your tea or have run out. The Barisieur Milk Fridge features an infrared sensor that automatically turns on the fridge when it detects milk inside the fridge - Saving energy when not needed.\nAutomatic Mini-fridge for Milk\nRewards     \nHow-To: Making your First Brew\nThe Barisieur uses a simple set of toggles to set the time, alarm, and brew delay.\nHold the large button on the side 4 secs to set the time \nHold the large button on the side 2 secs to set the Alarm \nRotate the Brew Delay to -5,0,+5,+10,+15 - Allowing your brew to either start brewing before, on, or after the alarm.\nToggle down to snooze the alarm (not the brew)\nToggle up to reset the alarm for the next day\nClick Make to brew on demand or manually turn brew off.\nWatch the video below for a full tutorial.\nPLAY\n\nSpecs and More Features\nBase\nMini-Fridge: Uses a Peltier cooler, functions 24/7H, keeps contents at 2 to 5 degrees Celcius, auto-on with infra-red sensors to detect if milk is present or not.\nDisplay: Auto-dimming and can be turned off. Displays time in 12H/24H and brew status\nUSB Port: 5V USB port can be used to charge a phone and other devices\nInduction Heater: Uses a custom induction coil designed by Toshiba manufacturers\nAlarm Sound: Can be Enabled / Disabled to accompany the timed brew\nVoltage: Available in 220V-240V and 110V-130V. These two models work for every country.\nLiPo Battery: Keeps time and alarm settings when the Barisieur is unplugged or power outage.\nSuction Cup Feet: Barisieur Feet have suction cup designs to prevent movement \nStorage Draw: Has a built-in stainless steel lid and measuring spoon\nTop\nWooden Tray: Available in Walnut or Blond Variants, both are FSC-Certified and Solid Timber\nRotatable Arm: Can be rotated back for easy access to cup. Made from Stainless Steel arm and precision bearing.\nGlassware: All custom-made for the Barisieur with thick glass for durability\nBoiler Bung: Features a steam vent ensuring the optimum temperature of transported water\nShower Head: Uses a 12 hole design to ensure equal saturation of tea or coffee\n\nPress\nGadget Show\nBarisieur Glass\nHand-formed glass made by Master Glass Blowers.\nOur Glass is hand-formed by masters using the purest borosilicate glass available. Borosilicate glass is renowned for its superior durability, heat resistance, brightness, and clarity. All of our glassware goes through many stages of production and testing. The result is our unique set of glassware designed solely to help you make and enjoy tea as it's meant to be. We hope you enjoy using each piece as much as we do. \nSolid Timber Construction\nOur wood trays are machined from solid wood and go through a vigorous hand-finishing process. They are then treated with a stain and water repellant matt varnish so no need to worry about stains.\nComing from FSC-Certified forests we make sure that what we take is given back, so our forests stay healthy and continue growing. \nCraftsmanship\nWho are We?\nJoy Resolve (Originally Barisieur) made its debut in 2016 on Kickstarter with our original coffee brewing alarm clock. Since coming to market we\u2019ve had incredible success working with the likes of Harrods, Selfridges, and Bloomingdales.\nBrew Chamber & Wireless Chargers are our first major update to the Barisieur since our release to the market. To commemorate the occasion we decided to go back to our roots and launch it here for our Kickstarter community.\nSquad\n \"We believe quality and timeless design is the best form of sustainability\"\nExtra Information:\nWe have a warehouse in UK, Germany, the USA & Hong Kong. We can ship World-wide with every Voltage and different Plugs.\nProject Timeline\nWith our successful campaign in 2016 and the 6000 Barisieurs we\u2019ve sold, our supply chain and manufacturing partner links are strong and ready to start production of the Tea Barisieur and Brew Chamber.\nBarisieur Quality Control\nEvery Barisieur is fully tested before leaving the factory. That means every single Barisieur boils 2 servings of water to check it is functioning. \nQuality Control - Barisieur 2.0\nBlond Wood Quality Control\nPress Pack and Socials\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1olEeWC3zjusy-fGXxRbvMbHp1sHEdx08&authuser=josh@joyresolve.com&usp=drive_fs\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Joyresolve/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/joyresolve/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith all projects, there are going to be risks and challenges and the biggest ones comes down to manufacturing, certifications, and logistics. Because this isn't our first project we have over-come 99% of these when we launched Barisieur 1.0 and have this all set up now. We have learned a lot and will keep everyone updated with monthly updates (like we did last time) so everyone has full transparency of the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nJoy Resolve is about creating timeless tech with style. Quality is our main concern and we want our products to last a lifetime with both style and functionality. We are not interested in planned obsolesce after the warranty is finished so you come back and buy another machine - great for the company's bank account but terrible for the environment and the customer. We offer a 2-year warranty and sell any parts that need replacing.- instead of having to replace a whole unit.\nReusability and recyclability\nAny faulty machines are collected and fixed. Units that are too faulty to fix have parts reused (where they can be) and recycled. The packaging used is incredibly protective and has a handle to aid in carrying and transportation. Most of our customers keep the packaging for this exact reason - to transport it to new locations when they need to.\nSustainable materials\nAll timber used for the product is FSC certified. This means any tree cut down is planted with a new one. The positive about cutting trees down is that the new ones that grow absorb more carbon dioxide and provide more oxygen then the older trees that are cut down.\n\nOur Wireless chargers are made from recycled Aluminium which uses 70% less energy to create. It also means we are resuing material instead of extracting more from our precious earth.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe pride ourselves on the factory we have been working with for over 4 years now. Unfortunately, there is a range of factories out there; unethical sweat-shops to incredible and clean operations with staff that are treated incredibly. We also work with our factory due to the supply chains being close. It's important to us that the material isn't traveling miles to then be assembled.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe have a warehouse in the USA, Hong Kong, United Kingdom & Germany so that the final mile is as close to the customer as possible.\nSomething else\nAs our company grows and becomes more profitable - we want to impose on ourselves an annual tax of 1% of sales to Deforestation and planting new trees to mitigate any negative environmental consequences of our business activity.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Double Walled Glass Mug", "descp": "\u00a37\nSave \u00a38 or 53% | Retail Price \u00a315\n1x Double Walled Glass Mug\nKeep your brew hot longer.
