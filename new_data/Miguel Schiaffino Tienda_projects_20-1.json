[{"backer": "Miguel Schiaffino Tienda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We're glad to be back with our 3rd project, which combines our geeky nature with the desire to create products that people use every day.\nThe HUNT23 is a tiny, ultra-lightweight titanium flashlight that fixes to your keyring. With a flashlight on one end and a tiny pry bar on the other, they combine into one essential tool. \nOpen things. Light your way. HUNT23 is a simple, helpful keyring tool that\u2019s always there when you need it, and won\u2019t get in the way when you don\u2019t.\nThis idea started a few months ago while we were manufacturing HUNT22, our tiny, durable EDC titanium UV flashlight.\nAfter using our flashlights for a while, the single function\u2014while useful\u2014seemed like a wasted opportunity for truly upgrading our everyday carry (EDC). Something was missing.\nSo we went back to the drawing board. We stripped the flashlight tool back to its absolute basics, giving it a minimalist aesthetic, and added in a few useful features that made it worth carrying around all day.\nWe loved the idea of having an object like a screwdriver or bottle opener with us, but the thought of attaching yet another item to our keyring was just too much. We landed on the idea of a tiny pry bar, a multi-use addition on the back end of the flashlight that could drive screws, open bottles, open lids, cut boxes\u2014basically, could open anything we needed in our daily lives. \nWe settled on a design that allows us to do more and carry less.\nHUNT23 provides a beautiful balance between minimalist style and maximum usability, in one tiny package. Just stick it on your keychain and away you go. \nHate walking home in the dark? Can\u2019t find your phone? HUNT23 is always there to light your way.\nHUNT23 flashlight produces 100 lumens of crystal-clear light.\nSick of looking around for a bottle opener? Got a loose screw that\u2019s bugging you? The tiny pry bar has you sorted.  \nWon\u2019t damage products inside packages.\nIf you\u2019re after a simple, brilliant multi-use EDC tool that\u2019s always there when you need it, HUNT23 is the tool for you.  \nHUNT23 is the toughest and smallest flashlight you've ever seen; finger-sized yet with maximum durability and the strongest light beam in any product this size. \nTesting has proven that our flashlight is virtually indestructible. It's definitely a LIFETIME use body!  \nLight your path and find what you need with HUNT23\u2019s brilliant white light.\nThe UV light option allows you to explore the hidden world. Keep safety top-of-mind and always be aware of your surroundings. Fingerprints, hidden stains, or secret messages in books will all become illuminated.\nMaterials\n100% Grade 5 Titanium \nLED Specs\nSMD LED Bulb (100 Lumens)\nBuilt-in Resistor To Prevent Overheating\nBulb Lifespan 30,000 - 50,000 hours\nUses 3 Common 1.55V Watch Batteries (AG3 LR41 or 392 )\n\u2022Alkaline Battery Life - 60 Hours (Constant Use)  \nGallery\nAbout us\nSEPTEM was established by a small London team who are passionate about bringing cool, sleek technology ideas to life, as well as striving to inspire others and foster an exploratory mindset. \nDesign is our passion, our hobby, and our vocation. With this project we\u2019re trying to bring something new to the world, and Kickstarter is an amazing platform to do that. \nOur supporters receive the best prices and get the unique chance to follow the whole manufacturing process from start to finish. We\u2019re super excited to be back with our third project, our new titanium EDC multitool, HUNT23.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter project, so we know we\u2019ve got what it takes to bring this project to successful completion. \n\nThe only risk we foresee will be the chance of shipping a little bit later than the estimated dates, if the project is extremely over-funded. We\u2019ve factored in extra time to account for this, but large-scale productions involve considerably more planning. \n\nWe\u2019ll provide regular project updates, so should a production or shipping delay occur, we\u2019ll let everyone know about it ASAP. \n\nPlease note that the flashlight shown is a functional prototype, and we reserve the right to make minor design alterations to all elements as needed. The dimensions may need to be adjusted during mass production to ensure we produce the best flashlight we can for everyone.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a328 or more", "title": "Just One WT", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1x HUNT23 WT Flashlight\nSave \u00a317 Off RRP \u00a345 [38% OFF]\n3 Years Warranty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["325 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a328 or more", "title": "Just One UV", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1x HUNT23 UV Flashlight\nSave \u00a317 Off RRP \u00a345 [38% OFF]\n3 Years Warranty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a367 or more", "title": "Mix Three", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 HUNT23 WT or UV Flashlight\nSave \u00a368 Off RRP \u00a3135 [50% OFF]\n3 Years Warranty\nCombined Postage", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["214 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3112 or more", "title": "Mix Five", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 HUNT23 WT or UV Flashlight\nSave \u00a3113 Off RRP \u00a3225 [50% OFF]\n3 Years Warranty\nCombined Postage", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3207 or more", "title": "Mix Ten | Best Deal", "descp": "Looking for a great gift for your team, friend, or family this Christmas, this one for you.

Adding holes into the shell doesnt change the fact that its still cheap plastic. Traditional gaming mouse companies like to cover this up with their marketing speak, but this is just putting lipstick on a pig.\nSeveral years ago we decided to do something about this and started Zaunkoenig. Our first product, the Zaunkoenig M1K, is the world\u2019s first carbon fiber gaming mouse. The combination of cutting edge materials and radical production methods result in a gaming mouse with a fighting weight of just 23 grams. Every other gaming mouse weighs more than twice as much. Most gaming mice even weigh three or four times as much. See for yourself:  \nSource: sensor.fyi/mice made by Dimitar Dimitrov\nThe importance of low weight\nAt 23 grams accelerating and stopping the Zaunkoenig M1K feels almost instantaneous. Put another way: the M1K is really good for aiming. We achieve this low weight not only by using carbon fiber, but also by removing mouse features that do nothing for your aim: RGB lighting, sniper buttons, side buttons and the mouse wheel. \nThe Zaunkoenig M1K weighs 23 grams\nWhat gamers say about the Zaunkoenig M1K\nHuddled, known for his world records in KovaaK's FPS Aim Trainer: \u00abThis mouse is kind of insane, these were my scores within the first 20-30 minutes of plugging the mouse in and I haven't been playing kovaak's too much lately. It is a ton of fun to use and I'm looking forward to see what other scores I can get with it.\u00bb\nMatt Kelly, competitive gamer with a background in professional Quake/CoD: \u00abA mouse should be used for aiming \u2013 not to offer extra binds, and certainly not for your push-to-talk key. Zaunkoenig have created a mouse that is objectively better at what matters, aiming.\u00bb\nMenismyforte, Youtube mouse reviewer: \u00abEverything is just so awesome I can't describe how much I like it, it's such a weird experience. It seems like a simple concept but the execution is just incredible.\u00bb\nqsxcv, OCN legend: \u00abThis mouse is 4 grams heavier than the g502's wheel and they call it lightweight? Ridiculous. 0/10 would not buy.\u00bb\nCheck out the Youtube reviews of our current prototypes:\nMenismyforte: \u00abI myself was a doubter when I first saw it. I surprisingly found that I got some amazing results when I was actually playing with this mouse ingame. I also found that my judgement in the area of \u2039there is such a thing as too light\u203a was way off.\u00bb\nBT: \u00abI love that they [Zaunkoenig] are really pushing the boundaries of performance that we can get out of a mouse. It is truly inspiring to say the least.\u00bb\nBeardedbob: \u00abIt was pretty good on latency this thing. It has beaten everything and is now king of the latency test.\u00bb\n\nThere will be 333 Zaunkoenig M1K on Kickstarter\nAt Zaunkoenig we use the same production methods that are used to make a hyper car: we laminate the carbon fiber into the mold by hand, vacuum the mold, and bake it under high pressure. Whereas a normal plastic mouse shell from a traditional gaming mouse is made in mere seconds, the carbon fiber top shell of the Zaunkoenig M1K takes hours to make. And we do it ourselves, in Germany. Because the production of the carbon fiber shell is so complex, we can only offer a very limited amount of Zaunkoenig M1Ks on Kickstartarter: 333. Making carbon fiber parts is craftsmanship. \nThis picture shows how we laminate the carbon fiber\n3D printed fractal honeycomb bottom shell\nThe bottom shell of the Zaunkoenig M1K features a fractal honeycomb pattern which is only achievable through 3D printing. It weighs an astonishingly low 6.0 grams. The below picture shows a multicolored bottom shell featuring black, green and yellow ABS. Multicolored bottom shells are only available when you pledge the Founders Edition of the M1K (other pledges are limited to either black, blue or yellow).\nFractal honeycomb bottom shell with printed circuit board (PCB)\nFor the Founders Edition you can specify up to four colors for one bottom plate. Here are some examples:\nYou can go crazy when ordering color combinations for the Zaunkoenig M1K Founders Edition\nMouse feet\nHyperglide makes the mouse feet of the M1K. Hyperglide is famous for their rounded edges on their mouse feet, which they seem to be pulling off better than anyone else. Without rounded edges mouse feet will scratch on your mouse pad.\nOh and by the way: we didnt put the mouse feet over the screw holes, so you can open up the M1K without destroying your mouse feet: \nHyperglide mouse feet on the M1K are not placed over the screw holes\nCustom hardware and software\nThe printed circuit boards (PCBs) in todays gaming mice are usually bigger, heavier and uglier than they need to be. Also, they are usually full of low quality components and run poor firmware (debouncing, anyone?). This is how a bare PCB without components soldered onto it looks like:\nThis is how a Zaunkoenig M1K PCB looks like with no electronics parts soldered onto it; for the Founders Edition only will you get one of these bare PCBs with your name in gold on it\nOur PCBs are soldered in a German factory. We use an expensive micro controller unit (MCU) that makes it possible for you to install a custom firmware. And instead of the cheaper Chinese Omron switches with their inflated bazillion click ratings (lipstick all over again) we use Japanese Omrons (D2F-01F) which feature a more complex design and gold contacts. This is how the PCB of the Zaunkoenig M1K looks like once all the components are soldered onto it:\nThe printed circuit board (PCB) of the Zaunkoenig M1K\nWe didnt stop at custom hardware. The firmware of the M1K is based upon the firmware of overclock.net user qsxcv. It offers extremely low latencies and is open-source. You can change CPI, Angle Snapping or LOD without having to install software on your PC. This is not only convenient, but more importantly crucial for pro gamers that are usually not allowed to install software on competition PCs.\nThe Zaunkoenig M1K is probably the first gaming mouse that uses zero lag switch debouncing: our clicks have very low latency and still accidental double clicks are not a problem. Traditional gaming mouse companies artificially delay mouse clicks by up to 40 milliseconds to prevent accidental double clicks. Some mouse companies are even happy when their gaming mice accidentally double click: it means they can sell you one more mouse.  \nThis is how the M1K clicks sound like (and also: what a blue bottom shell looks like): \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\nOverclock to 8,000 Hertz\nHigh refresh rate gaming monitors are becoming more and more common. We think a 500 Hertz mouse is the equivalent to a 60 Hertz monitor: outdated. Thats why internally the Zaunkoenig M1K runs with 8,000 Hertz. When you are willing to overclock your Windows driver you can actually use the Zaunkoenig M1K with 8,000 Hertz in Windows.\nUsing the Zaunkoenig M1K at 8,000 Hertz as opposed to 1,000 Hertz reduces input lag by 0.4375 milliseconds on average; compared to 500 Hertz mice, the Zaunkoenig M1K will be quicker by 0.9375 milliseconds on average. We worked hard to not only save every gram of weight on the M1K, but reduce every millisecond of latency as well. \n8,000 Hertz USB polling rate\nMouse cable\nTraditional gaming mouse companies usually use cables that are way too stiff and heavy. This is due to using very few and thick copper wires which are cheaper for them to produce. Making matters even worse, most traditional gaming mouse cables use a cheap plastic jacket made out of PVC. Some traditional gaming mouse companies then go the extra mile and encompass their creation with a nylon braid, for that extra bit of stiffness. You end up with something that feels more like a lightning rod than a mouse cable.\nTo make the cable of the Zaunkoenig M1K flexible yet robust, we started at the core of the cable: the copper conductors. We use very fine copper wires, instead of thick ones. Whereas a normal gaming mouse cable has 28 copper wires inside of it, the cable of the M1K has 76 copper wires. For the jacket we went with the modern material polyurethane, which pulls off the feat of being flexible yet robust at the same time. We use gold plated crimp terminals from Molex to connect the cable with the PCB: \nM1K mouse cable\nMade in Germany\nAll of the soldering is done in a German factory. We make the cable ourselves. We print the bottom shell ourselves. We make the carbon fiber shell ourselves. Even the nine Torx screws inside every Zaunkoenig M1K are made in Germany. To summarize: there is no Chinese mouse factory that can delay our Kickstarter.\nWe already have molds for producing the carbon fiber top shell. What we will use the Kickstarter funds for is to make more of these molds, so we can produce larger quantities. We do not need injection molds, since we print the bottom shell.\nEvery major component of the Zaunkoenig M1K is made in Germany; the color combination of the bottom plate in this picture is one of our favorites by the way (only available in the Founders Edition)\nThe Zaunkoenig M1K is a pure Fingertip Grip mouse\nWe think Fingertip Grip is the best mouse grip. The Zaunkoenig M1K is the first gaming mouse that is designed purely for Fingertip Grip. The Zaunkoenig M1K is not compatible with Claw Grip and Palm Grip. For optimal performance you have to design a thing to be just one thing. Just imagine an off-road vehicle that is also designed to be a racing car. A gaming mouse that works with Palm Grip and Fingertip Grip is not optimal for either of those grips. \nZaunkoenig M1K is for Fingertip Grip only\nWho the Zaunkoenig M1K is not for\nWe did not set out to make a mouse that is okay for many, but to make a mouse that is the best for a small group of people. To anyone who is not sure two mouse buttons are enough for the game he/she is playing: this is such a weird question for the both of us, since we never used the wheel in twenty years of gaming. Patrick has played in the German national team for StarCraft: Brood War and didnt use the wheel once. Dominik soloqued his way to \u00abGlobal Elite\u00bb in CS:GO without missing the wheel once. In our opinion there are enough keys on the keyboard. You just have to use them efficiently.\nWe get it though: if you are used to jumping with the wheel for example it can be hard to relearn that. Changing your hotkeys is not something you can get used to over night. So is it worth it to relearn hotkeys just to use a lighter mouse? Well: Just think about the last time you switched from a heavier to a lighter gaming mouse. Have you tried going back to the heavier mouse after a few weeks? Usually this results in: \u00abWow, this is so heavy, how did I even play with that?\u00bb Now imagine how your current mouse will feel like after you have tried 23 grams. \nSeveral Zaunkoenig M1K carbon fiber top shells with multicolored bottom shells (Founders Edition)\nSpecifications: Zaunkoenig M1K\nProduct name: M1K\nNumber of buttons: two (left button, right button)\nWeight: 23 g\nHeight: 30 mm\nLength: 79 mm\nWidth: 60 mm\nMCU: Microchip ATmega32U2\nFirmware: Open-source\nSensor: PixArt 3360\nMaximum CPI: Enough\nDefault CPI: 800 (changeable in increments of 100)\nMaximum IPS: Enough\nUSB rate: 1,000 Hertz (overclockable to 8,000 Hertz)\nSwitches: Omron D2F-01F (Made in Japan)\nSwitch latency: 0 (press and release)\nCable diameter: 2.5 mm\nTop shell: Aerograde carbon fiber\nBottom shell: 3D printed fractal honeycomb ABS\nScrews: Torx (9 \u00d7 T6)\nMouse feet: 4 Hyperglide PTFE with rounded edges (\u00d8 = 7 mm; height = 0.65 mm)\nThe carbon fiber top shell of the Zaunkoenig M1K\nTimeline\nSeptember\u2013October 2019: Kickstarter Campaign\nOctober\u2013November 2019: Certification, tooling\nNovember\u2013February 2019: Production\nMarch 2020: Shipping\n\nZaunkoenig is two brothers: Dominik and Patrick\nDominiks focus is engineering and manufacturing. He is responsible for the carbon fiber top shell and the 3D printed bottom part. Looking at cheap ABS mice with holes all over the place makes him cringe.\nPatricks focus is on the cable and PCB. He has a bit of marketing experience under his belt and is able to detect marketing bullshit from great distances. He hates lipstick. \nZaunkoenig is two brothers: Dominik (left) and Patrick (right)\nShipping and fulfillment\nFor now we need backers from countries with additional VAT/taxes applicable to pay the VAT/tax themselves upon delivery. We are currently in exchange with fulfillment centers, reviewing different possible shipping solutions as we ideally would want backers to have zero bad surprises of exorbitant surcharges at customs. At this stage international shipping is (due to the customs situation and if we manage to effectively integrate the use of fulfillment centers) hard for us to calculate accurately worldwide. That is why we feel obligated to communicate upfront that as of right now we cannot promise to find a better solution for our backers than what we are currently offering in the reward tiers. Rest assured though that we are working on a more seamless backer-friendly solution concerning VAT/taxes outside the EU and will keep you posted in our updates.\n\nUnlocked stretch goal at \u20ac35.000\nOur stretch goal includes the following three things:\n1.1 All backers who pledged for an M1K will get one bare PCB (though not with your name in gold on it; that is still exclusive for the Founders Edition). A bare PCB is the PCB of the mouse, but without anything soldered onto it. If you solder components on it, this PCB will be a fully working mouse PCB. You can also just add it to your keychain though (involves much less skill).\n1.2 Additionally everyone who pledged for an M1K can now specify two more colors for his bottom plate (for this we will send out a survey after the Kickstarter campaign): Orange and White. Previously these colors were limited to the Founders Edition.\n1.3 To make the Founders Edition a little more juicy we will add to it a completely soldered PCB. You can use this PCB for modding projects or as a backup.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking hardware is tricky. We surely dont know all the tricks. So we might run into unforeseen problems. We have been developing the Zaunkoenig M1K for seven years though, so by now we have run into a lot of these unforeseen problems already. There cant be many more left. :P And because we produce everything where we live, in Germany, we can fix problems very quickly.\nInternational shipping (and local customs/VAT in particular) is a topic we lack experience. Customs/import duties/taxes outside of the EU: we would have loved to make it more convenient for our backers, but it's not viable for us with no real experience in international shipping to calculate so many different taxes into one and the same price.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nUsing switches with gold contacts ensures that the M1K will not develop accidental double click problems after a year or two, which so many gaming mice these days do. Further, the MCU of the M1K enables the user to install firmware, thus making the M1K future-proof.\nSustainable materials\nThe industry standard for mouse cables is a material called PVC which is widely regarded as being harmful for humans and the environment. Contrary, our mouse cable is made from polyurethane. Our cable meets ISO10993 Biological Compatibility, is RoHS and REACH compliant and free of phthalates and halogens.\nPer design the M1K has a very high material efficiency: we removed all the gimmicky features that traditional gaming mice have.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe produce locally in Germany where the production facilities are subject to the highest environmental standards in the world. The German factory that solders our PCBs is certified after ISO14001 which is together with EMAS the most important sustainability certificate in Europe.\nBeing highly vertically integrated with the cable, top and bottom shell being produced in-house in Germany, there is no complex supply chain creating unnecessary emissions.\nSustainable Distribution\nTo reduce our environmental impact, we use a tin box (100 % recyclable) for the product packaging. Also, by weighing just 23 grams, shipping the M1K uses up less resources.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Join the Zaunkoenig community", "descp": "The Zaunkoenig is the third smallest bird in Europe and is often confused with a mouse, because it likes to run through the undergrowth like a mouse.

Most struggle to master their daily nutrition. Designed for a healthy lifestyle and a simple life, with the Cell One we aim to create the most effortless indoor garden solution. Along with a plant-based nutrition guide based on sprouts and microgreens, Cell One will empower you to meet and sustain your nutritional goals. \nMost indoor gardening systems lack the size and ability to grow a substantial amount of fresh food. We are focusing on sprouts and microgreens since they are rich in nutrients and have a short growth period. That's why when it comes to providing fresh, unprocessed and whole food, our smart garden is the most efficient and sustainable solution on the market for indoor gardening. \nPerfectly designed for your lifestyle and your health\nCell One is more than another shiny appliance into your kitchen. This is the foundation of a lifestyle designed to help you meet and sustain your personal goals: Whether that be weight loss, muscle gain, overall health improvement or even increasing your athletic performance: We want to bring the best food to your life! \nHow Cell One works\nFirst, fill the water tank and insert the pre-seeded biodegradable seed pod. The Cell One automatically adapts the lighting and watering cycles to ensure your sprouts and microgreens thrive. An intelligent system of irrigation, LED lighting, sensors, and ventilation controls the microclimate for ideal growth and taste. \nAutomate Growing \u2013 Effortlessly grow food, and never kill a plant again\nSeed Pod\nYou have a bright verity of pre-seeded and biodegradable pods for microgreens, legumes and grain sprouts.\nAir circulation while sprouting is vital, and if the sprouts can\u2019t breathe while growing - they can die. Therefore, it is critical that seeds are at an ideal distance from each other. In the Cell Garden Pod seeds are already placed in the best possible arrangement. \nThe growth medium is made of natural, renewable materials, and are biodegradable. After harvesting the Cell Garden Pod can be thrown in compost bins, so Cell One is easy to maintain and keep clean.\nNo soil or additional substrates are needed for germination. All of the nutrients at the early microgreen stage come from the seed itself. This ensures each pod is perfectly clean, and ready to snip and eat.\nTo assure you the best crop we have selected high quality seeds that are organic, non-GMO and untreated (99% germinable). \nNo experience required \u2013 Peel the top and pop 'em in!    \nSave Money! \nMicrogreens, up there with gold, saffron, and perfume.\n\nWhat Cell One can grow\nOn three levels of the Cell One you can soak, germinate and grow various nuts, sprouts and microgreens at the same time. In three trays you can produce 15 different types of natural and sustainable superfoods.\nIn the top tray, with daylight and special LED light, you can grow microgreens such as radishes, alfalfa or broccoli. \nThe middle tray is particularly suitable for growing sprouts from buckwheat, oats, chickpeas, lentils and mung beans. \nIn the lower tray, rice, white beans or nuts can soak.\nProduce 15 different types of natural and sustainable superfoods\n WHY SOAK NUTS, GRAINS, AND SEEDS? \nBeans and nuts can contain substances that interfere with the body\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients. The process of soaking and sprouting grains, beans, and nuts reduces the anti-nutrient content and makes them more beneficial to the body. Soaking all types of nuts makes them taste fresh like picked from the tree and popped straight into your mouth. Create raw food vegan desserts, that are delicious, nutrient-rich, and give you the best energy. \nCell Garden App \u2013 monitor your garden health from anywhere\nOptimize plant growth, monitor water and light levels and notice when it's time for harvest - with the Cell Garden App you always have everything under control. \nWe have even created a clean, plant-based nutrition concept and an easy-to-use, free mobile Nutrition Assistant, based on sprouts and microgreens \u2013 the easiest way to get the nutrients you need.\nIn your Cell Garden App you get access to the Nutrition Assistant \u2013 whole food, plant-based recipes, shopping lists, meal plans and nutrition tips for a healthy lifestyle. \nPLAY\n\nThe mobile Nutrition Assistant is everything you need to make nutritious eating delicious and convenient, without any hassle. \n\nSprouts & Microgreens - fast, delicious, and nutritious\nSprouts and microgreens are one of nature\u2019s greatest superfoods. In a plants development, sprouts are the first stage and microgreens are the second.\nThe germination period of chickpeas is typically 2\u20133 days.\nThe growth period of broccoli microgreens generally is 4\u20135 days.\nThey are also packed with vitamins and enzymes to keep you healthy.\nThey are easy to digest, have a high biological value, rich nutrient density and \u2013 not to mention \u2013 fresh and tasty.\nWith Cell One microgreens thrive two times faster than typical.\nNutrient-Packed: Eat fewer greens, get 10x\u2013260x the nutrients!\nResearchers discovered that the microgreens contained four to 260 times more nutrients than their mature mother plant. \nSo, eating just a handful of microgreens can get you the nutrition of a full salad.\nFuel your body with nourishing eating \nOur cookbook, The Superfood Assistant, is about enjoying delicious, nutritious food to help people feel their best. With this new book, we want to inspire people to eat more fresh, whole and real foods. You will discover delicious recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner which are high in antioxidants and full of essential vitamins and minerals.  \n\nTestimonial\nTimo Hildebrand  Former German professional footballer\nPLAY\n\nCell One Technology\nSave space \u2013 Cell One has the size of a coffee machine  \nSprout up to six different plants in less than a square foot.\nProduct Design\nCell One has been through hundreds of iterations over 3 years, from sketches and ideas to cardboard mocks-ups, 3-D prints and prototypes, all leading to our fully operational model.  \nCell One symbolizes natural living and health, integrating itself in every room with its unique design.

It's the perfect compliment to every kitchen!\nCell Garden has partnered with Graustich, a pro for twenty years,  and Ren\u00e9 Goetzenbrugger has been creating products and brands. He was awarded internationally several times, latest in 2018 when he and his team received the \u201cGerman Innovation Award\u201d \u2013 an outstanding achievement in Goetzenbrugger\u2019s career thus far.\nProduct Engineering \nCell Garden has partnered with Lemberg Solution Ltd from UK to develop a 3D-printed and fully assembled design prototype. \nPLAY\n\nOur Story\nCell Garden is the creation of young visionary entrepreneurs who are on the mission to improve people's lives by clean and sustainable food, supported by smart technology to make these once-tedious tasks effortless.\nWe are three co-founders with different backgrounds and experiences. The passion for a healthy diet and smart, convenient technology drives us.\nMarina Zeisler, (B. A. International Business & M. A. Business Development) is responsible for Marketing and Sales. She brings deep experience in General Management, Corporate Strategy, Marketing and Sales, Russia and China. After graduating, she worked in Corporate Strategy until she finally followed her passion for healthy and delicious food and founded Cell Garden with her co founders Joe and Alex. She combines the power of diverse perspectives and a broad range of thinking.\nJoe Teips, our product engineer, has a Bachelor and Master in Mechanical and Product Engineering. He is the techie geek and has had the dream of a smart self-growing garden about the size of a coffee machine, which is well designed and fits in every lifestyle. He spent many years in manufacturing before he went to university. \nAlex Lier, our nutritionist, has a Master in Mechanical Engineering and has gained few years of experience in construction and project management. Nevertheless, he has a huge passion for nutrition and creating healthy and delicious recipes. He traveled a lot during his studies and collected much food inspiration from different countries. To gain more knowledge in food and nutrition he completed a degree as a nutritionist.\nSince starting on our mission over three years ago, we have been supported by business angels, family and friends, the industry, universities, venture capital, and state funds. As an innovative-driven and knowledge-based start-up, we have been supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy with the EXIST Business Start-up Grant during the preparation of the innovative technology.\nTeam\n\nWe are ready for full production with your support\nWe have been working on Cell One for over three years to create a connected ecosystem: our hardware, app, seed pod, cloud back-end, plant-based nutrition concept, and cookbook. The indoor garden you see in the video and the ecosystem around it is real, working prototypes. It\u2019s exciting to see how far we\u2019ve come, but now we need your help to start production and to bring Cell One into your kitchen. \n What's next \nRefine our engineering in a step called \"Design-for-Manufacture Engineering.\"\nCreate the tools required for mass production with our manufacturing partner \nSet up our first production run \nRun a test production of the alpha units ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur experienced manufacturing partner will build Cell One. With production facilities in Germany, they understand every step from design to direct fulfillment. \n\n\nWe began collaborating with our manufacturer at the Engineering Concept stage and have been in extremely close contact with our Mechanical, Electrical and Production engineers along the way.\n\nOur next step is to finalize the Design-for-Manufacture engineering. Our partner Helbling AG operates innovation centers in Switzerland, Germany, the USA, and China to support clients in developing the next generation devices as well as kitchen and home appliances from the first idea to market launch. Well-known companies such as Nestl\u00e9, Nespresso, Braun, Haier, Midea, Miele and Bosch trust in support of Helbling. Examples for the developed products are coffee machines, household appliances, power tools, and medical devices.\n\nHelbling supports Cell Garden with the industrialization of Cell One from the prototype to the successful start of series production. \"The industrialization of CellOne is part of Helbling's daily business. The project, therefore, is well plannable and involves no special risks,\" comments Johannes Eckstein, Head of Development at Helbling Technik.\n\nWe will then build the tools, get the final assembly line going, install testing equipment and do two more builds for stress testing before beginning production.\n\nWe believe that the risks described above are manageable, and we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver. We have the right talent and resources in place to meet our deadlines and get Cell One to you in time. Of course, we will be keeping our supporters in the loop and inform you of the progress.

Thanks to your support, we successfully funded and delivered the original Foldio & Foldio2 portable studio systems.\nThey were a HUGE success and have helped thousands of photographers, collectors, and business owners take beautiful, studio-quality photos using just their smartphone.\nWe\u2019re back with a new challenge \u2013 this time to bring our previous backers and new supporters the gift of 360 photography with the Foldio360. We believe that this project will be a catalyst for creating 3D image content for online environments.\nABOUT TEAM ORANGEMONKIE\nWe are a creative, dedicated team with members in California and Seoul. Our passion is finding new ways to harness and improve upon smartphone technology. So far, we have done this with two highly successful Kickstarter projects, the Foldio1 and Foldio2. Our motto, is \u201csimple but useful\u201d. We hope to empower photographers everywhere with simple, useful, and cost effective tools that they can use everyday for their business or hobby. Our projects are designed and developed completely in-house with lots of care. We thank you for supporting our new project.\nFoldio360 Kickstarter video on Youtube\nFoldio360 quick video on Youtube", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter successfully funding and delivering 2 other Kickstarter projects, we realize how important it is to recognize and reduce the risks that come with creating new products. This is especially true for electronic hardware devices, which take more time and money to reach mass production scale.\n\nFortunately, our team has experience in delivering successful Kickstarter products. For the Foldio360, we have spent months developing the prototype and working with our electronics manufacturer to ensure production and delivery goes smoothly once this fundraiser is completed. As long as there is demand for the Foldio360, we do not foresee any issues that could greatly challenge manufacturing or delivery. And if anything comes up, we will solve it quickly and efficiently as we have always done.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "The End of the year 2020", "update_content": "Hi, guys\nFinally the end of 2020 is coming.

It is an ESP8266 based open-source Wi-Fi development board to create IoT applications by virtualizing plug-n-play modules to RESTful APIs with mobile APPs.\nThe traditional methodology of building IoT applications consists of electronic engineering, micro-controller programming, network programming, IoT protocols handling and application development. Every step involves various hardware and software knowledge and challenges.\nThis time, we define a new way to create IoT applications. \nNo hardware programming. No breadboard. No jumper wires. No soldering. \n3 steps. 5 minutes. Build your own IoT applications!\nThank you so much for supporting Wio Link!  \nHere comes our stretch goals and let us know what do you expect for the next! :-)\nPLAY\n\nVisual Configuration\nWio Link provides simple visual configuration via mobile APPs to replace the complex micro-controller programming. Drag and drop the sensor tags to certain pins then you can visually set up the hardware.\n\n  OTA (Over-The-Air) Firmware Updates\nWio Link compiles firmware through cloud and can do OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates. All the hardware libraries are ready in the cloud and you can proceed with software and applications development directly.\n\n\nPlug-n-Play Groves\nWio Link connects to the large library of Grove modules. Grove is a family of plug and play, open-source sensors and actuators with standard interfaces as well as various functions. Much like Lego\u2122, it takes an approach of building blocks to assemble a project. No breadboard. No jumper wires. No soldering. \n\nNote: By now there have been 30+ Grove modules compatible with Wio Link and you can find most of them in the Rewards. We're working to add more continuously. \n\n\nIFTTT Application\nWio Link provides basic IFTTT (if-this-then-that) applications for you to interact with friends through Seeed IFTTT Channel. Make the LED strip light up in random colors or set up a reminder of wearing more clothes when it becomes colder. You could create more with Wio Link.\nAndroid & iOS APPs \nWio Link mobile APPs can be used on both Android and iOS devices. \nRESTful APIs\nRESTful API resources let you develop IoT applications easily with the \u201cvisualized\u201d sensors and actuators.\n Come and pick up your own package of Wio Link! We have provided the single pack and double pack of Wio Link development boards, the five  different themes of Grove kits and three large sets for friends, workshops and hackathons. There must be a suitable for you.\nWe've also developed some cute accessories of Wio Link. Just add the amounts to your pledge then we'll send you the mousepads or T-shirts together with the rewards.

Wearality\u2019s board of advisers and VR industry leaders speak out on the promise of the Wearality Sky\u2122.\nAnimated GIF compliments of kontis via Reddit\nThe next level of virtual reality (VR) wearable technology is here. We took a different approach - the lenses and the optics are the key to unlocking the ability to really experience what immersive 3D worlds are meant to be. Wearality wants to provide the tools to unleash this revolution of creative talent and ability - to launch a new medium. \nThe combination of a pioneering team of VR experts and the largest defense contractor in the world has built the most impressive VR optics for headsets in the world with an astonishing field of view of 150 degrees, giving you a new way to look at the world - one that is truly limitless. \nDevkit(early adopter) with removable blinders\nThe Technology Behind the Product  \nWe have shied away from using the standard spherical magnifying lenses you see in other VR HMDs. These lenses have the benefit of being exceptionally cheap, but at the cost of clarity and field of view.\n So what have we done differently?\nWe have developed a set of double Fresnel lenses that fundamentally change how you see your screen. Because the lenses calibrate your view such that you can only see half of the screen through each eye, the need of a central divider has been removed. It also means you cannot see past the edges of the screen, thus an outer housing would only be needed for preventing light bleed.\nWhy did we leave out the enclosure? \n As stated, the enclosure's real purpose is preventing light bleed. Our enclosure is actually comprised of a hat, and two optional blinders which block light from the top and sides respectively.Our enclosure free device:   1) Provides maximum portability. No other VR system is collapse-able.   2) Reduces simulation sickness by giving a fixed point of reference.     3) Allows for physical interaction with the screen\nThe Wearality SKY is differentiated in three primary dimensions: experience, portability and accessibility\nWidest field of view (FOV) head wearable display today (FOV 150 degrees vs. 90-100 degrees). \nCrystal clear and in focus everywhere with little or no color distortion. \nState-of-the-art, patented, double Fresnel lens technology designed by Lockheed Martin for the defense and aerospace industry. \nOpen design and increased FOV reduces or eliminates \u201csimulation sickness\u201d and eyestrain experienced by users of other systems.\nDevkit(early adopter) with removable blinders\nThis was filmed on an LG G3 smartphone with shaky hands and all. You are looking through the Wearality Sky lenses at a Nexus 6. We scanned a special Cardboard QR code to disable distortions and increase FOV. No barrel distortion.

We are available to all our supporters to help with our product should any issues or problems occur. \n\nUsage:\n\nThe Wearality SKY offers a truly immersive experience utilizing powerful, precision, optics. Therefore, when using please:\n\n1. Do not look directly into the Sun (good advice at any time).\n2. Do not leave exposed to direct sunlight (like any magnifying lens this can cause a fire).\n3. Use only in a safe environment that is clear of people and obstacles.\n4. During usage, be aware of your surroundings; do not leave children/stove/etc unsupervised.\n5. Not for use by children under the age of 13 without supervision.\n6. Take frequent breaks, even if you don't think you need one.\n7. If you experience discomfort, stop using device immediately.\n8.

When your eyes don't hit the sweet spot due to IPD, you get fuzzy images and eye strain which ruins your VR experience.

For instance, if we can get a personalized mod kit lens just for the DK2, it might be optimized to provide 150 degrees FoV, but it would be nice to know that if we decide to use those lenses with larger displays, we can get even higher FoV out of them. I think it would be wise to make one set of lenses that can be used with any reasonably sized display, and the only thing that changes the FoV would be the size of the display and the projection and distortion used on it.

That's why I pledged twice, one for July and another for October. I plan on using one set to show VR off to my friends, family, and people I meet at bars. The other set I will tinker with on other VR HMD's.

It will then turn a smartphone into a smart multimeter. The multimeter is a must have tool for every DIY, tinkerer or hardware hacker. This project was started two years ago by two makers, Michael and Tom. They could not find a multimeter that was convenient to carry, yet powerful and versatile enough to be useful in their wide range of projects. So they set out to build their own. Almost two years later, they are ready to introduce Voltset to the world of makers.\nVoltset is especially helpful when...\nPortable technology and troubleshooting on the go: Instead of bringing a traditional multimeter, aka \u2018the brick\u2019, pull out your Voltset and give a battery or resistor a quick test. Voltset may even suggest a thing or two based on your measurements. \nAuto-calculation, logging and Excel: No more writing down and punching in numbers. Measure voltage (V), resistance (\u03a9) and the built-in (Ohm\u2019s Law V= I*\u03a9) equation will return the estimated current (A) reading. If this is not enough, use the built-in Excel to save your data. With Voltset you can easily keep logs and make charts.\nBest Loyal Companion For Arduino And Raspberry Pi: Download the app plug-in and probe your Raspberry Pi / Arduino test points to diagnose your project. Voltset is your best tinkering companion like R2D2 for Luke Skywalker, and JARVIS for Ironman.\n\nVoltset compared to existing solutions on the market today\n \nFor hardware we are using Cortex-M3 as a microcontroller with a dedicated 50,000 count DMM chip. This solution provides accuracy and low power consumption. Combined with our Bluetooth extension module Voltset will be usable in multiple environments.\n\nMini test probes can be neatly wrapped around the case to bring with you. And you can always plug in regular cables from the front to expand its functionality. \n\n\nVoltset seamlessly integrates with your smartphone. It is getting smarter with each app update. Upload or share data to your cloud or with a community. Download add-ons or share your latest software with members of the open platform. \nSoftware Development Kit\n\u2022 We will be providing applications for both Android (requires at least Honeycomb/Ice Cream Sandwich) and iOS systems.\n\u2022 We will also be providing Voltset API Client Library for Java and .NET including a console tool for the Windows platform.  \n\u2022 We will be closely monitoring customer feedback in order to provide a wide range of software development solutions and developer support for the applications. \n\nCompatibility\n  Voltset is designed for CAT II which means it's safe to be used around the house (we are improving it to be CAT III capable). So you can use Voltset on most household appliances and with your favorite gadgets and toys. \nMetal Oxyde Varistors (VOM) are used for circuit protection offering up to 600VDC and 400Vrms against overvoltage transients such as lightning, power contact, and power induction. Resettable PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) fuses are also used to provide over current protection, and will reset automatically when the fault is removed and temperature returns to a safe level. This is considered a more convenient method than conventional fuses that need to be replaced manually.\nThe Voltset requires no batteries to function. As long as your smartphone works, so does your Voltset.\nNote: The Bluetooth extension module for Voltset is a risk free pledge, given that it will only be charged if more than 700 units are backed. We will be sending out a SURVEY after our Kickstarter campaign closes where you can respond with what Voltset accessory you included in your pledge amount. While we have a working prototype able to transmit values from the Voltset to an iPhone, further R&D is required to develop and design a module that is fully functional, tested and working with most devices.\nHaving reached our initial funding goal that will allow us to put Voltset in the hands of our backers, we now look forward to how we can improve it through your continued contributions. Help us reach these goals!\n            Tiny Circuits                                RabbitProto                              1Sheeld\n          Two years ago, we started building a handy multimeter concept that is convenient for us to carry around and help us do what we enjoy doing. Here are some of the early concepts:\n\nThis is our second design. We called it the mega voltset since it was pretty large. It actually had so many issues that we soon had to start re-designing it from scratch.\n\nMore coming soon.\n\n So where are we in the process?\nWe're fine-tuning Voltset V5 prototype - we are still working on fixing some bugs. With this version, Voltset is getting ready for a larger production run.\nDesigning Voltset V6 - this is the version you will be receiving!\nSetting up for mass manufacturing. The higher the number of units we make, the better the fab we can use, and it will also allow us to bargain for better parts to improve performance and make upgrades.\nWe are constantly improving functionality.\nListening to feedback 24/7 from you. You can find a direct live hotline to the project founders on www.voltset.com. We love to talk to people!\nThis is the team that has been working hard to bring Voltset to life. From the humble beginnings of the two co-founders, Tom and Michael, at Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship, to a growing team crossing multiple disciplines and continents. We have worked together towards achieving the joint vision of making tools smarter. Most of our communication relies on emails, Skype and Google hangouts, from early mornings until late nights, as American, European and Asian time zones require great flexibility. While at times it can be a challenge to coordinate meetings, this small inconvenience is far outweighed by the advantages of having a truly global and multicultural work environment. No matter where you are from, or what your background is, Voltset welcomes passionate and curious individuals who want to create value for society.\n\nThanks for stopping by, if you believe in what we do, please back our project and share it with your friends. Thank you!\nA Special thank you to these great people whose contributions helped get us where we are now:\nMarc Korbuly, Viola Wang, Winston Wang, Norns Song, Song Juju, Andrew Terranova, Elias Rodarte, Frances Cheng, Kyle McCormick, Eric Chen, Tyler Toy, Spring Liang and Leon.\n****Interested in getting in touch with us?

Most likely we will not be able to do anything about it.\n * Assembly\nWe might run into problems or delays with assembly, so we will make sure to run with at least 2 suppliers and assembly partners to reduce risk of late delivery. Additionally since we\u2019re very serious about the product we are designing, we might not be satisfied with the results that we are getting and therefore it might take us more time to address.\n * Large scale production\nMeasurements for device enclosures will be strictly monitored with every iteration of PCB. Enclosures will be designed simultaneously and accepted at the same time as the board itself.\n\nWe will make sure to communicate clearly with our backers, if there are any indications of delay, and make sure to keep backers posted on progress along the way.

When we adjusted the controller's scope, so to did our aim in Quake.\u201d - Tom's Guide\nReality Gaming\nUsing advanced computer vision and specialized optics to track your movements, Rescape lets you digitize the real world, pull any canvas you want over it, and then have you and your friends blow it to pieces! It actually lets you move around physically within a game, mimicking your and your friend\u2019s movements in the real world. Since there isn\u2019t really a name or genre for it already, we chose to simply call this mix of real and virtual reality gaming - Reality Gaming.\nRescape prototype\nRescape in action\nRescape is like no gaming experience you\u2019ve ever had \u2013 guaranteed.\nRescape is a hardware game controller and software for your smartphone which turns it into a reality gaming platform. Rescape puts players physically in the game \u2013 running, shooting and screaming. All your senses tell the same story, bringing a whole new level of immersion to mobile gaming.\nEven though the phone is small, the immersion is great when it's in front of your eyes and follows your movements.\nThe Rescape SDK, specifically developed for the Rescape hardware\u2019s special optics, maps your environment and tracks your movements in the real world with centimeter accuracy, enabling you to physically walk around in virtual worlds that map 1:1 to your real environment. See and hear the world around you like you\u2019ve never seen or heard it before through the screen and earbuds of your iPhone.\nGame controller with smartphone mount\nThe Rescape game controller is optimized for FPS gaming, with a trigger, a directional pad and a smartphone mount containing the specialized optics. The controller is resizable to accommodate different arm lengths and preferences, and the shoulder stock can even be removed completely.\nRescape game controller\nRescape computer vision technology and SDK\nUsing a technique called SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) pioneered by NASA and previously used mainly in robotics, the Rescape SDK maps and tracks your environment in real time using advanced computer vision and sensor fusion.\nPLAY\n\nVideo showing 13th Lab's SLAM from a car (playing at 2X speed). No GPS used, only computer vision and sensor fusion.\nThe SDK also contains a tool for quick and simple structural 3D reconstruction of large environments, allowing gamers to quickly create and digitally \u201cpaint\u201d large game spaces like an office and start a game. The SDK includes a C api as well as out of the box integration with the Unity game engine.\nThe Rescape SDK is 100% free to use and develop for, there are no license costs involved.\nMultiplayer support\nPLAY\n\nOne of the most fun parts of Rescape is the multiplayer support. Multiple players positions can be synced over the network, and your real friends replaced with digitized representations. You can collaborate, or play against each other, in teams or individually.\nEnable any existing FPS game for Rescape in a snap\nWhile Rescape enables a totally new genre of gaming, which we call Reality Gaming, where you digitize the real world and then shoot it to pieces, it can also drastically change the experience of any existing mobile FPS game in a snap.\nFor companies that want their existing FPS games to utilize Rescape\u2019s motion sensing technology as a six degrees of freedom (6 DoF) game controller, we have also included a directional pad on the game controller for moving over greater distances within a game without having to physically walk or run.\nRendering of the directional pad\n By adding support for Rescape into their existing games, which is just a matter of dropping in the free Rescape game controller library, developers can turn any existing iOS FPS game from a normal \u201csmall screen shooter\u201d into a fully immersive experience, beyond even the console gameplay experience. Once you and two of your friends have tried playing a game like Quake together using Rescape, running and jumping around like mad in your respective apartments, you\u2019ll never want to play it in any other way again!\nPLAY\n\n 6 degrees of freedom controller for any FPS game\nOptics optimized for robust visual tracking\nRescape includes optics which are optimized for robust visual tracking. It features a 180\u00b0 fisheye lens, which together with the Rescape computer vision SDK provides unparallelled motion tracking, even during very fast movements.\nDevice support\nThe first manufacturing batch will support: iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, and will include experimental support for the iPhone 4S.\nAndroid phones are a bit more complicated due to the greater span of different hardware and optics. We will be taking a device by device approach and expect to support a set of high-end Android devices in the months following the first release.\nProduct timeline\nMay 2014 \u2013 finalize mechanical and electrical design of the Rescape controller, find manufacturing partners\nJune 2014 \u2013 finalize Rescape controller and smartphone holder design, finalize agreements with manufacturing partner and suppliers\nJuly 2014 \u2013 make tooling for injection molding, produce and verify first pilot batch of electronics, CE certification\nAugust 2014 \u2013 manufacture and verify first pilot batch of the Rescape controller, finalize design of packaging and manual, start first full manufacturing batch\nSeptember 2014 \u2013 verify first full batch, start shipping Rescape controllers to our backers\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want to get the Rescape Controller and SDK in the hands of as many developers as we can, both large and small, so that they can play around with it and hopefully both add Rescape support for their existing titles to improve gameplay and user value of those, but also start imagining completely new games, that really leverage reality in a new way! \nWe also want to reach gaming enthusiasts and get the Rescape product in their hands early, involving them in the process and through their feedback making the Rescape product even better.\nThe team behind Rescape\n13th Lab is a computer vision startup based in Stockholm, Sweden.

In 2011 we released the first consumer SLAM application on the app store, the game Ball Invasion. In early 2012 we provided this technology for free to developers through the PointCloud SDK.\nRescape was born when we realized that this amazing technology which can understand the world around you and how you move in it, could let you turn the world around you into a game, where your movements in the real world are captured and mimicked in real-time in the virtual world.\nAfter some brainstorming, hacking and cardboard prototyping people who tested it were amazed at the experience we had created.\nEarly Rescape designs and prototypes\n3D printed prototypes\nWe hope you are as excited about Rescape as we are, and that you will help us making the world around us a game by backing our Rescape campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked very hard to minimise risk as much as possible before starting this campaign.

They are dedicated, traditional, well functioned, and most importantly, expensive. They are usually only available and affordable to academic and industry. Individuals, however, are not lucky enough to get the best electronic instruments as they want. This is how we are inspired to make DSLogic.\nAfter extensive research on the principles of professional electronic instruments, such as Logic Analyzer, Oscilloscope, DAQ, etc., we realized that many of them have the same core circuit unit \u2013 the sampling and storage circuit.\nDSLogic consists of DSLogic-Core and extension modules. DSLogic-Core is a re-configurable circuit board based on FPGA technology with maximum 200MHz sampling rate and 64Mbit on-board memory. DSLogic-Core can work alone as a fully functional logic analyzer, along with various extension modules.DSLogic can also work as oscilloscope, data acquisition system, protocol analyzer and even RF analyzer.\nTraditional electronic instruments are limited to capture electronic signals. However we believe people need a more creative tool to discover the world, so we also made a special wireless extension module and corresponding wireless probe that is compatible with Arduino board. All you need to do is to connect the probe to existing Arduino sensors, and then DSLogic would automatically capture the sensor data, and visualize them on your computer at real-time without any additional efforts. With this functionality, you will be able to use the Arduino probe to discover the real world, including: physical inputs, such as temperature, humidity, light, sound, magnetic; abstract physical variables, such as distance, speed, accelerometer, force; and even biological signals, such as heartbeat, emg, brainwave, etc.\nWhy DSLogic?\nFully functional and low cost USB-based logic analyzer\nThere are already many USB-based logic analyzers in the market, such as professional LAP-C (162000+) from Zeroplus, well-designed Logic16 from Saleae, and low-cost Open Workbench Logic Sniffer from Dangerous Prototypes. However, they are either lack of functions or with high cost.\nDSLogic is DIFFERENT! You will know DSLogic through the comparison of Sample depth, Sample bandwidth and Price, the most important parameter of logic analyzer.\n*The price of LAP-C(162000+) was captured from Amazon: http://goo.gl/6GqvZa\nCheck out the complete comparison between DSLogic and other logic analyzers as followed.  With the same features that LAP-C(162000+) supports, DSLogic is more than 90% cheaper.\nOpen Source and Extensible\nWe've benefited tremendously from the open source community, so in return, we would like to benefit other people as well.DSLogic is a completely open sourced product. All of our design files(software/firmware source code, schematic diagrams, board designs, and bill of materials) will be open source. \nOur host side software is created based on sigrok (www.sigrok.org) , a portable, cross-platform, Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various device types. We mainly focus on the improvement of human interactions. With the solid open source community support, there is no need o worry about the maintain and upgrade of DSLogic software.\nGet DSLogic software on our website: www.dreamsourcelab.com, and give us your feedback. We will keep improving the DSLogic software.\nDSLogic hardware is also extensible. We want to make it as easy as possible to be extended and improved upon what we've built. Thus you can build your own extension module for your needs, and share them to other people.Based on this iteration, DSLogic will be growing up in the open source community, and benefit more and more people\nArduino Compatible\nWe love Arduino. It brings happiness and fun to many people in doing hardware projects.  Lots of their existing components can be directly used in various projects. Our wireless probe is also compatible with Arduino, so you don't need to develop your own sensor, but instead, just connect to the Arduion compatible sensor and DSLogic will visualize the sensor data for you. \nAdditionally, you can reprogram our wireless probe under Arduino platform. DSLogic can graphically display any data. It can help you have more fun and verify your ideas faster.\nEasy-to-use Software\nTraditional instruments are faced to well-trained engineer, so their software is powerful but not intuitive for everyone. DSLogic software is designed under the easy-to-use principle.\ncursors\nWe are really proud of the cursors design of DSLogic software. it is the most convenient interaction to insert, move, delete and goto a cursor. You don't need to find any menu, or worry not enough cursors. Just simple mouse click to put any cursor on anywhere.\nPLAY\n\nProtocol decoders\nProtocol decoders are essential for logic analyzer. Currently, DSLogic software support following bus decode: I2C, SPI, Serial, DMX512 and 1-wire bus. We will add more protocol decoders according to backers' requirements. And, we also hope open source community can help us to build a more powerful protocol decoding system, which will benefit everyone.  \nPLAY\n\nzoom system\nDSLogic software support mouse based zoom system. You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out, left button to drag, right button to zoom a rectangle region. Additionally, first double click will show you the full view, and second double click will back to the previous scale.\nPLAY\n\nTrigger system\nSimple and advanced trigger system is supported by DSLogic. The left side channel based trigger buttons can be used to quickly set a simple trigger flag, like high, low, rising edge or falling edge. The right side trigger dock can be used to set a complex trigger flag, include trigger position, 16 levels trigger stage, two match units for each stage and 16 bits counter for each match unit. \nPLAY\n\nPattern Search\nPattern search is an important feature of logic analyzer. However, we can only found it on high-end logic analyzer. We think you will love the pattern search feature on DSLogic software. \nPLAY\n\nDSLogic software has many other cool features. For example, you can use mouse cursor to get width, frequency and period of digital signals; move and disable any channel, or group several channels into a group signal. You can also save current data into a file, and reload it at any time. DSLogic software also support hot plug, you can plug or unplug DSLogic hardware even when capture is going on.\nDSLogic Specification\nHardware\nInterface for logic analyzer\nCH15 ~ CH0:  \nRecommended input voltage range: -6V to +6V\nAbsolute input voltage range: -30V to +30V\nInput impedance: 200Kohm\nMaximum Input Bandwidth: 50MHz\nCompatible voltage systems: 1.8V / 2.5V / 3.3V / 5V\nThreshold for 1.8V to 3.6V: 0.7V (Low) / 1.4V (High)\nThreshold for 5V: 1.4V(Low) / 3.6V(High) \n CLK, TI, TO: \nCompatible voltage systems: 3.3V\nMaximum state clock: 50MHz\nWireless Specification\n300 foot range at 250kbps\nOn-board ceramic 2.4GHz Antenna\n250kbps, 1Mbps and 2Mbps on air data rates\nAuto ACK\nAuto Re-Transmit\n6 data pipe MultiCeiver\u2122\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe need your support to help us fund the production of DSLogic. With them, we can buy components much cheaper in bulk quantities, and have the DSLogic boards professionally assembled at a very reasonable cost.  This directly benefits you to get a powerful instrument by a lower price.\nIf the Kickstarter campaign would be successful, we would like to open DSLogic for backers, and release it to public in a few months.  We've completed one extension of DSLogic so far.  However, we've already got lots of ideas on extensions, such as: \nanalog extension for oscilloscope\nRF detector and analyzer extension\nSpecific protocol extension, like USB\nWe definitely need more hands on this project. We hope talented people in open source community would make a lot of useful extensions, share them, and participate in improving DSLogic. This would let all of us make things better.\nRewards\nOur Team\nDreamSourceLab is a team of enthusiastic engineers, who want to help individuals eliminate the barrier to hardware projects.  We aim to provide everyone with the technology that used to be only available to academic area and industry.  We would like to encourage more people to make their own awesome projects, have more fun, and participate in maker movement.\nThe core team is as follows:\nAndy Deng: DreamSourceLab Co-founder. Has a master's degree in computer architecture, the designer and creator of the DSLogic. USB bus specialist, participate in several USB chips design and production. With over 8 years digital logic design experience, he works with various instruments every day, and really hates the interaction interface of traditional instruments. He wants to redesign these instruments. DSLogic is a start. And with your support, his dream will become a reality.\nBinary Fu: DreamSourceLab Co-founder. Has a master's degree in computer architecture, and a professional hardware engineer for more than 6 years, has designed dozens of circuit boards, main designer of the DSLogic hardware boards. Like mountain climbing and photography.\nJixin Li: Software engineer. Graduated from Johns Hopkins University. Always knows the best way to implement an intuitive software. Loves to travel.\nWhere are we today?\nDSLogic is a complex system.  Design phases involve circuit, logic, firmware, driver and software.   In order to make it as a high-speed electronic instrument, we also needed to execute signal integrity analysis, stability and noise immunity test, over-voltage and over-current protection design. We have been working on DSLogic project for over 6 months.  The prototype development and various tests have also been done.\nNow, we are focusing on the production of DSLogic, including the test of production version PCB and final software optimization. \nHardware\nThe hardware of DSLogic includes DSLogic-core board, wireless extension board and Arduino probe board.  All these three boards have passed the prototype test and are currently in quantitative production testing phase.\nSoftware\nNewest update (15/12): Linux version is available!\nWe have finished the first version of driver and software development.  DSLogic can be run in Windows systems, including Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.\nDSLogic software is not only intuitive, but also stable and smooth. \nThe production plan\nTwo iterations of the DSLogic hardware have been produced.  All of them are made in ShenZhen, China.  \nDSLogic-core, wireless extension and Arduino probe boards are in final round of testing for mass production.We will start the production immediately after this campaign is over.\nPer the discussion with our manufacturing partners in ShenZhen, time frame for production is set for three weeks, including parts sourcing, PCB production, soldering and cables assembles. However, Jan 31st 2014 is Chinese New Year and there will be national holidays for a week.  To account for the holidays, we eventually plan for five weeks in manufacturing. \nAfter manufacturing is done, we will proceed with production test and quality control, for additional two weeks. This will be done in our own platform and software in test mode.\nShipping preparation will be done while manufacturing is in progress.  All rewards are set to be shipping by mid-March of 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDSLogic is a project involving both hardware and software. Like all the other engineering projects, it carries risks in product development, manufacturing and physical delivery.\n\nFortunately, the risk in our product development is minimal. DSLogic software is almost done. You can get the source code and executable file from our website: www.dreamsourcelab.com. We would love to maintain and improve it. On the other side, DSLogic hardware, including DSLogic-core, wireless extension and Arduino probe, has been prototyped and tested iteratively as well. We are ready to release to production. Additionally, we are preparing a small-scale test in open source community. If necessary, we will do the final update during this campaign. After the funding period, we will start production.\n\nOur biggest challenge is manufacturing, but don't worry! We have already established close relationship with our manufacturing partner in Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing capital of the world. All the parts used by DSLogic have been confirmed for mass production. We also have considered various factors that might affect the progress. Substantial time has been planned to avoid delays.\n\nLastly, we have been in touch with several global package delivery companies. We only consider companies with good reputations to ensure that your rewards arrive on time in perfect condition. In case of unforeseen circumstances, we will keep in touch with our backers, and try our best to overcome any difficulties.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "We are back!", "update_content": "Dear All, \nFirst of all, we should apologize to all of our backers because of the long time without any update.

Check our new Christmas reward! \nTODAY YOU HAVE THE LAST CHANCE TO GET YOUR CHRISTMAS REWARD! \nYou can order it until Tuesday 17.12.13 3PM PST. \n[Image removed by Kickstarter]\nWhat is the NeuroOn?\nNeuroOn is the world\u2019s first brainwave - monitoring SLEEP MASK that allows you to switch from monophasic to polyphasic sleep. That means you can sleep less and more efficiently.\nWake up!\nDo you ever feel sleepy? \nAre your plans to take over the world taking up all your free time? So much to do and so little time? \nWe're the same!\nDo you dream about squeezing extra hours into your schedule to have fun, relax or work?\nSo do we! \nWhy not do just that with the NeuroOn?\n                                         As seen on:\n                   What is your dream?\nDo you need more energy and to feel well - rested?\nDo you want to pack even more into your day?\nDo you want to have more control over your day?\nDo you hate jet lag?\nDo you just need that few extra hours every day?\nDo you want to be a hero by day and a superhero by night?\nThe NeuroOn is for you!\nThe final prototype\nWhat is polyphasic sleep?\nIt is a term referring to alternate sleep patterns that can reduce the required sleep time to just 2-6 hours daily. It involves breaking up your sleep into smaller parts throughout the day, which allows you to sleep less but feel as refreshed as if you slept for 8 hours or more.\nPolyphasic sleep modes\nSimply put, it's a series of fine-tuned power naps that allow you to sleep effectively, rest better and perform at optimum energy levels during the day.\nAdditionally, NeuroOn monitored polyphasic sleep allows you to sync your body clock to very demanding schedules at whatever time is convenient or required.\nIn conclusion, through great sleep efficiency, Polyphasic sleep can give you an extra 4 hours of free time every day. That\u2019s up to 28 hours (1 day+) a week, 1460 hours a year. \nThat\u2019s right - Your year now has over 420 working days!\nTrust the masters\nSo, you\u2019ve heard of Leonardo? No, not the turtle!\nApparently Da Vinci, Tesla, Churchill and even Napoleon used polyphasic sleep to rest. It allowed them to fully regenerate, reducing sleep time to 6.5 hours or sometimes just 2 hours. And those guys got things done!\nFamous polyphasic sleepers\nScience that helps you sleep. (Details)\nNeuroOn is a wearable sleeping mask that measures your biological signals, including: brain waves (EEG - electroencephalography), muscle tension (EMG - electromyography) and eye movements (EOG - electrooculography).\nAll the data collected from a user's sleep is transformed from analogue readings to digital analysis and sent via wireless interface fully compliant with Bluetooth 4.0 LE to a smartphone application.\nWiring diagram\nWhen you sleep, you go through two phases: REM and NREM and one follows the other. Using intelligent analysis based on data collected by the NeuroOn, the device will wake you up after your last REM phase, allowing you to feel fully rested and energized.\nData collection and communication\nThanks to the use of the newest technologies we were able to create a device that will improve your effectiveness and concentration at work to the best possible levels. Measurements of EEG, EOG and EMG, coupled with the usage of artificial intelligence, allows us to create the world's first digital sleep-control system that provides accuracy close to professional polisomnographic clinics. It's a whole new level above current, simple solutions that only use accelerometer readings to detect sleep phases. The NeuroOn reads biological signals direct from your body, allowing for super precise and in-depth measurements.\nNeuroOn construction\nNeuroOn will be powered with the inner battery. It will be rechargeable using micro-USB charger. The battery works for at least 10 days.\nPLAY\n\nThere\u2019s an app for that!\nNeuroOn is managed by a smartphone Android and iOS application so that you have full control over your sleep cycles.\nWhen you are sleeping, the app is working hard to learn your personal sleeping preference and style. Yeah, you\u2019ve got style!\nOur intelligent algorithms calculate your individual sleep patterns. The NeuroOn app not only records your sleep data, but also helps you to analyze and optimize your sleep to make sure you enjoy your every waking moment.\nUsing the app, you can access your complete and personalised data about your sleep and rest at any time.\nYou can then analyze your data to choose the best sleeping pattern for you, reducing both stress and fatigue.\nOh, and jet lag. Who needs it?\nNo more of that! With the NeuroOn mask you can manage your sleep and rest whenever and wherever you want - not just when your travel plans make you. You can easily eliminate jet lag and travel without having to recharge after every flight!\nConsider turning on Polyphasic sleep mode.\nThis is supposedly the way Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, Nicola Tesla and, we suspect, Bruce Wayne, used to sleep. Sleep less yet have more energy. Enjoy longer, more efficient days. Sleep a total of just 2 hours a day and let your productivity soar.\nWith NeuroOn you could sleep/ nap wherever you want.\nAm I dreaming? \nThe NeuroOn can pinpoint the exact start of your REM phase. NeuroOn has technology that helps you induce lucid dreaming, whenever you want. So you can literally control your dreams.\nDreamy design\nWe went through dozen of designs, working tirelessly on the look and feel of the NeuroOn.\nProduct early sketches\nIt took months to create the final artificial intelligence algorithms, which fit the bill. Today we finally have our working prototype and we\u2019re ready for start manufacturing!\nProduct early sketches vol. 2\nOn the inside, we make the NeuroOn from soft, comfortable materials with the ability to adjust to your face, thanks to the use of viscoelastic foams - the latest version of memory foam.\nProduct early sketches vol. 3\nThe outside of the mask is fully customizable with various designs, including your own designs, so you can sleep in style.\nEvolution of PCB\nTo receive bioelectrical signals we use the electrodes created from electroconductive dry materials. Our electrodes are not going to co-operate with traditional EEG or ECG machines because of their high resistance and high level of contact potential difference. A substantial problem is the sizeable difference of resistances between the couples of electrodes in one canal.\n\nPCB version 1.0\n That's why we decided to build a dedicated and extraordinary biological amplifier which manages measurements perfectly in adverse conditions. With the aid of our original construction there is no need to humidify electrodes before using them. It's enough to put your finger on the surface and you'll see smooth ECG signal. If you want to see EEG waveform simply apply electrodes to your forehead, it's easy as that!\nPCB version 2.0\nPCB version 2.1\nPCB version 2.2 under construction\nAttached below are the waveforms of ECG, EEG and EOG signals registered by our team. When you look at the spectrogram you can easily see the level of particular componential frequencies which distinguish relaxation state from the concentration state that are followed one by one in 15 second intervals. When a person is focused on solving a task and his or her frontal lobe is activated, a major action of faster beta waves occurs in the band above 16 Hz. In the opposite situation - relaxation state - you can observe lack of the aforementioned activity and an increase in alpha waves\u2019 amplitude 15 sec. after finishing the task.\nECG signal (chest)\nECG signal (fingers)\nEOG (eye movements)\nEEG (brainwaves during the concentration)\nOne of the main features of our biological amplifier is an ability to change parameters of its own analogue track. During profiling the signals it can easily switched from tracking high-amplitude signals (like the ECG) to the lower ones (like brain waves) in the suitable moment. There's no black box magic in it, only pure and advance engineering and our original patents. Not to mention that our device is fully safe and energy-saving, it can work steady one week without charging regardless of what power (battery or accumulator) you will use.\nSleep safe\nThe electronics at the heart of the NeuroOn provide the highest precision of sleep measuring. Crucially, for the user's safety, data is only transmitted when the mask is not touching the user's face. Data transmission to the smartphone only occurs when you take the mask off in the morning.\nSleeping with NeuroOn is comfortable in every position.\nWhen you rest, it\u2019s a comfortable sleeping mask. When you wake up, it becomes a superhero mask, setting you up for whatever lies ahead.\nColorful foams\nThe competition? They must be dreaming!\nNeuroOn provides a whole new level of sleep monitoring and optimization. All the other smartphone apps and sleeping solutions currently available, that claim to analyze and help you sleep efficiently, rely purely on accelerometer readings.\nYour every twist and turn affects the \u201csleep analysis\u201d and can completely nullify all the data collected.\nAccelerometer is less precise than biological signal processing\nOnly the NeuroOn analyzes your movement, your eye movement and your brainwaves all together for super accurate and reliable readings. Using an accelerometer alone is like using one note to compose a symphony.\nCurrent prototype (the backside view)\nCurrent prototype (the frontside view)\nThe President of Poland - our Honorable #001 User\nPLAY\n\n  We were given an opportunity to pitch NeuroOn for the most influential people of Poland, including the President. He loved our product and devoted almost half the duration of his speech to it, eager to learn more. We were truly honored to present a NeuroOn mask (formerly \u2018Zizz\u2019) to the President, who became our first user!\n\n\nKamil Adamczyk is handing over the smart sleep mask to the President\nKnow who you\u2019re getting into bed with\nWe\u2019ve always dreamt about great technology and our passion is the human brain \u2013 eminent and inscrutable. We have all chosen our unique areas of study independently in varying fields, but we\u2019ve combined our expertise to create an incredible product.\nKamil Adamczyk pitch at Ennovation conference\nKnowing more about the brain (undoubtedly the most important and fascinating part of the human body) is something we will definitely want to achieve.

Even expensive precise multimeters can be severely limited on their current ranges by the shunt burden voltage and tolerance.\nMeasure the standby and sleep current of the latest generation of microcontroller and other digital electronics, energy harvesting devices etc, down to the nanoamp (or even picoamp!) level with superb accuracy.\nThe \u00b5Current also works as a precision x100 voltage amplifier.\nSee my article originally published in Silicon Chip magazine about this project and explaining burden voltage.\nThousands of the original \u00b5Current are in use all around the world, and it has quickly become the industry standard low cost tool for low power current measurement in modern low power microcontroller based digital electronics. The \u00b5Current GOLD is the latest design with greatly improved specs over the original design:\n0.1% vs 0.5% on the mA range\n0.05% vs 0.1% on the \u00b5A and nA ranges\n300KHz bandwidth vs 8KHz bandwidth\n+/-1.25A vs +/- 0.3A maximum current (& improved mA range burden voltage)\nShorting switch\nWith the extra bandwidth you can now measure fast changing \u201csleep\u201d modes in microcontrollers. The added shorting mode ensures uninterrupted power to your device under test whilst changing ranges. The \u00b5Current can rival 5 1/2 digit multimeters in accuracy, it is truly a precision instrument. \nMADE IN AUSTRALIA!\nMost kickstarter hardware projects just \"shop the job out\" to a manufacturer in china. I take great pride in not doing that, I want to encourage electronics manufacturing here in Australia.\nThe box is made in Australia, and the units will be assembled and tested here in Sydney under my control using prime spec original parts. \nLike the previous version, the design is Open Source Hardware.\nThe funds all go towards buying parts in production reels and production quantities. Some of the specialised parts have to be ordered in full reels only. \nSpecifications \u2013 \u00b5Current GOLD \n3 Current ranges: \n+/- 0-1250mA (20\u00b5V / mA burden voltage typical) * switch contact resistance plays a role here. 10uV due to the shunt resistor. \n+/- 0-1250\u00b5A (10\u00b5V / uA burden voltage) \n+/- 0-1250nA (10\u00b5V / nA burden voltage) \nOutput Voltage Units:  1mV/mA, 1mV/\u00b5A, 1mV/nA\nNOTE: You simply read your milivolt multimeter range as if it were mA/\u00b5A/nA \nResolution (nA range):\n100pA (3.5digit meter)\n10pA (4.5 digit meter)\n1pA (5.5 digit meter) \nAccuracy (typical):\n<+/-0.05% on \u00b5A and nA ranges\n<+/-0.1% on mA range. \nOutput Offset Voltage: <50\u00b5V (essentially insignificant on 4.5 digit meter) \nBandwidth:>300KHz (-3dB)\nTemperature Drift: <10ppm / degC (\u00b5A/nA), <15ppm / degC (mA)\nNoise: < -90dBV\nTHD: < -60dB\nBattery: CR2032 Lithium coin cell Battery Life (NOT supplied): >50 hours (battery good LED ensures accurate measurement when LED is on).\nNOTE: Yes, I know not including a battery really sucks, but it is illegal to ship even such a piss-weak lithium battery in the units by air freight, these are Australia Post's ridiculous rules.

I currently have all these parts to hand for a small number of units, also I also have some larger volumes on order already, due for delivery in early January, so I have anticipated this project going ahead and have put down some serious money already.\nOnce I know how the campaign is going I will be able to confidently order more of these critical parts, above the ones I already have to hand.\nHowever, it is possible that if the campaign gets too big, there is the possibility of long lead times on some parts from the manufacturers (one part is quoted as 12 weeks).\nAlso, whilst I know the manufacturer has stock of a certain part, and I can get them in a week or so, I cannot control someone snapping up all the manufacturers stock before I can order them and forcing a long lead time.\nI do anticipate being able to supply at least a few thousand units if required in the given time frame, so long lead times would be an exceptional case.\nOther things like the contract manufacturers screwing something out and delaying this is also a risk to the schedule.\nAll this is no different to the usual risks of any other electronics hardware production project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "\u00b5Current now available for general sale", "update_content": "For all those who have asked, the \u00b5Current is now available from my new store.\nNo plans to sell it through the distributors like I did last time, it's only available from my store for worldwide shipment.\nThanks\nDave."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "All units now shipped!", "update_content": "Shipped the final 50 units today!\nIt has taken about a month longer than expected to get the final units out due to the volume and a few hiccups, but otherwise the campaign shipped basically on time except for the final units.\nThere are still quite a few who, after repeated requests, haven't provided an address, so I will have to deal with those now.

Seriously though, it works! Our illustrations are fun, quirky and memorable and we have plans, big plans, if you will help us! Chineasy has been on the Internet now for a few months, since my TED talk, and we have already amassed quite a following, if we do say so ourselves. We have turned to Kickstarter because we KNOW that there is a real desire for a book, as well as other Chineasy material. We are here because people won\u2019t stop asking us for MORE!\nIt is evident that people are hungry to learn about China. People are keen to be able to communicate with the 1.3 billion people. Yet there is not much out there to enable them to do so. Whilst the entire Chinese population is learning English, it is time for us to really comprehend this complex economy and society with our own eyes, knowledge and judgment. Knowing their language is the first baby step but a crucial one.\nThe real agenda behind this project is to bridge the gap between the East and the West.\nI want to give the West a real understanding and knowledge of China and Chinese culture through their own eyes rather than through layers of packaging, manipulation or loss in translation. Chineasy will become the first step for anyone in the world who wants to understand China, Chinese culture and its language. It is educational, social, cultural and inspirational. I am demonstrating the beauty of this deep and ancient culture with a modern interpretation through sleek modern design. For me this is also an arts project, as I grew up in an artistic family. I am connecting the dots by going back to my artistic upbringing, and connecting my life's journey through the East and the West.\nThe Methodology\nThe Chinese language has long been considered the most difficult major language to learn, largely on account of the vast number and complexity of its characters. Being a Taiwanese native now living in London, this is a fact I am acutely aware of. When I began to teach my British born children Chinese, I realized just how difficult Chinese characters are for a native English speaker to learn. It was like torture for my kids! So I spent many years looking for a fun and easy way to teach them how to read Chinese. After years of searching, I realised that none of the methods out there were engaging or efficient enough. So I did what any entrepreneur would do, I created my own method to learn how to read Chinese characters: Chineasy. And you know what? It works.\nChineasy allows people to learn to read Chinese easily by recognising common characters through simple illustrations. Behind the charming and engaging illustrations, the entire system is based on a rather complex programme I designed on my computer by breaking down and reconstructing thousands of characters. It is the CPU behind this method.\nThe magical power of the Chineasy method is that by learning one small set of building blocks, students can build many new words, characters, and phrases. Master a few building block sets and your learning will accelerate to a whole new level. With very little effort, learners are able to read several hundred Chinese characters and phrases whilst simultaneously gaining a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural influences behind the vocabulary. Even though there are tens of thousands of Chinese characters, only a few hundred are actually necessary to comprehend basic Chinese literature and begin to delve into Chinese culture and art.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary has 171,476 words in it, but I think it is safe to say that most people do not know all 171,476 of them. In Chinese, though we have thousands of characters, not all of them are needed to understand the language. For instance:\n20,000 = Characters in a Scholar's vocabulary \n1,000 = Characters used in standard literacy \n200 = Characters used Basic literacy\nWith top 200 most frequently used characters a person will be able to understand about 40% of the basic Chinese literature. The trick is to know how to build phrases by using those characters. This is enough to understand Chinese found in Menus and on road signs.\nIn Chineasy we started off with 8. With these 8 building blocks we can quickly build hundreds of compounds (made up of two or more building blocks) and phrases (made up of two or more building blocks & compounds). Have a look at Chineasy.org then you will be amazed how many more characters and phrases you are able to recognise and remember just knowing the first set of 8 building blocks.\nAre you are confused by all of the terminology? See below\nHow we create illustrations\nWhat makes Chineasy unique is its beautiful visual style, which is highly memorable, but also captures the fun and modern side of Chinese. But, these simple illustrations are anything but simple to create \u2013 as our three designers will tell you! Each character we create has to follow the same three guidelines: they have to look stunning, be stylistically consistent with what we have produced before and most importantly they have to be educationally effective.\nBefore we even start designing our team researches the definition, origin and history of the character. We then move on to the applications (for example, how to build more characters and phrases) and finally we consider how to make stories out of them.\nAfter this research our designers create their different interpretations of the character. We always have several versions and numerous drawings for each. Between us we then discuss, debate, bounce ideas and then finally decide on a final version to you. Each character is one of our children!\nHelp us!\nWith your help we would like to publish a Chineasy book. We have already made a start, but we want to do more and we want to share the characters with you in all of their Glory! With your help we can finish our first batch of characters and publish them in a beautifully bound book. We hope to include characters and phrases and stories (what sort of book would it be without some stories!)\nIf we succeed we would also like to produce even more educational material such as an App and audio recordings, we have so many things planned!!!!!!\nThe Creator\nShaoLan in her own words: Hiya All! Growing up as the daughter of a calligrapher and ceramic artist in Taiwan, art and an appreciation for the beauty of the Chinese language has always been a huge part of my life, but I admit\u2026it is not easy to learn!\nI\u2019d like to think of myself as an entrepreneur, geek, writer, traveler and dreamer. I have had several dramatic career changes in the past and, while studying for an MBA, I wrote four best-selling books on software.. In my second semester I co-founded my first venture, pAsia Inc, which became a major player in the Internet sector in the Greater China area in the late 1990\u2019s. After moving to London, I began investing in and advising young technology companies through Caravel Capital, which I founded in 2005 whilst studying at the University of Cambridge. So you could say that I have now come full circle with Chineasy as I have finally gone back to my artistic roots...\nBut, Chineasy isn\u2019t a one-man band! We have been incredibly lucky to have the artistic talents of the illustrator Noma Bar supporting us. He saw something in Chineasy and has been helping the whole team come up with fun and memorable illustrations for all of the characters \u2013 it is not an easy task!\nBreaking down the Great Wall of Chinese one character at a time!\nWhat Your Support Means!\nAs well as the book, the money we raise on Kickstarter will also let us fund the expansion of Chineasy in the following ways:\nChineasy Rewards - Go on, you know you want them!\nOnce we are funded we will be able to create more SET posters such as Nature, Animal and Person!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEverything is uncertain in life, but the one thing you can be sure of is that if we get the money you will get the rewards of your choice.

We will aim to get everything to you by Christmas so that you can share the Chineasy love with the whole family, but unfortunately, we cannot be responsible for the post (though we will do our best!).\n\nAll stretch goals will be initiated once the campaign is successful, but wont be completed for at least 4 months due to the commissioning process. \n\nOnce we get the book published copies will eventually become commercially available in early 2014, however Kickstarter backers would get theirs first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Happy Lunar New Year of the Dog!", "update_content": "Happy Lunar New Year of the Dog!

But it can be hard to keep those baby plants alive!\nBefore I started making terracotta seed-starters in my garage, I killed a lot of seedlings.  In the delicate seedling phase, plants need gentle watering every single day, twice a day if it\u2019s hot outside. With long hours and work travel, sometimes it just wasn\u2019t possible for me to keep those baby plants alive.\nAbout a year ago I had an idea for a new way to solve this problem.  I invented a terracotta self watering seed-starter with a reservoir for water, and porous walls that keeps seedlings happy for about a week between waterings.\nMy mother in law sent me this picture of her tomato starts after they\u2019d been left alone for nine days while she was on a trip.\nAfter debuting my invention last September, I started selling out all the production runs I could make in my garage.  I found some local artisans  here in California to help me meet the growing demand.\nBigger is Better for Baby Plants\nNow I\u2019m working on a new, bigger model.  The 12-pack allows you to grow bigger seedlings, and more of them.  Big is great for the plants, but it's too much for me to handle in the garage.  I need your help to make this product a reality.\nWith your support, I can pay for professional mold-making, and begin manufacturing with my partners in California.  THANK YOU for supporting the Self-Watering Kitchen Garden!\nRewards\nI'll be offering the 12-pack to supporters of this project before it's available to the general public.  After the Kickstarter is over, you'll be able to choose from 4 glaze colors:  White and green will be offered, plus 2 wild-card colors that will be chosen by supporters of the project.\nI also have a limited edition Original Sixie seed-starter, postcard, tote bag and organic cotton t-shirt as additional rewards.\nAll rewards include the cost of shipping.\nThank you for your support of the Orta Self-Watering Kitchen garden!\n\nNew Rewards - Seeds!\nMany of you have asked, and here they are! I have designed 5 trios of seeds that will work well with all Orta Seed-Starters and are easy to grow in the ground or in containers. You can add these to your pledge, or tell your friends to get them for you!\n\nEasy Heirloom Tomato Trio\nThree vigorous varieties of small heirloom tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes are much easier to grow than larger varieties. If you haven\u2019t grown tomatoes before I recommend starting with these three. Tomato plants need to be transplanted into garden beds or large containers (5 gallon minimum) and need full sun to produce well.\nSalad Greens Trio\nThe always popular arugula, along with two heirloom heading lettuces. Greens will tolerate some shade, and can be grown in fairly small containers (6 inch pots are ok for one plant), although they are happier and will produce more with more space. This trio is a good choice for apartments.\nSummer Stars Patio Trio\nThe three most popular plants to grow in your summer garden: Heirloom cherry tomatoes (dwarf variety appropriate for containers), Basil Genovese (pesto basil), and heirloom sweet peppers (compact container variety). All of these plants must be started early in seed starters then planted out to a sunny spot in containers. They will also do fine in the ground.\n\nHeirloom Basil Trio\nThis trio of seeds includes the classic Italian pesto basil, Genovese, along with Thai Basil, and a very flavorful, mottled purple basil called Ararat. Basil plants are happy transplanted either in the ground or in pots (about 10 inches across or larger), but they need lots of sun and warmth to thrive.\n\nContainer Tea Herb Trio\nGrow your own herbal teas! Herbs require a bit more patience to germinate and start in your seed-starter, but once they get going, they are hardy plants that do well in containers (about 10 inches across and bigger), and will tolerate a bit of shade. This trio includes Chamomile, Spearmint and Lemon Balm. Please note that both Spearmint and Lemon Balm should be grown in containers because they can become quite invasive in an open garden bed. Chamomile can be grown either in a container or out in the ground.\nYou can find these new rewards over on the right. Pledge levels are as follows:\n$9 pledge: One trio of seeds ($3 per seed packet)\n$16 pledge: Two trios (save $2!)\n$36 pledge: All five trios (pay for 4, get all 5!)\nIf you're already a backer and would like to add seeds to your pledge, simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. At the end of the funding period, when we ask for shipping details, etc, there will be an opportunity to choose your trio(s).\n(I'm sorry, this reward is not available to international backers - international shipping of seeds is very restricted.)\nProduction Plan\nJuly - August:  Work with professional mold-makers to develop original \"mother mold\" that will be used to produce production molds.\nEarly September:  Make and dry production molds.  (Plaster molds take up to 10 days to dry before they can be used.)\nEarly September - October:  Cast, fire and glaze 1st run of 12-packs\nOctober - November:  Ship 1st run 12-packs\nOctober - December:  Cast, fire and glaze 2nd run of 12-packs\nJanuary:  Ship 2nd run of 12-packs\nHow you can help\nFirst, I need to raise enough capital to pay for the professional molds and make this project happen.  If you'd like a seed-starter, tote, or t-shirt, please back the project.\nSecond, I need help getting the word out.  If you know someone who might like this project, please send it along to them.  Or post to Facebook and Twitter!\nThank you very much for your support!  Every little bit helps and I really appreciate it.\nWhat people are saying:\n\"Amazing idea! Where have you been all my life?\"\n\u2013 Marcus\n\"I work long and crazy hours and I immediately knew that your design and idea would be invaluable to me for some consistent seed starting and healthy growing.\"\n\u2013 Rob, Alaska\n\"I'm so excited - because these might be the only seeds I won't be able to kill!\"\n\u2013 Deena, Washington\nStretch Goals!\nWe've reached the funding goal and then some! Thank you all for your support!!\nNow it's time for some stretch goals. Here they are:\nIf we reach $35,000: We'll be able to work with an artist to design beautiful custom seed packets. All backers at the $20 level and up will receive a limited edition print of all the seed-packet artwork. And for everyone who pledged to receive seeds, your seed packets will be much better looking!\nIf we reach $40,000: Everyone* at the $20 level and up will receive a free packet of heirloom tomato seeds!\nIf we reach $45,000: Everyone* at the $20 level and up will receive a free packet of heirloom basil seeds, in addition to the tomato seeds!\n*For international backers in countries that restrict the import of seeds (which is most countries) we will replace the seed packets with postcards of the seed packet artwork. If you're a US backer and prefer postcards to seeds, just tell me, and I can make the substitution for you too.\nThanks again for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding on my success bringing my first seed-starter to market, I am confident that I will be able to fulfill orders for the 12-pack on time. This doesn\u2019t mean it will be easy. The 12-pack is a difficult piece of pottery to make. (In some ways this is great news: because it\u2019s so hard to make, it is extremely difficult for others to copy!) But the 12-pack shares the same basic structure and materials as the smaller models, and my artisan partners and I have already worked hard to overcome the challenges inherent in the manufacture of such a complicated form. From form considerations to mold design, and production timing to clay recipes, we\u2019ve already worked out the kinks in this highly analog process.\n\nThe two biggest risks in adapting our successful process to the larger 12-pack are form and timing. In order for the pots to cast reliably in high quantities, I may need to tweak the form of the pot in small ways. The overall size and shape, and size and number of plant pockets will remain the same. I have planned for plenty of time in the schedule to meet estimated delivery times, but sometimes unforeseen things happen. I will keep you updated of progress along the way, and you\u2019ll be the first to know if there are any delays. We\u2019re all in this together!

This stretch goal will be unlocked only after we achieve our first stretch goal.\nUDOO specifications\nUDOO is a very powerful board based on dual or quad core ARM cortex-A9 CPU with great performance both on Android and Linux OS, and a dedicated ARM processor for the GPIO.\nUDOO's ARM CPUs, Arduino compatible pinout, connections.\nFreescale i.MX 6 ARM Cortex-A9 CPU Dua/Quad core 1GHz\nIntegrated graphics, each processor provides 3 separated accelerators for 2D, OpenGL\u00ae ES2.0 3D and OpenVG\u2122\nAtmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (same as Arduino Due)\nRAM DDR3 1GB\n76 fully available GPIO\nArduino-compatible R3 1.0 pinout\nHDMI and LVDS + Touch (I2C signals)\nEthernet RJ45 (10/100/1000 MBit)\nWiFi Module \nMini USB and Mini USB OTG (micro with the final release)\nUSB type A (x2) and USB connector (requires a specific wire)\nAnalog Audio and Mic\nSATA (Only Quad-Core version)\nCamera connection\nMicro SD (boot device)\nPower Supply 12V and External Battery connector\nUDOO is an open-source hardware project, all the schematics will be available on the UDOO web site licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license.\nFlexible development environment\nUDOO is a multi development platform solution for Android, Linux, ArduinoTM and Google ADK 2012. The board is designed to provide a flexible environment that allows to explore the new frontiers of the Internet of Things. UDOO allows you to switch between Linux and Android in a few seconds, simply by replacing the Micro SD card and rebooting the system.\nRunning Linux\nUDOO is a stand alone computer itself and since is based on the Freescale i.MX 6 CPU, it runs an optimized version of Linux Ubuntu for ARM architecture, called Linaro (11.10 at the moment). Linaro environment has everything you need for programming, for example you can use the Arduino IDE to build & upload your sketches to the Arduino-compatible embedded board, without additional/external cable connections.\nBlinking an LED\nRunning Android\nAndroid 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich runs smootly on UDOO giving you all the features of an Android device (further Android releases will be available at the time of distribution). Apps interface with Arduino-compatible embedded board through Accessory Development Kit (ADK) connection for building accessories and smart devices based on Android.\nArduinoTM\nUDOO is compatible with all the sketches, tutorials and resources available on the Arduino community as well as all the shields, sensors and actuators for Arduino DUE available on the market.\nMake\nDIY - With UDOO making things is really simple.\nWant to build a LED light-controller, a RFid reader or a creative game controller? UDOO allows you to create any kind of project and share it with the community.Combining the flexibility of ArduinoTM with the power of Android or Linux, you can create and update tons of stand-alone solutions without worrying about the linking between the two worlds and their wiring.\n\nUDOO with shield and sensors\n\nInstallation - With UDOO digital installations are easy to do.\nUDOO board allows to create powerful solutions for Internet of Things, interactive art and embedded devices. Processing, OpenCV, PureData and openFramework are just few of many tools available to program and design interactivity. Touch screen, Full HD video projection, I/O for generic or custom components and any controller you can think about, are ready for your installation.\n\nPrototyping - With UDOO companies can build high level prototype in a fast and easy way.\nUDOO provides companies with a powerful tool to create fast prototyping for any kind of needs. Prototyping with physical computing toolkits has become a widespread method for technology development, design exploration and creative expression. The board allows researchers and designers working for companies to quickly create and explore new interaction techniques and design devices in the protptyping sessions of a project. UDOO provides a full suite for developing prototypes based on Android platform alone or combined with ADK2012.\nEducation\nLearn\nWith UDOO people with different skills in coding and electronics can learn easily. UDOO board is flexible and can be used both by newbies and experts in coding and electronics. With UDOO, people can choose the configuration that fits their level of skills and from there move forward in the direction they prefer. Step-by-step \u201chow to work with electronics\u201d tutorials will be available for every level of expertise while there will be ready-to-go Arduino sketches for those interested in working with codes.\nScratch programming\nTeach\nWith UDOO teachers can teach basic as well as advanced topics with the same low cost hardware. Teachers can use the same platform for teaching different topics, from interaction design to firmware programming to robotics, and explore the possible sinergies among topics. Teachers of different classes and fields can coordinate their action connecting different teams. Using one of the pre-installed programming language, such as Scratch4Arduino,  it's possible to teach the basics of programming and hardware development. Students can create and share their own interactive stories, games and even music.\nCommunity\nOur aim is to create around UDOO a seamless educational and professional community that could grow according to the challenges posed by the new emerging technologies (e.g. Internet of things, cloud computing, cluster computing, etc.).\nWe are building this community starting from a small set of selected Universities (Carnegie Mellon, USA; University of California San Diego, USA; Aarhus University, DK; Siena, IT; OCADU Toronto; CA) with the aim of bootstrapping the design process of the board and its accessories and then opening up to the rest of the world.\nWe will support the community by mean of educational events and competitions and through the development of an educational web site that will sustain teachers and students in their teaching and learning efforts. Furthermore, while keeping the academic world as the main partner in this educational endeavour, we aim at addressing also the basic process of computing literacy in primary and higher school, through Academic projects like Scratch and Squishy Circuits.\nThe UDOO Web Site will provide examples and resources for get up and running with UDOO and its developping tools for different levels of expertise.\nT-shirt\nBe part of our community, make a $20 pledge and get this awesome t-shirt!\nWho is behind UDOO?\nUDOO is a joint effort of SECO USA Inc. (www.seco.com ) and  Aidilab (www.aidilab.com), in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in interaction design, embedded electronics, sensor networks and cognitive science, who along the years have worked together in several projects sharing the same vision about the role of technology in human life, and are now spread between North Europe and United States.\nWhere we're at \nWe\u2019ve been working on UDOO for over 1 year now. We have formed an awesome team in Siena, Pittsburgh, Toronto and Aarhus. The boards that you see in the video are real working prototypes. We\u2019re 80% ready to have the final product in our hands.\nRight now the board is not ready for the final users because we have some issues in hardware and software:\n- UDOO needs to be connected via serial cable to run the boot script that load one of the two different OS and to set the desired output hdmi, lvds and resolution.\n- The graphic acceleration is not fully functional and there are not stable drivers for camera wi-fi and touch screen (both for linux and android).\n- Currently some of the functionalities are linked through physical jumpers while in the future the same connections will be managed via software.\nPhysical Jumpers\n- Furthermore there are still communication issues between Android (while running ADK protocol) and the arduino-compatible embedded board that will be taken care of during the pre-release session.\n- Right now, UDOO runs Android 4.0.4 so we\u2019re working to upgrade our board to the latest Android distribution available. UDOO needs OS optimization (Android and Linux) and dirivers developing.\n- As Arduino DUE, UDOO pinout works at 3.3V, we are testing which shields available are compatible at the moment, besides this, we are working on libraries and example sketches.\nThe board design is in the final stage and our engineers are redesigning the electrical schematics and all the components to finalize the PCB development.\nThe production will follow these steps:\nComponents purchase\nWarehouse\nSMT\nPTH\nAOL\nComplete System Assembly\nTests\nQuality Control Packaging\nShipping\n\nProject timeline:\nFeb - Jun 2012 - Concept Design, partner definition\nJun - Oct 2012 - Project definition and specification\nNov 2012 - PCB Order\nDec 2012 - Prototype production (15 pcs)\nGen - Mar 2013 - Hardware and Software testing, Brand design\nApr 2013 - Componets and PCB order\nMay 2013 - Pre-Release production\nJun - Jul 2013 - Pre-Release Testing, Drivers Finalization, OS Release\nAug 2013 - First commercial production, packaging\nSep 2013 - Fulfilment to customer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur goal is to create an easy-to-use product which provides an integrated solution between Arduino - Android - Linux environments in order to make simpler all the DIY projects that require Internet connectivity and high performance computing capability.\n\nAs we described in \u201cWhere we're at\u201d, before entering mass production, we still have some open issues to solve in the next months.\n\nSECO, which is partner of the project, has over 30 years of experience in design and production of electronics embedded solutions.

Using only 12 watts of electricity, the NanoLight generates over 1600 lumens, equivalent to a 100W incandescent lightbulb.\n12W NanoLight (100W Equivalent) White\nThere are plenty of 20-60W Equivalent LED light bulbs in the market today, but the selection for 75-100W equivalents is still quite rare. To most light bulb manufacturers high efficiency and cost effective light bulb production is still uncharted territory. \nThe NanoLight takes energy efficient lighting to a whole new level by offering a lightbulb far more efficient than any existing LED bulb. It is a true breakthrough for LED Lighting technology. \nCNET - \"an early glimpse into the future of household LED lighting.\"\nGeek.com - \"definitely looks like no light bulb that anyone has ever seen before, but maybe that\u2019s what it takes to usher in the future of lighting.\"\nCBC news - \"An eye-catching invention.\"\nToronto Star - \"Toronto grads invent world\u2019s most energy-efficient light bulb.\"\nThe Crowdfund Mafia - \"We're doing backflips for the NanoLight! Product of the year.\"\nNEW LEAF Design Reward Options!\nAs part of our mid-project update #5, we now have a NanoLight with a Leaf design as an optional add-on to the WHITE NanoLight. \nNanoLight with Leaf design lasered on the surface. (Optional)\nOmnidirectional Lightbulb.\nUnlike other LED light bulbs, the NanoLight emulates the classic lightbulb and directs light in all directions. This allows for light to be distributed evenly, and provide the ultimate lighting experience. \nInstant-On Capabilities.\nUnlike compact fluorescent lights, the NanoLight achieves full brightness the instant it is turned on. The performance of the NanoLight is not affected by frequently turning on and off. \nThe Coolest Light Bulb. \nOur energy efficient design allows for very little energy lost due to heat. You will never burn your hand when you touch the NanoLight. \nSafe for use in an Enclosed Fixture! \nMost LED light bulbs or CFL\u2019s have a problem of overheating within a fully enclosed fixture, which causes the LEDs to start failing well before their expected lifetime. The reason for this is that these fixtures do not allow for sufficient air flow, thus trapping the heat inside and overheating the bulbs. We cannot claim that the NanoLight will work in absolutely all enclosures, but we can say that the NanoLight emits less than half the heat energy as compared to other LED bubs or CFLs. The chance of overheating is far lessened. After receiving various question regarding fixtures, we realized that these bulbs are going to end up in all kinds of installations. Of course, we want to make sure that the customer gets a long life out of these bulbs so that they pay for themselves over the long run. As a result,we are happy to announce that we have added overheat protection as a standard feature of every bulb. If the bulb gets too hot for whatever reason, it will automatically dim itself to prevent damage or shortened life.\n\nUltra Bright and Energy Efficient!\nYour environmentally friendly home can now be brighter and more energy efficient than ever before. For the amount of energy that it uses, the NanoLight produces more light visible to the human eye than any other white light bulb available on the market.\nThe brightness of a bulb is measured in lumens; which is a measure of the total visible light emitted by a source. Below is a comparison of the amount of lumens per watt the NanoLight provides compared to other light bulbs on the market.  \nLumens per Watt Comparison Chart\nThe NanoLight operates at 133 lumens per watt which is about 200% better than other light bulbs available on the market! \nHow will the NanoLight benefit you?\nBe the first to get a NanoLight and start saving today! Within its lifetime, the NanoLight will pay for itself, cut electricity bills, and save CO2 emissions all while providing bright beautiful lighting for all your needs. \nSo what are you waiting for? Illuminate your world with the NanoLight, and start saving today! \nBased on 30,000 hrs of usage and an electricity rate of $0.14/kWhr. Electricity Cost may vary depending on location.\nRewards\n1. 10W NanoLight (75W-Equivalent).

(i.e. table lamps, ceiling / bathroom lights, etc)\nStandard E26/E27 base\nTest Evidence\nThe NanoLight has been extensively tested using professional lighting test equipment at two independent testing facilities in order to ensure brightness distribution, sufficient luminous output, and color temperature. The light output meets or exceeds 1600 lumens for the 12W version and 1200 lumens for the 10W version. The power consumption has been verified using two independent professional grade power meters. \nIntegrating Sphere used to measure lumens output\nManufacturing Plan\nThe electronic components used within the NanoLight will be procured from distributors that stock well known brands of electronic components. The LED chip (die) is manufactured in Korea. \nElectronic components are mounted onto the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) using mostly SMT (Surface Mount Technology). First, the board goes through the pick and place machine where a robot places individual components in predefined positions. Second, the populated circuit board goes through an oven that melts the solder paste and permanently secures the components. \nAn intermediate testing stage and quality control step is done at this point to ensure that the circuit functions correctly and that no visual defects are found. The final step is to assemble the circuit board into the shape of a light bulb and secure on the screw base. \nAfter final assembly, each light bulb is put through functional testing. Testing will be separated into two phases; one to ensure circuit functionality and the other to ensure brightness / power consumption. Quality control is the most critical part of our manufacturing process as it is our way of ensuring that we deliver a high quality product.\nPackaging", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, there are inherent risks and challenges. We've gotten through the sourcing, design, prototyping, and testing stages. We have hand-built an initial batch of 10 light bulbs to perform a variety of electrical, heat output, light output and stress tests. For the upcoming stages of our project, there are several challenges that we still face. \n\n1. Sourcing: To bring costs down, we are sourcing several of the components in China. To ensure quality, it is essential to form solid working relationships with vendors that have a history of good business and high manufacturing standards. Often, it is challenging to find such vendors but we are spending the time searching, communicating, and visiting these factories in China. We hope to form relationships with a couple of venders for every component so that we always have a failsafe in case one vendor cannot deliver. Further, we are spending the time to perform a lot of our own scientific tests on the provided samples in order to ensure that the supply of parts for our product meets the specifications and meets our high standard. \n\n2. Unconventional printed circuit board: So far, we have manually assembled the few light bulbs that we made. This includes hand soldering all electronic parts and LEDs. For larger production, this is impractical and needs to be done by machine. Although machine assembly of electronic circuit boards is a tried and true method that has been around for decades, we are doing a few things out of the norm. Our printed circuit board has a very complex shape that may complicate the machine assembly process. Further, the LEDs are mounted in an unconventional way and require a low temperature soldering process. Although we believe that all the kinks can be ironed out, we fully expect there may be complications along the way to allow for robot setup and programming. \n\n3. Outsourcing the manual assembly steps: We have access to a large assembly factory with workers that will be able to help us with the bulk of the manual work required. The manual tasks are simple, but some training will be required. Several quality control steps will need to be implemented along the production process. Overall, the main challenge will be to customize our own manufacturing process and introduce a testing procedure. In this way, we will be able to deliver the NanoLight with confidence of high quality and reliability while maintaining an affordable price. \n\n4. Manufacturing consistency: the few samples that we have made by hand show to work reliably and are able to withstand normal use. We have been testing them for several months. However, only when a larger set of samples is made will we be able to find inconsistencies in the manufacturing. These may show up as a few failed bulbs with electrical problems, or ones with structural defects, or any range of unforeseen problems. Although the QC process should prevent any defective products from shipping to the customer, we need to ensure that the defect rate is low so that the production is economical. Adjustments in manufacturing may be necessary along the way to solve problems.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "New Nanoleaf Accessories Now Available For Your Nanoleaf Bulbs!", "update_content": "Hi Backers!\nWe're excited to let you know that after getting high volume of requests, we have created two design-centric lighting accessories to go with your Nanoleaf bulbs!

I don't believe that there's anything wrong with your wiring, switches, or the NanoLeaf light bulb. If you were to go to your breaker panel and turn off that circuit the NanoLeaf light bulb would go out totally because now there's no power in the line. The NanoLeaf light bulbs, are so efficient and takes such little energy to light up, that what is lighting (20 lumens) your bulb, is what I would call the \u201cfloat voltage\u201d in the line. So, in your home you have power running through the lines, that if you had an illuminated switch that is turned off, it stays lit by the voltage going through the line? Much like when the power goes out in your area, your phone system still operates because phone companies have their own internal \u201cfloat voltage\u201d (48 to 52 V here in Canada) for the phone systems.

UPVOTE ON REDDIT! UPVOTE ON HACKER NEWS!\nAlthough we have nearly reached our goal, we think with your help and additional funds we can make this Kickstarter even more awesome!\nOur PhoneJoy app is currently only optimised for phones, and although it will work for tablets it surely won't look as nicely as it won't make use of the additional space a tablet offers. With additional funds we will take the extra time and create a a tablet sized layout for Android and iPads that will allow you to browse PhoneJoy compatible games comfortably on a tablet.\nCurrently it is the case that for most phones attached to the PLAY, their charging and/or audio port will get blocked. Many of you have voiced that they still would like to use these when they play games on their phones. We have listened and thought long about the best possible solution for this without jeopardising the overall project delivery. As highlighted in update #8, we want to introduce custom-made L-shaped charging cables and a 3.5mm audio adapter that are optimised for use with the PhoneJoy PLAY. Needless to say, these come at an extra cost because they will be custom-made and new tooling will be required to make these, which is why we can currently offer them as an add-on for an extra $5. However, should we reach $100k we will have enough extra funds to include one audio adapter and one charging cable of your choice (microUSB/30pin) with each PLAY. \nWe have highlighted that there are certain third-party apps such as Blutrol and USB/BT JoyStick Center 6 that allow touch input emulation, which in turns allows greater compatibility with nearly any game. However, these apps often come at an additional cost to the user. Our plan is to make our own touch emulation apps on iOS and Android. However making these takes considerable time and funds, which is why till now we had to rely on third parties to offer these. By reaching $150k we will have enough funds to make this kind of app ourselves, and offer it as a free add-on to all PhoneJoy customers.\n\n-FROM GAMERS FOR GAMERS-\nBlack prototype shown above. Final version available in jet black (as shown), arctic white or user-voted color!\n\n\nTired of touch screen controls? Well so are we and with the PhoneJoy\u2122 Play we got just the solution for you . The PhoneJoy\u2122 Play controller is a wireless gamepad that allows you to to clamp smartphones of all sizes running iOS or Android right into the gamepad turning your phone into a portable console for great gaming on the go.\nBut it doesn't just stop there, the Play can also be used as a great standalone controller that fits perfectly into your hands. The controller can be used either on PCs running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux or by connecting your phone/tablet to your HDTV or projector.\n-CONSOLE GAMING ANYWHERE YOU WANT-\nIn a nutshell, PhoneJoy\u2122 Play is the perfect all-around game controller for your household allowing for endless possibilites. The sky's the limit!\nGTA III: Vice City with the PLAY and Blutrol!\nModern smartphones and tablets have made touch controls mainstream. We don't say this has been wrong. Touch controls are great for a number of games that require dragging, swiping and drawing such as Angry Birds, Infinity Blade, Flight Control, Jelly Defense and Draw Something! Menus are easily accessible with touch controls, too. So, yes touch controls hold their advantages.\nBut they also come with a number of drawbacks that have hindered a whole lot of games to truly shine. We think these type of games mainly include 3D action and shooter games, but also platformers, sport games and also to some extend racing games. Why?\nTouch controls have a number of drawbacks...\ntake up screen real estate\nlack of proper physical feedback\nare often not very well optimized for tablet sizes\nsometimes fail to register button presses\nmany games position touch buttons at different, often unfamiliar locations\nonly allow for two thumbs to be used simultaneously\nprecision and reaction speed not up to par with game controls\ncan easily lead to sore thumbs after prolonged games sessions (we have been there!)\n\"We believe the future of mobile gaming is going to be awesome!\"\nDevelopers haven't been able to translate console games to mobile platforms very well precisely for these reasons. We have seen a lot of them try, but they just don't measure up to their true potential. And that's why we came up with the idea to create a gamepad that is both compact and versatile enough to finally allow mobile games to be played at their fullest. We believe the future of mobile gaming is going to be awesome. Today's modern smartphones and tablets already come with horsepower that nearly equals that of current-gen consoles. So why limit yourself to Angry Birds when games like Crysis or Halo 4 could become reality on your phone? \nThe Play merges the best from both worlds: fantastic gameplay as well as great portability. You get all the buttons you need for console games together with the ergonomics you will want for prolonged gaming sessions, and all that at a size that fits right in to your pocket!\nClosed mode: 102 mm (w) * 87mm (h) * 37 mm (d)\nFully extended: 255 mm (w) * 87 mm (h) * 37 mm (d)\nWeight: about 250g\nDocks to smartphones of all sizes up to 153mm width and 14mm thickness\nBluetooth 3.0\nWireless range of up to 30 ft\nBattery power of more than 20 hours\n14 programmable buttons\n2 pressure sensitive analog sticks\n3 LED indicators.\nSupports iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux\nFour modes: HID Gamepad, HID Keyboard, iCade, Mouse Emulation\nSupported by more than 300 games on Android & iOS\n\nPhoneJoy\u2122 controllers make use of Bluetooth to connect to devices. \nFor Android (requires version 2.1+) all you need to do is to turn on your PhoneJoy\u2122 and activate Bluetooth on your device, then launch the PhoneJoy\u2122 app, which will then direct you through the necessary steps of pairing your controller with your Android device.\nFor iOS it's even more simple. All you need to do is to turn on your Play and activate the iCade mode. After you have done that, you only need to pair and connect the controller in the iOS settings and then launch the PhoneJoy\u2122 Game Center to choose and install compatible games.\nFor use on PCs (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) the PhoneJoy\u2122 Play can be launched into HID gamepad mode. All games that natively support HID gamepads will also support your Play.\nAdvanced users on Android can also install the GameKeyboard or USB/BT JoyStick Center in order to emulate touch controls with their PhoneJoy\u2122 controller. On top of that these apps come with a range of other features such as mouse emulation and OnLive support.\nLikewise there's a similar solution on iOS for advanced users who own a jailbroken iOS device. With the Blutrol app users can emulate touch controls and play a great number of games that do not natively support controllers on iOS. Please note: Currently, the app does not support the analog sticks of PhoneJoy\u2122 controllers as of yet. This is a feature coming in 2013 according to the developers of Blutrol.\nThere are already a ton of games compatible games available both on Google Play as well as iTunes. We have tried to compile a list in recent months and we are working hard on adding new games in the coming months.\nAndroid compatible games: www.phonejoy.us/games/\nAndroid Emulators: Android offers a fantastic range of emulators for systems such as Playstation 1, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, Gameboy, GBA, GBC, SNES, NES, Atari 2600, MSX, PCEngine and many others. For more details check out our emulators page. \nAndroid (touch emulation) games: Nearly all Android games' touch controls can be emulated through the use of 3rd party apps. Only a few games that make heavily use of swipe actions can only be partly emulated (e.g. Deadspace, Mass Infiltrator, FIFA 2012), because only up to two swipe actions can be emulated.\niOS (iCade) games list: click here\niOS (BluTrol) games list: click here\nBackers of LEVEL5/6/7/8/9/10 receive:\n1x PhoneJoy\u2122 Play (arctic white, jet black or user voted color)\n1x MicroUSB charging cable\n1x User manual\nEnvironmentally friendly retail packaging\n\n\nLEVEL1 - $1 - DONOR PLEDGE\n\nLEVEL2 - $5 - GENEROUS DONOR\n\nLEVEL3 - $15 - SUPPORTER\nPlease scroll down to the add-ons section for images of the papertoy and stickers!\nLEVEL4 - $30 - EYE CATCHER\nPlease scroll down to the add-ons section for images of the t-shirts!\nLEVEL5 - $50 - (BELATED) CYBER MONDAY BACKER!\nLEVEL6 - $60 - KICKSTARTER SPECIAL\nLEVEL7 - $70 - LATECOMER\nLEVEL8 - $199 - EARLY ACCESS!\nLEVEL9 - $299 - HIPSTER\nWhite PhoneJoy Play Airbrush Limited Edition (mockup only!)\nBlack PhoneJoy Play Airbrush Limited Edition (mockup only!)\nFor more details check out update #4 and update #8!\nLEVEL10 - $499 - SPECIAL TREATMENT\nWith the PhoneJoy Play Genie Edition you can nearly customize anything.

Those of you who also like some action on their tablet will be delighted to discover an included custom-made tablet kickstand that easily fits right into the case. Inside of the case there will also be a custom-fit mesh pocket that will allow for storage of your charging cable, earphones, batteries and what not. We will provide more pictures as soon as possible!\nBag will be available in black or white.\nClick here for 360 degree view.\n$20 - Kickstarter Limited Edition.

Then sign up for the PhoneJoy\u2122 t-shirt package that our illustrator Dave Smith has specifically designed for you. You can pick one out of two t-shirts made out of 100% organic cotton fresh from Honduras. All sizes for men/women available. Just like our gamepads, these shirts will be made to last!\n$30 - Priority Backer\nFeeling impatient? By choosing the priority top-up your pledge will be upgraded to priority status. Instead of shipping your reward(s) first to our warehouse partner in the States or shipping it by regular airmail from Hong Kong (international customers), we will use a 48 hour courier service (such as DHL or FedEx) to your destination right from Hong Kong. This will translate into a time saving of two to three weeks over a regular pledge. Please note: Non-US backers will still need to up $15 for international shipping.\nKickstarter is fantastic. We have backed and observed a number of projects and absolutely love how much the community gets directly involved in the making of some remarkable projects that would have otherwise not turned out as great or even at all. So yes, we are here for some much needed funding to get our project going, but we also hope to get some much needed feedback in order to make a product that is not just wanted by us but also by you - the community! Last but not least, making this project success will also show all developers out there that there is a real market for console gaming on mobile phones and tablets!\nWe have nearly completed the design and prototyping stage of the electric and mechanical design and just filed an invention patent for our unique EasySlider mechanism. The gamepad is already completely functional and is only short of a few cosmetic changes. \nWhat is still left open is the completion of the development of the Bluetooth 3.0 module's SPP mode (the PhoneJoy Analog is only using SPP) in order to ensure complete backwards compatibility. This is going to take some more time, but can be updated via a firmware upgrade.\nAlex working on one of the recent prototypes right at the factory site in Shenzhen, China.\nOn the software side we have just released in October the PhoneJoy v1.0 app after six months of development. We plan to release an update and an iOS app by January. The SDK may take additional time. All in all, the software part will take us quite some more time, but you can rest assured since it won't delay the delivery of the final product.\nWe want to be clear about one thing: every cent we earn through this Kickstarter will be spent on the accomplishment of this project and possible stretch goals. \nApart from obtaining the tools required for mass production (e.g. mold) and the necessary certificates/approvals (that are required for the legit sale of the Play), we will obviously require a fair chunk of the funds to deliver your pledges (production costs, shipping, Kickstarter/Amazon transaction fees).\nAll the remaining funds will be spent on:\nDevelopment of the Software Development Kit for Android/iOS\nRedesign of our website\nRelease of basic iOS app\nFurther development of Android app\nShould we receive more funds we will of course add more items to that list. Trust us, we got a lot of ambitious ideas, but we will need your help to make them a reality!\nBACK NOW AND CHANGE MOBILE GAMING FOREVER!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn this section we want to list our four most critical challenges. We understand that neither of these challenges will be easy to overcome. However, we have been trying our best to prepare ourselves for these cases. Being a small and young company however, please bear in mind that these challenges exist for us and the accomplishment of this project certainly isn't as easy for us as for a bigger company. But, hey that's why we are here, right? Because we need your support!\n\nRisk/Challenge #1: Timelines can slip\n\nWe have waited until a very late stage of our product development and have sunk thousands of dollars of own money in the process into the project before we decided to reach out to the Kickstarter community. We have a working prototype and now need to translate this to manufactured mass scale.\nOne of our advantages is that our office is very close to our Chinese suppliers based in China. Within three hours we can reach all our suppliers. Operating within the timezone makes collaboration with them extremely easy.\nAfter having worked with them for many months already we believe to have a good understanding of what it needs to get the PhoneJoy Play ready for mass production. However, there can always be unexpected delays. Should we encounter delays that appear critical path to launch, we will communicate this with our supporters. Keeping you informed is crucial to us.\n\nRisk/Challenge #2: Given productions costs and all, will $50,000 be really enough to meet your goal?\n\nAgain, as mentioned we have already raised some funds from family and friends. They will cover a good proportion of the costs we are facing. However, it won't be enough, which is why we have come to Kickstarter to get your help! Also, we have nearly reached the end of the product development phase and are aware of the tooling- and bill of material (BOM) costs involved. On top of that we have launched a product before and know the day-to-day costs that come with the continuous sale of a product. So taking all this into account, we should be able to avoid a drastic miscalculation.\n\nIn the very worst case, we are willing to go the stretch and take on a long term loan that comes at a considerable interest though. We really want to make this project happen. But we need you to show us that the market is really interested in it!\n\nRisk/Challenge #3: What if one of your chosen suppliers drastically changes their terms/pricing before you deliver the Play?\n\nWe have already established a long lasting partnership with a number of our suppliers, and all of them are aware of our intentions and anticipated volume requirements. With those we are about to start a new relationship with we have talked in person on-site and made sure that they meet our quality standards.\nOf course, there's always the possibility that we will need to switch suppliers. But thanks to being based just a two hour car drive from hundreds of possible suppliers, this will not be a major issue for us.\n\nRisk/Challenge #4: What if you need to deliver more rewards than you initially had expected?\n\nThis is indeed quite a challenge. However not one we are not prepared for. Actually, in southern China most of the world's consumer electronics are made and assembled. Our currently requested amount of one to two thousands parts of each component is in fact very low and just above the minimum level many of our suppliers are willing to start producing at. Should we need to deliver twice or three times as many Plays it should not pose a serious threat to the project timeline. Only production numbers beyond five digits may delay the project delivery times by a few weeks (possibly up to two months in the worst case). On the service side we would need to make new hires of course, but this wouldn't be much of a problem since more pledges also translates into greater funding for us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "The Final Phonejoy Kickstarter Update", "update_content": "To all of our Phonejoy Game Controller backers and fans, \nToday we are here to announce that this will be our final and last update to the Phonejoy Kickstarter Project page.

With your help we can launch a new sunglasses brand that incorporate sustainable materials and manufacturing processes.\nEveryone that pledges will be able to choose which model and color they want at the end of the project.  All sunglasses will ship in January. \nWearPanda.com\nOur Story.\nSunglasses have traditionally been made from harmful plastics and metals through environmentally damaging manufacturing processes.  We created PANDA with the belief that there is no reason why stylish sunglasses should not come in an environmentally friendly form.\nWhere We Are Now.\nWe have spent the last year fine-tuning our designs.  We have received countless feedback from our local community and peers.  We our launching our first 5 designs that will come in three different stains: natural, brown, and black.  We have partnered with a woodsmith/manufacturer and prototypes are one step away from production.  We need your financial support to start creating our hand-crafted bamboo sunglasses.\nWhat Makes PANDA special.\nEco-friendly Bamboo\nBamboo is a green alternative to environmentally hazardous plastics and metal sunglasses.  Its environmental benefits arise out of its ability to grow in a sustainable manner without the need for fertilizers, pesticides, or much water.  It is more moisture resistant and more stable than traditional woods such as Oak.  Bamboo is quickly becoming one of the most important plants in the world.\nLifetime Craftsmanship\nAll PANDA sunglasses are individually handcrafted to ensure superior quality.  The attention to detail creates a final product that is not only stylish but also guaranteed to last for a lifetime. We offer a 100% lifetime warranty on all of our sunglasses and will replace any pair of glasses with defects caused by materials and workmanship.\nWhy We Need Your Support & What You Get\nWe are looking to raise $3,000.  Your support will allow us to create our first run of sunglasses.  All money raised will go towards creating the sunglasses.  So, if you think the PANDA is a great idea, if you want a pair, if you want to own a really nice pair of sunglasses, please support!

Check out the updates section above to see more footage from the EZ-Steady. \nYou can now choose black anodizing as a color option for the weight arm! (We'll get your preference at the end of the project)\nHow do I know what to pledge?\nMy Story\nI started making films a year ago and quickly realized that without a camera stabilizer my footage was useless. I tried several different products but all of them had their own issues. So I asked myself this question. What if there was an affordable stabilizer that was quick to balance and easy to pan and tilt? \nThat's when my quest started to engineer the \"perfect\" stabilizer. After almost a year of designing, prototyping, and re-designing I came up with the EZ-Steady. You can balance it in 5 minutes or less. You can \"fly\" it effortlessly with one hand. And, it's affordable with a MSRP of $325 ($225 if you pledge on Kickstarter) while still being made right here in the USA. \nWhat is the EZ-Steady?\nIf you are unfamiliar with camera stabilzers, the EZ-Steady is a way to get really smooth camera motions without having to use a large rig. It is a simple, hand held device that eliminates camera shake and gives the footage a feeling of flying.\nWhat's so cool and different about it?\nMost camera stabilizers take a long time to balance your camera when you're first learning. With the simple stage systlem, it can take as little as 5 minutes.\n  Another great feature of the EZ-Steady is that there are many points of contact that allow you to control where you're pointing the camera. Use one hand or both, each option has muiltiple flying positions.\n  \nAlso, the precision machined gimbal allows amazing range of motion for running or low to the ground shots. The weights shown in the picture below are easily adjustable. They allow you to remove counterweights without having to completely unscrew the weight pack from the stabilizer arm. This makes for quick adjustments on the fly if you're changing lenses or cameras.\nThe EZ-Steady is also extremely compact. This enables you to get low to the ground shots or fit into tight places when filming. It packs away easily for travel and you can even detach the weight arm if needed. \nWhy is this product on Kickstarter?\nThis is where you guys come in. Oh my wonderful Kickstarter community. You see over the past year I've spent countless dollars (my wife knows exactly how much) on product design that I don't have the money for my first production run. I need your generous support to get this product going and into the hands of creative film-makers.\nThat's why we need your help to get the ball rolling. We're offing the EZ-Steady at a reduced price if you pledge $225 towards this project.\nWhat's Rhino Camera Gear?\nRCG is the company I created to sell the EZ-Steady and other film making equipment we design in the future (Sliders and shoulders rests are currently in development).  Don't be surprised if you see our future products making their debut on Kickstarter.\nNote: The final production version will have a few changes made to it. All for the better of the EZ-Steady. These include a stainless steel gimbal, a micro-adjustable weight to balance it even quicker, and a slightly smaller stage. Please message me if you have any questions. \nTHE END\nThanks for checking out my project! Please watch the video and have a read through the FAQs below.

They were binding up and not spinning freely as they should. We figured out that the there was too much space between the outside of the bearings and the inside of the handle tube. Somehow our epoxy expanded unevenly and cross loaded the bolt within the bearings causing it to seize. In simple terms they don't work. We tried to just put one bearing in the handles. That did work but there was some slop and wiggle in them that I couldn't accept.
