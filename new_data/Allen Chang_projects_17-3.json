Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur unfulfilled projects are moving along according to schedule.

Each player picks an element and the Town is formed from the combination of those elements.\nDraft rules for Town creation (Click for larger version).\nThen, two maps of the Town are drawn: the Town Then and the Town Now. These represent the Town  during different time periods, as the characters remember them.\nEach player creates a character, choosing to either be one who Returned or Remained. Each character provides a different lens to explore the Town and their own relationship to change.\n Returned characters left the Town Then and have just recently returned to the Town. They are slightly more focused on their own concerns and how the Town's changes reflect on their own feelings and growth.\n Remained characters have stayed in Town throughout that time. They are slightly more focused on community concerns and how their actions and experiences are reflected in the Town's changes.\nDraft rules for character creation (Click for larger version).\nPlayers then use prompts to expand the Town and fill it with locations, residents, traditions and events. Players can then explore the connections between their characters to the Town and to each other and how that has changed over time.\nDraft rules for play actions (Click for larger version).\nAs players explore the Town and the relationships between the characters, you will update the maps of the Town Then and the Town Now as you go. \nYou also create and update a Relationship Map between the characters and the different aspects of the Town, as well as write down your asked and answered questions on the map as part of the River. At the end of every game, your map will become an artifact of the game you just played.\nExample Town maps from playtests (Click to learn more about the playtest games).\nYou can also pick up a  demo of the game on itch.io here and by clicking the banner below:\nLink to the demo available on itch.io.\n\nWhy do I want to make this?\nI made a first draft of An Altogether Different River in June 2020 as part of my Game a Month 2020 project. However, it had its start way earlier back in 2019. \nI originally conceived of An Altogether Different River as a part of Homebound, an anthology zine that I produced in 2019 with the help of Vee Hendro and Cecile Richard. Homebound was a significant personal project that collected games about home and going away made in the context of my move back to Malaysia after 14 years living in Melbourne, Australia. I gave copies away as a farewell gift to some friends, and also made a version of it available online on itch.io.\nHomebound anthology zine.\nI didn't end up including An Altogether Different River in the zine as I couldn't finish designing the game before I had to move, but I've always considered it as a sort of coda or successor to Homebound. If Homebound was about grappling with my feelings about moving away from a home I had made, An Altogether Different River is about grappling with my uncertainties of returning to a home that I know would be much changed.\nI thought I would be able to finish the game quickly and it would be a poetic first game to complete after moving back. Things don't always go the way you think they will.\nAnyway, it's almost done now. I've been doing a bunch of playtests in the lead up to this campaign and I am happy with how the game is coming along. I am proud to have this game be my first foray into crowdfunding, because I think it's a pretty good representation of what I want to and can make. I hope it might bring you some enjoyment too.\n\nWhat can you get?\nReward tiers for An Altogether Different River.\nAll tiers will get you access to the draft rules as they stand right now so you can get playing straight away. \nThe Digital Zine tier (AUD8/about USD6.20) will get you the final PDF delivered via itch.io. \nThe Physical Zine tier (AUD15/about USD11.60) will get you an A5 staple-bound black and white booklet. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nI have also included the option to get digital PDFs of the Homebound zine at a discounted price. As mentioned above, Homebound is a zine I made in 2019 that collects three games on the theme of \"home\" and \"going away\":\n How to Say Goodbye - A microgame about collectively visiting important places and people to say farewell to them and leave pieces of your heart behind.\n Ithaca in the Cards - A blackjack-driven GM-less/GM-lite storytelling game about doomed travelers on a perilous journey home.\n Far From Home - A belonging outside belonging game about immigrants exploring what it means to live and thrive in a culture that is not fully your own.\nHomebound games.\nThe Digital Homebound Combo tier (AUD16/about USD12.40) will get you the final PDF delivered via itch.io, plus the PDF of Homebound.\nThe Physical and Digital Homebound Combo tier (AUD23/about USD17.80) will get you an A5 staple-bound black and white booklet, plus the PDF of Homebound. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nReward tiers for An Altogether Different River and Homebound.\nUPDATE:\nYou can now also get physical versions of both zines and just pay the same shipping!\nThe Physical Zines Homebound Combo tier (AUD30/about USD23.70) will get you both An Altogether Different River and Homebound as A5 staple-bound black and white booklets, plus PDF versions of both. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nNew pledge tier to get physical copies of both An Altogether Different River and Homebound zines.\nWhat's left to do?\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used to pay for additional illustrations to fill out the zine and also to finalize the layout for digital and print.  The rules are close to final, but I will continue playtesting and refining the game at least until the end of March (backers are very welcome to come join me in playtests). I am also planning to flesh out the introduction, safety and expectations, play advice and some game seeds to get players started quickly. The expected page count for the final zine is about 24-32 pages.\nIllustrations in progress.\nThe digital PDF version will be in full-colour and grayscale. The layout is already being drafted and additional illustrations are underway. I am aiming for release of the final digital version at the end of May 2021:\nFebruary - March 2021: Playtesting and revisions/writing, illustrations underway\nApril 2021: Complete editing and finalise fully illustrated layout\nMay 2021: Review final document for digital release + Contingency\nOnce the digital files are completed, the physical zine will be printed in black and white in A5 staple-bound format. I've allowed for significant time to finalise the document for print and for international shipping.\nMay 2021: Review final document for print + Send to print \nJune 2021: Printing and proofing, commence shipping\nJuly - September 2021: Allow 3 months for shipping + Contingency\nTimeline to produce Kickstarter rewards.\nWho's involved?\nAaron Lim is a designer of tabletop games currently based in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, and previously in Melbourne, Australia. His work ranges from board and card games to story games and tabletop RPGs. Most of his work is self-published at ehronlime.itch.io.\n\nVenessa Tang is an illustrator and concept artist based in Malaysia., creating visual developments and storyboard illustrations.

I've tried to build in sufficient time and cost contingencies, but this is the factor that is hardest for me to control. Depending on the scale of the project, I've bookmarked several options that might help to alleviate some of that risk (partnering with other zine stores etc for distribution) but it really depends on the final breakdown of project backers.\n\nMost of the layout and artwork is already underway, so I don't foresee significant delays there. I am continuing to playtest and refine the game, which may result in changes down the line. However I don't foresee any issues hitting the digital version deadline though it may impact the delivery of the physical zines.

The winner's spell goes through, and the losers is cancelled out.\nThere are 30 unique signature spells which players use to customize their hand.\nSignature spells provide a multitude of ways to play mind games on your foes, or strategize with friends.\nYour signature spells are unique to you, and you may only have 3.

Goblin Hunters is a fast paced push-your-luck style card game combined with set collection and a betting mechanic for 2 to 4 players and is played within 10 to 15 minutes. The Goblin Hunters base game comes with 4 different character cards to choose from, and more will be added as stretch goals are reached.

The aim of the game is to collect as many goblins as possible without taking too many wounds, while also trying to collect sets of goblins to gain extra bonuses.\n\nThis is not the only way to score bonus points, you can also bet on the results of the other adventurers, risking your hard earned goblin points for more bonus goblin points. It's a high risk with high rewards. So the next time you're in the tavern healing from your wounds and mouthing off about who is best Goblin Hunter, make sure you can put your money where your mouth is and bet on your fellow adventurers.\n\nThis is the perfect game to play while having a few laughs with some friends, between other games or while waiting for the rest of your party of adventurers to arrive for a big night of gaming.\nPlayer Board\nShipping should be added automatically during the pledging process depending on your location, however below is a breakdown of shipping costs for the core game (Hunter level) unless specified differently on the pledge level.\nUSA / Canadian backers, Kickstarter should ask for $6 AUD shipping = ($5 USD)\n\nAustralian Backers, Kickstarter should ask for $8 AUD\nRest of the world, Kickstarter should ask for $10 AUD  shipping = ($8.00 USD)\nPlease note there is a special Australians only reward level to which includes free shipping for this level only for all other levels Australian shipping will be added as normal.\nGoblin Hunters has been in development for a little over a year.

Every dollar this project can raise will go towards increasing the print run and production quality of the game through stretch goals, while keeping the price of each game as low as possible.

We'll even pay for shipping.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusive items, but we'll only print a limited number of the special edition as based on the final pledge totals.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more stretch goals we reach, the more enhanced and beautiful the game will be! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators--we truly value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game, and we promptly address all questions and ideas.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping fees for Kickstarted games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nBackers Come First: You'll get your copy of Between Two Cities well before it enters traditional distribution channels. Remember that retailers can be backers too!\nWe Need You: We've covered the cost of graphic design, art, and development for Between Two Cities, but we can't manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nA few of the 250+ playtesters who helped us along the way.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to eliminate customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge, as that's the number that can fit inside a shipping carton with proper packaging. For additional copies, you can pledge under a different Kickstarter account.\nBetween Two Cities is played in three rounds. In each round, you'll start with a fresh hand of tiles. Select two of those tiles, passing the rest to the player on your left or right (depends on the round). Place one of those tiles in the city on your left and one in the city on your right, then pick up the hand that was passed to you and repeat the process.\nThe middle round actually involves drawing 3 rectangular \"duplex\" tiles (two building tiles side by side in a vertical or horizontal configuration) and selecting 2 of them--there is no drafting in this round.\nAfter all three rounds, you will have built a 4x4 city on your left and a 4x4 city on your right. Add up the scores for all cities, but only compare your lowest scoring city to each other player's lowest-scoring city to determine the winner.\nEach of the tiles (art shown below) scores in the following way. The final tiles have scoring reminders below the art:\nShop (yellow): The more shops you have in a row or column, the higher the score.\nPark (green): Each group of adjacent parks score an ascending amount of points based on the number park tiles in the group.\nHouse (brown): Each house scores a point for each other tile type in the city (they want variety).\nOffice (blue): The more offices, the better. If they're next to at least 1 Tavern, they score a bonus point.\nTavern (red): There are 4 types of taverns (different icons)--you want to get as many sets of different tavern types as possible.\nFactory (gray): The cities with the most factories score more points per factory than other cities.\nThe game includes a head-to-head 2-player variant that removes the partnership mechanism but increases the impact of the tiles you choose to pass (or not pass) to your opponent. \nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe special edition of Between Two Cities features a limited-run version of the game. The game itself is the same, but the box will be embossed in gold foil highlights and will be stamped with a number unique to your copy of the game (e.g., \"1287 / 4000\"). The special edition also includes rules in French and German (in addition to English rules).\nThe special edition will also include 7 additional pairs of city tokens. When we were designing the city tokens, we designed 14 of them and had e-newsletter subscribers vote on their favorites. The top 7 were selected for the retail game, but we liked the other 7 so much that we decided to include them in the special edition for extra flavor. They do not expand the game past 7 players or impact the gameplay in any way.\nIn addition to the standard city tokens, the special edition also includes the Arc de Triomphe, US Capitol, Brandenburg Gate, St. Basil's, Big Ben, the White House, and the Forbidden City. Each token in the final version will be a unique color.\nOne of the exciting aspects of designing a complete core game is you generate a lot of ideas for expansions. We look forward to discussing these possibilities with backers during and after the Kickstarter campaign to see the types of expansions they're the most excited about. These are the two styles of expansions we're considering:\nVertical: These would expand upon the base game, allowing players to develop their cities through the ages by adding more rounds and new tile types.\nHorizontal: These would take the core mechanisms of the game and translate them to other themes, like Between Two Castles, Planets, Dystopias, etc.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our game to retailers during the campaign.

Thanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween Two Cities is a first for us in that it's the first game published by Stonemaier Games that wasn't designed by Jamey Stegmaier--rather, it's from designers Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley. Jamey served as the game's developer, honing it, balancing it, and trying to make sure that every decision is fun and interesting. This process was made easy by the designers' willingness to hear and test new ideas.\n\nDuring the evolution of Stonemaier Games, we've learned the importance of blind playtesting (having people learn the game from the rulebook and test the game away from the designers). We've been fortunate to have hundreds of Stonemaier Ambassadors and their friends volunteer to playtest our games so as to make them as good as possible for the first print run. We've also learned the value of having checks and balances at every step in the production process, but when we do mess up, we go above and beyond to remedy the error.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisers to point us in the right direction. We also work with Panda Game Manufacturing to produce the game, a company with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\n\nStonemaier Games has delivered all of our Kickstarter rewards from 4 projects within a few months of the estimated delivery date, sometimes even early. However, we seek to continue to improve that process to keep shipping rates low, deliver quickly, and ensure that the games arrive in perfect condition. We've learned that shipments sent from China to Australia need fumigation certificates for wooden components and that products shipped anywhere need \"Made in China\" clearly listed on the exterior of every product for them to clear customs. In short, we've made mistakes, and not only have we learned from them, we've shared them transparently with backers and on our blog to help other creators.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Between Two Cities: Capitals Release Day!", "update_content": "Today is a special day.

That time is long past. On what was once a partially terraformed outpost world, the descendants of the long-dead colony struggle to eke out an existence on a planet that is growing ever more inhospitable.\nYou are Princess Tahira of Avestan, a small kingdom to the west of humanity\u2019s last great city, Babylon. The death of your brother has left you as the sole, unwilling heir to the Throne. After your anxiety over this burden sparked an argument with your father, you left Avestan to explore the lands that lie to the south.\nA year later, a message arrives warning of a vast army intent on returning to the stars, crushing all who stand in its way, and begging you to return home.\nIt is here that your real journey begins.\nIn Tahira the story and combat are intrinsically tied together. Every battle you fight has different objectives, which are informed by the story. In one, you fight desperately to hold a town long enough for its citizens to flee. In another you ambush an enemy squadron, trying to rout them before they can make use of their superior numbers.\nWhen you\u2019re not fighting you\u2019ll have the chance to walk around your surrounds, engage with your travelling companions, and learn more about the different cultures you\u2019ll encounter as you travel on the road.\nWe're writing Tahira's story episodically, and this campaign will cover the remaining costs of the first episode. We\u2019ve chosen this format so we can execute the scope of what we feel Tahira should be.\nEpisode One will feature a dense and thrilling plot with fleshed out characters who develop over the course of the game. Taking cues from studios like Bioware and Telltale Games, decisions and progression you make in Episode One will continue to influence your journey through later episodes. We estimate Episode One will run for 4-5 hours and are designing it to have the density of an episodic Telltale game.\nTrekking through the Himalayas and exploring the Middle East were the dual inspirations for Tahira. Beyond anything else, we want to transport you to another world and to take you on a journey that will stay with you well after you have finished playing.\nA character-driven story centred upon Tahira, an unwilling princess forced into a leadership role she never expected.\nA rich cast of colourful characters, from a bitter, drunk merchant to a swaggering mercenary power-couple.\nPainstakingly rotoscoped animations, with the frame-by-frame technique creating a realistic, hand-drawn appearance.\nA journey across hand-painted environments, which showcase the bittersweet beauty of a dying world.\nChallenging strategic combat, which demands that the player both plan ahead and adapt to a changing battlefield.\nA modern twist on classic turn-based tactics where units tire and grow more vulnerable throughout the fight, and your units can skip the turn queue and act instantly.\nA wide range of scenarios, ranging from scrappy fights between a couple of soldiers to epic sieges where the player must manage multiple fronts.\nUpgrade your forces, choosing from a range of improvements to suit a variety of play-styles.\nLearn the history of both the current denizens of a former frontier world, and the ancient space-faring people who first explored it.\nAn atmospheric soundtrack composed by Max LL that incorporates the sounds and textures of Central Asia and the Middle East.\nTahira's combat is inspired by childhoods spent secretly playing Gameboy games such as Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and Final Fantasy Tactics under the covers. As well as more modern titles like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga.\nActing through Tahira, the player leads their forces into battle by taking control of several groups of units, each with their own distinct stats and abilities. Leveraging the unique skills of your diverse team is the key to victory.\nAny leader needs allies, and Tahira is no exception. She is joined in combat by several great warriors, each leading a cadre of troops who share their leader's strengths. As the game progresses, you'll unlock opportunities to upgrade each of these heroes. When you do so, you upgrade their personal stats, skills and abilities as well as those of their followers. The system takes inspiration from XCOM and Starcraft 2: these aren\u2019t just little skill point buffs, they\u2019re distinct choices that will change the way you play the game.\nThe combat system in Tahira is designed to simulate the flow of a real battle. Rather than relying on the traditional \"we all move, then you all move\" system, turn order is assigned dynamically, based on the speed of each of the fighters.The game's heroes can skip this queue and act immediately - at a cost - creating opportunities for skilled tacticians to turn the tide of a losing fight, or punish an enemy in a weak position before it has a chance to rally. Additionally, as fights progress, your troops grow fatigued. Each attack suffered by a unit reduces its defence, meaning that your force becomes exponentially more vulnerable as the battle wears on.\nTo further create a sense of realism in combat, no two combat scenarios are alike. Battles in Episode One will range from scrappy skirmishes between a handful of soldiers, to epic sieges involving dozens of units and multiple fronts. In these larger fights, players will need to act on a solid strategy, distributing their forces between two or three areas, and prioritizing certain objectives at the expense of others.\nIn Tahira you\u2019ll encounter dozens of characters, ranging from a depressed alcoholic wine merchant, to a swaggering mercenary power couple. Some will ask for your help, others will travel with you and a special few will fight alongside you.\nConversation is an important part of Tahira. You\u2019ll be given opportunities to talk to your travelling companions as you progress through Episode One and your interactions with them will have consequences within the story and the battles you fight.\nThe sounds you\u2019ll hear in Tahira are an integral part of the experience we are building. We want to transport you to another world, a world that is familiar enough to feel real but alien enough to excite your imagination.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with the talented Max LL to score Tahira\u2019s soundtrack. Max has just returned from many months spent traveling through Central Asia, capturing the sounds and textures of the region.\nHere's an alternative version of the music he wrote for the trailer:\nFrom the moment we heard his music, we knew we wanted to work with him. We can't wait to hear him bring the emotion and cultures of Tahira's world to life.\nThe other integral part of the audio is the sound design. Each of our environments will have its own detailed soundscape. We want you to feel as if you\u2019re really journeying across the world as you play. We\u2019re working with Sound Designer Brendan Holyland to achieve this. \nHere's a little sneak peek of some of his early work for The Southern Waypoint.\nLaunch \u2013 Tahira will launch on PC, Mac and Linux. We hope to release on Steam (see our Greenlight campaign) and we will also release a DRM-free copy of the game.\nBeta \u2013 We will be running a beta later in the year. If our Greenlight Campaign is successful we will conduct it using Steam. All backers who pledge $35 or above will receive Beta Access.\nWe\u2019re a three person team and we don\u2019t want to promise new features that will delay the game by months, or worse be dropped when we realise we can\u2019t execute them.\nInstead we\u2019ve picked two goals that we think would make very positive additions to the experience of playing Tahira, and budgeted them to exactly what we need to make them a reality.\nBackers at this tier will get exclusive, Kickstarter-only access to an alternative version of Episode One: Super Fresh Ultimate Tahira X! This version of the game will be a loving parody of the decade which gave us some of gaming's most iconic characters, and will be embellished with all things '80s:\nOver-the-top neon colours.\nGarish visual effects.\nIncredibly questionable style decisions.\nIt will also have a talking horse.\nWhile Super Fresh Ultimate Tahira X! will be fundamentally the same game as Echoes of the Astral Empire, it will amount to a completely different playing experience. All of the game's art will be lovingly (heinously) re-coloured  and Tahira will get a stylin' new pair of shades. Further, the script will be partially re-written, as Tahira's equine companion Iba has mystically gained the power of speech.\nThese mugs have frames from the most action-y parts of our favourite character animations printed on them.\nChoose from one of the following designs:\nThe Hammer's earth-shattering strike\nA Footsoldier's attacking lunge\nThe Claw's vicious swing\nTahira channelling her staff's energy\nWe'll ask for your preference when we send out the backer surveys.\nCommissioned from Iranian born Disney Artist, Merhdad Isvandi, this beautiful piece will be printed on 23.4\" x 33.1\" (A1) high quality glossy stock.\nThe image we've uploaded of this really doesn't do it justice. It's a gorgeous, incredibly detailed piece of art. For example, you can clearly see both The Hammer and The Claw among the people walking through the valley.\nCommissioned from Italian artist Simone D\u2019armini, the T-shirt features Tahira in action across the chest and the Tahira logo on the back of the neck.\nThe T-Shirt will be printed on a 100% cotton white tee. It will be available in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles. We will ask for your size and gender preference when we send out the backer surveys.\n(Artist's impression of what it'll look like. We haven't made the book yet.)\nThe Art of Tahira will be equal parts art book and development journal. It'll contain heaps of otherwise-unreleased concept art, stories from Tahira\u2019s development, and details about our creative process. The book will have approximately 80 full-colour pages printed on high quality glossy paper. It will be a soft cover book, with the cover printed onto 320 GSM.\nPlease note that we won't be finalising the book until we've shipped the game as we want to include all the finished art work from Episode One.\nWant to be a part of the game? We've got you covered. Pledge to this tier, and we'll transform your likeness into one of the game's characters.\nWe'll ask you to take photographs of yourself and then the transformation will begin! You'll likely have a few different portraits done, with different expressions and emotions.\nThis pledge tier is limited to three people, as we've only got so many persistent roles in the game, and we want to guarantee that those who pledge to this tier don't see themselves become nameless henchmen who get mown down after speaking a single line.\nAvestan wasn\u2019t always the city it is now. Hundreds of years ago, before the people of Babylon spread west across the mountains, the people of Avestan were tribal villagers whose belief system was rooted in a shamanic reverence of the earth and sky.\nSome still follow the old ways.\nTahira will meet one of these mystics on the road and - through him - will learn of her nation's ancestral roots.\nThe backer of this tier will work one-on-one with our writer, Peter Castle, to help create a folk tale for the mystic to tell Tahira. If you're the kind of person who enjoys mythology, fairy tales, or teaching through elaborate metaphors, this may be the reward for you.\nWe have a real treat for art lovers with this limited edition run of ten framed fine art prints of the poster design.\nCommissioned from Iranian born Disney Artist, Merhdad Isvandi, this beautiful piece will be printed on 23.4\" x 33.1\" fine art watercolour paper:\nMuseum quality,\nAcid free\nArchival with guarantee for 75 years.\nWe've framed these beautiful prints in a 30.43\" x 39.84\" rusted gold frame. We've already got one on our office wall. Believe us when we say the pictures don't do this piece justice.\nIn a word, independence. So far, we've been working to create the game we want to make, without having to compromise with anyone. The price we've paid for this is that we don't have investors or a publisher. We've survived financially by all working part-time jobs, but this can't be sustained.\nOur artist Peter S, gets up each morning at 3am and spends five hours baking muffins before he comes into the office. He then draws for a solid 8 hours before going home, going to bed, and starting all over again. With your support we can remove the distraction and stress of having a second job, and focus entirely on making Tahira as good as it can be.\nThough it is mainly a means of restoring our team's sanity, Kickstarter also lets us add features that we otherwise couldn't afford. One of those features is contracting the immensely talented Max LL, who created the music for our trailer, to write the whole soundtrack for Episode One\nWe've been working on Episode One of Tahira for 18 months. In that time we\u2019ve built functioning versions of all the gameplay systems, created half of the game\u2019s art, written a comprehensive draft of Episode One\u2019s story and developed a world with a history that stretches back hundreds of years.\nStill-to-do remains the other half of the art and a ton of iteration and polish on the gameplay. The bulk of the remaining art work that still needs to be done are the animations. The frame-by-frame, hand-drawn style we've chosen meaning that each character takes roughly a month and a half to animate from start-to-finish. \nRelease\nWe expect to have the full game playable by July 2015 and to have it ready for release by January 2016. We\u2019ve given ourselves those six months between July and January to polish the game and to conduct a Beta Test as it\u2019s very important to us that we take the time we need to do the game justice. \nWhen we sat down and imagined what Tahira could be, we knew we wanted to show players a vast world with a rich history. We wanted our characters to develop and grow realistically and we wanted to design epic battles in which you defend fortresses and cities. In short, we wanted Tahira to have the scope of an epic fantasy series. Then we remembered we\u2019re only three people.\nTo create a game with the visual fidelity and scope that we\u2019re aiming for would take the three of us a very long time. We talked to some of our peers and they suggested we could make the game episodic. The more we thought about it, the more we liked the idea.\nMaking Tahira episodically allows us to design each episode with a beginning, middle and climactic end. It gives us the means to do justice to our vision. As we move through the series, each game will add new playable characters, which we simply couldn\u2019t spend the time making if we were trying to create all of Tahira in one go. You\u2019ll see so much more of the world in this format and have many more opportunities to talk to your travel companions. It also lets us take feedback on board from you, the players, and gives us the opportunity to iterate on all of our systems. We think it will be a better experience for you and for us, win-win.\nHow many episodes?\nWe envision two seasons of Tahira games. Season One of Tahira will have two episodes. At this stage we have written a draft for the entire series, but other than that, all of our work over the last 18 months has gone into Episode One. This is how we will continue to work. We will work on Episode One until we are happy it\u2019s met the quality bar we\u2019ve set ourselves and then we\u2019ll move onto Episode Two. \nHow long?\nWe're shooting for 4-5 hours for Episode One. We're not adding any filler, it'll just be you playing through the best story we can write, fighting battles in unique scenarios and having lots of conversations with your traveling companions. We're making Episode One as dense as we can without adding fluff for the sake of padding it out.\nWhale Hammer Games is a three person independent developer based out of Canberra, Australia.

Starting out with just a simple trick and a handful of helpers, you will embark on a journey to become the greatest illusionist alive.\nInspired by movies like the Prestige, Now You See Me and the Houdini mini-series, we created a world where magic and illusion are part of people\u2019s everyday lives. Most of the magic tricks in the game are part of the repertoires of real world illusionists, past and present, but a pinch of supernatural was also added to the mix \u2013 just so you can never be sure whether those Spiritual tricks are really merely illusions...\nEach turn, you will visit Magoria\u2019s various Locations \u2013 the Downtown, the Market Row, the Dark Alley and the Theater \u2013 to expand your team, learn more and more intricate magic tricks, get components for them, and prepare them in your Workshop. Each turn concludes with a Performance phase in the Theater, when players may perform a breathtaking magic show for Fame points and money. After the sixth Performance phase, the player with the most Fame points wins the game, and becomes the next Legend of Illusion.\nThe four starting characters are all inspired by great illusionists of the golden age of magic. You can read their story at trickerionboardgame.com.\nThanks to you helping us fund in less than 24 hours, we will add four more Magicians to the game! \nBoth the Illusionist and the Legend Box will ship with 8 Magicians to choose from instead of the original four, with four additional double-sided Magician cards and four additional Magician Poster Cards.\nThe four new Magicians will be revealed in this section as the project moves forward, so check back often!\nMore Coming Soon!\nTrickerion is a massive game, but its length and complexity is yours to decide!\nThe base game is very easy to grasp and takes 60-90 minutes, but for a truly epic battle of wits, feel free to enhance the game with the Dark Alley and the Magician Powers built-in expansions.\nThe Dark Alley expansion is included in both the Illusionist and the Legend Box.\nThis expansion adds a whole new Location to the game. It also comes with 60 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 20 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.\nThe Magician Powers expansion is included only in the Legend Box.\nYour Trickerion Shards gain a whole new gameplay significance with this expansion: They will unlock Power Card slots that allow you to customize your Magician by learning diverse abilities to enhance your game. As there are 90 different Power cards available, it will open up a multitude of new strategies and adds even more replayability to the game!\n\u201cThis is a rock-solid worker placement with a bunch of really, really cool evolutions.\u201d\n- Rahdo Runs Through\nTrickerion is a worker placement game at its heart, but we've added many new elements to spice up the formula and create a fresh gaming experience for even the most seasoned tabletop game fans out there.\nBefore placing their characters, players secretly and simultaneously plan their turns using Assignment cards, reducing player downtime during the placement phase, and letting you adjust your strategy according to your opponents\u2019 plans \u2013 if you can see through them!\nLocations in Trickerion have several Actions to choose from, each costing a number of Action Points. You are unlikely to get fully blocked out of a Location, but the number of Action Points you\u2019ll get to spend on Actions strongly depends on when you get to a Location and who you\u2019re getting there with.\nEach turn concludes with the grandiose Performance Phase, when the shows prepared during the turn are presented to the awestruck audience. The way these performances shape up is entirely up to the players: from a single trick gig to 6-trick blockbusters, Thursday to Sunday, you can even co-perform with others for greater rewards \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\nEnglish Rules\nFrench Rules (translated image captions here)\nCzech Rules\nCheck out our latest, formatted rule book for detailed rules of the game.

If you enjoy any of these types of games, its a pretty safe bet you will enjoy playing this!\nEach player receives one secret target to kill. There is no one in the game who will NOT be targeted by someone else in the group. The aim is to try and assassinate your quarry before they figure you out. At the same time, you have to deduce who is trying to do the same to you.\nSurvive by standing in plain sight of crowds and open, brightly lit areas. When you move into dim places, plant security cameras that will penetrate the darkness with their infrared. At fixed intervals, the resort's security forces will update the bulletin board with warnings to the public that certain members of specific traits are suspected to be in danger. If you notice your character's traits being targeted by another player who is lurking very close to you, it is a good time to panic. Even when you have confirmed your would-be killer through the elimination and deduction method, you will still have to live long enough to find the closest patrol man and report that person in!\nThe bulletin board is your friend... and your enemy.\nCaught your killer?

The mini-game only caters to 4 players, and lasts about 10 minutes per session.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86077588/Hitman%20Holiday%20PnP.pdf\nMany of the following reviews were done BEFORE the game title was changed to Hitman Holiday, and may refer to the game as Deadly Vacation.\nUndead Viking's Review: (Personal Thoughts begin from 16:45)\n\"There's a TON of things I love about this game...// I love the whole process of nobody knowing who I am supposed to kill, the bluffing and counter-bluffing.

If you like Battlestar Galactica or The Resistance, this is the game for you.\" -Mark Meredith, DiceMonkey\nClick HERE for the full review from DiceMonkey.\n\"Hitman Holiday manages to blend a tactical movement and bluffing mechanics into a fun fast paced game. Each game feels unique because the different assassin powers and starting locations mean you have adjust your strategy each time you play. Hitman Holiday could easily be a chaotic mess, but the addition of the assigned target makes the game much more focused. The game scales well as you increase the player count and doesn\u2019t increase the time played significantly. Hitman Holiday would be a good fit with a larger game group looking to play with 5-8 players.\" -Tyler, Boardgamequest.com\nClick HERE for the full preview from Boardgamequest.\nHitman Holiday was ranked among the Top Projects of the week by MM, falling short of 1st place only because of its Day 1 funding percentage achieved.\n\"...the mechanics are so ridiculous I can't help but love it. So you're a hitman, hunting another specific hitman in sort of a circular targeting system. You're moving around the board, laying bombs, setting up cameras, avoiding police, all to kill your target. Oh and you need to make sure you use the bathroom and eat... like The Sims.

Each turn, players have 4 Action Points to move around or trigger zones. Playing of cards and planting of hidden objects do not require any Action Point. At the end of a turn players must turn the 3 dials on their sheets by 1 each, unless they have visited the required places during that turn. Players can visit the 5 Cache locations and draw additional Hidden Action cards. Every 2 turns, players must reveal a clue about one trait that their target has. After 3 kills, the game enters the second phase. There is no difference between phase 1 and 2 other than for tracking the game duration. (Think of it like Half Time in a sports match) After another 3 fresh kills, the second phase is over and the game ends. The winner is the player with the highest score.\nFor the complete rules, please download it HERE:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86077588/HH%20Rulebook.pdf\nOur artists have managed to get out the final Rulebook in time to post it up here.

It will never be reproduced.\n Simply add AUD 45 (US$35) to your pledge total to get a set of this \"weapon\" or you can also pledge a standalone for just the item alone.\nAssurance of Quality:\nWe believe in giving the very best quality! We chose to go with all the best options of production choices - priority being durability and practicability. For example, we could choose to just produce the game with minimal component standards such as a 1.5mm game board. However, we chose to spend more and cut on our own margin to provide a high quality 2mm thick game board. Similarly, instead of the original cardboard standees for characters, we ended up going for more. No, we went beyond even meeples! We are producing actual hand crafted miniatures to give a more realistic 3D feel.\nAll of the game components were decided in this same manner, and they all had almost no impact to the customer's price tag at the end of the day - anything that we could absorb by simply taking a smaller margin, we did. Even the original mechanic of using mere tokens for the Needs mechanism in the game has been replaced by the much more expensive 'dials' system on every character sheet in the game. Here at Medieval Lords, it is always the passion of gaming first, before we talk about profitability. This is our very first game product - we will give it 200%!\nThis is a true blue genuine Kickstarter story. Whether or not we turn into a real company with a line of excellent products for you to enjoy is in your hands - literally. Hitman Holiday is our debut game.\nWe are here in Kickstarter not to have an easy way out. That is why we are only calling for the amount we fall short of. From this game alone, you can already tell the direction of Medieval Lords is to focus only on games that are truly unique or can introduce refreshing new mechanisms and themes into the gaming world. Give us a chance to show you what we have in store... \nWe make a solemn pledge with this project, that we will churn out amazing games for the world. Count on it!\n'Design Talk'\n\"We really wanted to make this game as unique as possible. It was created to fill the missing gap of a game where players can become assassins who match up against each other in a realistic setting. In the real world, assassins rarely ever burst in with guns blazing since the likelihood of dying can be pretty high and they only have one life each. Instead, they do their utmost to be low profile and cautiously plan their kills. Another myth buster is that most real life assassins do not look like James Bond or Jason Statham. That old woman you often see making her routine trips to the market in the morning could be as much an assassin as anyone else. We designed the characters to be interesting and from various walks of life. Lastly, players are not invincible. They need to eat and sleep and poop! This also doubles as a game mechanism that prevents 'camping' as well as open up more options for killers to prey on their unwary victims while they take care of their daily needs.\" -Dominic, Designer of Hitman Holiday\nThe Designer of Hitman Holiday was also interviewed on The Fiver by 5 big names in the industry:\nClick HERE to read the complete interview with Dominic Michael H.\nWe would also like to give a shoutout to BoardtoDeath Luca and his teammates for their contribution in improving Hitman Holiday from its early stage into becoming the smooth game it is now.\nThe Official BGG Page of Hitman Holiday (Click ME!)\nBe a Fan of Hitman Holiday on BGG!

A fast, fun game of bluffing, deduction, and cute cat pictures!\nUncertainty didn\u2019t kill the cat, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dead. Dr. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Werner Heisenberg taught us that. We\u2019ve all heard about the cats in boxes experiment and maybe we're even curious about the results -- but attempting such an experiment would be INSANE in real life! Now you can try your hand at challenging the uncertainty principle without risking the lives of innocent kittens or exposure to radioactive particles! Awww!\nIn Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats players run experiments, form hypotheses, and try to one-up each other\u2019s research. Players take on the role of a Cat Physicist such as Albert Felinestein, Sally Prride, or Neil deGrasse Tabby! Using their special ability to help prove their hypothesis, or at least debunk someone else\u2019s, each cat physicist tries to determine the minimum number of alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes across all the boxes in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s lab.\nYou may not be certain your hypothesis is valid, but if you love cats, science, and games you will be certain to love the Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats card game!\nCats are a curious lot, Cat Physicists doubly so. Their desire to discover the secrets of the universe overwhelms their shaky catnip-influenced ethics. While Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger is away the cat physicists will play\u2026 in his lab\u2026 with their colleagues.\nCheck out the video play-through below for a detailed description of game play or read the full overview below (including the current rules link and a low-res print and play version you can play right now).\nGame Play Overview\nFor the complete Game Rules < RULES LINK > For a playable low-res, b&w Print and Play < PNP LINK >\nEach Cat Physicist (i.e.Player) is dealt a hand of cards equal to the number of players (i.e.Cat Physicists). Each card in your hand represents a box in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Experiment. In a game with 6 players, each player is dealt 6 cards, making 36 boxes in the experiment. \nPlayers are each dealt a Cat Physicist character card that they keep secret. It allows them to influence a variable in their experiment which can help to prove their hypothesis. The Cat Physicist cards add an additional layer of strategy, as only you know your special ability and it can only be used once per game.\nOn your turn, you present a hypothesis to the group by stating how many alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes there are in the lab. If you feel that showing your findings will convince the group of the validity of your hypothesis, you may place any number of cards of the type bid face up for all to see. Meaning that you could show alive cats from your hand if your bid was alive cats, but not if your bid was dead cats or empty boxes. After you present your findings you may exchange the same number of cards as you revealed for new cards from the research deck which will (hopefully) help prove your hypothesis. \nWhen a questionable hypothesis is made the next player may choose to call the theory unfounded. In that case all players reveal their hands and a count is done to discover the truth. If a bid of 17 alive cats was made and there are at least 17 alive cats (including wild cards) then the hypothesis is deemed valid and that player is able to stay in the game. The player that called the hypothesis unfounded is now out of the game. If there were not at least 17 alive cats (including wild cards) then the player that made the 17 alive cat hypothesis would be out and the other player would stay. \nThe next round now has 1 fewer player and 1 fewer card is dealt to each player (now there are 5 players and only 25 cards/boxes). Play continues until only one Cat Physicist is left. Their research, emerging unblemished from the peer review process, is beyond refute and they are declared victorious! \nSchr\u00f6dinger's Cats also has a suggested 2 to 3 player variant in which no player is eliminated at the end of an experiment or round. Instead, the players face off until a certain number of wins or losses are reached determining the ultimate Cat Physicist!\nAs fans of James Stowe\u2019s Sidekick Quests, the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats team was super excited about the chance to work with him. James was really excited to draw pictures of cats in lab coats, and the results are amazing!  One of our primary stretch goals will be adding additional art for the Cat Physicists cards, and James might be more excited to draw them then we are to have art for them!\nThe Cards of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats\nGet the official Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats UNCERTAIN-TEE SHIRT! \nYou won't know if it's ALIVE or DEAD until you open the box (that comes in the mail).

However she had to put that promising career on hold to meet the rigorous demands of middle school. Chris and Heather O\u2019Neill showed Heather Wilson their fledging theory and after many hours of rigorous play-testing and scientific study, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats as it is known today was born.\nOnce it was clear that \"the Heathers\" really, really wanted to make Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats a reality, discussions were had about how to make that happen. Kickstarter seemed like the natural choice to get the game produced and into the hands of players quickly. 9th Level Games (of which Chris O'Neill is a partner) realized that Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats would be a great fit for expanding their catalog of humorous, universally-accessible games. Plus, 9th Level Games had recently run a successful Kickstarter for their role-playing game KOBOLDS ATE MY BABY!

However, the final layout and rules editing will not be complete until after this Kickstarter campaign ends, and could be affected by any additions or stretch goals from this campaign.\n\nProduction - There is a minimum order quantity which means we have a fairly high production cost. That is where most of the goal came from for this Kickstarter. After the initial production run is done and the Kickstarter backer orders are fulfilled we will still have a good number of games to make available through distribution. We can also start our second production run without worry of going out of print. \n\nDelivery - Our manufacturer\u2019s standard delivery process is quite long and can\u2019t be started until final layout is complete. We set realistic goals but there is always a chance that there will be production or shipping delays. \n\nInternational Orders - We know that shipping physical product within the US is doable. Unfortunately, that is not the case for internationally shipping. Good news! We were able to extend shipping to Canada, Australia and the UK! Also, the print and play download will be available in 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian). We also plan to make the game available through distribution worldwide. \n\nCommitment - We are committed to getting this done right! Our goal is to produce a quality product that we are proud of.

Each group has encountered and aligned with a native tribe.  With the new explorers upsetting the delicate balance of the tribes, this once peaceful island has been set into chaos.  It will take one group of explorers to unite the tribes or kill off the opposing explorers to bring peace back to the island.\nIn Island Dice, players select strategic combinations from a variety of custom dice each turn.   You then execute your roll results in order to bring peace to the island.\nThis can be achieved in one of two ways:\nYou can unify all four of the native villages by protecting them simultaneously, bringing peace to the island.\nOR\nYou can eliminate all of your opponents.  With no one left to fight, you have brought peace to the island, and you win.\nBegin your turn by selecting three of the eleven Option dice.  You will then add the three Action dice and roll all six together.\nNow choose which of the die rolls to resolve first and take its action.  Continue resolving your dice one at a time until they have all been used.\nAt any time during your turn, you may choose to spend some of your gems to help enhance your strategies.\n (above picture includes stretch goals #1 and #2)\n\nThis mysterious hole in the ground is surrounded by hundreds of years of bones and destruction. Mist, strange and continuous, flows up and out. A thin winding stone stairway travels either down into the unknown depths below or provides an escape for what lies, or lied within. This is a territory for no living person. The natives fear this place and will not enter its realm.\nThis hex is a promotional land tile. Natives will not and can not move onto this location. This provides a native free hideaway, but it is nowhere near safe. Both the Massive Roaming Karma, and the Big Nasty Guy can opt to spawn from this location when they are first summoned instead of their normal tiles. The cave and the ancient ruins are no longer the only dangerous spots. With this third spawning point, the danger and strategy only become greater.\n \"It's a game I really enjoy\" - Undead Viking\n \"If you like chucking dice, but you want a little more strategy, definitely be sure to check out Island Dice.\" - Bower's Game Corner\n \"The best part of the game is probably the chances that there's going to be at least one stand up dice roll moment.\" - Under 5 Minute Review\n \"Island Dice is a fun game that is a little different, made by a company that's just starting out and actually needs your pledge.

There are 4 events but only 3 get shuffled into the deck at random. Battle of Durak is all about efficiently playing cards that you are dealt and choosing the right skills to play at the right time. Battle Events are designed to throw players off their a-game, keeping all players on their toes. Just when you think you have the perfect cards in-hand, a dust storm may engulf the battlefield, you could get wounded, be pillaged, or even worse, taxed. \nThe official game instructions can be found HERE.\nBattle of Durak is played clockwise around the table through a series of attacks and defends. An attacking player can attack the opponent to their left with a battle card. The defending player then has a chance to defend that card with a card of higher numerical value or a trump suited card. Once defended, the attacker can continue their attack with cards that numerically match the cards in play. For example, if you attacked with a \"6 of Stars\" and it was defended with an \"11 of Stars\", you can continue your attack with any other 6 or 11 that's in your hand. If at any time a defending player can no longer defend against an attack, they have to take all the cards in the play area into their hand. So much for getting rid of all of your cards! If an attacker's cards where defended, the cards in the play area are moved to the graveyard and the defender gets a chance to attack the opponent to their left.\nDon't forget about your powerful, game-changing skill cards! Each character has unique skills that will aid you in battle. Each player will hold 3 of 5 skill cards along with 6 battle cards in hand to unleash lethal combos.\nWant to play the game before funding?

Now with all English language on the board.\nFor $57 you can get our special Kickstarter Deluxe edition, with metal coins and wooden tokens instead of cardboard. And for just $2 more, you not only get the deluxe edition of Orleans, but also a TMG original game by Andy Van Zandt, Bottlecap Vikings!\nA Brief Description of Orl\u00e9ans\nDuring the medieval goings-on around Orl\u00e9ans, you must assemble a following of farmers, merchants, knights, monks, etc. to gain supremacy through trade, construction and science in medieval France.\nIn the city of Orl\u00e9ans and the area of the Loire, you can take trade trips to other cities to acquire coveted goods and build trading posts. You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate.\nImage Credit: Steph Hodge Photography\nIn Orl\u00e9ans, you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy.\nOrl\u00e9ans English Rulebook (4MB PDF)\nImage Credit: Steph Hodge Photography\nThe Deluxe Edition\nFor the Orl\u00e9ans deluxe edition, we have made the following upgrades to the base game:\nProvide Metal Coins (we still include the cardboard tokens)\nWooden Discs + Stickers are available for the workers. (we still include the cardboard tokens)\nIn addition to these, we can unlock with Stretch Goals further improvements to the components as detailed further down below.\nWe will only be manufacturing the deluxe editions once.

This is not a game on the scale of Burgoo or Coin Age, but more like Harbour or Dungeon Roll.\nIt is a quick and variable rondel game which has your decisions heavily influenced by where other players are. The rondel setup is variable, and so are the player powers...\nUpdate #5 was all about the game if you would like to read more about it.\nWhat If I Want Multiple Copies?\nIf you would like to pledge for additional copies at your tier level, then please just add the base cost of the tier again.\nSo, for example, just add $59 to get an additional Deluxe Orl\u00e9ans and Bottlecap Vikings. Limit 4 total outside of the USA for shipping costs purposes.\nWhy USA / Canada / Australia Only?\nThe nature of our agreement with game publisher DLP and the designer Reiner Stockhausen is such that we are only able to sell in the USA, Canada, and Australia on Kickstarter.\nOnce this Kickstarter is over, then we will only be able to sell in the USA and Canada.\nThe tracks where you collected workers and rewards.

We personally believe that it was the best game released at Essen in 2014, which says a lot since we also like AquaSphere very much.\nWe love the game so much that we wanted personally to have premium versions of the game. Now, the cost to print and sell these through distribution is just too high!\nSo, we have added our cost of the deluxe upgrade to the game to the Kickstarter price without any profit added in. We want as many people to be able to have this as possible and we hope that you decide to order on this Kickstarter project.\nAlso, if you have Belfort, Village or Harbour, then you know that we like to have stickers on wood.

As an established small games company, the real question is making sure we manage potential sources of delay and communicating clear expectations throughout the campaign and after the funding ends.\n\nTwo primary sources of delay are staying on top of production and completing art in a timely fashion. These two things are closely related, of course. \n\nTo address any concerns related to production TMG hired an operations manager in April 2014 to escort everything through the checkpoints and hurdles with our manufacturers. Thankfully we have worked with Panda Game Manufacturing for several years now and have a good working relationship with them.\n\nWe've assembled a full team here in Utah to elevate our overall level of service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Invasion!", "update_content": "Just a little update regarding Invasion expansion in case you are curious.

These farmers have long used a sophisticated irrigation system to organize rice cultivation by integrating religious devotion and social responsibility with traditional farming methods. Even modern farmers seek to placate the spirit world in their quest to produce an abundant harvest.\nIn Spirits of the Rice Paddy players compete against fellow rice farmers to construct and tend rice paddies. Livestock can be used to build walls and remove large rocks. They can eat harmful pests and fertilize the fledgling crops. Weeds must be kept at bay. And, most importantly, water must be conserved and released with the greatest of care. With a little luck, all that back-breaking labor will pay off in the end. The good news is that the spirits are eager to assist, granting many special abilities, blessings and magic. The farmer who produces the most rice over seven rounds wins!\nWe thankfully had several requests from industry professionals interested in an early glimpse of Spirits. Here's what they had to say!\nRichard Ham, the illustrative reviewer and creator of Rahdo Runs Through played Spirits and called it \"a perfect, wonderful farming simulation with a brilliant, engaging puzzle to solve...\" and \"one thing we don't see enough of in games - a really great sense of escalation.\"\nAs usual, he does an extremely thorough run-through (and static-cam here).\nYou can also see his extended gameplay video (and static-cam here).\nRyan LaFlamme of Cardboard Republic sat in a game of Spirits at Gen Con, and he also graciously agreed take a copy home to play. Here's his preview.\nHe also says that Spirits creates \"a farming atmosphere with a flavor all its own.\"\nHeavy Cardboard included Spirits in its most-anticipated games of 2014 list. They opened episode 15 with this preview.\nJason at Indie Cardboard graciously looked at Spirits. It wasn't quite his cup of tea, but the preview is quite informative.\nG*M*S Magazine interviewed Philip about Spirits. Listen to it here.\nMeeple Mechanic does a Foxhole Fiver with Philip duBarry.\nSpirits of the Rice Paddy is a big game, Here's a breakdown of the components:\n Additional components will be added to this list as stretch goals are met.\nSpirits of the Rice Paddy is a medium to heavy Euro agriculture simulation. It is a worker placement game with several other interesting and complex elements. \nWhat makes Spirits interesting to me, and the reason I decided to pick the game for publication is the interaction between Spirit cards and player order, which creates a unique puzzle for how each game is played.\nSpirit cards dictate the order that players get the most precious commodity - water. Spirit cards with high numeric value are extremely powerful. Playing high-numbered cards grant tremendous powers BUT you'll get water after other players with lower-numbered Spirit cards. \nWater is the most important commodity in the game - necessary to plant and grow rice. Players that don't get water risk wasting seasons without planting.\nEach player has a market from which they can hire laborers and buy livestock. Laborers can build paddies and plant, weed and harvest them. Livestock (oxen) can build paddy walls and remove rocks from the field as well as remove pests and fertilize fields (ducks). Taxes apply when getting multiple items on a turn, so even though rice/money is tight it's important to get items early to avoid late-game taxes.\nYou can get more information about Spirits on the game's page at apegames.com.\nYou can download the rules from apegames.com. \nPhilip duBarry is the designer of Revolution!, Courtier, and several other board games and expansions. Philip has been playing and creating games since childhood and has done so on a professional basis for about the last six years.\nSpirits has been in the works since 2010 and is perhaps his most heavily playtested game to date. He lives in Cincinnati with his wife and five (soon to be six!) children.\nFriend and really smart guy Brendon Hall has built an online boardgaming engine that has worked really well for testing and playing Spirits of the Rice Paddy. \nWe'd like for you to play Spirits online with us so that you can learn about the game. To that end we're scheduling game nights with the designer, Philip duBarry. Watch the project post updates and this space for more information on the first game night! \nIf this project exceeds its $16000 funding goal, we'll upgrade items, and add new items to your pledge levels as the total reaches the indicated amounts.\nPhilip designed solo rules for Spirits of the Rice Paddy from the start. This stretch goal includes a new solo player board, rain cards and rules for solo play at no extra charge. \nThese components won't be available in the retail product - only as part of this Kickstarter and afterwards directly from APE Games at an additional cost.\nThis goal will be to upgrade the 80 wooden laborers in the game from standard meeples to more thematic rice farmer meeples, similar to this:\nThe game box, cards, die-cut tokens, player boards and main board are upgraded to have a linen-like finish.\nWe hate it on games when you jostle the board and pieces go everywhere. This stretch goal provides two-level player boards with 'grooves' for the paddy walls and market laborers and livestock. Table jostles will be no problem!\nBy popular request we're upgrading the green and black weed and pest cubes to actual meeple components!\nArcadia is APE's card game of building theme parks. Have you ever gone to an amusement park and thought that roller coaster would be so much better if they only added a couple corkscrews after that first drop? Well here's your chance to build a theme park for the ages! \nArcadia is a card game of building amusement parks for 2-4 players, aged 8+. \nIn Arcadia, players collect job and expert cards -\nThen trade them in to build rides, midway games, food stands and shows of ever-increasing complexity.\nThere's more to it than that, so head to apegames.com to see more!\nArcadia will be published at the same time as Spirits. There are pledge levels here that let you add Arcadia at a discount.\nWe know there are a lot of tabletop game choices on Kickstarter, so why back Spirits? \nFor starters, APE Games really does need your help to ensure Spirits gets printed. This will be the most expensive game to print since Rolling Freight, so we can't do this without you!\nSecond, depending on stretch goals achieved, Spirits will cost at least $50 in stores, so you'll get a substantial discount off the retail price.\nAlso, assuming we hit the solo game stretch goal, the solo board and cards won't be available in stores.\nAs always, shipping in the U.S. is free, and reduced in the rest of the world. We'll ship from within Europe, Canada and of course, the U.S.\nThere are some other projects that you should check out on Kickstarter. One such project is Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge. The art is awesome and... monkeys hung on martini glasses for scoring!\nCards contain recipes for drinks, and they made up a new 'Spirit' for our game!\nGo take a look at it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAPE Games has successfully run and delivered all of our Kickstarter projects.

Here's a preview of all of them!\nYet again, a ravening horde of horrible zombies has shambled forth to devour the living. It must be a day of the week that ends in \u2018y\u2019.\nIn I Hate Zombies., designed by acclaimed game designer, Kevin WIlson, 2-12 players face off in a climactic battle for the very fate of the world that will last about 10 minutes. Some of the players will be the noble last survivors of humanity, while others will be dirty, wretched brain-guzzling zombies. To see who survives, they will engage in that time-honored tradition, that Sport of Kings...\nYes, that's right. Rock-Paper-Scissors. To the Death!\nAlthough the valiant humans each have a special ability to aid them in their struggle to survive, the zombies are tougher to kill, and humans they kill turn into more zombies, and certainly let us not forget the spleen-churning stench.\nWhile the game could be succinctly described as Rock-Paper-Scissors with special abilities, the abilities add some interesting decision making for the zombie players as to which humans to focus their brain munching beam on, and when. So, while the game uses the RPS mechanism, there are real and interesting decisions to be made which will have the zombies debating their strategy (or at least as well as their limited mental capacity allows).\nIf you hate zombies (and you should!), you'll find altogether more zombies than you're comfortable with in I Hate Zombies.\nWe could blather on about how to play the game here, or we could just link you to the rules. The simple rules all fit on 4 small pages, so you can likely get the gist of it in a couple minutes!\nDownload the Rules Here!\nWant to play the game now?  We've even put together a print and play set of the game for you to download!  The game is only 13 cards, with a front and back side for each, so just follow the short assembly instructions via the link below and you'll be playing in no time!\nDownload the PnP cards here!\nSome of you might absolutely love playing RPS and you're already sold.  Awesome, you'll have a great time!  However, the rest of you are scratching your head and wondering how this is anything more than repeatedly playing RPS with a scoring system. We think you'll still have a great time, but let's show you a little more...\nGranted, the game is a very light party-style game any way you slice it, but the fun of the game really arrives in the special abilities of the human characters, and how they can end up interacting in the game! They can really put the zombie scum in a bind, which is exactly where we like seeing them. So, let's check out the motley crew that will be fending off the horde:\nAthlete: The athlete's competitive spirit means he's going to win, and he's going to win a lot!  Zombies aren't going to want to mess with him if they can help it.\nBiker: The biker is fearless and will step in to sucker punch any zombie that comes near her!  The zombies are going to want to take here out before she punches out what little brains they do have.\nBulldog: The bulldog is one serious threat, and may kill a zombie in one chomp!  A weakened zombie may find him to be a less risky target, but if a zombie is still in good shape, he may want to avoid this fella.\nBusinesswoman: Her game function is essentially the same as the bulldog, but she'll beat you with her smarts instead!\nCheerleader: A fairly easy target for the zombies, but if she sticks around, she'll make everyone around her even meaner with her inspiring cheers!\nCouple: Strength in numbers!  There's two of 'em, so they're twice as hard to kill!\nHunter: The zombies do not want to cross the hunter!  Not only will he set his sights on a zombie, but the bullet will fly into another zombie as well!\nNurse: While she may look harmless, her healing abilities are a serious pain in the neck to the zombie horde!\nPoliceman: The law is going to come down on the zombies HARD! When the policeman gets a shot off on a zombie, he's going to feel it.\nScientist: The pesky scientist has come up with an antidote!  Instead of dying, any zombies next to her will regenerate into a full healed human again.\nSniper: The sniper is always looking for a zombie to finish off.  He can set his sites on any zombie of his choosing when he wins a fight!\nSoldier: The last of the insta-kill trifecta of cards (along with Bulldog and Businesswoman).  These abilities are a big risk for zombies, and can also really mess with their heads!\nWhichever human (or zombie, should you be so unfortunate) you control, you'll find yourself yelling and cheering for you and your fellow teammates, as the fate of the world hinges on each and every battle!  You'll also find many interesting scenarios emerge, as we'll now see...\nWe totally understand! So far, it's just us project creators telling you how cool the game is, and of course we love it or we wouldn't be making it.\nUndeadViking is the first reviewer to review IHZ!  If you've never watched his videos, you really should!  He is one of the most thorough, thoughtful reviewers out there, besides just being an all around good guy.  Furthermore, he doesn't accept payment for his reviews, so you know his opinion isn't based on us throwing a bunch of dollars at him. He just has a real passion for games and reviewing them, and it shows!\nIf you enjoy Lance's review, make sure to subscribe to him on YouTube, where he does very excellent, in depth reviews of all kinds of games.\nHere's an example of a scenario you might come across in IHZ. Let's pretend you've been duking it out for bit, and it's now zombie A's turn.\nZombie A has previously sustained a wound, meaning attacking the Policeman is a risky move (remember, zombies thankfully die when they take 3 wounds, and the Policeman does two damage if he wins). Attacking the Policeman could spell his doom!\nHowever, attacking the Sniper comes with a big risk as well.  Zombie A's incompetent friend, Zombie B, has already taken two wounds.  If the Sniper wins, he could choose to finish Zombie B off instead.  Worse yet, this means there'd be no one left to finish off that pesky Cheerleader, leaving her uncontested to cheer on the Policeman, a combination deadly enough to make any zombie shudder.\nIt's almost enough to make you feel sorry for the zombies!  Wait, no, never mind. We really hate zombies.\nMost importantly, IHZ is fun, and we want it to exist! Have you not been paying attention to anything we've been saying!?!  If you like having fun with your friends, pledging for a copy (or two, or three, or five) would be a fun time for you when the game delivers. If the project doesn't fund, there will be one less fun thing in the world!\nA generous royalty per copy goes to Kevin Wilson! If you play many games, you've heard of this guy.  He has some awesome game design credits to his name, such as A Game of Thrones, Descent, Arkham Horror, and Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game. At BGG, we want to support the awesome designers that bring these games to life. The % royalty we give on our micro games is very generous; we want to make sure Kevin can afford a good chainsaw should zombies arrive at his doorstep.\nThe profits go to supporting BGG! Whatever profit is made from the project goes toward supporting the BGG community. We're continually at work making improvements, and are working toward continually doing so. If you enjoy the new marketplace system that was recently completed, that's the sort of work that will continue to be underway!\nRobb Mommaerts is awesome! If you've been looking at this project, and thinking, \"Gee, these graphics and illustrations are really nice!\", you can thank Robb.  He's an amazing illustrator, and his contributions have really made IHZ into not just a fun game, but an outstanding overall product that we're really proud to present.  We would love to pay him for even more eye-popping illustrations, which brings us to...\nWe want to make IHZ even better!  We have some more cool ideas for the game, but bringing them to life isn't without cost.  We'd like bigger cards, more cards, and more of Robb's awesome illustrations, which all cost money that we can only afford if they're diluted by economies of scale.  So, more copies sold equal more cool things we can add!  More specifically, here's what we'd like to do...\nZombie Meeple Marker - $3\nFor $3, we'll add in a zombie meeple to your pledge rewards!  Just add $3 to your pledge for each meeple you would like shipped along with your games! The zombie meeple is great for marking the active zombie, which is especially useful in lower player count games to keep track of which zombie is currently attacking!\nThe meeple is Meeple Source's Mega Meeple size, which is about 19mm x 19mm.  A huge thank you to http://www.meeplesource.com/ for helping us make this item a reality.  If you haven't checked out their site, you really should, as they have all kids of awesome gaming accessories!\nBrain Life Point Counters - $5\nFor just $5 for a set of 24 counters, you can add a set of brain life point counters to your game of IHZ.  Just add $5 to your pledge for each bag of brains you would like shipped along with your games!\nThe game is perfectly playable without these counters, but they definitely add some bling, and are a little neater to play with than the card rotating option.\nPlease note that the color may not match exactly what is shown in these images, as these are the prototype brains.  The shape and size is all set, however!\nThe Salesman promo card will be free to all backers, and later available in the BGG Store, so only backers will get the card for free!\nThe Miner promo card will be free to all backers, and later available in the BGG Store, so only backers will get the card for free.\nThe Priest promo card will be free to all backers, and later available in the BGG Store, so only backers will get the card for free.\n To better showcase Robb's awesome work, we'll be upgrading the card size to the size of the cards used in Dixit (which there are card sleeves available for!).  Bigger cards mean bigger illustrations! This is an upgrade to all copies of the game!\nA trifecta of new characters!  These promo cards will be free to all backers, and later available in the BGG Store, so only backers will get the cards for free.\nThis will be an upgrade to all copies of the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this will be BGG's first published game, we don't anticipate any large risks or challenges in getting IHZ to you. The reasons being:\n\n1) We've budgeted, budgeted, and budgeted again. The funding goal is enough to pay for the artwork, pay the designer, pay Kickstarter fees, get the games produced and shipped to our warehouse, buy envelopes for shipping, pay our warehouse staff, and pay the final shipping to you.\n\n2) We're working with Ad Magic to produce the games. If you've never heard of them, they also handle the production of a little game called Cards Against Humanity (you may have heard of it, and if you haven't you must live in a cave). So, this isn't Ad Magic's first rodeo! Once I get them the files, they're responsible for the whole production process and getting the games to our warehouse in Texas, which they have done countless times with other games. So, we're letting a solidly proven professional handle all aspects of the process that we're unfamiliar with.\n\n3) We're used to shipping large number of orders from the Geek Store. Our store staff should be able to ship out the orders rather efficiently once the games arrive from Ad Magic!\n\nThe main possible delays will be due to the stretch goals and needing Robb to do the extra illustrations for them, which will take some time.

Also I want to thank the games press for giving this little project some coverage- especially Rock Paper Shotgun and Kotaku.\nA mock-up image of 'night mode', one of the stretch goals now reached!\nConcrete Jungle is a new take on the city building game that swaps micro management for deck-building and extra servings of strategy.\nThe game combines the simple but satisfying mechanics of a tabletop deck-building game,\nthe intricacy and accessibility of an indie title,\nand the variety and depth of a collectible card game.\nTopped with the isometric stylings of classic 90s management sims!\nYou use cards in your deck to place buildings, clearing city blocks to give yourself more room to build. As your city grows you'll get opportunities to hone your deck, but the game also gets harder.\nIt started off years ago as a sequel to my indie game 'MegaCity' from 2011. Although still a successor to that game, it's come so far I thought it had earned a shiny new name.\nThe game is being developed for PC but I'll also be porting to Mac. Ports to Linux, Android and iOS may also be possible further down the road.\n*sound of traffic*\nYou have a deck of selected cards which you can use to place buildings. Each building will affect it's surroundings in different ways. The aim of the game is to clear city blocks by gathering the required number of points from your residents, giving more room to build.\nAs the city grows, you choose bigger and better new buildings to add to your deck!\nAs you get opportunities to hone and refine your deck, residents will demand more from you, making the game harder. You'll find yourself inadvertently creating zoning puzzles- playing against your own past planning decisions!\nAlso in the works is a competitive game mode where 2 rival city planners face off in a city planning dual. Incredibly tactical- your building placements and deck building skills matter more than ever here.\nIs their new apartment building raking in tonnes of points? Place a landfill next to it to screw them over! It's like building a city through playing chess- if chess was much, much meaner. There will also be AI to play against in this mode.\nThe game does not feature free-to-play mechanics or micro-transactions. There will be plenty of unlocks, but you'll have to earn them!\nPlanned features:\nOver 150+ buildings! 50 more in a free update after release.\nSingle player story mode with 6 unlockable characters! 2 more in a free update after release.\nVoice acting for the characters!\nOnline High Scores system!\nCompetitive mode with challenging AI!\nLocal competitive/co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players (1 vs 1, 2 vs 2)\nSoundtrack featuring DP Kaufman, Mokhov & Xerxes and original music.\nA night time mode- see your city lights at night! (Will also be in the free update).\n\nCombo buildings together for maximum points.\nBuild your deck as you build the city!\nAlthough I have a functioning build I'm really happy with, it only represents the beginning of what I want this project to be.\nAs the sole developer and artist, I can operate for next-to-nothing (but not quite nothing). The kickstarter funding will secure me enough time to implement the features listed above, as well as provide enough money to license the ideal soundtrack for the project.\nI've organized the project for minimal risk- all the game mechanics are in place- what's left to do is add content and balance. Both of which are time consuming, but also in the grand scheme of things, relatively straightforward. That's not to under-estimate the challenges up ahead, but I'm fully confident I can deliver on this!\nEarly access funding is/was another potential route. However, as a gamer myself, I'm a little wary of this model. I feel it diminishes the release of the actual finished game- it's hard to keep track of a game when there's more than 1 release date!\nOffering a preview build in a kickstarter campaign is a great comprise as it's limited enough to not deaden the final product, while giving you guys something cool to play in return for supporting the project.\nThe preview version of the game is already completely playable on PC and features 44 buildings. It's what I'm using to demo the game. You can get it right away after the kickstarter ends, along with a copy of the full game on release if you pledge just \u00a35 or more!\nThe other backer rewards are filled with ways you can actually be in the game! There will be a large pool of random building names which will be assigned to every building each game. To add your name to the building databases, choose one of the pledges detailed on the right.\nThere are different databases. One is the citizen database, this will just use your or a name and apply it to a residence. Eg. 'Frank Callahan's House'\nAn example of your building names in the game!\nThe next is the city building database, which is unique for every other building. I'll sort out your submitted name into the correct category. For example, you could submit 'Frank's Firework Factory' and I'll make sure it only applies to factories. Or have a hospital named after you, eg 'Franklin's Hospital for Severe Burns'.\nThere is also a neighborhood database. In the game this applies to a group of buildings- real life examples would be the neighborhoods of SoHo or Tribeca in New York. This could be pretty much anything. 'The Firework District'.\nLastly, there's also a database for landmarks, which are top-end buildings. Think of them as statues or monuments. Eg 'The Frank Callahan Memorial'.\nFor the top tier rewards, I will get in touch with you to create your buildings/character!\nI reserve the final say over what makes it in, but if I have a problem with your submission I'll get in contact to request a new one from you or suggest alternatives. I'm going to ask we avoid blatant advertising, submissions of bad taste etc. Names are fine. Puns are encouraged!\nThe campaign has had an incredible response! So much so that we're already funded & greenlit! So what now?\nI asked the backers to vote on how the extra funds should be used (if you're a backer, check update #4), and the favorites were expansion of the game (more buildings and characters) and more visual effects (night mode, weather etc).\nSo I'm going to be putting the extra funding towards those- details further below.\nI've also had a lot of advice relating to stretch goals- adding more content inevitably takes more time. I want to do what I can to meet my original planned release date and get a finished project out there for you. \nSo my plan is to complete the game to the standard above, release it, then use the extra funds to expand it for free. I'm also going to be using some of the money to hire people to help with the workload in the meantime.\nThis is the best of both worlds as you guys will get the game on time, and you'll get the extra content later on for no cost!\nSo this is the content I'm looking at adding after release, for free:\n+50 more buildings! Every time we break a new \u00a3500 barrier from 8k onwards, I'll add another 5! (I'm going to have to cap it at 50 though folks, I'm running out of building ideas!) GOAL REACHED!\n+2 new characters!\n+Night mode! It's a nice visual change, and it just looks cool! It's something I've wanted to include since the start but involves a lot of work as each building will have to have a 'night time look' created for it. I've done a quick mock-up of how I want it to look above. GOAL REACHED!\n +Other VFX: I'm going to look into doing some rain effects, and I'd like to get some people on the streets. The only thing stopping me from promising this right now is I'm not sure how it will impact performance on the engine I'm using. Will do this if possible!\n+Language support: I'm already going to put some of the extra money to making sure the game supports some other languages. Details will be confirmed towards release. French, Spanish & German at the minimum.\n+Expanded soundtrack: As well as the aforementioned licensed tracks, I'll also be adding some original music to the game in the form of a 'main theme'. Guaranteed @ 11k!\n+Voice acting: I think this could be really cool (especially for a tutorial and the story mode). Consider it guaranteed if we pass 12k!\n   Here are the best ways to follow the project (aside from through kickstarter of course):\ncolepowered.com or concrejunglegame.com\nDeveloper's Twitter\nConcrete Jungle Twitter\nFacebook\nIndieDB\nGreenlight Page\nIf you are a member of the press, you can find a presskit here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI want you to be able to back my project with confidence.

The game ends when either the planets or bonus opportunities run out. \nThe player with the most victory points wins.\nVariable Game Length: At the beginning of the game, players can set up the game to be either a short (10min per player) or normal (20min per player) length game.

There will be no branding of the Outer Earth logo or creators on this poster.\nCan I add a poster to any pledge level?\nYES! To add a poster to your existing pledge, increase your pledge level according to the type of poster (single or grid) and the number of posters you want. At the end of the Kickstarter, I will send out a survey verifying your order.\nExample: If you have an Art Direct pledge ($150) and want 2 single posters (2 x $30) and 1 Grid poster ($35), your pledge would be 150 + 30 + 30 + 35 = $245\nWhat is the poster quality?\nThe posters will be printed on an archival, acid free heavyweight matte paper stock.\nAre there any additional shipping costs?\nSince I will be using a Print on Demand service, you might have to pay customs fees on orders outside of the United States. However when pledging for a poster, everyone (US, INT', EU) pledges the same amounts ($30 and $35).\nHow are they shipped?\nThey will be rolled up and shipped in super-durable tubes!\nThe Kickstarter goal will fund an initial print run of 1000 units for Outer Earth. It includes shipping, basic distribution (in Canada + US), artwork and mandatory fees.\nTo ship Outer Earth, we will use a service called ShipNaked (a service used by Game Salute) and distribute the game through two different warehouse locations.\nThe first location will be in the US (that will ship worldwide excluding the US).\nThe second location makes the game EU friendly by shipping within the UK.\nWhen adding an additional game to your pledge, add $35 for each additional copy of the game for a maximum of 10 games.\nWhen the Kickstarter ends in November, we will have the resources to begin the completion of the digital files of Outer Earth. We will send and approve final proofs from prospective manufacturers by the beginning of 2015, allowing us to initiate production in March 2015. For optimal distribution to backers, the game will ship to two different warehouse locations. We expect the game to be in your hands by Early Fall 2015.\nI started developing Outer Earth when I first heard about Cards Against Humanity's 2013 Tabletop Deathmatch. After being selected as one of the 16 finalists, I went to GenCon in the hopes of getting Outer Earth published.\nWhile I did not get selected to win, the whole experience of meeting people in the board game industry was powerful and inspiring. It gave me incredible motivation to continue developing the game. Since GenCon 2013, every game element has been scrutinized, playtested and redrawn multiple times. Though the game has truly evolved from its humble beginnings, the essence of the game has not changed. The result? Outer Earth finally plays like the game I envisioned it to be a year ago, and it's much simpler and better than before.\nMy intentions are to keep improving Outer Earth up until the files are sent to the manufacturer. Although things might shift around ever-so-slightly until the very end, I am fully committed to delivering the best version of my game, Outer Earth, to you.\nTo provide the illustrations for the game, I have collaborated with Daniel Orellana; a friend, illustrator and a budding game developer (like myself!). He has been a part of the Toronto indie videogame development scene for a while, and Outer Earth will be his first illustration job for a boardgame. Working side-by-side with Daniel, we have created a utopian futuristic setting to bring to life the realities of terraforming to the game.\nCheck out a sample of the awesome game art below!\nIf you want to test out the game before committing, try the Print and Play found below. Watch the video below for instructions as to what you need and how you assemble the PnP. Some features include:\nRuns perfectly with the latest version of the rulebook.\nDesigned for ease of cutting and assembly.\nOptimized to reduce ink coverage.\nRulebook for digital viewing\nRulebook for double sided booklet printing\nPrint and Play file\nThe physical copy will include a rulebook in English, however there are a few backers that are willing to translate the rulebook into different languages. All of these translations will occur AFTER the Kickstarter is done and the rulebook is finalized.\nWe currently have these languages lined up:\nPortuguese\nItalian\nMandarin\nSpanish\nEven though I (Paul Tseng) attempt to do most if not all of the avenues of Outer Earth myself, I have realized that there are three people that have helped me tremendously and I consider them a part of the team.\nWhenever I need help in video, copywriting or general game design, I know that my sister (Fei-Ling Tseng) is there to bounce ideas off.\nMy girlfriend (Justine Wong) has endured my year long endeavour, supported me at GenCon and motivated me to make the best game possible.\nMy fellow friend and game designer (Daniel Orellana) has brought an artistic style to Outer Earth that really brings the game to life.\nWe are all based in Toronto, check us out below :D\nPaul Tseng\nWebsite | Twitter  Game + Graphic Designer\nDaniel Orellana\nTwitter  Illustrator\nFei-Ling Tseng\nWebsite | Twitter  Helper #1\nJustine Wong\nWebsite | Twitter  Helper #2\nBoardGameGeek Entry\nFacebook Group", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first time I'm publishing a game\u2026\n...so there is plenty I\u2019ve had to learn (and continue to learn) along the way.\nHowever, you can be sure that I will make no hasty assumptions and shortcuts.

It features a unique combination of card drafting and set collection that makes every game a new and exciting challenge. The base game comes with cards for 2-4 players, but if you add two sets together you can play with up to 8 friends. \nTime: 60 minutes (roughly 15 minutes per player)\nAges: 13+\nTwo years ago we set out to make a game that would be fun for both casual and experienced board game players. The sort of game you could play with your non-gamer friends and family that you would enjoy as much as they did. Countless iterations and hundreds of internal and external playtesting sessions later and we finally have a game we are incredibly proud of. Now we want to share the finished game with you! We hope you love Dragon Racer as much as we do and we hope you join us on our quest to make this game a reality.\nDownload our FREE Print & Play Prototype at our website!\nDownload the Prototype Game Rules!\nHate reading game rules? We do too! Check out our preview videos below to see some awesome rundowns of how to play!\nIn the game you play as a Dragon Racer, one of the few individuals talented enough to train and ride dragons through some of the most dangerous racecourses the world has ever seen. Your goal is simple; race faster and go further than any of your competitors.\nThe rules of dragon racing are easy; each racer has a team of three dragons to race with. The only problem is that it is very hard to encourage dragons to go the way you want them to. To get them moving you are going to need to enlist the help of other dragons from the surrounding area to cheer your dragons on. The faster the dragon, the more cheering dragons you are going to need to encourage it!\nAs the game goes on you will be able to switch faster dragons onto your team and use other dragons you collect to sabotage your rivals. In the end the winner will be the player who is able to make the best use of the dragons they collect.\nDragon Racer was designed with compactness in mind. We found we could fit all of the cards needed for 2-4 players inside one small box. But one of the great things about the game is its ability to play just as well with 3 players as it does with 8. With this in mind we designed the game in such a way that combining two sets gives you all the cards you need to play with up to 8 players.\nPrototype Components Pictured\nOne Box of Dragon Racer Contains:\n64 Dragon Cards\n8 Trophy Cards\n4 Double Sided Large Character Cards [+2 Bonus Cards!]\n12 Large Race Track Tiles\n8 Player Tokens [Dragon Meeples!]\n1 Rulebook\nThe components shown above are prototype quality and the final version will include updated artwork.\nDragon Racer features the beautiful artwork of Rose \"Rocky\" Hammer (Drawings of Pokemon, try-hard Comics). Rose is a local Canberra designer who has been involved with the game and art design from start to finish. \nOur current prototype of the game uses Rose's art and the final version of the game will feature even more. The game's final artwork will include:\n12 Different Dragon Card Illustrations\n8 Different Character Illustrations\n12 Visually Enhanced Track Cards\nAnd More!\nEach game of Dragon Racer lasts seven turns. Each turn players will simultaneously draft dragon cards from a collective pool. The goal is to collect the dragon cards you need to support your specific team of dragons. Unlike other drafting games, in Dragon Racer each round you have goals that you will either succeed or fail at - this creates an exciting and tactical drafting experience. Dragon Racer is built with a number of modern game design principles that make it an engaging game for players of all skill levels. To learn more about how to play download the rules, or check out preview gameplay videos below!\nWhy Casual Gamers Love Dragon Racer\nEasy to Learn: Nothing turns off a new player quicker than needing to spend half an hour learning how to play a game. Dragon Racer has simple rules and was designed to introduce new aspects of the game in a logical order, making it very easy to learn as you play through your first couple of turns.\nSimultaneous Turns: Since most of the gameplay in Dragon Racer happens whilst drafting, there is very little downtime in the game, keeping everyone active and involved at all times.\nPerfect Length: Most games targeted at casual players are very short filler games. We wanted a game with a little more meat than that. We found that 60 minutes was \"just right\" for most players and with a set number of turns you know the game won't last longer than expected.\nGreat for any group size: Since you can play with as low as 2 and as many as 8 players, no one will need to sit out when you play.\nNever Out of the Race: There is nothing worse than knowing you are going to lose a game and having to keep playing. Dragon Racer solves this problem by escalating the stakes each turn and giving small advantages to the players who are falling behind. So even if you fall way behind, it's always possible to win an 'Australian Skating Gold'.\n Why Experienced Gamers Love Dragon Racer\nNo Dice, Low Luck: Many games targeted at casual players are filled with lots of luck, randomness is the great equalizer. However we believe that too many random elements in a game lead to an unsatisfactory experience. While Dragon Racer does have some random elements, we keep skill and strategy at the forefront at all times.\nVery Replayable: Every game of Dragon Racer is different. The character card you choose, the way the players around you are playing, and the track cards that flip all combine to make the game incredibly replayable. There are many different strategies and approaches to try out and the value of each is entirely dependent on the strategies your opponents take.\nRewards Advanced Skills: Card counting, statistical estimation, player psychology - all of these difficult skills can give you a great edge in Dragon Racer. Your ability to predict the outcomes of drafting decisions of other players will give you a distinct advantage.\nLearn Fundamental Drafting Skills: From \"Magic the Gathering\" to \"7 Wonders\", drafting is an increasingly popular game mechanic. Dragon Racer is a \"pure\" drafting game and is perfect for honing your skills and learning how to excel at all types of drafting. Learning signaling and establishing what types are 'open' are just some of the basics this game will help you master.\n    Gettin' Higgy with Dragon Racer [4:02]\nA quick video that explains how to play Dragon Racer.\nDice Tower Preview (with Ryan Metzler) [15:43]\nA more detailed rules rundown by Ryan Metzler.\nGreyElephant Gaming Video Preview [28:44]\nThis preview goes into more depth and runs you through a full two player game.\nFather Geek Game Review\nDragon Racer received the Father Geek seal of approval, being fully endorsed by separate gaming groups of children, parents, casual gamers, gaming elitists, and non-gamers!\n\"This is a challenging game, but plays casually. There is no such thing as a bad hand and it\u2019s up to the players to do something with it. No luck here. Only skill. Games like this always entertain me and they certainly entertained others.\" - Father Geek\n\u201cNeat ideas in this game. Some I\u2019ve seen before and some are brand new. I like that. I also like how easy the game plays out. Very smooth.

I can imagine even those without much board game experience would be able to grasp the basic rules in one or two rounds. That is not to say the game is simple, as I noticed a fair bit of strategy involved.\" - Lin Htat\nhttp://atgn.com.au/dragon-racer-preview/\nCheck out our updates for more info on each stretch goal.\n$7,500  -  FREE DIGITAL ARTBOOK  -  UNLOCKED!\nAll backers will be sent a high quality PDF Artbook featuring artwork from the game.

This name will appear in every copy of the game ever made! This level also comes with the standard DOUBLE DRAGON rewards, including the 2 copies of Dragon Racer.\nTo help keep the game consistent and fun for everyone, we have some naming restrictions all backers at this level must abide by. Each name will need personal approval and may be denied at our discretion. If your name idea is knocked back we will work with you to choose another name everyone is happy with.\nNaming Restrictions:\nThe name must not exceed 15 characters in length (inc. spaces)\nThe name must not be rude or vulgar\nThe name must not include any intellectual property from other franchises\nThe name must be appropriate for a dragon in a fantasy setting\n$140 - RETAIL RACER\nGet 6 copies of the game at the cheapest price per copy.

Please read that pledge level for rules on naming dragon cards. In addition to naming a dragon you will also get the chance to direct what type of modifications you would like made for the \"elite\" version of the artwork. There are 8 dragons in the game with abilities and each of those will have custom \"elite\" artwork thanks to our $12,500 stretch goal. Here is an example of modifications for an \"elite\" dragon:\nWhen the artwork for each normal dragon in the game is complete, backers will be able to pick which of these they want and will then help us come up with ways to modify the 'elite' version of it. Picking dragons will happen in backer order, so get in early to get your top choice! Alterations include things like color, extra horns, details, anything you can imagine really. We will retain the final say and control over the artwork, but we will work with you to truly make the dragon design your own.\nAdd-ons are extra products you can add to your order by simply adding extra funds on top of the pledge level you choose.\n1. Artwork Prints [$12 + Shipping]\nNow you can add professional Dragon Racer artwork prints to your order. These full color prints will be 5\" x 7\" (12.7 x 17.8 cm), the standard photo size that is perfect for framing, and printed on thick acid free cardstock to ensure they last for decades. Each will be hand signed with Rose's red signature seal. Every piece of dragon art and character art from the game will be available, meaning that currently you have a selection of 12 regular dragons, 8 elite dragons, and 12 characters to choose from.\nExample Prints from Rose's Online Store, Drawings of Heroes\nTo add prints to your order, simply add $12.00 for each print you would like. These come with free shipping to Australia. If you are outside of Australia please add an additional one-off cost of $8 extra for shipping. You only need to add the $8 once, regardless of how many prints you order.\nFor example to buy 3 prints shipped to the USA would cost $36 for the prints + $8 for shipping, for a total of $44.\nWe will contact you after all the artwork for the game is complete to let you choose which prints you would like. \n2. Dragon Racer Artbook [$50]\nThe Dragon Racer Artbook was unlocked as the first completed stretch goal of the project. This gives every backer a free digital copy of the artbook as a part of their digital perks. But for those of you who want a beautiful way to display the art from the game in your home, look no further than this $50 add-on.\nThis book will contain behind the scenes sketches, high quality images of all the dragons, and some wonderful text explaining more about them and the world they are from. It will also contain some snippets on game and card design and all the behind the scenes goodies you would expect.\nThe printed copy is $50 (including free shipping anywhere in the world). It will be a softcover coffee table style artbook on standard portrait sized paper (7.74\" x 9.75\"). We expect it to be a beautiful premium addition to your pledge. The high price point is an inevitability given the very limited print run we will be doing.\n3. Extra Copies of Dragon Racer\nYou may add as many extra copies of Dragon Racer to your order as you like. You can add copies at the same price points as the three levels we already offer them at. That is:\n+1 Copy of Dragon Racer = $29 + Shipping\n+2 Copies of Dragon Racer = $49 + Shipping\n+6 Copies of Dragon Racer = $140 + Shipping \nAdd shipping costs as you normally would for your location (see each pledge level for details).\nFor example if you wanted 3 copies of Dragon Racer shipped to Australia it would cost you $49 + $15 for the DOUBLE DRAGON pledge level, plus another $29 + $10 for the extra copy, for a total of $103.\nYou can always manage your pledge to add extra add-ons at any time.\nShipping for each reward level is included in the pledge description. Kickstarter's new shipping system means it will automatically prompt you to add the correct amount for shipping to your pledge. We will be collecting shipping addresses from you again right before we ship the final game out. That way if you move addresses there will be no problems. We are committed to shipping the game to backers before August 2015.\nUnfortunately it is cost prohibitive for us to manufacture or ship the game directly from Australia, hence the shipping cost. However we have been able to provide a significant shipping discount to Australians because we plan to do a bulk shipment into the country.\nWe have placed our international shipping fees at competitive levels. We will do our best to ensure the game is shipped EU-friendly.\nRose Hammer, Myles O'Neill, Luke English\nThylacine Games is a small Australian board game development company founded in 2012 by Myles O'Neill & Luke English.

Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.\nEach player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout the world of Aerim, each worth varying victory points. Each champion has two abilities: a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy (discard) pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but also for which ability he will add to the next.\nFurther impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!\nWant to try it out for yourself?

YOU made that happen.\nIf you missed out on the Kickstarter of Vye, but would still like to order it, you can do so at our company website: www.SandHatGames.com \nThank you all again for the support and we\u2019ll keep you updated on the development of the game as things progress. \nJoe, Doug and Vince of Sand Hat Games\n\u201cVye is a kingdom building game at its most beautiful state.\u201d Across the Board Games\n\u201cWould I recommend Vye? Without hesitation. It\u2019s a fun and highly competitive card game of positioning and timing.\u201d - Father Geek\nVye is an area control game that plays quickly across an ever increasing, and oftentimes contentious board, usually taking less than half an hour. The game is made up of 110 beautifully illustrated cards and 125 wooden tokens in 5 different colors. It has been favorably compared to Carcassonne, Fealty, Robber Knights and Go.\nVye is a game for 2-4 players, competing to build the largest kingdom... before the Inevitable Empress is drawn.  \nBelow is a quick \"How to Play\" video we put together for all of you. \nTo play, you take five cards and lay them out as the unconquered lands of Vye. Players choose a color and put their matching house, and tokens in front of them. When played, each family member in a house claims neighboring cards with a unique trait. You\u2019re dealt four cards and during your turn you can play from either your hand or from family. Playing your cards strategically enables you to capture your opponent\u2019s lands and control the largest kingdom, thereby winning the game. Will you see your kingdom fractured or will you remain united and claim the kingdom of Vye before time runs out?\n\"Vye shines with its original artwork and design and is a terrific game to introduce to new gamers.\" Across the Board Games\n \u201cDo play Vye the first chance you get and enjoy the challenge of capturing territory in an ever-shifting land dispute for power and control!\u201d - Father Geek\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun playing Vye and we\u2019ve gotten a lot of great feedback and comments about the game. So much so that we wanted to give all of you the opportunity to try out our \u201cpre-release edition\u201d for free. Download the Print and Play of Vye below and if you like it please consider showing your support.\nDownload the Vye print and play kit here\nVye includes 60 Land cards, 20 Family cards, 24 special cards, 3 legendary cards, and an Inevitable Empress card. It also includes 5 different sets of colored wooden tokens (125 total) all in a beautifully designed box.\nUpdate: Collector's Edition Box - $75 (Early Prototype)\nHere's an early sample of the Collector's Edition box and tokens created by Lyris Laser Studio.\nFor more of an update on the Collector's Edition, check out Update #10.\nUpdate: Release Party V.I.P. ($60) \nWe have some more information regarding the \"goodie bag\" that comes at the V.I.P. pledge level.\n For more of an update on this pledge, check out Update #11.\nAll stretch goals are designed to add variety and mix up gameplay to keep you on your toes (as you Vye for control of the kingdom)! All stretch goals will be included in every copy of Vye.\nOur first stretch goal is to upgrade our standard, and totally acceptable, card stock finish to the much more impressive linen finish. This gives the cards a thicker more durable feel.\nWild Lands: Vye is a magical place and sometimes lands don\u2019t take form until the moment of choosing. The Wild Lands are 4 new bonus cards you can add into the deck. Wild Lands take on the aspect of a neighboring land when played.\nWinter's Vale: High in the mountains of Vye, is a place where the snow never melts, called Winter's Vale. Winter's Vale is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of a game.\nSinkhole: The world of Vye is falling into the earth. Giant, unexplainable sinkholes are swallowing up the lands of Vye making areas unpassable. Sinkholes are 4 new bonus cards you can add into the deck. They are placed on top of any existing land card. No kingdom can ever control that space again.  \nFoxwood Marsh: Seeing the Foxwood Marsh, you might wonder why anyone would want to claim this foul smelling place for their kingdom. The creatures who live here are smarter, and more cunning than any animal should be. Some believe there is a Fox King at the heart of the bog ruling his minions with an ancient language only he remembers. The Foxwood Marsh is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nCatapult: In the battle for the kingdom of Vye, sometimes it helps have reach. The families have brought their own weapons of war onto the battlefield. Catapult adds 4 new cards to the game. Each player adds a Catapult next to their house at the start of the game and plays it as they would a Family card. The Catapult allows you to claim a land previously out of your reach.  \nHungry Seas: The seas of Vye are ripe for conquering. It takes a boldness and bravery to sail these treacherous waters against the leviathans that call it home. The Hungry Seas is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nFortress: Command your ever-expanding kingdom with the indomitable Fortress. Providing you with a strong foothold in the contested lands of Vye, your Fortress can never be captured by your enemies and provides the lands surrounding it an imposing garrison. Fortress adds 4 new cards to the core set. Played from your sideboard along with your other Family cards, Fortress is sure to bring an exciting new dimension to your Vye games.\nThe Amber Jungle: What lurks in the remote depths of the Amber Jungle? Keep close watch as you explore the reaches of this newly discovered country, for predators known and unknown surely stalk this vibrant jungle land. The Amber Jungle is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\n Undermine: Divided realms will be reunited with the powerful Undermine card. While you own Undermine, you may count the score from two of your kingdoms instead of one. Undermine adds 4 new cards to the core set and is sure to bring earth-shattering dynamism to your Vye games.\nDrover Reach: The pastoral reaches of Vye are perfect additions to your burgeoning realm. Drover Reach is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nThe Lost City: The Lost Cities are thriving meccas of culture, influence and power. Long ago the inhabitants chose to remove themselves from society, learning to bend the minds of men to avoid their cities. However, you have found them and claimed their city as your own. The Lost City cards are 4 new bonus cards you can add into the deck. If they are in your largest kingdom at the end of the game, they increase your overall power.\nOnyx Coast: Ancient castles stand vanguard over the realm known as the Onyx Coast. Their origins lost to time, these long-abandoned strongholds would be perfect conquests for your kingdom. Onyx Coast is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nHouse of the Entangled Soul: Just who are these upstarts? Do they presume to divide your kingdom and take it for their own? Or will they be allies in your quest to rule Vye? The House of the Entangled Soul is a set of 4 new Family cards and 25 black tokens you can use in place of an existing family or to expand your Vye games to 5 player slug-fests! \nThis stretch goal also unlocks an additional Catapult and Fortress card for the 5th family as well as 25 additional custom wooden tokens for the Collector's Edition version of the game.\nEarthquake: The earth beneath your kingdom\u2019s feet is not as stable as you might think. A sudden shift in the ground can cause lands you once controlled to slip away to a different part of the kingdom. In its place is a new land and potentially a new kingdom has appeared.\n Sanctuary: There\u2019s a place in Vye, where even enemies coexist. This land is protected by the rulers of Vye and safe passage is always granted. The inhabitants are the castaway children of the houses - bastard sons and moon daughters. Though these children are not allowed in their own kingdoms, no house is willing to shed blood here, for fear that it would be their own.\n Necropolis: All things must die, but you can control who goes first. Watch how a kingdom\u2019s forces, once powerful and mighty, turn to dust with the touch of the Necropolis.\nVye was created by three video game developers. We\u2019ve spent our careers working on games such as inFAMOUS: Second Son, Diablo 3, Warhammer Online, City of Heroes, WildStar and more. Vye was developed in between two of those jobs. We wanted the perfect opener to getting hired: a game you could actually play in the interview, rather than just our resume of previous game experience. We knew the game would need to be quick to learn in order to immediately win over our audience of skeptical game developers. We never imagined that we\u2019d create such a fun and beautiful game. Vye is that game and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you.\nVye is in the final stages of development. The core game is solid and fun. We\u2019re final testing some of the bonus cards to make sure everything flows smoothly. The art is being completed, with only a few cards remaining. We have our quote from our manufacturer and have determined how we\u2019re going to fulfill orders when they come in.\nAll that remains is getting your support to make Vye a reality. If we hit our funding goal, we\u2019ll be able to do a minimum print run of the game for you, the backers, and get Vye into game stores. We hope you\u2019ll show us your support and back us.\n  The three of us, Joe, Doug, and Vince, make up Sand Hat Games. We are a small company dedicated to making beautiful games for everyone to enjoy. Our professional background is in video game development, where we\u2019ve spent years designing, writing and generally creating a lot of different games (Diablo 2, Diablo 3, City of Heroes, inFAMOUS, WildStar, and Warhammer Online). \nAt home, we\u2019ve worked on different projects from pen and paper RPGs to card and board games. Vye marks our first attempt to come together and produce something for everyone at Sand Hat Games, LLC. We hope to continue making gorgeous games that you love to play. Thank you for your support.\nIf you're interested in ordering multiple copies and are curious about what to add for shipping, please follow this handy chart below. If you are ordering multiple copies of the game please remember to add the proper shipping into the cost of the pledge. If you would like to add an additional copy or copies to an existing pledge, use this chart to determine how much extra to add to your pledge.\nSponsor Names\nOne of the amazing things about Kickstarter is that it allows the many to make the dreams of the few come to life. At the $100 and $125 pledge level we offer backers the chance to sponsor a card, much like a piece of art in a museum. The Kickstarter edition of Vye will display the sponsor names on the cards (See example below). The names are integrated well with the rest of the card making them both elegant and unobtrusive to players.\nWhen you zoom in, the name looks like an etched glass plaque that\u2019s been screwed into the card. It makes the card look like a museum piece.\nWe\u2019re confident this will look elegant and we are testing it with actual cards to make sure the quality is up to our standards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThankfully, Vye as a game is pretty much done. That leaves the hard part - printing & fulfillment. \n\nPrinting: We're going with Magicraft for our printing service.

In this update, we\u2019ll take a more detailed look at the tokens.\nAs we played the first edition of Vye with co-workers, family, friends, and at FLGS tables in various cities (where we met some awesome and enthusiastic people!), we started to notice a trend in the execution of the game from a component perspective - specifically that, under some lighting conditions, we could not see the black tokens on the cards and it could be challenging to tell the blue from the black tokens. Additionally, as we encountered players with various forms of color vision, we discovered our token colors didn\u2019t hold up well. So, we decided to change things."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Introduction to the Second Edition of Vye", "update_content": "Hello, faithful supporters of Vye! This is Doug Woolsey and, over the next few weeks, I will be talking about some of the art and production changes you\u2019ll see in the upcoming Second Edition of Vye.\nWhen our supply of the first edition of Vye was getting low in the summer of 2015, we knew we needed to get another run produced as soon as possible. We began talking with our printing partner, BangWee, to gather cost and timeline information, and tried to figure out how much of our game we could alter for the second printing. We knew that, at a minimum, there were some rulebook changes we wanted to make and we wanted to do something, if possible, about the serious problem we were having with the token colors. The cost of the changes both in manufacturing and time started a larger conversation about what changes a second printing of Vye really needed. We identified a number of core things about the game and its components that we felt needed change and realized that, if we made all of the changes we wanted, not only would we produce a better game than the already great game we had made, but that there would be enough changes that we needed to starkly identify it as different from the first edition. Thus, the second edition was born. We had our list of design, art, and production changes, we chose a chunk of time for the production of the list, and we began working through the items meeting weekly to discuss our progress."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Second Printing!", "update_content": "Greetings and salutations, my fine crowdfunding affectionados.

You'll hunt monsters and cook with magic in a competition like no other!\nThe campaign has ended, but you can preorder Battle Chef Brigade HERE! On top of that, for a limited time, the physical rewards will be available on BackerKit! Note: do not preorder if you're already a backer!\nYou can also join our journey on Twitter, Facebook and the Trinket Newsletter! Thank you all so much, Battle Chefs!\nMagic and cooking fit together perfectly in so many ways. Imagine fire knives that slice AND sear, mystical ingredients, and chefs' spells whirling around immaculate dishes.\nCooking in games is always a simple affair, represented entirely by minigame or crafting mechanics. Not so in Battle Chef Brigade. Here, you decide what dishes to make. Each elimination round of the Battle Chef Royale will pit you against an opposing chef in a competition to wow the judges with your tasty dishes and culinary skills and spells.\n Read more about Ziggy in Update #10!\n Consoles?\nAfter a lot of deliberation, we've decided not to add WiiU, PS4, 3DS, or Vita stretch goals yet. We want to keep our focus on making the game the absolute best it can be. More playable chefs, more environments, voice over, epic summoning spells, and a new game mode are the next steps Battle Chef Brigade needs to become the amazing game we all envision. Since we're only three developers, we don't want to make giant promises far in advance. We want to finish building a phenomenal game for you before spreading it across more platforms.\nThat said, you can rest assured that our goal is to bring Battle Chef Brigade to consoles and handhelds. We're now a licensed Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft developer AND we're using the Unity3D game engine. That means that when the time is right to bring BCB to consoles, we'll be in excellent shape to do so. In fact, the game already supports PS4 and Xbox One controllers on PC! We love our consoles and really want to play Battle Chef Brigade on them :)\nOf course, after this campaign we'll keep you updated on Battle Chef Brigade's progress and will want your feedback about which platforms you want to play on next!\nCheck out Update #9 for more information about Add-Ons and how to increase your pledge!\nBattle Chefs stock their pantries by hunting monsters in the Arena! Monsters abound, each with their own dangers and ingredients.\nUnique Style - Chefs have their own hunting abilities and upgrades. Control Mina\u2019s whirling knives, Thrash\u2019s blood-hungry sword, and Kirin\u2019s mechanical traps!\nWild Monsters - Ingredients aren't just sitting on the shelf in Battle Chef Brigade! Each monster can drop different cuts of meat but only the most precise chefs get the best ones.\nEcology - The monsters are part of an ecosystem that you can influence and upset. You can feed the birds to get more eggs, but letting the other monsters snack on them might be very dangerous.\nPlayers must concoct unique dishes before running out of time in each round. Carefully season, sauce, and transform your ingredients to win the adulation of the judges.\nCreativity - You\u2019re in charge of deciding what dishes to create! Be mindful of the round timer and the judges' picky tastes. If you want to serve pan-seared dragon shank with raw squid stomach, go right ahead. Keep in mind that not everyone likes uncooked seafood or even dragon meat!\nSpells - The best meals are made with skill AND magic. Accelerate cooking times with an inferno, super-season a dish, and swap tastes and textures. Eat your own dishes to regain health and mana - just make sure they're edible first!\nJudging - The sternest gourmands, from meat-loving Orcs to diet-obsessed Elves, will be tasting your dishes. Keep their gustatory preferences in mind and make sure not to serve them any uncooked, burnt, or over-seasoned food.\nUse your chef's individual skills and personality to win the judges' favor. Battle Chef Brigade stirs together celebrity chefs and fantasy characters to produce its quirky cast.\nMina - Fast and Fearless! Mina\u2019s inexperience sometimes leads her into culinary danger, but she\u2019s got the speed to get any dish back on track.\nThrash - Powerful and Brazen! When your sword thirsts for meet, feed it. Thrash\u2019s blade increases in power when given meat and can then be used for all manner of explosive Orc magic.\nKirin - Sly and Scientific! Beware the technological tricks and traps of the Elves. Precision is the name of Kirin\u2019s game.\nZiggy - Twisted and Undead! His muscles may be decaying, but he can summon sous skeletons and spirits to pick up the slack.\nCezar - Stout and Stubborn! Cezar might be tough to get moving but his mighty cleaver is ready to decapitate any beast.\nAnd More - Unique and memorable characters are at the core of Battle Chef Brigade, so there are more to come. Your support can help us expand the playable and supporting cast!\nMina, Thrash, and Kirin will be playable at launch. The rest of the chefs will compete against you and take on big roles in the story. We'd love for your favorite chef to be playable and your support can help us reach our goal of making all the chefs playable!\nDuring the tournament, you\u2019ll have opportunities to upgrade your chef and tools!\nCookware - Custom tools are your most important allies in the kitchen. Larger pots and pans are necessary for cooking huge ingredients while other special cookware can give your food crucial bonuses.\nSpecialty Tools - Unique equipment like a Pasta Cutter, Pie Tin, or Wok can help transform mundane ingredients into fantastic dishes.\nSpells - Each chef can learn new spells for the Kitchen and Arena during the tournament. Spells range from super-powered attacks to dish-saving cooking aids.\nSound design and music are key parts of the Battle Chef Brigade experience. Sound effects in particular are critical to grounding our fantasy monsters and cooking with the real world.\nIn fact, gaining the means to continue paying our Sound Designer, George Hufnagl, is one of the reasons this Kickstarter exists. He's already done a phenomenal job crafting the game's soundscape, from bushes rustling in the Forest Arena to the Dragon's flame-throwing roar. Here's an in-depth sound design walkthrough of an old prototype from George.\nWe tasked Tom Dunkin with composing a few songs for the demo and Kickstarter. With funding, we'll be expanding this list a lot! Per-chef themes and context-sensitive dynamic music are two audio features we're really excited about.\nFull Release - Battle Chef Brigade will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The full release is planned for multiplatform distribution on Steam and as a DRM-free download through the Humble Store.\nBeta Access - We will be releasing a pre-release build of Battle Chef Brigade for feedback using Steam Early Access or the Humble Store.\nOther Platforms - Battle Chef Brigade is also a great fit for consoles and some handhelds. Based on time, your interests, and the success of this campaign, we\u2019re hoping to spread BCB to more platforms!\nWe quit our game industry jobs because we wanted the creative freedom to make something awesome. We released two tiny mobile games soon after forming Trinket, including the very well received Color Sheep. Now we're ready to tackle the game we really quit our jobs to make: Battle Chef Brigade.\nWe've self-funded BCB for over a year now. We spent a lot of time prototyping the creative Kitchen mode, since it\u2019s the toughest design challenge. These prototypes were invaluable for nailing down which aspects of cooking could be nicely abstracted into clear, fun mechanics and which were just too clunky. It\u2019s too bad scratch-and-sniff monitors never took off.\nOn the programming side, we've been able to keep building on our years of industry experience. Integrating new characters, foods, and chef challenges will be a straightforward process since we've been preparing for them all along. We invested a good chunk of our time building a robust combat system that integrates into our animation tools.\nOur biggest remaining tasks are related to our illustrated, hand-animated art style. There are very few shortcuts to creating hand-drawn animations and environments. Our tools help smooth out the process, but each chef and monster still requires a lot of Photoshop time! We'll use some money from this campaign to contract more artists when necessary.\nWe'll be updating backers with our progress regularly, especially on our Dev Blog, TIGSource, and Twitter! Open development and community are really important to us!\nDigital Download copy of BATTLE CHEF BRIGADE for PC, MAC, and LINUX (DRM-free + Steam key)\nA stunning digital ART BOOK PDF, chock-full of concept art, sketches, progression images, and details from Battle Chef Brigade's development.\nThe digital SOUNDTRACK, guaranteed to transport you into the rich world and delightful mood of Battle Chef Brigade.\nEARLY ACCESS to the BETA and access to BACKER FORUMS AND POLLS! Be the first to play Battle Chef Brigade and to help steer its development!\nYour chefs will discover BACKER-ONLY ITEMS in the tournament. The items will include a COOKWARE SET, a SECRET SAUCE, and a SCROLL, each more mysterious and powerful than the last! Your dishes, tools, and chefs will have that special something that no one else has! Note: these are not pay-to-win items. They'll look cool and deepen the experience, but won't make the game unfair to players without them.\nYou get a glorious Battle Chef Brigade T-Shirt and Poster combo. Your friends will be twice-baked with envy when they come upon your battle-ready form and fortress.\nT-Shirt Design\nWe'll work with you to bring a monster from your imagination to life! Over the course of a few Skype/Hangouts/Phone calls, you'll share your vision, review concept art, and assist in naming your monster.\nWe\u2019ll work with you to create an illustration of you as a BATTLE CHEF BRIGADE VETERAN. You'll provide a picture of yourself (or someone worthy of immortalizing) and suggestions for what fantasy race you'd like to be. Our Creative Director Eric will then draw you in an epic pose that will be used in-game and a trailer to introduce and explain the history of the Battle Chef Brigade. We'll also send you the image so you can print it or use it as an avatar image across the web!\nWe\u2019ll work with you to create a CELEBRITY GUEST JUDGE in the game. We\u2019ll need a picture, some of your favorite and least favorite foods, and what sort of hungry fantasy character you'd like to be (orc, wizard, elf, etc). We'll then transform you into an awesome animated in-game judge, ready to mock and praise players' creations!\n                                                                    The three of us met in 2009 while working for Disney Interactive\u2019s Wideload Games. Over the next three years we collaborated on Disney\u2019s Guilty Party (Wii), Avengers Initiative: Hulk (iOS / Android using Unity), and a host of unannounced Disney projects.\nIn 2012, we quit to form Trinket Studios, where we quickly built up a handful of games and prototypes. Color Sheep and Orion\u2019s Forge were released to wide acclaim in early 2013, after which we began work on Battle Chef Brigade!\nTom Eastman @TrinketTom   (President + Programming + Design)\nIt\u2019s always been Tom's plan to start an indie studio that makes unique, fun games. The path to BCB and this Kickstarter wound through a lot of ugly games in high school, Dartmouth College Computer Science, internships at Garage Games and Wideload Games, and a few years at Disney Interactive. He's thrilled to finally have everything lining up for Trinket!\nEric Huang @TrinketEric   (Creative Director + Design)\nEric grew up as a daydreamer heavily influenced by all the games he watched his older brothers play. Fighters, RPGs, and beat em ups sent him off in the trajectory he now travels, where animations, comics, and friendships have all added to his ever-growing love of creating. Though he may not be the most skillful or frequent gamer, the starry, childhood eyes he has for the medium only continue to be inspired and amazed.\nBen Perez @TrinketBen  (Programming + Design)\nBen is driven by opportunities to learn and grow as a game developer, which served him well while obtaining a B.S. in Computer Game Development from DePaul University. At Wideload/Disney, however, he felt more and more creatively constrained. With Trinket, he's elated to have so much freedom to focus on fun gameplay and satisfying programming problems.\nOf course, Battle Chef Brigade wouldn't be possible without a lot of help from our friends and contractors!\nGeorge Hufnagl @grhufnagl  (Sound Designer)\nGeorge's considerable experience and ebullient personality made him the ideal candidate to bring the audio of Battle Chef Brigade to life. You know you've got the right sound designer when you'd be thrilled to ship a game with just the sounds effects that come out of his mouth!\nTom Dunkin @tomaeusd  (Composer)\nTom is a self-taught musician from Washington State who composes purely by ear. His primary instrument is the guitar, but he dabbles in others such as the piano, trombone, theremin, stylophone, and anything else he can get his hands on. Most importantly, he went through a Mongolian throat singing phase in college.\nYann Blomquist  (Environment Artist)\nYann is a concept artist and illustrator currently residing across the sea in London. He attended the same college as Eric in New York, majoring in cartooning but not without some armorsmithing on the side. Though his friends may think he belongs to a time of knights, or a world of werewolves,Yann is perfectly content creating his darkly magical characters in his many sketchbooks while munching on some chocolate.\nChristine Chong @mayshing  (Colorist)\nChristine is a freelance illustrator, animator, and premium comic artist on inkblazers.com. Her passion is telling stories of others and her life through manga, comics, animation, illustration. She enjoys learning about different cultures, traveling, helping others, a good cup of tea and coffee and spending time with family and friends.\nMike Antonicelli @superfantastik  (Colorist)\nMike Antonicelli is an independent artist and animation consultant. His consulting company, Superfantastik CG Animation, has partnered to create games with Disney and Marvel, among other clients. Mike worked alongside Tom, Eric, and Ben at Wideload Games.\nTwitter: Follow and Tweet!\nFacebook: Like and Share!\nSign up: Our Newsletter!\nThank you so much for your support :)\nWe can't wait to serve you a perfectly-cooked Battle Chef Brigade!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGames are always hard to make and very complex, so there are rarely sure bets. Luckily, we've already been through plenty of development cycles, including together at Wideload / Disney. With multiple shipped titles under our belts, we've been preparing for Battle Chef Brigade for a long time.\n\nFinancial: We quit our jobs at Wideload/Disney so that we'd have creative freedom, but we made sure to save up first. On top of our savings, Color Sheep sales are still trickling in, though we'll be relying on this campaign to cover contractor and software costs. Here's the breakdown for our goal:\n30% Environment Art\n20% Colorists\n15% Sound Design\n10% Music\n10% Kickstarter/Payment Fees\n10% Taxes\n 5% Software Licenses\n\nSchedule: It's super hard to stick to a schedule in any creative project. We've already prototyped (and cut) lots of mechanics, smoothed out the art pipeline, and planned the remainder of the game. In addition, we've been working in Unity for over four years now, so we know which dead-ends to avoid. That said, we've set the estimated completion date to be further away than we anticipate. We're hoping to pleasantly surprise everyone with an early release, but games (especially Kickstarted ones!) don't have a great track record of finishing early.\n\nThank you for backing Battle Chef Brigade and supporting Trinket!

The Barkeep isn't a part of a Guild so there is no Virtus Card for this character. But crafty folks in the city can gain his trust by keeping his bar stool filled with thirsty patrons. And you can hold sway over the Tavern by making sure it's standing room only!\nLike the other promos, these cards will initially only be made available through this Kickstarter until a future time when they may become available at conventions or through other outlets. But before all that, they are for you first! Let's make the last few days count! Please keep sharing the project far and wide!\nSee update #8 for more info!\nUnlocked: The Party Pack Promos will now include 5 cards with two new versions of The Chiseler and The Herald with art by Jaqcui Davis! And the photo cards will still be included, too!\nThe Bloody Butcher removes 3 cards to the discard pile and will probably give you nightmares! The Chiseler looks vaguely familiar and will chisel away at other player's hands. And The Heralds?

This marker will be given to the first player so that when ever the game end is triggered all others players are given one more turn to prove their worthiness in the cause against the corrupt crown!\nUnlocked- We have great playtesters and backers and we heard your request loud and clear! Some of the Virtus Cards refer to the \"Castle\" and \"Harbor\" locations which are indicated on the locations cards by small signs pointing to the space next to the play area. For some people these signs were difficult to see and keep track of so we've decided to add two new cards to Fidelitas that can be placed to help these locations to be more clear. While players won't actually play to these locations but rather at locations next to these cards, we thought it would be helpful to make them stand out a bit more than they do in the current format. See the variant possible with these new cards herehttp://www.phantasiogames.net/2014/08/fidelitas-stretch-goal-2.html. This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include these cards right in the box!\n\nUnlocked- Meet the Brute, the Commander, the Scribe, and the Monk! Manu Forti is Latin for \"with a strong hand\" and these cards add new actions, new missions, new members of the least represented Guilds, and new ways to score. These new Virtus Cards can be played as an action or scored by gathering specific types of cards into your hand! These advanced cards provide an added layer that sows confusion and mistrust while providing another route to gain points that pave the way to victory as the leader of the revolution! This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include this expansion right in the box!\nIn Fidelitas, players take on the role of faithful citizens in a medieval city exerting influence in order to gain the credibility needed to lead the charge against the corrupt crown. Players play character cards to various locations that make up the city in order to meet conditions of hidden objectives. Each type of character card is associated with a unique action that manipulates cards in the game; use the Butcher to bully other characters to new locations, use the Student to gain more cards, use the Soldier to keep the peasants from loitering too long.\nIn this game where keen maneuvering is key, attentiveness to the opposition may uncover hidden motives that seek to foil your bid for power. The first player to gain a certain number points depending on the number of players is determined worthy to lead the revolt, and also wins the game.\nFidelitas is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up and plays in 20-30 minutes. The game is designed by Jason Kotarski (The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) and Philip duBarry (Revolution!, Courtier, Canalis, Kingdom of Solomon).\nWatch Rahdo's Gameplay Runthrough here:\nWelcome to Fidelitas! In a city you\u2019ve never heard of that\u2019s far too difficult to locate on a map, during a time long before you or anyone you know were born, a cohort of faithful citizens gathered to put plans in motion to take the power back from the political elite whose so-called \u201cleadership\u201d led to nothing more than inequity and discontent among the people. But instead of formulating a plan for revolution, they drank too much ale and forgot what they were gathering for in the first place.\nBut thanks to their digression, now it\u2019s your turn to pick up where they left off\u2026before the over-indulgence, of course!\nPhoto by Scott King (ScottKing.info)\nFidelitas is a card game with a small footprint that packs a big punch!\nFidelitas will include:\n50 Virtus Cards (characters)\n20 Missio Cards (hidden goals)\n5 Location Cards \nFull-color rulesheet with illustrations and examples\nAll this will fit in a small, rigid two-part box for maximum portability!

So although it isn't a \u201ctake that\u201d kind of game it has a gruffness that involves a lot of social gaming without actual being a social game.\" - Scott from ScottKing.Info\nCheck out Scott King's full preview here!\nCheck out Philip's interview with JR from The Nerd Nighters:\nListen to Jason talk about the journey into publishing here!\n                                                                                        \"The game is quick and fun for two to four players and pulling off a come-from-behind victory is one of the best parts of this game.\"-Ken Grazier, Geek-Craft.com\nRead the full review here!\n \"For anyone looking for a short length game which offers fun and engaging decisions in a small package, look no further.

We have plans to add value to Fidelitas that we think you will really appreciate. We're not talking about \"doo-dads\" and \"whatsits\" here. WE ARE TALKING ADDED VALUE!\nWe have several stretch goals in mind that have been developed and tested. And we hope to hit them all! But know that if we do, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe  that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.\nThat being said, we'll be listening close to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the brilliance that comes our way.\nWe need your help spreading the word far and wide so we can continue hitting our goals!\nSee Update #3 for more details!\n\n  See Update #4 for more info!\nSee Update #5 for more info!\n       See Update #5 for more info!\nSee Update #6 for more info!\n                         See update #8 for more info!\nSee Update #10 for more info!\n       See Update #12 for more info!\nIf you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the Rules PDF RIGHT HERE! We're currently editing the rules to make them as clear as possible before sending them off to our brilliant graphic designer who make them look super snazzy. But in the meantime, this rough draft rule set will give you a better feel for the ins and outs of Fidelitas. \nThe rules are hosted on BoardGameGeek and will require a free account to download. But if you like games, BGG is the place to be so head over there now to get plugged into the world-wide gaming community! \nIf you've read the rules and are still on the fence pledging $5 or more will gain to you early access to the Print & Play version of Fidelitas!

The low price point of this game should keep these charges to a minimum.\nJason Kotarski and Philip duBarry are game designers from the Midwest who met on the internet. They thought it would be cool to work on a game together. Neither of these stand-up-fellas had ever designed a game in collaboration with another designer before. And even though it can be difficult to give up some control in order work with another human being, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They probably learned something in the process. It may have even been kinda fun. Fidelitas is the result of more than a year of emailing, developing, and playtesting. They'd love it if you'd pledge your support for the fruit of their labors.\nJaqui Davis is an illustrator from the U.K. who's done beautiful work in the tabletop game space that includes contributions to: Belle of the Ball, Euphoria, Epic Resort, and Skyway Robbery.\nDarrell Louder is a graphic designer living in Delaware.

Many of you have expressed your hope that we would find a way to make this film even if this campaign didn't reach its goal, and we intend to do exactly that. We're already exploring other avenues to allow us to begin production, but we still want you, our first backers, to be involved. So head on over to our official site and sign up so we can keep you updated \u2014 you don't want to miss what we're working on!\nPlease visit our website for more information and future updates:\nwww.infinitybladechronicles.com\nWe are going to produce a live-action short film (roughly 25 minutes long) based on the story and characters from the blockbuster video game franchise, Infinity Blade. Some have created artwork inspired by this game, even published novels and gorgeous animated shorts, but this will be the first production set in the Infinity Blade universe using real locations and live performers.\nWhile this is an independent project, we do have full permission and cooperation from Chair Entertainment and Epic Games, the creator and publisher of the Infinity Blade series, to ensure we can make a film with the highest production standards possible and remain faithful to the vision that millions of players the world over know and love.\nFor those that might not have played the game already (and you're missing out! go download it from the iOS App Store), Infinity Blade is set in a distant post-apocalyptic future, and follows a man named Siris on his quest to defeat an elite group of immortals know as the Deathless, with the only known weapon capable of ending an immortal\u2019s life, the Infinity Blade. During his quest, Siris discovers that not only is he himself immortal, but he was once the worst Deathless of them all.\nA New Chapter\nThe screenplay for this short film has already been written by Josh Aker and Kyle Logan, and while it deals with characters and settings from the game, we chose to focus on specific events in Siris' life, with details not seen in the original game, its sequels, or the novels. Some of those details include the battle of the Plains of Koroth, how Siris lost his memory, why Siris and Raidriar couldn't escape the Vault of Tears, the discovery of the quantum identity pattern, and even how the Infinity Blade itself actually works.\n  Kris Holden-Ried \u2013 RAIDRIAR\nAmrita Acharia \u2013 ISA\nChristopher Judge - THANE\nWe have more roles yet to be formally filled, including that of Siris. Some are still in negotiations and can't be revealed just yet (we'll post updates here as soon as they're finalized). Some will only be cast if we hit our stretch goals!\nA.K.A. \"where does all the money go?\"\nThere are a billion different ways to make a movie, and no two approaches are the same. The quality of the resulting film can vary for so many reasons, but a simple rule of life applies to film as well: \"you get what you pay for\". And when you're making even just a short film based on Infinity Blade, with tens of millions of players worldwide and a reputation for stunning visuals, you just can't cut any corners. We knew we had to go big or stay home. So in addition to the expenses of hiring a first-rate cast, here are the key areas of production where your pledges will be spent:\nLocations\nWe will be portraying several iconic locations from the Infinity Blade universe to tell Siris\u2019 story, like Drem's Maw and the Plains of Koroth. We have scouted many of them already in the stunning landscapes of remote Utah wilderness.\nSet Construction / Miniatures\nWe will be creating a life-size Vault of Tears on a massive soundstage, where many of the key scenes occur. Our goal is to use staged sets and miniatures for a majority of the scenes (as opposed to shooting all the action on nothing but green-screens and inserting our actors into a fully-digital world). \nUsing practical effects with real hand-made sets is very time-intensive, but we believe it to be the most effective way of pulling the characters out of the virtual world of the Infinity Blade video game and into a convincing, visceral live-action experience. Nothing looks quite as realistic as real objects, under real light, captured in a real camera.\nVisual Effects / CGI\nThe Infinity Blade franchise has many industry awards for its groundbreaking graphics on the iOS platform. To translate the look and feel of the game into a film production worthy of its inspiration, a large portion of the budget will go towards top-notch visual effects. And we mean substantially large. It's easily the largest portion of our budget. This is a futuristic science-fiction story after all, with characters, settings, battles, creatures and more that have to be animated. Quite simply, the more money we raise, the more content we can create, and the more man-hours we can afford for modeling, animating, and rendering the complex fantasy universe of Infinity Blade.\nWhile writing the script, we were extremely mindful of where to include the need for special effects. We did this not only to optimize our special effects budget but also to strategically use special effects to make the visual experience more immersive and faithful to the original game \u2013 while avoiding extraneous use of CGI where live-action filming would better serve the story.\nTo achieve these goals, we will have the deep cinematic experience of Rob Au and Jarom Sidwell (previously with Rhythm & Hues and Weta Digital) producing our digital effects. Their experience working on movies including Avengers, Transformers, Avatar, X-Men and more, will ensure a level of quality rarely seen in fan-funded video productions.\nCinematography\nMark Andersen will be our Director of Photography, bringing his professional talent, crew, and RED cameras shooting in 6K. What the heck does that mean? It\u2019s going to look AWESOME! Even when viewed at lower resolutions (like the typical hi-def 1080p), the use of such a high resolution format in capture and throughout the filmmaking process results in a much better final product.\nArmor / Costumes\nDavid Powell of Powell Arts Workshop, a third-generation leatherworker will be creating the costumes for our characters, using a combination of traditional and modern fabrication techniques to produce the hybrid medieval / futuristic styles of armor seen in Infinity Blade.\nMusic\nJosh Aker, the creator of this project, also happens to be the composer of the entire Infinity Blade series' soundtrack. This means that our musical score will be absolutely true to the musical and emotional experience of the games you've played for years. Josh will be joined by Will Calhoun (Living Colour), adding a wealth of percussive creativity to the original music in this production. Also contributing to the music is Tina Guo, a stunning performance artist, and solo cellist on the soundtracks to Sherlock Holmes, Iron Man 2, and many more.\nBy pledging your support, you make all this possible. We've planned and prepared all we can up to this point with no funding at all, just months of time, sweat, and our best hopes \u2013 but we can't produce the kind of video that we know the fans of Infinity Blade would expect, on hopes and dreams alone. Making any film takes a small village of talented people, and we're not just making any film, we're bringing the world of Infinity Blade to life for the first time. That's a tall order, and we'll need every dollar we can ask from you \u2014 whether you are fans of the game who have been swiping and slashing your iPhones screens for years, you love scifi fantasy, short-film fanatic, or just a repeat kickstarter contributor \u2014 to cover all the production costs. We might have the blessing of the game's creators, but we're on our own financially. That's why we're asking for your help. Rather than waiting years for some big movie studio to green-light an Infinity Blade feature, we have the opportunity, together, to make it happen now. Your pledge is the only piece missing in this picture. Everything else is in place, ready for you to give us the green light!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor any film, casting is a crucial component, but one that is often very hard to predict.

This Kickstarter campaign has been created to bring that expansion to your lab table, as well as allow us to bring the second edition of the base game of Compounded to all those who have yet to experience the joy of science!\nThe Geiger Expansion gives experienced scientists even more to consider in the lab with the introduction of radioactive elements and compounds. Scientists will have to keep a close eye on the Geiger counter, because as productivity in the lab increases, so does the chance for radioactivity levels to soar dangerously high.\nThe Geiger Expansion introduces a new, interactive paradigm to the base game of Compounded, as players will now sometimes have to work together to eliminate or reduce the threat of radioactivity. Of course, those players with a propensity for causing chaos will have even more methods at their disposal, ensuring that each game will be exciting and dynamic.\nThe Geiger Expansion will be chock full of new things to add to the level of fun - and danger - in your lab.\nFirst off, there are three new elements that will affect the game in different ways. \nRadium is a rare element that is pulled from the elements bag like the six base elements. It can be stored on a scientist's work bench and used to complete radioactive compounds, or processed into Lead that is used in completing other valuable compounds. Finally, Polonium is an extremely radioactive element that, when pulled from the element bag, increases the radioactivity levels in the lab. More Polonium is added to the bag as scientists make progress in completing elements moving along the score track. \nNext, the Geiger counter is used to track the lab's radioactivity levels. As the levels progress, elements are tainted by the radioactivity every round and a few are removed from the elements bag. When radioactivity reaches a certain level, lab fires break out \u2013 and if radioactivity levels grow too high, it is too dangerous for scientists to work and the lab is shut down. Scientists may work together during the game to help manage the radioactivity levels, or create a bit of mayhem by selectively completing compounds that raise the radioactivity.\nThe Geiger Expansion also includes new compounds that may grant scientists additional tools - like Calcium Hydride and Ethenone - or require Radium and Lead to complete - like Radium Nitride or Lead Sulfide. Stay tuned for project updates that will show off new cards with new Chemical Reactions and new abilities!\nFinally, scientists will receive a work bench extension with room to store the new tools they may acquire during the game. Scientists can track the decay chain of any Radium that they are decaying into Lead. At one point in the process Helium is released, which scientists may use as a Wild Element during the game. \nWhat's included:\n- 47 new Compound Cards\n- Thick punchboard Geiger counter\n- 12 Helium tokens\n- 8 Radiation tokens\n- 2 new Lab Tools (total of 8 new punchboard tokens)\n- 25 Elements (12 Radium, 8 Lead, 5 Polonium)\n- 5 Work Bench extensions\nAnd, yes, everything inside the Geiger Expansion will fit inside the main Compounded box!\nIn case you're not familiar with the original base game of Compounded, it was successfully funded on Kickstarter in February of 2013. Because of the help of wonderful Kickstarter backers, we at Dice Hate Me Games were able to produce 5,000 units. Compounded was released for retail sale in November of 2013, and sold out in April of 2014 (except for a few personal copies which are available in the ALL THE THINGS RIGHT NOW pledge level). With your help and support of this Kickstarter campaign, we can afford to print a second edition of the game, ensuring that even more gamers will be able to bring Compounded to their lab table.\nCompounded is a game about building chemical compounds through careful management of elements, a fair bit of social play and trading, and just a bit of luck. In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others \u2013 or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.\nAlthough Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools and even favors \u2013 if there is truly honor among chemists!\nIf you'd like to know more about Compounded you can check out a gameplay video, rules and more at dicehatemegames.com.\nThis mini-expansion for Compounded that introduced a bit more chaotic fun to the lab was a promotional for backers of the original Compounded Kickstarter project. We have since sold or given them away as convention promos, and recently made the mini-expansion available for purchase online. For every pledge that includes a copy of the base game of Compounded, we'll include a copy of Chemical Chaos, as well!\nAchieving our base funding goal now ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish the Geiger Expansion and the second edition of Compounded with the quality that we all have come to expect. Now that we've exceed that goal, we can bring out stretch goals!\nStretch goal number one has been passed! We'll now add 10 wooden Flame Cubes to every Geiger Expansion box! A lot of you were clamoring for a flame token upgrade in the first campaign, and it was always our intent to revisit the idea. But with so many other great stretch goals we never managed to find the time for these cubes to come back around. \nFlame Cubes were in the very first prototype for Compounded, and they\u2019ve always been a bit of a sentimental component for us. By putting them in the Geiger box it will allow us to upgrade components for the base game for both old and new owners of Compounded. \nWe've reached stretch goal #2! Since we've reached $55K, we'll make sure the wooden Flame Cubes have a companion piece - wooden Radiation Tokens! \n These tokens are used to mark radioactive compounds when they get a hot spike, much like when volatile compounds are exposed to a lab fire. Unlike when volatile compounds explode, when radioactive compounds get two Radiation Tokens, they are flipped upside down to create \"dead zones\" in the Research Field, limiting the amount of compounds that are available for completion. \nIn addition to the Radiation Tokens, we'll also add one new compound to the Geiger Expansion - Calcium Nitride. \n It's a tough little compound to complete, but when you do you receive 7 points and activate the Magnet Chemical Reaction which allows you to select any available tool from the tool section on the scoreboard. It can prove to be a pretty powerful and flexible reaction after you invest all that Calcium.\nWe've also reached our next milestone! \nSince we reached $65K, we can kick Radium and Polonium up a notch. How? Well, since they\u2019re radioactive, it\u2019s only fitting that they would glow in the dark! That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve checked with our manufacturer, Panda Games, and they can make those gems truly radioactive. It doesn\u2019t exactly add to gameplay, but it sure does pour on the theme.\nWe've reached our next stretch goal of $70K! We can now give every backer that pledges for GEIGER and above the promotional Methamphetamine Lab Partner card. This might explain our mysterious reference to something Heisenbergian in our stretch goal teasers.\nThis card will be a Kickstarter promotional that each backer may opt to receive as an extra, in addition to the expansion and game. That means that gamers who would rather not include Methamphetamine in their pledges will be asked if they\u2019d like to receive it in the survey that will be sent out after funding. This card will NOT be included in the base game or the Geiger Expansion - it is simply a promotional item for those that would like it.\nOur next stretch goal is super cool - and we've reached it! We can now create a Geiger counter with fully-movable dial!\nThe Geiger counter will now be comprised of four parts - the main Geiger counter punchboard, a dial made of punchboard, and a plastic connector that snaps the punchboard parts together. Scientists will now be able to move the dial instead of a token whenever the radiation levels rise in the lab! This is something we always wished we could add, and with this new stretch goal, we can finally do it.\nWe're pretty excited for our next stretch goal, as we have been toying with the idea of this since the Kickstarter campaign for the base game last year. We have always wanted to highlight some of the chemistry heroes throughout history, so since we reached $90K, we'll produce a pack of 5 Scientist cards for the Geiger Expansion box! These cards will be the same size as the Lab Partners cards, only oriented vertically. \nIn this variant, each player will randomly receive a scientist at the beginning of the game. Each scientist has a special ability that will benefit that particular player, as well as a global ability that affects the entire lab. We've shown you two of the scientists and their abilities above, and we'll be highlighting the other scientists over the next few days in updates. For the time being, we'll just tease to the other scientists in the expansion: Michael Faraday (invented the Bunsen Burner), Joseph Priestley (credited with the discovery of Oxygen), and John Dalton (pioneer of atomic theory and chemical reactions). Feel free to speculate on their powers and global abilities in the comments! Also, please bear in mind that the portrait art above is just placeholder art, for now. If we pass the stretch goal, we'll be contracting an artist for custom portraits of the scientists.\nSince we posted the last stretch goal, everyone has been super excited about the Scientist cards, and clamoring for more. We aim to please; If we pass $100K by the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll give everyone five more scientists! \nIn addition to Geiger and Mendeleev above, we\u2019ll also include cards for Rosalind Franklin (discovered molecular structures of DNA and viruses), George Washington Carver (revolutionized agricultural chemistry), and Emil Erlenmeyer (contributor to theory of structure and inventor of the Erlenmeyer flask). We\u2019ve enjoyed reading everyone\u2019s speculations as to the powers of the last scientists, so feel free to discuss what you think these other three might contribute to the game!\nWe have more stretch goals planned so keep spreading the news and let\u2019s keep the lab growing!\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a complex game. You don\u2019t need to know anything about chemistry to play it, at all. And I think it really fits a niche in which there are not enough games being put out there\u2026 This is a good game. I very much recommend it.\u201d - Tom Vasel (The Dice Tower)\n\u201cI love it! I haven\u2019t thought positively about chemistry since\u2026 high school.\u201d Eric Dow, Critical Plays (Crits Happen)\n\u201cYes, kids, high school chemistry can be fun\u2026 we like Compounded so much we\u2019re ranking it all the way up to the #2 spot (on their Top Ten Games list).\u201d Emily Duhigg (Getting Higgy With It)\n\"Compounded is a medium weight game full of scientific brilliance. The tag line on the box, \"Better gaming through Chemistry,\" sums it up beautifully. I couldn't have said it better myself. This game is fun for scientist of almost every age. I highly recommend it.\"Gaming Bits \n\"This has to be one of the most thematic games I have ever played. You really feel like a scientist gathering elements and creating compounds to complete experiments.\"J. Chris Miller\n\"The end result is a game that appeals to fans of lightweight resource management, families looking for a new game night addition, or even a game to potentially assist in educating students about science in a fun way. It focuses less on deeply complex moves and more on showing that Euros can be thematically rich with widespread appeal. (Especially if that focus is on something as awesome as science.)\" Cardboard Republic\nWell, here we are again - at the precipice of another great adventure together. I am so excited to present the first, official, \"big box\" expansion for one of our Dice Hate Me Games titles. Especially so since Compounded has been so well-received since its general release late last year. \nThe past three years with everyone on Kickstarter and in the board gaming hobby have been absolutely amazing, and there is so much more in store as long as you all continue to come along for the ride. The Geiger Expansion not only expands on a great game \u2013 it also expands on the dream that is Dice Hate Me Games in so many ways, and I cannot wait to share it all with you. It has been an incredible journey because of all of our wonderful backers, and I appreciate each and every one of you, both old and new.\nLet's go make some magic - or science.

I\u2019ve been holding off on updating until I received confirmation that everything is solid - the good news is, we\u2019ve worked it all out. The bad news is that, because the file issue went unresolved until factories closed for Chinese New Years, things have fallen behind.

Check out the End Game Games website for post-funding options.\nThe game uses polyhedral gaming dice to represent factions of warring energy beings. The core mechanic of the game has players make a single move each turn which they can build into a chain of movement allowing you to move your fleet across the battlefield. Your hedrons will also gain access to dynamic powers, allowing you to use your fallen warriors to fuel more powerful attacks. You\u2019ll gain victory by showing you\u2019re the most powerful set of hedrons in the whole sector through dominating areas of space and destroying your opponent\u2019s hedrons.\nBest of all, this isn\u2019t game you\u2019re going to have to wait a year for. I designed Hedron with the goal of creating a game that you could actually print and play at home (as opposed to print, cut, cut, cut, glue and play), but this Kickstarter will also offer options to get a boxed game to your door within a few months. If you just want me to shut up and take your money, skip to the end for the Reward breakdowns.\nUPDATE: You can now add an extra set of dice, for a 3rd player, if you've pledged for the d10 reward tier and any reward tiers above it. Add $7 if you're from a country that isn't the United States of America. Add $13 if you're from the United States of America.\nHedron provides a pretty unique game experience. Each unit in Hedron is a completely contained physical object with all of it\u2019s necessary stats right there on the top of dice, no reference card or wound token needed, and the different sizes of dice make each unit subtly different.\nThe chain of actions that take up your turn is another element that sets the game apart. This lets the battlefield shift dynamically from turn to turn without having to worry about action points, initiative or activating your troops unit by unit. Hedron lets you engage your friends in space war, and wrap it up in under an hour, including setup time.\nThe other big thing is that Hedron is bucking the Kickstarter trend and steering clear of the traditional manufacturing route. Kickstarter has changed the games industry dramatically and has led to a lot of games being made that would have never seen the light of day otherwise, but it seems game designers now see making 1500 copies of a game in China as the only solution. I\u2019m following in the footsteps of many game designers before me and offering a game that uses common components so you get a big box game experience at a fraction of the price.\nI briefly explained the game in the main video, but I'm going to go through the complete ruleset in the videos below. You can also download the rules booklet. \nPart 1: The Chain\nThe Chain is at the core of Hedron's gameplay. It's a little bit of spatial problem solving that'll keep player's mind working between turns. Each turn you'll start by moving one hedron but if you land next to another friendly hedron, you'll also get to move it, creating a chain of movement that will launch your units across the battlefield.\nPart 2: Flux\nFlux transforms Hedron from an abstract strategy game into a dynamic space battle, turning seemingly empty areas of space into fluctuating battlegrounds of raging energy beings. Whenever one of your hedrons is destroyed, it is not removed from the game, it merely goes into flux, where it waits until you return it to play or tap into it's dynamic energy using Flux Cards.\nPart 3: A Playthrough\nThose are the rules, here's the game! The video below shows a complete 2 player game from start to finish.\nPlease note, this image does not necessarily represent final components or art\nAll backers above $5 will receive the fully unlocked digital Hedron.\n D12: Premium Chrome Hedron\n12 hex tiles for variable set up\n2 sets of polyhedral dice (basic single colour opaque dice to start with, final colours to be determined by popular vote)\n1 set of chrome polyhedral dice\n32 card Flux mini deck\nA game box\nPlays up to 3 players\nAlso, includes beta version and full digital Hedron\nAnd possibly more things!\nD10: Hedron with dice for 2\n12 hex tiles for variable set up\n2 sets of polyhedral dice (basic single colour opaque dice to start with, final colours to be determined by popular vote)\n32 card Flux mini deck\nA game box\nPlays up to 2 players, add another set for 3\nAlso, includes beta version and full digital Hedron\nAnd possibly more things!\nD8: Hedron Diceless\n12 hex tiles for variable set up\n32 card Flux mini deck\nA game box\nNo dice! Players will need to bring a 7-piece set of gaming dice to the table\nAlso, includes beta version and full digital Hedron\nAnd possibly more things!\nD6: Full Digital Hedron\nPlease note, this print-and-play is actually print and play. You can play the full version of Hedron for two players with two pieces of paper, a single cut, 2 sets of gaming dice and a standard deck of playing cards.\nThe digital print-and-play Hedron with all unlocked content\nIncludes (at the very least) all you need to play with 2, 3 and 4* players (both full colour and low-ink versions available)\nNo dice! Players will need to bring a 7-piece set of gaming dice to the table\nD4: Limited Digital Hedron\nDigital beta Hedron with low-ink player maps and mats for 2, 3 and 4* players\nJoin the dice party early to see how if it's your scene\nShawn Sharp, one half of the Smashing Plastic team, is a new reviewer on the YouTube block and was generous enough to sit down to a game of Hedron with me. Here\u2019s Shawn\u2019s thoughts:\nI was lucky enough to try a game of Hedron just as this Kickstarter went live. Hedron is a great little strategic game of cosmic bumper cars. Say hello to spacial awareness and good-bye to your dice collection. It plays quick but keeps you engaged right up to the end game as you collide, spike and explode your way through your opponent\u2019s best laid plans.\nPlease note, I have received no payment to endorse Hedron.\nJonathan Winter, of the Australian Tabletop Gaming Network, visited my local game group to do a hands-on preview:\nHedron is a fun and compact game that makes clever use of a familiar gaming apparatus. In many respects it reminds me of chess as it involves game-pieces of contrasting power levels that move around the game board eliminating each other. It is also reminiscent of King of Tokyo in that the centre of the game-board is useful for scoring points. The game is currently enjoying a successful Kickstarter campaign and I highly recommend backing this excellent product and supporting one of our most promising home-grown tabletop game designers.\nMichael of NVS Gameplays has also given us a video preview. The impression parts really gets started around 23:55. I should also note, Hedron is in no way a representation of how physics or science works. It is technobabble at best.\nDisclaimer: Michael has not yet received any chrome dice for his lovely work, but I gave him a couple of bucks to cover print-and-play materials, $4.20 CAD to be precise.\nThis Kickstarter won\u2019t let me pay myself an equitable wage for game design, but it will help me achieve my goal with this game, to get it played by as many people as possible. For the print-on-demand version of Hedron, I\u2019ve priced it to make it the best value of money I can for my backers which means a very slim profit margin. The bigger order I make, the more I can reduce the cost per piece. This also carries over to shipping to Australia, the more I order, the less I need to pay per piece. By supporting this Kickstarter you'll help to achieve the quantities I need to make this game a thing that exists in real life and not just in a dark, overlooked corner of the internet.\nHedron is 99% finished. It\u2019s gone through lots of iterations and playtests, including blind playtests, but this is my first published game, so I\u2019m releasing an almost finished beta version to all Kickstarter backers to pick up any flaws that I may have overlooked and to pick up any clarity issues with rulebook. I'll be collecting data from any willing early backers, as well as ongoing playtesters. Opening this up to everyone will give me the biggest and best sample size, so if you play the beta version, please add your play data to this Google spreadsheet. I'll use this to evaluate whether any player order advantage or end game problems have sneaked past our playtests and made it into the game, and to determine whether the final end game bonus is fair and correct.\nUPDATE: We're going to PAX AUS 2014! And we're going to be doing free pick-up there, so if you're going and are planning to have a little room in your bag, don't add shipping! I'll also be doing free delivery to several Brisbane game groups (Critical Mass Chermside, Critical Mass Indooroopilly and Gold Coast Board Games Club). If you'd like to add your group to the list, please leave a comment.\nHedron will be manufactured in the US using The Gamecrafter, a print-on-demand game manufacturing service. I've already received prototypes of Hedron and I'm happy with the quality, but it should be noted that the game will be digitally printed and you may notice a difference in finish than some manufactured games. I don't believe this impacts play at all (if I did I wouldn't be using their service). The hex tiles included are approximately the same thickness as Catan tiles (Mayfair version), and slightly heavier.\nWith The Gamecrafter, I'm able to design a game in Australia and get it delivered at a reasonable price to US backers, but unfortunately the price is less reasonable for non-US backers. If cost is an issue, please choose one of the digital reward levels (if cost isn't an issue, please choose one of the premium rewards levels).\nI'm sorry, this project is not EU-friendly (you may need to pay additional VAT or taxes). \nAs the campaign progresses, I'll be able to give you more stuff for mostly the same amount of money, these are called stretch goals. If we're able to meet the conditions below, we'll unlock the goals. Most of our goals will be focussed on the reward tiers, if we get the listed amount of backers at the matching rewards tiers, we'll unlock the goal.\nThe first stretch digital map pack adds a map for each player count with more Points Hexes, shifting the focus of the game more towards gaining and holding areas.\nThe second digital map pack introduces Current hexes, which will flow into the boxed game, as well, making this a reward for all backers. Current hexes will hurl your hedrons around the board opening up new strategies and more powerful chains.\nThe third digital map pack unlocks Shift hexes, which will flow into the boxed game, as well, making this a reward for all backers. Shift hexes allow you to shift hedrons at the end of your turn, giving you more versatility and potentially speeding up your march into enemy space.\nIf we get here, we'd just like to say WOW and THANK YOU. This is beyond the scope of what we planned for Hedron, but we want to reward our backers for all their support. If we get up to $3500, we're going to start developing a new team variant opening up better support for 4 players. The variant will be playable with the boxed version of Hedron and we'll create specific maps for our d6 backers. This will need to be properly developed and tested, meaning that it won't be ready when Hedron ships. Expect a release date of late 2014 / early 2015.\nOnce we get to 25 physical backers, we'll add in play mats to the boxed version of Hedron. This will give you some handy reference and somewhere to park your points tracker and your in flux hedrons.\nInternational backers usually get the short end of the stick from projects shipping out of the US, but the stick is pointing the other way for this stretch goal.  Backers outside of America, can add one more set of dice for $7, and Americans can add one more set for $13 (just add the amount to your pledge). It just so happens there won't be a significant increase to international shipping with the extra size and weight of the dice, so we're able to give our international friends a pretty good deal. Don't forget to give us your opinion about dice below!\nHedron will now ship with nicer dicer for everyone. We're still deciding exactly what dice, so if you're a backer, give us your opinion.\nEnd Game Games is mostly me, Jason Kotzur-Yang. I\u2019m based in Brisbane, Australia. I\u2019ve got an undergraduate degree in creative writing, a teaching qualification, a piece of paper saying that I can do graphic design and a passion for tabletop games. My current day job has marketing in the job title, but I\u2019m an experienced graphic designer who can make websites and design physical objects and get them printed. \nBut like a child, a board game can\u2019t be made by one man alone, and I\u2019ve been helped out heaps in the development by Australian gamers and friends who are generous with their time and brains. Special thanks go to lead playtester, Yao-ban Chan, who's spent a lot of dice moving around and rolling dice with me and making sudden changes to gameplay mid-game. And still beating me most of the time. Here\u2019s a list of the people to whose debt I am currently in, the list will hopefully be a lot longer by the end of August!\nSusan Kotzur-Yang, first tester and official wife; Anthony Sun, idea generator; Chen Reed and Yang Wong, runners of nets and rollers of dice; the Raup brothers; Benjamin Fox; the Critical Mass design group; attendees of TAGE and CanCon 2014; Allen Chang and Gold Coast Board Game Club; Michael Brown; the internet, specifically Boardgamegeek and r/tabletopgamedesign.\nExtra Credits\nThe music in the videos is Bacteria Love by Rolemusic.

This lets me actually focus on the important thing - the game. I\u2019ve done my research and my pricing with the physical rewards offered. The Gamecrafter are an experienced manufacturer (having just completed their 2nd Kickstarter campaign) and I've received prototypes of all the components, which are actually the exact same thing you'll be getting if you back at a physical reward level. There's a small amount of risk that the Gamecrafter's production schedule may become bloated or they might not have enough dice to fulfill the order. I've notified Gamecrafter of the campaign, and we'll be moving on to a different dice supplier if we have enough backers to get nicer dice. Due to the dynamic nature of the different rewards, there is a risk of me losing a dollar or two for the print on demand version of the games if there's less than 25 backers at these levels, but I'll still be able to deliver.\n\nI'm working with established creators to deliver the premium reward tiers. The chrome metal dice are already made and the steampunk metal dice are on their way, making this very low risk. These rewards will be fulfilled and shipped differently to minimise the risk of mix-ups and to make sure you get all your rewards as soon as they're ready. If for any reason, these creators are unable to deliver, I'll work with backers to make sure they got something nice and shiny in return for their generous support.\n\nThe graphic design of the game is mostly finished and I just need to put the final art together. As an experienced graphic designer, I\u2019ll be doing this myself, eliminating any risk of non-fulfilment by outside parties. The only way you won\u2019t get your game is if I\u2019m murdered, and since this is my first Kickstarter, I currently have no mortal enemies.\n\nThere is a small risk of currency fluctuations impacting the costs of the game, since I'll be funded in Australia dollars and paying for production in American dollars. This risk is offset by having digital backers (with no outside cost) and by reducing cost through increasing quantities. I'll be monitoring the exchange rate as we go but there won't be any issues unless there's major economic upheaval.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "The next frontier", "update_content": "Hi there!\nIt\u2019s been a little over a year since Hedron was funded and I\u2019m now just a few days into my new campaign for Ragnaroll, a dice-driven game of death and glory.

You're all doing wonderfully, I've received all the print surveys and we're good to go. I've also got all the art done, the dice on the way to the manufacturer and I'm just waiting for confirmation from the manufacturer before I press the big green button that says PRINT, so we're all on schedule. Good for us!\n\nHowever the manufacturer's production schedule has become very bloated, and that may throw the delivery date off. At the beginning of this project, the production schedule was 5 days and during the project it stretched out to 2 weeks, which was making things a little tight to get the physical games delivered when I was planning, which was supposed to be earlier than promised, before the beginning of November. The production schedule has now extended to 2 months. This should still get all US backers the game in November, but it might push international backers, including Australians, into December. No dates are 100% confirmed yet, I'll get back to you with a more firm delivery date once I've got a more firm delivery date. If you've requested PAX pick-up, it's looking likely that we'll miss the date. I knew this scenario was possible and I took the risk to offer free pick-up with full knowledge, so if we miss the date, it's my bad and you'll be getting free shipping, with my apologies.

They\u2019d been hired to steal data, but the bloody dissection tables & the occasional vat filled with murky liquid hadn\u2019t been part of the job description.\nOut of morbid curiosity, Rachel turned her gun-mounted flashlight onto the nearest vat. It was massive, at least two meters tall & filled with an opaque green fluid. She approached & peered into the murky depths. \"What could possibly be growing inside these?\" she whispered.\nSMACK!\nRachel stumbled back as she received a partial answer. A black claw, bigger than her head, had reached out of the liquid & slammed into the glass wall of the vat. Just as abruptly, it disappeared back into the depths of the tank.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Rach,\u201d Maximus grunted, barely glancing at the source of the disturbance. \u201cNothing can bust out of those vats. They\u2019re made of two-inch-thick transparent synth steel, it would take\u2026\u201d\nMax & Rachel\u2019s hearts simultaneously skipped a beat as they both heard the crunching noise of something breaking underneath Max\u2019s huge combat boots. Rachel swung her torch to the ground & saw scattered fragments of metal and glass.\n\u201cWhat's that stuff?\u201d she asked, glancing at her partner. Maximus hesitated before answering.\n\u201cTwo-inch-thick transparent synth steel.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFragged Empire is a tabletop RPG setting & rules, set in a far future 'post, post-apocalyptic' setting. Your people have survived 100 years of brutal tribalism & savagery & are just now emerging back into space.\nSet in the style of Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 film Alien, television series Firefly, Farscape & Blake's 7 & computer-based role-playing games Mass Effect & Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic.\nTo learn more: explore the Fragged Empire Website, download the Character Sheets & check out our YouTube channel, which includes Rules videos.\nPrices are in Australian Dollars (AUD): if paying in USD, remember your figure is likely to be lower on account of a favorable exchange rate in comparison to AUD.\n Core Rule Book: A high-quality, massive, 384 page, full colour, hardcover book. With everything you will need for players & game-masters (GM). The book will also include loads of art, short stories & more from the game universe.\nThe Antagonist Archive 1: A high quality, 140 page, full colour, hardcover supplement book. Jam packed with information about the darker side of the Haven System. With NPCs, faction and locations for your players to contend with.\nThe Antagonist Archive 2: Similar to the Antagonist Archive 1, but will be slowly built over multiple years until it is the same size as the Antagonist Archive 1. Every time we release a new book and expand this setting, we will add to this book. We will also be gathering ideas from our community and placing the best ones inside (with professional art, writing and editing).\nAdventure 'Let Sleeping Gods Lie': 40+ pages, Softcover, black and white interior. Ideal introduction to the Fragged Empire setting.\nAdventure 'Genetic Spectres': 40+ pages, Softcover, black and white interior. Ideal for low to mid level characters.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSetting primary themes: Cultural tension, biological technology & exploration.\nRules primary focus: Non setting specific rules (though it comes with a setting), 3d6 skill rolls, nonlinear character progression, long sandbox games & tactical miniature based combat.\nAfter expanding throughout the galaxy, terraforming millions of planets & creating electronic wonders beyond our imagination, humanity became apathetic & faced extinction due to Genetic Erosion. Unable to save themselves, they engineered a race to inherit their fallen empire: the Archons.\nRather than treading in the footprints of humanity, the Archons pushed into scientific fields that their creators had barely explored: genetic engineering & the creation of scores of new species, all in an effort to make the \u2018perfect\u2019 race.\nOver thousands of years, the Archons built a mighty empire & created hundreds of species. But they played favourites, lavishing their love & generosity on some while entirely neglecting others.\nEventually they created what they initially thought was the \u2018perfect \u2018 race, naming them Xion. When the Archons attempted to rescind the title of \u2018perfect\u2019 the Xion fought back. The Archons eradicated the Xion. That is, all but one, who escaped far into uncharted space.\nTwo hundred years later the lone Xion returned with its own genetically-engineered army (the Nephilim). The ensuing war lasted six years & spelled the destruction of the Archons, their created races & empire. Vindicated, the lone Xion again disappeared, abandoning its army. Small pockets of survivors were scattered across the galaxy, unknown & alone.\nNow, a century has passed since the Great Xion War & descendants of the survivors have started to emerge. They have begun to rediscover space travel & are just now making tentative contact with one another in a small star system named \u2018Haven\u2019. You are one of these descendants who find yourself stepping into so much unknown\u2026\nCorporation\nRejected by their creators (the Archons) as inferior, the Corporation (formerly known as Vargarti) have grown to love the Great Xion War as it freed them from an existence of insignificance & irrelevance. They are now eager to prove themselves. Not a nation in the classical sense, the Corporation is a massive corporate entity comprised of millions of smaller, affiliated business enterprises; a purely capitalistic society.\nKaltoran\nBorn with the genetic memories of their ancestors, Kaltorans are an innately gifted & flexible race. They are eager to make a new future for themselves, though they struggle with the \u2018genetic memories\u2019 of not only the Great Xion War but the extreme measures taken by their ancestors to survive it.\nLegion\nA physically imposing race, hastily created by the Archons to fight their losing war against Xion. The Legion now struggle to create a stable society & to find meaning with no war to fight. In recent times the Legion have formed a close economic relationship with the Corporation, acting as enforcers for hire.\nNephilim\nA junk-word term used to describe the diverse descendants of Xion\u2019s genetically engineered army. Created to wage war on the Archons & their creations, before being abandoned by their creator, Xion once the war was won.\nThe Nephilim have an eclectic, primal & often violent society that is supported by advanced biological technology. While publicly no longer loyal to Xion, their pursuit of genetic perfection at any cost is pervasive.\nFree Ambient Audio Files (created by www.tabletopaudio.com):\nNephilim Lab\nKaltoran Spacecraft\nLight, Fast & Flexible non Combat rules: We don't want rules to slow the role playing down.\nPlayer Creativity is Encouraged: We balance the math by telling you what roll needs to be made but not what skill needs to be used. Your approach to a problem will give you bonuses or penalties.\nEncouraging Player-Driven Goals: Help players be invested in your world.  NPCs\u2019 opinion of your character have a statistical effect on your stats; not everything has to be done for money. You can also be a merchant or scientist, plan trade routes or research new or forgotten technologies.\nTactical Personal & Spacecraft Combat. Build or modify your own Weapons & Armour.\nBuild your own Custom Equipment & Spacecraft. Will you make a gunship for fighting, a cargo ship for trading, create labs & workshops to modifying weapons or perform research or do a bit of everything? The choice is yours.\nSee an explanation of Spare Time Rolls, plus Research & Trade Goods:\n See an example of Character Creation:\nPlease see our YouTube page for more rules videos.\nNon Setting Specific Rules\nFragged Empire comes with a setting, but rules are flexible & robust enough to be adapted to almost any science fiction setting.\nSimple 3d6 Resolution System\nSkill rolls are done with a simple 3d6 +/- bonus or penalty vs a Difficulty Value or Target\u2019s Defense.\nNonlinear Character Progression\nCharacters have a pool of options available to them, with no set ability or equipment progression path. This allows Characters to quickly specialize or diversify & to create unique combinations of abilities & equipment to suit your play style.\nLow Level Characters can be a dangerous threat to high level Characters due to specialization. Even if two Characters have very similar Attributes, Skills or Equipment, they can function quite different due to Trait selections.\nChoose any path you want; Cunning Mercenary, Black Market Smuggler, Archeological Treasure Hunter or Power Mad Scientist. All are balanced.\nBest for Long, Sandbox Games\nFragged Empire works for short games but is in its element in long, sandbox-styled games.\nBeing in a post, post-apocalyptic setting, you will regularly have to make the most of what little resources you have, including balancing short-term & long-term options, making short-term sacrifices for long-term gain, & so on.\nTactical Miniature Combat\nFragged Empire presents intuitive, tactical combat where you will need to not only react to your environment (cover is your friend), but also to respond to your opponents\u2019 Actions. There are also optional rules for non-miniature based combat, if desired.\nPDF, pledge $20aud or more.\nWhen the project is complete, you will receive a PDF copy of the complete book & access to the PDF version via DriveThruRPG. This will allow you to freely download any future updated versions of the book.\nThe PDF will be available before the book.\nKS Exclusive Wallpapers.\nWe will be making up a full set of High Res wallpapers. These will remain exclusive to our backers for 6 months after we post out to all of our backers (then I will most likely just put them up on my website for free).\nAdventure: \"Let Sleeping Gods Lie\".\nExplore the remains of a (possibly) dead, ancient, biological Nephilim warship as it floats through space. This small adventure is ideal for new players and a great introduction to the Fragged Empire setting.\nWe have expanded this Adventure to now be 40+ pages long, and it will no longer be a KS Exclusive Adventure.\nReference PDF\nA handy PDF with Trait, Equipment & NPC stat blocks.\nPhysical Copy, pledge $75aud or more.\nFeaturing 384 pages, full colour, offset printed, hardcover book. An awesome layout that is easy to read & helps you learn the rules, AMAZING art, loads of setting information & stories, a game-master\u2019s guide & of course, bad guys to fight!\nSigned Copy (Australian Orders Only), add +$4 per book.\nHelp Create Fragged Empire\nCollaborations, not committees, make the best multidiscipline creative projects & I would love to have your input.

All tokens come pre-painted.\nWe love how realistic resource tokens add to any tabletop game experience, and we want to share that with fellow gamers around the world. We've already created the sculpts for these tokens--now we just need your help to make them a reality!\nWe will add 1 resource token for every 100 backers (+1 gold after the first 100 backers, then +1 wood after the next 100 backers, and so on).

After selecting your reward level, add the shipping cost to your pledge total.\nThe following may be added to the $33 pledge level and above. After selecting your reward level, add this cost to your pledge total:\nAny backer may pledge to the $290 level--you don't have to be a retailer.\nViticulture & Tuscany are available for pre-order through our website, as are the wooden stars and lira as stand-alone purchases. We also have a few copies of Euphoria.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like the Treasure Chest within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund (see FAQ).\nHuge Discount: Based on the manufacturing cost, the Treasure Chest should have an MSRP of $60. We can keep the price much lower by only selling the first print run directly through Kickstarter, our website, and Amazon.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more backers we get, the better the Treasure Chest will be (see stretch goals). The Kickstarter price will remain the same, but the post-Kickstarter price will increase as we add tokens.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping prices for pre-ordered games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nWe Need You: We need your financial support to be able to manufacture and ship these Treasure Chests to gamers around the world.\nFree Euphoria Recruits: We're including 16 updated and revised Euphoria recruit cards in every Treasure Chest. They'll also be available from BGG for $5 in December.\nWe selected the resources for this first Treasure Chest with the help of thousands of voters on our website. Thus the resources in this Treasure Chest are set--we won't be adding any more or it would significantly impact the production schedule.\nHowever, we still want to hear your ideas for future Treasure Chests. We're particularly interested in resources that (a) can be represented in a \"realistic\" way, (b) aren't already produced by another company, and (c) apply to several popular games (not just one game).\nThe realistic resource tokens in the Treasure Chest are a great way to upgrade the retail version of Euphoria (shown here).\nWe anticipate that some backers may want a ton of a specific type of resource--for example, enough gold tokens to fill a swimming pool. There are companies that are really good at selling individual resource tokens...but we are not one of them.\nOur supply chain is based on creating one cohesive version of this premium product, making it affordable for you, and shipping it to you quickly and cost-effectively.\nphoto courtesy of Kim Euker at http://kiestone.smugmug.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Treasure Chest is a first for us in that it's not a game--rather, it's a box full of tokens used in a number of games. The challenge with these tokens is that they're all custom sculpts and moulds, which can be time-consuming and expensive to perfect. Fortunately we have lots of experience with wooden, resin, and metal pieces from Viticulture, Euphoria, and Tuscany.\n\nWith such precious components in every box, we're taking extra precautions to make sure the contents arrive safe and sound. Specifically, we will use a microfiber-lined box insert to protect the tokens from scratching, and there will be a layer of bubble wrap inside each box. The boxes will be made of very sturdy 2mm cardboard that can be stored vertically as well as horizontally without dumping the contents.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisors to point us in the right direction.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Token Trilogy and the Final Update", "update_content": "Hi!

One has the sense that if Arkham were to fall, it may spell the end of everything. But darkness has ways of being seen. The Ring of Shadows has been found, or maybe wanted to be found, at this critical hour. It's up to the citizens of the Miskatonic Valley to work together to wield its awful power to stop the end before it begins.\nIn Shadows of Arkham, 2-4 players take on the roles of citizens who work together to prevent cosmic horrors from unraveling reality. Shadows focuses on dealing with the consequences of dark forces conspiring against players, rather than combat. Players take turns spending Actions to travel the streets of Arkham researching Knowledge, hiring Muscle, collecting Assets, and dealing with Threats.\nEach game revolves around an inevitable danger to Arkham which is represented by the Threat Deck, a constructed deck of cards which players must survive in order to banish the Elder Cards and win the game. Each Threat Card features an Arkham face and a Shadow face. The Arkham faces represents the visible manifestations of the unseemly things found on the Shadow faces of the cards. Whenever the player with the Threat Start Marker begins their turn, a Threat token is placed on the current Threat Card and the indicated damage is dealt to players or locations. The first/last card represents the unique Elder threat which players must contend with in order to win.\nThe player who possesses the Ring of Shadows is able to view the Shadow side of the Threat Deck and deal with the Threat at hand by using any resources they have, but they expose themselves and others to harm in the process. If players manage to survive the final encounter with the Elder Cards in the shadows, they unceremoniously save the world from incomprehensible danger. \n...but such is the way in Shadows of Arkham.\nClick the link above to download the current version of the rulebook. Please note that the rules and game components will be continually updated until the manufacturing date!\nWatch this space for any video previews if they become available.\nWant to try the game out?

(Be forewarned: this is a reasonably complicated P&P with lots of double-sided card printing!)\nIf we're calling it \"ameritrash,\" it needs to have a lot of components.

This is a co-op campaign: no tiered versions, just more stuff for everyone.\nWe have some really cool stretch goals planned out! If we get enough support we also have some awesome mini-expansion ideas that will introduce even more variety to the game as well!\nYou'll want to act fast, this is a 3 week campaign! Plus, the faster we fund, the faster we add more stuff! : D\nWe also have a some otherworldly rewards for the curious:\nOccasionally, we get questions about how we do what we do. So much goes into a game like this. Maybe you're interested in hearing more about the process? \nWhile working on Shadows of Arkham we were very meticulous about documenting our process. We've saved all of our notes and versions of the game with the intention of sharing a look behind the scenes of designing a game like this. Backers of this tier, in addition to a copy of the game, will receive a digital commentary book (as a PDF) that illustrates the evolution of the game from notecard scribbles to a polished prototype covering all aspects of the process.\nFancy being the victim or the perpetrator of some manifestation of Lovecraftian skullduggery? Well you're in luck, we need faces! One of those faces could be yours! \nWe'll render your horrible visage on one of the Threat Cards or Item Cards, and you'll receive a high-rez image of the card's artwork, your name in the credits, and a copy of the game (with the Commentary Pack). This reward requires you to submit us a photo to use before the end of the campaign! Also, please keep in mind that this is a micro game with mini cards.\nWe weren't planning to do this, but we're going to make it an option: If you select this Reward, your likeness will be used for one of the Character Cards and Tokens in the game. You'll receive a high resolution digital image of the portrait, your name will appear in the credits, and you'll also get a signed copy of the game and the commentary pack. \nWe've priced the reward at $1,250. Supporting at this tier will add a new Character (you!) to every game. This reward doesn't tie to either of the Character Goals. You'll need to provide a high resolution photo(s) for reference within 7 days of the end of the campaign.\nWe have passed $26,250, add we're adding two additional Shadow Artifacts (2 Cards)!\nAt $27,500, we'll add an additional set of Elder Cards for a new Elder to threaten Arkham (3 Cards).\nAt $28,750, we'll add an new Character to the game (Token and Character Card).\n...and there are more...\nWe've never tried this before, but the goal is modest and something people can help accomplish without spending more money...\nWe currently have 319 likes on Facebook, and 317 followers on Twitter, and 365 Lab Report subscribers. If we can reach 500 on each of those by the end of the campaign, we'll add a new Character and Character Token to every copy of the game.\nWe're estimating an October delivery. Why so quick? \nWe've chosen to do our manufacturing in the US for both Shift and Province. We've been very happy with the communication, quick manufacturing timelines, and production quality, and so we're continuing in that tradition. While it can be slightly more expensive, at the end of the day you're getting high-quality, ethically produced games with crazy fast turn around times! No waiting on big cargo ships.\nProvince ended in March, and many of our backers will be receiving their games during this campaign. We expect that with the time necessary to finish art and production logistics that we can have the game ready to ship in October.\nIn 2013 we designed, developed, and published our very first microgame with the help of backers like you here on Kickstarter! Shift is a dueling card game that boils down Japanese-style CCG's into a single card. All you need is a friend, two cards, and some coins to throw-down in an epic anime inspired battle!\nLaboratory began working differently in 2014. We decided to start small and follow what grows. At the beginning of February we Kickstarted a microgame called Province, which sold over 8000 copies. It will also be our first game to enter retail channels. Province tackled the challenge of making a competitive 2 player micro eurogame. We think it's pretty swell. Other people seem to agree.\nSo when considering what to do next it occurred to us: why not do micro-ameritrash? How would that even work? Ameritrash games are full of stuff and theme! Things Clayton and Sam are both quite fond of, but how do you make a micro one? The theme was obvious immediately: What better theme to represent such a conflicted concept than the mythos of H.P. Lovecraft?\nAfter a mess of iteration, we've come to a game with some fun new ideas that we present to you today! We're proud of what we've accomplished, and we hope you like what you see! Shadows of Arkham represents a big step for us. For a small independent publisher/developer team of two, we've fired on all cylinders to bring you top-notch work that we're very proud of.

There was a ton of laughter. The effort y'all put into this really showed.\" \u2014 David G, playtester\n\"Could be the next Cards Against Humanity.\" \u2014 Jeremy Fisher, Wander\n\"The physical design of the cards is a delight.\" \u2014 Brian Bankler, Tao of Gaming\nHello! We made a thing you might like. It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s funny. You can play it with a small group of friends or a huge crowd of people. \nIt\u2019s called Monikers, and it\u2019s our attempt to update a classic party game. The concept is pretty simple: get your friends to guess a bunch of names printed on a set of cards. Each round has different rules about how you can give clues. In the first round, you can say anything you want. In the second, you can only use one word. And in the third, you can only do charades. It works really well, because the same cards are used in each round, so by the end of the game, you\u2019ve made up a bunch of hilarious jokes together.\nEach turn is only 60 seconds, so you also get to see your friends crack under pressure. Which is always great. Actually, the game is pretty much just 45 minutes of laughing at people while they frantically try to get you to guess a name that seems obvious to them but is actually really confusing to everyone else.\nWe like games that respect your intelligence even when they\u2019re making fart jokes, so that\u2019s what we set out to do. As a friend of ours said, Monikers is either a really smart dumb game or a really dumb smart game. Either way, it's our love letter to one of the greatest folk games of all time.\nHere are some things we think you'll like about it:\nMonikers is based on the public domain game Celebrity, which is one of the most fun and simple party games of all time. \nWe've spent years creating hundreds of funny and inappropriate names for the set, so you won't have to struggle to come up with clever names before playing. And you'll never have to deal with downtime or your friends writing down a bunch of boring, duplicate names like Barack Obama or Miley Cyrus. Ugh.\nSince we've met a couple of our stretch goals, the set now comes with the complete set of 500 cards. Our dream though is to get another 50 blank cards so you can add your own dumb names.\nWe sweet talked some people that are smarter than us to add some names to the set. The contributors are a mix of our favorite web writers (Jason Kottke, Andy Baio, Patrick Klepek, Emma Koenig) and game designers we really admire (Max Temkin, Asher Vollmer, Loren Brichter, Matt Rix).\nEvery card has a clue printed on it, so even if someone doesn\u2019t know the name on the card, they can use the text. Skipping is also highly encouraged, so no one will ever get completely stuck.\nEach card has a point total based on how difficult it is to guess (1-4). So when your team guesses someone easy like Roger Ebert, you get 1 point. But when your team guesses something hard like A Narwhal, you get 4 points.\nWe have some amazing illustrators signed up to do visual clues for some of the cards, like Zach Weinersmith (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal), Jana Kinsman, Ariel Aberg-Riger, Gemma Correll, Rachel Levit, Grace Danico, and more.\nAnd one more thing: we're making Monikers available for free through a Creative Commons license, so you can download and try out a playtest copy right now:\nWe can\u2019t really describe why Monikers is so much fun. You really just have to play it. There\u2019s something amazing about how the jokes build up, so that by the end of the game, everyone is sharing the same depraved hive mind, and all someone has to do is make some obscene thrusting gesture and everyone immediately knows they mean Ruth Bader Ginsburg (or whoever).\nIt\u2019s kind of silly to assign depth to a party game, but what we love most about Monikers is getting to peer into the minds of our friends and realizing that they have the same inappropriate thoughts as us.\nIn short: it\u2019s a fun and strangely personal way to joke around with friends.\nMonikers is a really weird game and a labor of love for us. Our goal starting out was to take the basic formula of the game Celebrity and perfect it: create an interesting set of names, experiment with some new rules, and make a fun set of cards to bring to parties. It was just a thing we did for ourselves and our friends at first.\nPeople have created boxed versions of Celebrity before, but the design and curation (Spiro Agnew? Wayne Brady?) don't seem to capture what we love most about the games we've played with friends over the years. Designing Monikers forced us to think about what transforms a game of Celebrity from good to great. And that's typically one thing: a hilarious set of names that strikes a great balance between obscurity, obscenity, and randomness.\nFor Monikers, we've added an entire category of cards to the game that doesn't involve famous people at all. They're more like archetypes or tropes. So in a round you may have to switch from a card designed for cheap laughs like Anthony Weiner to something more abstract like Homo Erectus or A Nigerian Prince. We also expanded the concept of what constitutes a \"famous person,\" so there are cards like Goatse, Doge, and obscure internet memes that lead to hilarious misunderstandings for people who don't know about them. But the cards we love the most are ones that lead to completely surreal interactions that stretch the rules of the game and sort of human speech itself, like The Lady Who Spilled Coffee on Herself at McDonald\u2019s or The Person on Your Right.\nBoth of us\u2014Alex and Justin\u2014have really button down day jobs in the nonprofit world. Working on the game has been an enormously fun and rewarding experience over the past year. We want that to shine through in the final product and get something into your hands that you\u2019ll be excited to bring along to parties or just play at home on a night in with friends.\nMaybe this goes without saying since we\u2019re on Kickstarter, but Monikers isn\u2019t going to get made without your help. We don\u2019t have external funding or a publisher waiting in the wings. And unless Mark Zuckerberg has a stroke, no one is buying us for a billion dollars.\nWe\u2019re just two socially awkward guys that are obsessed with games. And since this is our first project, we want to keep things as simple as possible. We'd rather focus on getting you a single great product than adding shirts, posters, and a bunch of other crap that would honestly be really fun to create, but would make it difficult to ship on time.\nPLEDGE $25 \u2014 You get one copy of Monikers, delivered.\nSHIPPING:\nUS backers: Free\nCanada backers: +$10\nUK, Australia, and NZ backers: +$19\nElsewhere: message us and we'll figure something out\nIf you want more than one copy, just choose this pledge level and add $22 for each additional copy you'd like. Backers outside the US, message us and we'll figure out shipping for multiple copies.\nPLEDGE $300 \u2014 One copy of Monikers, delivered. Plus you get to pick a name to include in the set. Seriously. Anyone. Well, don't do something stupid like name your Pilates instructor. We'll work with you. \nYou'll also be credited on the card like the guest contributors listed above (or have the option to remain anonymous if you'd rather not be associated with submitting something truly heinous like Terri Schiavo).\nMonikers is nearly done. But it turns out that printing a box of 400+ high quality cards is pretty expensive if you don't order that many of them. Luckily, prices get a lot cheaper the more copies we order, so if we're able to raise significantly more than our minimum goal, we'll be able to add some great stuff to the game.\n$20,000 \u2014 FUNDED \u2014 DONE!\nOnce we're at this level, the game will definitely ship.\n$30,000 \u2014 BETTER QUALITY CARDS \u2014 DONE!\nYour drunk friends are probably going to spill beer all over these cards at some point. The stock materials we're using are already pretty good, but our first priority once we're clear of the minimum goal is to make sure each copy of Monikers can take a beating.\n$40,000 \u2014 100 MORE CARDS \u2014 DONE!\nThis is where things get really good. If we can print 1500+ copies of Monikers, the price of each card drops dramatically. So if we make it here, we'll be able to add 100 more cards for everyone.\n$50,000 \u2014 50 BLANK CARDS \u2014 CLOSE!\nYou probably have some good ideas for cards that aren't in the set. If we reach this goal, we'll be able to add 50 blank cards to each set.\n$60,000 \u2014 MORE ILLUSTRATIONS\nWe're working with some incredible illustrators and webcomic folks to do artwork for a handful of cards. If we hit this goal, we'll be able to commission even more work. We'd love suggestions for who you'd like to see illustrations for. Shirtless Vladimir Putin has our vote.\n$70,000 \u2014 MOBILE APP\nBesides Spaceteam, there aren't many decent party games on iOS and Android. We'd like to make one. A friend of ours, who would otherwise be way too overqualified to work on this, is lined up to join the project if we reach this level.\n$80,000 \u2014 EXCESSIVELY NICE QUALITY EDITION\n\nOnce we get up to this level, we can really get serious about the quality of materials. We'll be able to make the cards even more durable, the colors more vivid, and text more legible. This is the version we would make for you in a perfect world, i.e. a world where we have $80,000.\nAlex and Justin are friends who started playing games together in college and sort of never stopped. In real life, Justin\u2019s an environmental lawyer in Chicago who works on sustainable energy policy. Alex lives in Brooklyn and cofounded one of the world's first MOOC-based universities in Rwanda last year.\nHuge thanks to everyone who played crappier versions of Monikers over the past year and were so generous with their time and feedback: Alan Gerding, James Nathan Spencer, the rest of our friends, and everyone on boardgamegeek who were nice enough to playtest for us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe really, really care about getting a game to you that you're going to love.

You've found the old Kickstarter page for Block Party. If you would like a copy of the game, or to learn more about it, head on over to\nhttp://w.3pxh.com/preorder\nAnd now back to our regularly scheduled programming (which will be outdated and preserved and until the end of the internet).\nHi, we're Benjamin and George, a pair of Stanford graduates in architecture and mathematics. We strive to find simple structures that give rise to complex behaviors and we love making big ideas accessible to anyone who is curious. Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter, and get in touch if you have any questions or comments!\nBlock Party is a pattern matching game which embodies the fundamentals of computer science search algorithms without using any words! It's fun for children, their parents, and anyone looking to use their mind. It is also designed to be approachable so that even those who might otherwise be intimidated by math or computer science find it fun and can experience the benefits of practicing logical thinking through play, without even knowing it!\nWhile players look for collections of icons called \"parties\" they develop heuristics, learn to recognize logical constraints, and identify limiting reagents. Combined with tactile play and eliciting information processing akin to the Flanker task, Block Party will stimulate anyone's brain.\n Party Duel is a very competitive variation of Block Party where Party tiles are limited objects that players must race for!\nBlock Party is an entire collection of games in just 8 pieces. We think that's pretty amazing! Check out some of the games below or look at the interactive tutorial.\nVariations have been tested with people ages 5-85, and we've concluded from the positive reactions across the board that Block Party has something to offer anyone who picks it up. We enjoy being able to keep things friendly or make them competitive, partying solo to break up the workday, and setting challenges to match the amount of time we want to spend. Block Party can be whatever you make it, and we have quite a few suggestions :-)\nWe've been working on Block Party for 8 months now. What started out as a hand-illustrated, experimental set of eight wooden cubes has become a refined game platform with more play styles than pieces. We're really proud of that.\nBut it's time for more than prototypes--we want to share Block Party with you and the world. For that we've turned to Kickstarter so that players can get Block Party at a reasonable price and the quality they deserve.\nWe've been in touch with manufacturers for several months now, so we understand what it will take to produce Block Party at scale. The samples we've received (see below) are beautiful objects and delightful to hold.\nPlease note: We have not conducted any formal scientific studies with Block Party (they're expensive and time consuming!). Studies presented use materials which we think bear a likeness to Block Party in some way, whether use of short term memory, spatial reasoning, or its tactile nature.\nResearch Publications\nSpatial Training Improves Children's Mathematics Ability http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15248372.2012.725186#.U1MGyq1dV95\nImproving fluid intelligence with training on working memory http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/04/25/0801268105.abstract\nWorking Memory Training in College Students With ADHD or LD http://jad.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/13/1087054713516490.abstract\nDeveloping Mathematical Reasoning Using Attribute Games http://www.setgame.com/content/developing_mathematical_reasoning_using_attribute_games\nThese and Other Studies In the News \nwww.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/can-you-make-yourself-smarter.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\nhttp://www.udel.edu/udaily/2014/sep/playing-with-blocks-092613.html \nhttp://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/spatial-training-boosts-math-skills/\nFunds raised here will be used toward producing sets of Block Party and shipping backer rewards. Funds are split like so: \n10% for Kickstarter/Amazon fees\n70% for Block Party manufacturing + freight shipping\n20% for Amazon multi-channel fulfillment\nWe will order sets proportional to funds raised, and provided we exceed the goal additional margins will be spent developing the stretch goals listed above. The production and shipping of the blocks will take less than 3 months (50 days for production, up to 40 days for shipping) as a generous estimate. For this reason the delivery date is November as we've budgeted over 4 months to be cautious.\nWe will be using Amazon's multi-channel fulfillment to ship orders so that they all arrive in a timely manner. Before shipping we will send out a survey to backers so that you can make sure your reward is shipped to the correct address, even if it changes before we ship. In the rare event that your package arrives damaged we will be happy to send you a replacement. Fortunately since the components are robust we expect very few defects in shipping.\nWe're Benjamin and George, and we love simple, deep architectures. Since fostering a healthy and creative collaboration in school and outside, we decided to found Three Pixel Heart to make simple, expansive fun.

It's easy to learn with almost no downtime between turns while still having a strategic balance and theme.\nGame time runs between 60-90 minutes, no matter how many players, and if you expose it to gamma rays, cool stuff happens (not really, don't do that).\nImage does not represent the final product as stretch goals may increase production value of the game.\nStretch Goals Will Earn Us Plastic Ships!\nTheme Overview\nThe O-Renj star system was full of wonderfully happy beings... until... Trobils appeared!  They're incredibly destructive and tenacious creatures.  Your job is to catch and eliminate as many Trobils as possible.\nYou'll make connections around the star system with pirates, smugglers, and other riffraff.  Deal with merchants, search the asteroid belt for ore, and build the perfect traps to catch the Trobils plaguing the system!\nWhy is Everything Orange?\nWe like Orange. And it's colorblind friendly!\nA family test playing Asking for Trobils at our local game store 8th Dimension.\nHow the Game Plays\nOn your turn you either place one Ship or retrieve your Ships from the board.  When you place a Ship, you get whatever that space gives you.  If you place your Ship on the Comet, then you'll receive two Crystals.  If you place it on the Asteroids, you'll get two Ore.  It's that simple.\nEven better, unlike most worker-placement games, there is no blocking.  You can bump an opponent off a spot to get what you need.  This is actually good for them, as it means they don't have to spend their next turn retrieving the Ship.\nAnother way that Asking for Trobils is different is how players make Connections around the board.  You can increase what you get when you visit a location by adding Connections to your Ship Card.  So while one player may only get two Crystals for visiting the Comet, you might get two Crystals and an Ore.  How you increase what you receive is up to you.\nCatching Trobils is how you earn points and win.  It's a race to see who can get the cards that pop up.  If you're determined enough, you can try and grab the larger Trobils that require a lot more resources to capture, but give more points.

(Up to 8 players with two decks of cards!)\nLinkage's MSRP will be roughly $20 \nGet your copy for only $14.00 until May 21st at 9:00 pm with FREE US SHIPPING (international shipping is extra)\n 10 DNA Cards\n8 DNA Nucleotide Cards (2 Guanine, 2 Cytosine, 2 Adenine & 2 Thymine) \n1 DNA Promoter \n1 DNA Terminator\n 24 RNA Basic Nucleotide Cards\n6 Guanine, 6 Cytosine, 6 Adenine & 6 Uracil\n 18 RNA Specialty Cards\n16 Special RNA Nucleotide Cards (4 Guanine, 4 Cytosine, 4 Adenine & 4 Uracil) with \"M\" - Mutation Icons\n2 DNA Mutation Cards\n * Graphics for game are 99% complete (with the exceptional of additional stretch goal graphics). The DNA to RNA color gradients are still being modified for easier nucleotide matching. Updated graphics will be posted as they come!  \n * PLEASE NOTE: Rules in the video use graphics from the prototype and DON'T reflect are a little outdated (Especially the SCORING). I am currently making a more updated video. The Rules attached show the most accurate set of the rules. Thanks for your understanding! \n Proper DNA to RNA Nucleotide Matching \nHere is a link to the Game Rules *Please note - these are a draft and NOT the final version.\nDNA cards are randomly aligned side-by-side creating a template strand of DNA cards. Players compete to build the most accurate RNA copy of this DNA Template by connecting their own RNA Cards side-by-side to accurately match the DNA Template. Players are awarded points based upon the number of RNA Cards in their strand that correctly pair with the DNA template. \n Along the way, players look to outwit the plans of their opponents by cleverly playing mutation cards to damage opposing players' RNA strands while strategically utilizing Chaperone Cards to fix their own. \nThe game can be played in as little 10 or 15 minutes, while points can be awarded over multiple rounds for a longer, more in-depth game.\nALL REWARD LEVELS RECEIVE A PnP (Print N Play) PDF OF THE GAME WITH THE UPDATED GRAPHICS!\nFor a pledge of $14 you get ONE copy of the game + access to the PnP version with updated graphics - One copy of the game allows you to play with 2 - 4 players . Now you have a reason to play games in science class or mutate your parents at home. Please only mutate your parents under adult supervision. (No parents were harmed in the design or testing of this game.)\nFor a pledge of $25 you get TWO copies of the game + Access to the PnP version with updated graphics - Want to play with more than 4 players, or give a copy to a friend - AND get a discount? If you pledge for two games you get them for $25 - which is $12.50 per game instead of $14. \nFor a pledge of $50 you get TWO copies of the game + ONE of our twenty exclusive prototypes + Access to the PnP version with updated graphics - This reward includes one rare prototype used to playtest this game (Only 20 Available) with a signed note from the creator, John Coveyou. But you don't want to mess up that prototype, so you'll also get 2 copies of Linkage! The delivery date for the Prototype is June while the 2 manufactured copies will be delivery in July, 2014.\nFor a pledge of $60 you get FIVE copies of the game + Access to the PnP version with updated graphics - After mutating your parents, why not mutate the teacher next!? Eight games is enough for the whole class to play! Or just a great way to get a copy of this game for $12 a piece! Even after including international shipping to anywhere in the world, the per-game cost for one copy at this pledge level is cheaper than one copy with free shipping to the US. Can't beat that!\nFor a pledge of $110 you get TEN copies of the game + Access to the PnP version with updated graphics - After your teacher, why not mutate the whole neighborhood? Even after including international shipping to anywhere in the world, the per-game cost for one copy at this pledge level ($13.60) is cheaper than one copy with free shipping within the US. Can't beat that!\nHere's a quick peek at the RNA Translation Game Prototype I am currently play-testing in case anyone is tempted to pledge at the $350 level :-) \n For a pledge of $350 you get EVERY GAME WE PUBLISH FOREVER + FIVE copies of the Linkage + Access to the PnP version with updated graphics - So some of you just want to give a lot of money and need a good reason to - here it is! Lifetime subscription to Genius Games! That means you get the 5 Copies of Linkage from above and EVERY game we ever publish FOREVER - Upcoming games include: a DNA Replication Expansion AND an RNA Translation Expansion for Linkage; Atomic Zero - a post-apocalyptic Chemistry Game; CellCraft - the game where players compete to build the inner-workings of a cell (name TBA!)\n(*Note: a game with more than 6 or seven people may get hectic, so for larger groups - like a classroom - I'd recommend breaking them up into smaller sized groups.\nIf we make it to $5,500 ALL DECKS will receive upgraded card stock: The basic 300 gsm - White Core - card stock will be upgraded to the 310gsm - Black Core - card stock!\nIf we make it to $8,500 ALL DECKS will receive an upgraded Rule Booklet: Previously, the rules were simple text printed on two cards. With this stretch goal, we can afford to have a separate rule booklet added to the game, to give it an overall more professional feel! \nWe already hit the $10,500 mark, but I am throwing this stretch goal upgrade in after the fact to say thanks so all my backer. Yes, this will greatly increase manufacturing and shipping costs all around, BUT the two part box will be much more durable and sturdy, look much more professional all around and will able to hold an expansion that we want to release!  \nIf we make it to $12,500 ALL DECKS will be upgraded with Ribosome Cards. These cards visually depict RNA Translation - the process of using the RNA strand which player created and form a protein (A chain of amino acids). \nOn the card above, the Ribosome is the big red glob in the middle, the strand running horizontal through the ribosome is the RNA Strand that each player is competing to build (more accurately named mRNA), the green twisted strands are called tRNA and the colorful spheres (or balls) are the individual amino acids. \nEach amino acid (one building block of a protein) is attached to the end of the tRNA, while at the other end of the tRNA is a three nucleotide sequence that matches up with a specific three nucleotide sequence in the mRNA strand. \nThis allows the mRNA strand to be \"translated\" into a specific amino acid sequence. And there you have the \"quick and dirty\" explanation of RNA Translation. \nISN'T SCIENCE AWESOME! - And all the geeks sign and smile...\nSocial Media Stretch Goals  \nIf Genius Games gets 50 new likes (we are currently at 248 so 298 total) I will post an instructional video explaining how the process of DNA Transcription works, using Linkage as a Teaching Aid!  \nIf Genius Games gets 150 new likes (we are currently at 248 so 398 total) I will post an instructional video explaining how the Process of DNA Replication Transcription works!  \nIf Genius Games gets 250 new likes (we are currently at 248 so 498 total) I will post an instructional video explaining how the Process of RNA Translation works!  \nIf Genius Games gets 350 new likes (we are currently at 248 so 598 total) I will post a professionally shot and edited video that explains the rules of the game!\n------ Facebook ----- Genius Game on Twitter ---- John Coveyou on Twitter ------\nI am a complete science nerd - AND - I love playing games!\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I greatly enjoy playing sci-fi and fantasy games, but as I was thinking about cool game ideas and I thought to myself, \u201cWhy not design a game where the game play and game mechanics are based entirely, and very accurately, upon some science concept.\u201d\nThat way, instead of diving deep into a non-existent alternative universe, you dive deeply into real-world concepts that only the super geeky - or someone right in the middle of a biology class - know about! (There\u2019s that geek in me flaring up again.)\nSo that\u2019s what I did. I wouldn't strictly call this an \u201ceducational game\u201d, but becoming familiar with some biology and genetics concepts is an unavoidable consequence of playing the game.\n The game is 95% finished; the artwork is complete, but we are mainly waiting to finish up the graphic design of the box and rules sheets and then finalize the files for a manufacturer. At this point, I have taken a little too much money from my daughter\u2019s college fund to produce this game (just joking \u2013 but also kind of serious\u2026) to pay for the graphics and prototyping. \n So I am asking for funds to help pay to put the finishing touches on the graphic design, the final file preparation and ESPECIALLY to help pay for manufacturing (and the cost to ship you the game!). \n On my blog, I estimated the total funding needed to be right around $4,460 (roughly $4,500 like I said in the video), which included the future costs of damages and shipments, and errors and contingencies along the way. \n The upfront monetary expense I've estimated at right around $3,860. This includes manufacturing: $1,440, Shipping: $1,385, Graphic Design and File Preparation: $480+ plus the standard 10% Kickstarter and Amazon fees. There are also many problems that could arise which will incur additional costs and fees, and it's inevitable that some packages will lost or get damaged. \n But I want to see this project become a success so I am setting my funding goal right at $3,800 and I will make up the difference out of my daughter's college savings account if necessary. \n She can get a perfectly fine genetics education started for only $14 with \"Linkage\" so why does she need a college fund anyway?\nBut best of all, Linkage was designed to accurately employ mechanics from a process normally taught in high school biology: DNA Transcription, where an RNA copy is made from DNA for use in a cell. \nIn this way Linkage offers a unique, engaging and tactile experience that anyone can use to familiarize themselves with this fundamental concept of biology.\nDNA Transcription\nThe DNA of a cell is much like the blueprint of a house. In the same way that blueprints tell the builder how to build the house (the dimensions of each room, the electrical lines and outlets, the pipes for plumbing, etc.) the DNA of a cell guides the building of a cell (when to make more protein, enzymes, cell membranes etc.) \nNow, it would not be wise for the home builder to bring the original blueprints to the construction site of the house for fear that the originals may get dirty, damaged, or harmed in some way. \nInstead, a copy of the blueprints are brought to the site and the original documents are kept safe in an office. In the same way, the DNA does not itself go out into the wild chaotic 'construction sites' of the cell, for fear of being damaged or destroyed. \nInstead, a copy of the DNA goes out into the cell. This copy is called RNA. This game is modeled after the way in which a cell makes RNA by copying its own DNA.

Published by Sony, these games became legendary for their unique soundtracks, their snappy, frenetic action and the zen-like \"flow states\" that players entered into when they got into the groove. \nOriginal game screen and box cover art. The Amplitude logo is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC.\nBoth fans and reviewers REALLY liked the game. Some select quotes from back in the day:\nIn the 11 years since Amplitude\u2019s release, Harmonix has gone on to create true pop culture phenomena with the original Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Dance Central. Still, there was a quiet clawing in the back of our minds. Pleas from Amplitude fans, strangers on the street, and veterans of the studio - we needed to revisit this era of gaming and update it for the modern age! \nWith the advancements in technology and the huge creative leaps forward our studio has taken, we believe we can rebuild Amplitude for current consoles and make it an even more amazing experience than before. We're aiming to deliver an updated soundtrack, incredible visuals, and fine-tuned controls. These improvements will be layered on top of the core mechanics and hallmark difficulty that made both FreQuency and Amplitude such amazing experiences when they first debuted. We\u2019re confident that we can make a game that will do its predecessors justice!\n\n  Early Crippler concept - Purple player launched a debilitating power-up on the green player.\nDuring Rock Band, we perfected our methodology for \u201cbeatmatching\u201d, which we intend to apply to this new title. We\u2019ll also be moving the game into the new proprietary engine Harmonix has developed over the past 10 years. In addition to better control over timing windows, this will also allow us to run at 60 frames per second and smoothly port the existing mechanics to PS3 and PS4.\nThe game, as designed for this Kickstarter, focuses on the core Amplitude experience. Single player and local multiplayer are included in the design, as are leaderboards for online bragging rights. The Beat Blaster (the ship), music notes, tracks and FX will all be modernized and gorgeous. The cyberworld around the tracks will be designed by artists and crafted by coders so that every pixel on screen can be driven by the underlying music. Even as we work through our plans for this Kickstarter, the game is beginning to take shape \u2013 an HD reinvisioning of the cult classic, smartly updated for today on every axis. We believe this is the game that fans of Amplitude have been asking for and a game that can only come from Harmonix.\nEarly Beat Blaster concepts\nMusic is at the heart of Amplitude. The all-new soundtrack will focus on songs with an electronic-based feel, with tones spanning dark and moody to bright and bouncing. \nOur award-winning audio team is uniquely capable of composing amazing music with ideal GAMEPLAY in mind. All the amazing patterns and runs that made Amplitude's gameplay so fun need sick music crafted to match perfectly. For this game, we plan to focus our efforts on music that is custom-created for the game. This has the best chance of creating KILLER gameplay feel and a well-balanced list of songs. And you can help us pick which tracks make it into the final shipping tracklist! Take a look at our backer rewards for more details on how you can make your voice heard, contribute tracks to the game, or get your hands on a limited edition vinyl soundtrack!\nLimited edition colored vinyl (mockup)\nAt its higher difficulty levels, Amplitude was hard as hell. We\u2019re talking \u201cDark Souls\u201d hard, but with music. We know that fans of the original will be expecting that same level of challenge in this new version, and we won\u2019t disappoint. The game will still feature its hallmark difficulty as you progress.\nIn the years since Amplitude, Harmonix developers have become masters at making rhythm games fun for everybody. While we\u2019re focused on designing this project to appeal to a \u201chardcore\u201d base, we intend for fans of more recent Harmonix products to feel right at home with this new game as well, if they\u2019re willing to put in the practice and hone their skills!\nOriginal Amplitude team members still rocking it at Harmonix\nMany of the original developers who made this game a classic are still here at Harmonix, and psyched to update the experience for all players.\nThese veteran developers will be joined by the best rhythm game devs in the industry, folks who\u2019ve shipped dozens of AAA titles. We\u2019re ready to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience that players can pick up and enjoy. This is a game only Harmonix can make, on time and on budget. But we know that we can't do it without your help.\nThe levels are dark and quiet on entry, but jump to life as players release the musical notes.\nOur aim with this Kickstarter is to be humble in our expectations. The current goal is to make a faithful Amplitude \"HD\" - the core experience from PS2\u00ae re-developed for modern gaming devices. We certainly have LOTS of crazy ideas that could blow this concept out. Your contribution, feedback, and community input will decide where this project will land and how many crazy ideas we can incorporate!\nEarly Beat Blaster sketches\nThis project is intended to be a love letter to old-school PS2\u00ae fans, but we need to know that this is something you actually want.

(under the previous game name \"Payload\")\nPhoto courtesy of Dawni Burton Christensen\nPhoto courtesy of Michael Tunison\nIn Yardmaster, 2-4 players compete to build trains comprised of railcars of different goods and values. However, players are restricted in connecting railcars of only the same value or good type, so if you grab a railcar you can't use, it needs to wait in your sorting yard until it can legitimately hook up to your train.\nPlayers start with three cargo cards in hand, and three railcar cards are laid out on the table. Each player has one exchange token in one of the four colors, and whoever is to the right of the start player has a Yardmaster token. On a turn, a player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired; whoever holds the Yardmaster token takes a third action on her turn, then passes this token to the right. Players can:\nDraw a cargo card from the deck or (in most cases) from the top of the discard pile.\nBuy a railcar by discarding 1-4 cargo cards of the same color as the railcar, with the number determined by that railcar's value.\nSwap your exchange token for another one; you can discard two cargo cards matching the color of your token to represent one cargo card of the proper color when buying a railcar.\nEight cargo cards provide bonus actions during play, such as drawing extra cargo cards or paying less cargo to purchase a railcar. The player to reach 16-18 points first wins.\nYardmaster will have top notch component quality and the best part of that is we don't have to hit any stretch rewards for it to come this way! You can count on 96 high quality, linen embossed cards that will shuffle like a dream.

On each turn, all players will select one card from their hand and play it simultaneously in an attempt to collect Good Eggs that are worth VP while avoiding the nasty Exploding Eggs that lose VP!\nTypically, the player who played the highest Adventurer chooses an Egg first, then the player with the second highest Adventurer picks an Egg, and so on until all revealed Eggs are collected. Ah, but it's not that simple! Each Adventurer has a unique power that can affect the order in which Eggs are selected. The powers interact in strategic and awesome ways so that every hand is exciting and different.\nOutwit your opponents to collect as many Dragon Eggs as possible \u2014 while avoiding those wicked Exploding Eggs!\nStory\nEggs from the dragons of Ridback Mountain are valuable \u2014 not quite as valuable as gold following the last market fluctuation, but still TOTALLY worth the hassle, especially since it's not like YOU are climbing the mountain and searching through dragon caves. That's what peasants are for...\nAll the empires have sent their intrepid Adventurers out to collect Eggs, but not all will succeed! It gets crowded on Ridback Mountain, and there are only so many dragon Eggs to go around \u2014 not to mention that the dragons have started mixing Exploding Eggs into their nests, and those hurt.\nPledge Info\nWe wanted to keep this campaign very simple.

Canada backers would pledge $50 for two copies, $25+$25.\nCanadian and international backers should make sure to take advantage of the 4 pack to save on shipping costs!\nThis project is EU friendly!

The company has almost 130 years of experience manufacturing Playing Cards, ensuring these cards will be exceptionally well made.\nRed\nThe color red used on the cards is Pantone 200.

This is the color of the soles of Christian Louboutin's iconic high heels, which were worn by Claire Underwood in Netflix's House of Cards.\nCards\nThe Deck contains 52 cards, 2 Jokers, a blank card, and an edition card. The Edition Card will denote the deck as a first edition, which will be sold exclusively through Kickstarter.\nT-Shirt\nThe Limited Edition T-Shirt features the radial motif design. Using an incredibly high end screen printing process on T-Shirts from American Apparel, the application infuses the ink into the fabric instead of adding a vinyl-like layer on top. The result is luxurious and soft, and the design will never crack in the wash.\nNew: Now Available in Green, Blue, Yellow, Red, as well as Grey.\nT-Shirts are 100% Fine Cotton, and are fit for Kings and Queens in XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL. (Mens and Womens sizes)\nCustomization & Extras\nAdditional Decks & T-Shirts\nAdditional Decks and T-Shirt can be ordered by simply adding extra money to your pledge. Just add $15 to your pledge for each extra Deck, or $20 for each extra Motif T-Shirt.\nPress Kit\nIf you would like to write about these cards, you can grab higher resolution images from my Press Kit.\nBehind the Scenes\nThe design process for this deck was very different than designing a traditional custom deck. To a casual observer it may seem obvious and easy, but nothing about this design was ever straight forward. Simplicity is incredibly difficult.\nHere are some of the designs for the suit shapes.  Originally conceived to be in a wireframe style, here you can see how the shapes evolved over time. At one point, I had designed a four-leaf clover to replace the clubs suit shape, because I wanted the deck to be 'extra lucky'. It also contrasted nicely with the diamonds square shape.\nNote: Not Final Designs\nThe deck also began as a more classic design. I had wanted to pick new figures from which to base the face cards off of. For the Queen of Spades I depicted Hangaku Gozen one of the few women Samurai, shown on the left in a very very rough sketch form. For the Queen of Hearts, I had picked Elizabeth I, represented here by a simplified version of the Tutor Rose. One of the Queens was going to be Boadicea, which is the title of the track used in the video.\nAs the design progressed, I moved away from representing historical and literary figures, and more towards iconic shapes. You can see this in the Queen card as it adopts the crown symbol from chess. As much as I loved many of these designs, they never quite felt like I had arrived at the best design.\nNote: Not Final Design\n With the face cards reduced to a simple icon, I wanted to do the same to the numeral cards. I came up with a single shape that could represent the value and suit of the card. By placing the suit in a simple geometric shape, you could effectively create an identity for each card. \nIn the process of copy-pasting, I had ended up pasting a deck with only the corner shapes, and nothing in the middle. It's stark contrast to every other design made it jump out at me.\nI was incredibly nervous about using it as a final design. There was something very uncomfortable about it. I spent two weeks agonizing over whether or not to proceed with the minimalist final design. It was only after some push from designers whom I have tremendous levels of respect for, I decided to go all in with the ultra minimalist design.\nOnce the direction had been decided, the next step was to refine. You may not see a difference between the hearts at first glance, but there's a subtle pinching going on in the heart on the left where the curve of the circle transitions into the straight line of the heart. This was smoothed out whilst preserving the integrity of the shape. In the middle is the difference in the shapes overlapped. It's incredibly subtle, but it's part of the attention to detail that's gone into this deck.\nNote: Not Final Designs\n The box design is the part of this project that as been very clear from the beginning. I had tried this early on as an experiment for the back of the cards, and loved it so much I put it on the box. \nNote: Not Final Designs\nHere are some more cards from some of the different design directions. \nDon't Know How to Play?\nFrom Blackjack to Poker, you can learn the rules of dozens of card games from the Bicycle Rules website.

Well, most of every day...\nWhenever the boss is not around, the players hack into their employer's mainframe to snoop around for some state secrets, or at least some juicy gossip. After all, the only way up the ladder here is twisting your boss's arm with some defaming documents... You\u2019ll need to be the first to collect that epic stash of secrets!\n In Security is a light dice-rolling game for 3-6 players. I created it for a game design competition on Board Game Geek (where it won the Theme, Mechanics, and Design Quality categories, as well as the Grand Prize!). It's super-quick to set up and explain, and takes just 15-20 minutes to play, so it's a perfect little filler game!\nThis video explains how to play:\nPLAY\n\nOr if you prefer, you can simply look at the rules.\nThere are only three pledge levels. Because simple is good.\nThe DICELESS EDITION is the cheapeast option! I'll send you 6 pocket-sized player mats (7x12 cm) to which you'll add your own dice to play. The abridged rules are printed on the back of the player mats. (You can still download the PDF rulesheet and/or watch the video tutorial above.)\nThe COMPLETE EDITION is the full package, ready to play! The 6 player mats, plus 6 player dice, 6 hacking dice, and (in addition to the rules on the mats) you get a full-colour double-sided rulesheet.\nThe LIMITED EDITION is the complete game, packaged in a custom-printed and numbered drawstring bag, hand-made by me! This tier will become available on Friday May 2nd, 9pm BST.\nIn Security is meant to be a small and cheap game, so to save you money, I'm packaging both editions in a grip-seal bag rather than in a custom printed box.\nAdd-ons (multiple copies) \nIf you'd like multiple copies of In Security, you can simply pledge a higher amount! Just add an extra \u00a32 for an additional Diceless version, or \u00a36 for an additional Complete version.\nNon-UK backers only need to pledge the international shipping costs once. For example, 2 Complete versions for a Dutch backer would cost \u00a315 total: 2x \u00a36 plus the \u00a33 shipping charge.\n(Please don't try to add Complete add-ons to the Diceless pledge level.)\nThanks to our backers, we've hit 100% funding in record time!

No problem: just download the rules (ink-friendly version) and the player mats, grab a handful of dice and you're good to go!\nUpdate: By request, I've also created player mats with a separate track for Access Level, and added those to the player mats file.

I figured if they\u2019re not working for Madison, they\u2019re not going to work for anyone! Finally Madison approved the character design for Rudy.\n\nTruth be told, I\u2019m glad I waited! The little critic was right all along! Not only did we change the design of Rudy, but also the character of Rudy as well! Plus at that stage, I was only able to write short stories, not full length stories.\n\nSide story on Madison: I once told her that once a month on a full moon, my gals Rio and Rio (who are dogs BTW) turn into little children! After the full moon disappears, they turn back into their furry selves. To this day I think she believes me!\n\nThe character of Rudy Cool is based on me. Once I made the decision to base Rudy on me, this became the most natural story to write. The best moments from Rudy trying to date Miss Boo are based on my own dating mis-adventures! The scene about hot chocolate and the scene where Rudy says, \u201cHey was that a K\u2026\u201cwas all from real life.\n\nMuch of this story was written in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park, Sydney Park in Alexandria and Homebush Bay whilst out on walks with Rio and Ria. We\u2019d sit at the top of the hill on a sunny day, I\u2019d write and they\u2019d run round in circles chasing each other.\n\nMiss Boo was based on a composite of a few dream girls, one of which works in a bookstore in Sydney. The first time I met her, I couldn\u2019t talk properly and all I said was yes to whatever she asked.\n\nNapoleon Bearnaparte was inspired by a teddy bear I had as kid, who was dressed as Napoleon. The hunt for the creative team drove me insane \u2013 we couldn\u2019t find the right look for the book!\n\nAt one stage, I\u2019d given up and was ready to shelve the project again. Finally we found our superstar team of Glauco and Fred, who will also work on our next 2 books. Guys, I cannot thank you enough \u2013 you are a godsend!\n\nThis is the forth project Don and I have collaborated on for Silver Fox Comics.

Of course, Rudy wears his heart on his sleeve and Miss Boo is happy to rip it right off...with a smile.\n\nThe art by Brazilian Glauco Silva is clean and crisp and the confectionary colours and open panels add to the graphic novel\u2019s playful tone which should make this a fun accessible read, especially for younger readers.\n\nRudy\u2019s world is full of loveable characters plucked straight from a kid\u2019s imagination: a talking Beagle, crafty monkey henchmen, French teddy bears, and a Teddy Zulu Nation!

It\u2019s easy to think that super-heroes rule comic books, but if we look back to our early comic book exposure it may have been TinTin that sparked a love of adventure, or perhaps Asterix, Disney\u2019s Duck titles or The Simpsons comics that made us laugh out loud. And I laughed out loud reading Rudy Cool\u2019s misadventures! That\u2019s my tick of approval right there!\n\nWe need more books like \u2018The Adventures of Rudy Cool\u2019 that are accessible and fun reads for both young boys and girls. I\u2019m looking forward to following Rudy as he gets caught up in Miss Boo\u2019s high jinks in their future graphic novels. And I can only wonder what exotic locale Sorab will take us to next time....but I know one thing for sure wherever Rudy lands, there\u2019ll be a whole load of fun!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Reviews from Kinokuniya and Black Mermaid", "update_content": "So if there's one girl I need to impress with Rudy Cool, its my stylish little 10 year old munchkin of a niece - Madison! As you know Rudy was delayed many a time as she didn't like the original character designs! LOL Here's her review!\nHi uncle sorab, how are you? I wanted to send you a quick feedback about the story.\nFeedback: I liked the story a lot, the drawings were great. Maybe you should add a diagram of Chico, Nico and Rico. The diagram should explain if they are good or bad characters and maybe in the diagram you should add something funny like what they like to do, or their favorite food (bananas?). Overall, I thought it was excellent! I love the idea of the \"ruby love diamond\". I thought the teddy bears are awesome and I love it when Rudy cool becomes a naked teddy bear!!! Maybe you should add that when Chico, Nico and Rico try to steel the ruby love diamond they sort of mess up and then they do funny things unintentionally and then the teddy bears chase the monkeys and miss Boo."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Kings Comics Review for The Adventures of Rudy Cool", "update_content": "Dear all,\nI had to put in a few hours work on the day job on Easter Sunday but took some time out to film a brief quick video on my phone to tell you about Rudy Cool!

(Digital tiers only)\nFIND ARMELLO ON\nFacebook\nwww.armello.com\nTwitter @armellogame\nComing to iPad and also PC/Mac/Linux on Steam and DRM free.\nArmello is coming to Android and Windows tablets!\nNote: Early Access will only be available on Steam.\nArmello combines the adventure of role-playing games with the strategy of card and board games!\nThe King, once Armello's wise and benevolent ruler, has fallen ill to a dark and mysterious force known only as the Rot. Slowly eating his body and soul, the Rot twists him deeper and deeper into madness. In response, Armello's Great Clans have called forth their Heroes to claim the throne of Armello; and this is where you start your adventure, Hero. \nAs a 'Hero' from one of the Great Clans of Armello, you'll quest, scheme, explore, vanquish monsters, perform the Mad King's royal edicts and face off against other players with one ultimate end goal in mind \u2014 storming the palace and becoming king or queen of Armello!\nWill you gain followers, powerful treasures and hone your martial skills to challenge the King in combat and take his throne?\nWill you seek the healing powers of the Spirit Stones and quest across the kingdom facing Perils and danger?\nWill you defend the King and position yourself politically to be named his successor when he finally falls to the Rot?\nOr will you succumb to the Rot yourself, leave horror in your wake and claim the throne in the name of darkness?\nIn Armello, players use action points to move their hero across the board. During a turn you'll complete quests, capture settlements to raise your income, encounter followers, explore dungeons for treasures, vanquish the horrific Banes, and battle other heroes using our unique dice-based combat system!  \nPhysics based dice bring that magic tabletop feeling to our unique combat system!\nThere's no boring down time in Armello. After you hit the 'End Turn' button you'll be busy equipping items, recruiting followers and purchasing talents in your hero's unique talent tree. Maybe you're playing cards to the board as Perils for other heroes to stumble into or perhaps you're playing cards to strike up temporary allegiances... they're always temporary.\nDynamic questlines with multiple responses tailored to your hero.\nArmello uses a unique night and day cycle to shift the dynamics of play; the decisions you make will be affected by your hero's preferred time, whether adventuring bravely through the darkness or exposed in sunlight. Night time brings about a host of dangers; terrifying Banes erupt from dungeons to stalk victims and heroes await in ambush, concealed in the darkness. Dawn brings little respite; the King's Guards patrol the kingdom looking for traitors while the King himself slips deeper and deeper into madness, his edicts and demands becoming more outrageous as the game progresses. \nWhether you take the throne or not will depend entirely on how you navigate all of this and the other heroes on the board. Do you have what it takes to become Armello's next king or queen?\nEasy to Pick Up but a Challenge to Master - Combination of Card, Dice, Hex and Symbol sets makes it intuitive to play, yet deep with combinations and options.\nFast & Thoughtful - Adventuring in Armello is fast-paced swashbuckling fun, but also filled with tactical and political complexity, requiring meaningful decisions and forethought. \nMultiple Playable Heroes - Each unique hero possesses a special power, a personalised skill tree and customisable load-outs via Amulets and Signet Rings.  \nAnimated Cards - Over 100 beautifully illustrated and animated cards, from artists all over the world.\nTrue Tabletop Feel - We spent months making sure we cherry-picked the best parts of the tabletop experience, like our custom physics-based dice system! \nLocal & Online Multiplayer - Play with your friends on multiple tablet devices or PCs, or jump online and be matched up with players from the Armello community. \nEngaging Single Player - Your friends are busy? Play on your own against A.I. Each hero features their own tailored A.I., making each hero a special challenge.\nDiscover Your Play-Style  - No \u2018class\u2019 system, modify heroes as you play to adapt to each individual game.\nDynamic Questlines - Explore, vanquish, fight, or scheme your way to the throne. In Armello, each clan has unique questlines that change every time you play.\nLiving World - Procedurally generated 3D hex map and fully animated 3D characters.\nTurn-Based Day/Night Cycle - Gameplay is impacted by the time of day and players can continue to perform actions during their 'off-turn'. Equip and play cards, upgrade your hero and strategise while your opponents have their turn!\nDesigned Specifically for Digital Platforms - With digital-only capabilities and features, such as Stealth and more.\nExpanded World - With companion Novellas and animated shorts, and additional game content planned for future expansions.\nWorld Class Music & Audio - By Michael Allen, internationally acclaimed artist Lisa Gerrard, and Jacek Tuschewski.\nWhile you read, listen to the magic that Michael, Lisa and Jacek are bringing to Armello. Here's a little sneak peek at the Armello OST, the track, Wyld's Call. \nWhilst prototyping Armello on paper, the precise moment that we started to feel the real magic of adventure was when heroes entered the game. You, a hero from one of Armello's Great Clans, setting forth on your very own epic journey! \nBefore each game players choose a hero. Armello's heroes all have different stat spreads and each has a unique game-changing ability or power. After selecting a hero, players then equip both a Power Amulet and a Clan Signet Ring, augmenting the Hero's build to your liking. \nPlaceholder Character Selection Screens\nEach hero has their own unique talent tree and game-changing power, but there are no classes in Armello. Just you, your hero, their power, Amulet, Signet, and then the path you choose to carve for your hero in-game. \nArmello will initially ship with four heroes (one from each of the Great Clans) with more to come post release.  \nHowever... should you back Armello at the 'Bandit' tier, this clan of charming ruffians will be available to you from day one! What's your type? Is it the nimble thief? The dark butcher? The affable rogue? Or perhaps it's the bulky berserker? \nShunned by Armello's great clans, this rag tag bunch of miscreants are out to claim the Kingdown for their own! Can you lead them to victory?\n...and remember, there are plenty more heroes on their way!\nNew Heroes Now Stretch Goals!\nFor every one of these stretch goals we hit below, we'll give one of the second set of heroes from Armello (currently planned as DLC) to EVERY BACKER FOR FREE upon release of that hero. \nAll Stretch Goals met! The above heroes are now unlocked for all backers!\nFrom the very moment we started developing Armello we knew that we wanted deep and strategic card play and not just layered over the top of the board game experience, but integrated into every part of it. \nFollower cards are powerful characters you'll meet on your travels.\nWe're proud to say we've achieved just that. Card play is fully integrated within the mechanics of Armello. You'll play cards to equip items, recruit powerful characters (Follower cards) to your party, heal yourself, cast epic spells, trade and much more. Cards also have other strategic abilities; for example playing them to the board as Perils to thwart other players, or using them in combat to better your odds.\nIn Armello, players all draw cards from a common deck, just like in a board game. No pay to win mechanics or need to keep buying cards. You and your friends start with everything you need to play. :D\nOh... and did we mention that Armello has over 100 unique cards and they're all animated! \nUse Trickery cards to inflict your political prowess across the board.\nYou can play cards during your turn or during other people's turns. There's no down time in Armello! You'll get to refill your hand at the start of your turn by selecting cards from three decks; Items, Spells, and Trickery. \nThe Spell, Items and Trickery decks.\nItems: Items can be consumable single use cards (Throwing Axe, Wyldsap, etc) or equipped to your hero for permanent effect. \nSpells: Spells typically have short range, but get close to a strong caster and it can be devastating. Spells can be played as Perils (traps) to the board or onto a hero for immediate effect. \nTrickery: True power has no limit and so Trickery cards can be played anywhere on the board and flex your influence within the Kingdom. Trickery cards can be played as Perils (traps) to the board or onto a hero for immediate effect. \nTreasure cards are some of the most sought after cards in the game.\nThere are also two decks of cards that players don't draw from, but if they're lucky will happen across during their journey throughout Armello! \nFollowers: Colourful characters from Armello that players can recruit to their party for powerful effects and an edge when questing. \nTreasures: Extremely rare items that can be found in Armello's many dungeons, or perhaps discovered on a mighty quest.\nOne of the biggest challenges of bringing a board game to life is the board itself! We've spent a large part of development on the most minor of details just to make sure the world of Armello truly felt like a living breathing place.\nNo two games of Armello are ever the same!\nThe board of Armello is anchored in the middle by the Royal Palace, home to the King of Armello. In each corner of the board are the Clan Grounds; the point where the clan's territories border onto Armello. This is where each hero starts their journey (and respawns should they perish). \nThe rest of the board is procedurally generated every single game. There are seven tile types in the game and they all provide different effects, should that be stealth, exploration, danger, defense, etc. Using our special algorithm the board is populated before each match, ensuring a balanced, but completely new dynamic to each game of Armello.\nInspired by great war games and tabletop epics, Armello is a game of tactics and strategic positioning, played out as heroes move across Armello, fighting and vying for settlements and advantageous ground.  \n\"Nature rules Armello, both nurturing and cruel.\"\nThe Kingdom of Armello is a vast, beautiful and untamed wild, teeming with ancient mysteries and natural wonders. The locals, typically a very superstitious bunch are diverse and many. From the hardy, cold Wolf Clan nestled in the snowy peaks of the Northern Needles, through to the sophisticated Rabbit Clan and their majestic burrow cities under the Great Southern Plains. \nWe've grown up loving and immersing ourselves in adventures like Red Wall, Watership Down, The Dark Crystal, The Labyrinth, Star Wars, Princess Mononoke and other Studio Ghibli films. Real adventure tales where something truly personal is at stake. To these inspirations we've added our fascination with real world mythologies and traditions, such as the earth magics of the Celts, and our respect for the beauty of the natural world . All of these together have merged to form the Kingdom of Armello.\nWe've set out to create a place of wonder, courage and magic, but darkness and danger lurk around every corner and Armello is the type of place where walking through the woods at night nets you the true Brothers Grimm style ending. It's a world filled with hope and heart, and real consequences.  \nClans feud and scheme, heroes truly are heroes, ancient magical druids walk the earth, and witches and beasts of bane hide in the shadows. There is adventure, fame and fortune to be found in Armello, but take the wrong step and it will most likely be your last.\n Well, we sure have a treat for all the audiophiles out there!\nAs lovers of incredible soundtracks and grand soundscapes, we knew the sonic vistas of Armello had to be extraordinary. The team we've got on board are not only incredibly talented, but also world renowned stars. Michael Allen from his chart surfing pop songs to moving soundtracks and Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance, Gladiator, Samsara, The Insider) whose voice and composition have created some of the most heart moving music ever created.\nThe soundtrack and sound effects will be produced and mastered by Armello's audio director, Jacek Tuschewski, who has shipped over thirty games and worked with internationally acclaimed virtuosos like Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams, Jeff Rona, Klaus Badelt and Zbigniew Preisner on Academy Award winning films, theatre productions and sound installations.\nHere's another sneak peak. This time it's the track, Intrigue Burning. \nFor the final game the music will be mixed in real-time and responsive to player actions and game events, ensuring a tailored audio adventure that enhances each game. Every playthrough will be a unique sonic experience. \nWith your support we hope to also have a high-resolution format (lossless 192kHz/24bit and DSD) for all the audiophiles out there. The soundtrack will be mixed in a state of the art vintage analogue studio straight to DSD128 Double-rate Direct-Stream Digital.\nGame audio rarely gets this kind of attention or attains this level of sonic excellence. At League of Geeks we aim to change that forever.\nWe don't see Armello as just a game. For us it's a world, a universe, brimming with infinite possibilities and countless stories still untold. For over two years now we've been collaborating with our talented friends at 12 Field Animation Studios in order to help us tell some of these stories in the form of incredible animated shorts. These have gone on to become our trailers for Armello, the game. \nThese trailers are not all that we want to do and are certainly not the end of our collaborations with 12 Field. We have so many more stories to tell and incredible ideas on how to do just that. \nIf you enjoy the animated shorts we produce with our friends at 12 Field, the best way you can see more collaborations between 12 Field and League of Geeks is to support Armello and this kickstarter.\nShare the trailers far and wide and tell all your friends to do the same!\nThe Bandit Clan!\nCompletely exclusive to backers, this rag tag bunch of bandits is your chance to really show off your support of Armello! Whatever your play style, you'll find a friend in one of these rambunctious heroes! Also comes with access to four signet rings and unique Bandit Clan dice!\nIn-Game Backer Dice\nRoll with style with these unique backer exclusive dice that you can use in-game! Will only ever be available to backers.  \n'Listen' Amulet\nGet the special 'Listen' power amulet and equip it to your hero in order to gain the King's ear whenever you're called to council. In the right hands, it could be the perfect edge to help sway victory in your favour...\nLimited Edition Physical Soundtrack \nComposed by Michael Allen and Lisa Gerrard, and mastered by Jacek Tuschewski, this beautifully packaged limited edition Armello soundtrack will never be printed again. A serious collector's item. Four discs packed with tracks from the game, b-sides and bonus tracks, atmospheric audioscapes from Armello, the audiobooks and an intimate conversation with the entire Armello audio team. \n eBooks\nA set of five (5) short stories featuring gorgeous illustrations and penned by Armello writer and designer, Trent Kusters.

Lovingly designed and made, now you can keep Armello's unluckiest squire by your side thanks to this adorable plushy!

It's our dream game. We believe in it and we believe we are making something truly special. \nWe've thrown our heart and soul into this project, working outside of our day jobs; after work, on weekends and through holidays for over two and a half years. We've been funding development costs with our own savings and some government grants, but now we need your support to get the core team together for the final push!\nWith your support we can work on Armello during business hours and devote the best part of our days to finishing the game to the highest possible quality and as soon as possible.\nWith your support not only does PC become a reality, but Mac and Linux. Android and Windows tablets are possible if we reach the required stretch goal!\nWith your support you'll directly help us bring Armello to life, and build an experience that's custom made for lovers of strategic board and video games. A game where the little details matter. A dream board game brought to life that's specially made for you.\nWith your support... GUPPY LIVES! <3\nLoG is an indie game development collective comprising talented professionals from video game development and other industries.\nLoG's Directors: Ty Carey, Blake Mizzi, Trent Kusters & Jacek Tuschewski\nLoG\u2019s four Directors (pictured above) wield over four decades of game development experience and have shipped over 50 titles. However, this time, we\u2019re rewriting the playbook. Creative freedom and independence is at the core of League of Geeks and is made possible by a unique production model specifically designed to bring together talented collaborators from all over the world.\nFor the past two years, almost all of LoG's contributors have been working on Armello for a share in the game's profits. The LoG structure of distributing a project's profits to the developers means every single team member working on Armello is invested in making the best game possible. \nThe Armello team is filled with seriously talented folk from multiple industries and mediums. Renowned veterans to bright upcoming talent. From trailers, feature films, audio and special effects to art, games, production and design. Armello's team members have worked on licenses the likes of Warhammer, Darksiders, the Bioshock series, Pokemon, Puzzle Quest and many, many more. \nThis spectrum of creatives have come together purely because they believe in the project. No one is collecting a weekly pay check and just showing up because its a job. This is a project of real collaboration, of creative freedom at our personal bests. This is our passion project.\nWe've got what it takes to do this. You won't be disappointed. \n<3 LoG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTESTING PERIOD: \nWith a game like Armello, you can never know how long the game will have to remain in beta for. Although we can be quick on our feet, good testing and implementation of feedback takes time and the more you rush it, well... the shittier your game will be. For backers, a final release may not be so bad, as the majority of you will be playing the game from beta onwards, but if you're waiting for the full release there is the chance that due to illusive issues or stubborn design challenges the game may remain in beta for longer than expected. \n\nNEW STUDIO, NEW GAME:\nA lot of us have been working together for multiple years, and most of us have spent ten plus years in our respective industries, however... we\u2019re still a new studio making its debut game and working in an unprecedented way. So make no mistake, there will be bumps along the way. Game development is tough. Always. You have our word though, this game is getting made and it's going to be incredible.

We'll be opening the doors to our Kickstarter backers on June 21st. We'll contact our backers through email with installation instructions on or slightly before that day.\nContinue to follow us at Webhook.com\nWhat is Webhook and who is it for? \nWebhook takes the pain out of building content sites that need more functionality than blog software can provide. It allows you to build custom forms (not just posts) for your CMS without having to code or configure any code-like files. Anyone who knows basic HTML and CSS can build and deploy a site on Webhook. Once complete, anyone with an Internet connection can use the CMS to edit the website using a desktop, mobile or tablet device.\nThe entire CMS works in mobile so you can edit your site on the go.\nSee it in action\nWebhook's documentation is already online. We've also created a few videos where we walk through some sample site builds.\n[VIDEO] - Build a simple blog with a podcast.\n[VIDEO] - Build a one-page band site.\n[VIDEO] - Build a large media portal with multiple authors, reviews, interviews and relational data.\n[VIDEO] - Make a theme from an existing Webhook site.\nWebhook features\nWebhook uses a hybrid static approach to building your site. Your data is stored with Firebase in a JSON format that you can access in real-time and through the CMS. The site itself is deployed statically so that it loads as fast as possible without needing to hit a database or front-end server.\nInstalls in one line through NPM. The only requirement is Node. There is no database to setup or other software to install. It just works.\nWorks on plain ol' Windows (without Apache or anything else) as well as Mac and Linux computers.\nDeploy your site in one line. There is no infrastructure to build or manage.  We host the site, you point over your custom domain.\nFile uploads and image resizing built in. We take care of it. Seamlessly resize your images at the template layer to whatever sizes you need.\nSearch is built in. All your content is available through search as soon as you create it. Again, it just works.\nDjango-like templating We use Swig JS for our templates. That means you get the power of template extension. Want to call something from the CMS? Use a simple template tag on any page.\nComes with dozens of form widgets to build out your forms. Image galleries, markdown fields, wysiwyg fields, audio uploaders... we handle just about any content needs you require.\nScaffolds clean HTML. We generate scaffolding HTML for any form you create. No need to look up names or read documentation just to output your content. Simply add your design.\nWorks well with teams. Webhook works great with versioning systems like Github and can be worked on by a team of developers. Editors can edit the CMS at the same time and enjoy real-time updates.\nThemes are just git repos. Themes in Webhook not only define the look of your site but also the forms contained in the actual CMS. This allows you to do heavy customization without anything more than static files hosted on Github.\nWhy do you need it?\nThe content management system you're likely using right now is terrible. If by chance you're the Developer building things with it, well... it's doubly terrible.\nWhat do you get?\nAll Rewards above the $5 level come with the following.\nEarly Access\nKickstarter backers will get access to Webhook at least one-month before it's available to the general public. Your kickstarter email address will be white-listed so you can try it out. We'll send these invites sometime in the month of June, 2014.\nHosting at a reduced price.\nHosting is built into Webhook. Depending upon the reward you choose you'll receive at least one-month of hosting for your site. Continuing to use Webhook past this period is completely voluntary and will incur a monthly subscription fee of $20 a month. This price will only be available to Kickstarter backers and last for as long as you host your site with Webhook.\nThere are no other fees or add-on prices with Webhook. We provide a simple way to use a custom domain with your site. You can not use Webhook to build sites specifically for the use of file-sharing or other bandwidth-intense operations.\nThe reduced price will be good for any sites you create (in case you plan to build multiple sites).\nWhy should you trust us?\nWe've done similar stuff before. Dave Snider designed and founded Giant Bomb, Comic Vine, Tested.com and TV.com. We've designed and built CMS software from scratch to support large teams of editors at Whiskey Media, CNET and CBS. These sites currently receive millions of unique visitors a month and are in use by dozens of editors. We know the pain points in the field and know what it takes to build quality software. Dave is also a bit of a nut for documentation and recently redesigned the theme for Read the Docs, which is used by thousands of Open Source developers.\nIan Kelly, Dave Snider and Mike Horn.\nHow does it work... really?\nWebhook's local environment is a Grunt task that compiles Swig JS templates (similar to Django) into static HTML. The CMS itself is an Ember app (a single cms.html page that can load anywhere) and the data layer is real-time JSON powered by Firebase. Search is powered by Elastic Search.\nWhen you deploy your site we package up your templates and static files, pushing them up to our servers. When any user make changes to the live CMS we run a fresh build and regenerate the site for you. If you decide to later change your templates, redeploy the site and we'll build it again.\n1. Create a site on your local Windows, Mac or Linux machine.\n2. Serve the site locally, use our form-builder to create forms.\n3. We scaffold templates from your form. You add design.\n4. Deploy your site with \"wh deploy\". Invite friends into the live CMS to add or edit content. Don't worry, you can use your own custom domain.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe'd like to stay independent. Taking money from venture capital would pressure us into building growth instead of building a better product. At our listed goal we believe we can continue working on Webhook without outside investment. If that keeps us small, so be it. We're builders at heart.\nPut another way, our dream is no more than to provide a solid, well-respected product at a fair price. Kickstarter seemed like a better fit under those aspirations. It validates the need for this kind of product and lets us plan a few months into the future.\nWhat will you do with the funds?\nWe'll put it on the screen against the following:\nFree themes\nAs it stands right now Webhook has a limited number of preset themes to choose from. We'd like to hire a few well-respected designers to build some great starter sites (a blog site, an indie-game site, an artist's portfolio, a multi-editor news portal...etc) while we build out the CMS. Webhook is extremely powerful in the hands of a good designer, but most people aren't going to have the time to design from scratch. We'd like to give them a starting point.\nInfrastructure\nIt's our duty to make sure Webhook is reliable and available at all times. To do that we need some initial capital to build the hosting infrastructure needed for those magic one-line deploys. We'd really like to over-provide in this area and unfortunately it can be expensive.\nPeople\nAny extra funds we receive past our goal will go into hiring engineers and designers to make Webhook better.\nI want to see the code!\nWebhook's CMS, CSS, JS libraries, local run-server and command line tools will be available on Github when we release in June. We're looking into ways to release the production server as well so you can self-host, but that will likely come later in the year.\nYou can look at the actual template logic in our documentation which has plenty of examples.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a software project of this size the biggest risk is that will we will slip past our launch window. Although Webhook as a product is nearly complete, the hosting component becomes more difficult the more users we have using it. This could lead to a situation where an extremely successful Kickstarter might force us to slowly drip users into the system over the course of weeks instead of days.

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nFor two years I have been looking for a great dice game.\nDRAGON SLAYER is that game.\nDragon Slayer has everything I wanted in Indie Boards & Cards' first dice game:\nIt's fast playing, games take 15 minutes, so you can play while waiting for friends to arrive, in line, or over and over again all night long.\nIt has dragons that you are trying to kill.\nIt has dragon dice, dragons that are trying to kill you.\nIt's a \"press your luck\" classic, roll till you stop, go too far and you'll die.\nDid I mention that your friends are trying to get you killed?\nThat\u2019s right, it is a dice game with a twist \u2013 real player interaction! Think your friend pressed his luck too far \u2013 challenge him to keep going. If he does, he can score big \u2013 but if he fails or worst yet doesn\u2019t take the challenge, he\u2019ll lose points and you get some.\nDragon Slayer plays 2 - 5 players, but we are including everything you need to play with 6 in the box.\nFast, Fun and Full of spite \u2013 what more could you ask for?\n Dragon Slayer is a great game, but you can\u2019t know that yet. So if you are getting a reward from our recent Coup Reformation project, then we can add Dragon Slayer to your Reformation rewards and pass along the combined shipping savings to you. A great game at a fantastic price is good deal for everyone. Didn\u2019t back Reformation? Dragon Slayer is still a great game, and you can add extra copies at the same price. And you\u2019ll help us reach our stretch goals.\nIt\u2019s a dice game with 12 custom dice, nice art, detailed rules and six challenge tokens for 7 bucks \u2013 so you know that we can\u2019t get crazy. But I would like to give backers a few extras in addition to a fantastic price. And since this is mass produced, we need to make a minimum number to be able to offer special items.\nSo stretch rewards are based on number of backers (not counting those that aren\u2019t getting rewards, just counting those that are in at the $7 level and above)\n1000 Backers \u2013 Metallic Ink Dice: It looks cool, it is cool. Everyone will know that you got the special edition as soon as you take them out.\nAchieved!\n3000 Backers \u2013 Foil Box: We all like shiny, and a nice shiny game box is a great way to get your friends to play. We can\u2019t understand why, but we all know that it happens. So help us get more backers and we\u2019ll get a box that screams \u201cPlay Me!\u201d \nAchieved!\n4,000 Games - Battlemat: The Battlemat is a convenient way to track your turn during the game. It's been designed to help you quickly learn and teach the game by emphasizing the core game rules and steps in your turn.\nAchieved!\n5,000 Games - Score tracker:  a compact scoreboard with small cubes to track each player's progress and tokens to remind everyone what color they are!\nAchieved!\n6,000 Games - Score tracker for 6 players & and a 2nd copy of the Battlemat: Even though we are listing the game as supporting 2-5 players, there is no theoretical maximum number of players. We are including challenge tokens to support up to 6 (or have an extra if you lose one), so it makes sense that we could also include scoring markers for that 6th player as well. If we get 6000 committed games in this project, we will include the 6th player in green.\nACHIEVED!\nALL STRETCH REWARDS UNLOCKED!\nNote - These stretch goal upgrades won't be included in the retail version of the game that is sold via distribution.\nNick Hayes (a full time game designer, as well as a illustrator & graphic designer) did a great job on the box and game component art as you can see here:\nAs you might have expected in a PYL (push your luck) game, there are dice! 12 dice, 10 different with only the 3 warrior dice repeated. Each of the dragon dice have different head, wing and tail designs that really add to the \"wow\" factor. And yes these are molded dice - not silkscreened, so they will be durable. Also in the box are the challenge tokens - enough to support games with up to 6 players, though we are listing on the box that this will play 2-5.\nGame designer David Mortimer really made this game shine - creating a new PYL game is a deceptively difficult challenge, and he did this one right.  The rules can be found here. Like all great PYL games, the rules are simple, format of repeating the Dragon Hunt until you decide to stop. The very interesting twist is the player challenges. The ability to challenge, and rewards for passing or failing when challenged, add a dimension to everything that you do on your turn. What order do you go after dragons? When do you stop? When do you challenge? Who do you challenge? How do you get others not to challenge you?\nDon't get me wrong, it is still a classic PYL game with rules that are easy to learn and teach - it is just that the challenges really do add something very interesting to the genre and nicely complement the rest of the great design ideas that David has incorporated in Dragon Slayer.\nI really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the Indie Boards and Cards, and be able to offer this fantastic deal to those that helped us blow the roof off the Reformation project. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nThank you for supporting us!\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where it is ready; your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages. In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio. Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has another project that is due for deliver (Coup Reformation expansion), that game will be produced at the same time as this game. As the artwork is already done for both games this should not present a great risk.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Editions of Reformation, Extreme Danger and Dragon Slayer, available from Indie Boards and Cards via Amazon", "update_content": "Thank you for your support of this project, and many others from Indie Boards and Cards.\nEvery year we make more copies of the Kickstarter Edition than we absolutely need - we have to forecast for copies that are lost/damaged in delivery as well as supporting conventions that we attend and often times have to place the final orders before projects end to try to get games to you as quickly as possible.

What an amazing community of supporters! All my thanks!***\nThe Agents is a new strategic card game for 2-5 players, that introduces a unique \u2018Double-edged cards\u2019 mechanic into the undercover world of covert operations and espionage.\nThe Agents is a deceptively simple card game; easy to learn, set up and start playing, but underpinned by intricate decision-making gameplay. Players must join their Agents into Factions, assign Missions and take their opponents down, to gather intel and win the most points.\nFeaturing the captivating artwork of collaborator Danny Morison (aka Dark Mechanic), \u2018The Agents\u2019 will challenge your imagination and brain power as you plan, plot and scheme your way to victory.\nThe Agents gameplay is based on a unique, new mechanic we call \u2018Double-edged Cards\u2019. Each Agent card features a \u2018command\u2019 on one end of the card and \u2018points\u2019 on the other end. However, the direction in which you place the card will determine from which asset you benefit. If you choose to perform the command, one of your opponents will get the points. If you keep the points for yourself, an opponent gets to perform the command.\nThroughout the game, you\u2019ll need both commands and points to advance. Commands will allow you to manipulate Agents, control your Factions, and influence other players. But you\u2019ll need points to buy more Agents and Missions. And ultimately, the player with the most points wins.\nDeciding how to place each card will require strategic precision and calculated foresight, as you try to further your own goals, and prevent your opponents from reaching theirs.\n\"Once you've lived the inside-out world of espionage, you never shed it. It's a mentality, a double standard of existence.\" - John le Carre\nThis \u2018quick and dirty\u2019 Kickstarter campaign is a follow-up campaign to last summer\u2019s first outing for The Agents. It\u2019s a chance for you to get the (updated) original Base Set and (revised) original expansions, Kickstarter exclusive merchandise and of course, The Fancy Box. I\u2019ve also created 3 brand new expansions to add to the mix.\nBy listening to backer feedback, I\u2019ve also tweaked the rules by making subtle changes for substantial improvement to gameplay. A few screws tightened and some nips and tucks here and there gave birth to this \"The Agents Mark II\" version*. And this next production run will also see upgraded component quality, packaging and shipping methods, but with the same level of personal, attentive customer support.\n*If you own the original Kickstarter edition of the previous campaign, you can download the Mark II rulebook here, and the complete rules for the expansions here.\nEVENTS: Things just got real. This new deck is filled with cards that are played during and throughout the turns of the game, introducing unexpected events that force you to think on your feet and be ready for anything. Events make the game unpredictable and volatile. You\u2019ll need all your wits about you to stay ahead when everything around you is shifting.\nBREAK THE RULES: Screw the rules! Spice up your gameplay with rule-breaking cards that set up new game conditions from the start of the game that make every game different and much more dangerous. This mega-expansion includes 3 different expansions; a new Break-The-Rules deck, Commanders deck and Sites deck.\nBOUNTIES: Get your rivals to do your dirty work. By putting a bounty on an Agent\u2019s head, you can manipulate your opponents to do your bidding. This expansions forces you to enlist the help of other players to get the job done. But WHO is the job? This expansion also contains brand new, much requested, point TOKENS!\nWe've also beefed up the original expansions and made them available to new backers who want to get in on the action:\nSPECIAL AGENTS: Boost your deck of agents with a reinforcement of highly lethal professionals. Featuring new abilities and powerful commands that make gameplay even more intense and dangerous.\nPARTNERS: Team up with this group of highly skilled supporting agents that will keep you covered and add another dimension to the game.\nSECRET AGENTS: An elite unit of dead silent operatives who promote your objectives through the art of secrecy and disinformation.\nMISSION CRITICAL: High-stakes and high-jinx in this bundle of extra  missions. Perform brutal maneuvers and make painful decisions in order to win, and win big!\nThis is the Box of all Boxes. The sturdiest, most robust game Box ever imagined or produced. With reinforced sides, a strong magnetic closure, firm foam insert and room for the base set decks and each and every expansion, this magnificently designed Box is an integral part of \u2018The Agents experience\u2019.\n These figurines are true collectibles. Limited edition, limited run, they complete 'The Agents experience'.\nThe Agents Artbook is a must-have for all backers who are addicted to Danny\u2019s breathtaking artwork. This bumper Artbook contains full color prints of the artwork featured across the whole game as well as shows some \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 and \u2018making of\u2019 features. With anecdotes, fiction and annotations by Saar and Danny, this is a true collector\u2019s piece.\nFor the first time, you can display full color prints of artwork from The Agents in your home, your office or your safe-house. Danny has created brand new pieces of art especially for this purpose.\nWe\u2019ve also done something pretty cool. We\u2019ve invited a few brilliant artists from around the world to let their imaginations run wild and create their very own take on \u2018The Agents world\u2019. Each artist has a uniquely different style, so these new illustrations bring a whole new perspective on The Agents and the dark, mysterious world of espionage that they inhabit. We have produced a limited number of highest quality posters - check out the full line-up here.\nMore games = more fun! If you just can't wait to get your hands on The Agents, we'll send you a first edition copy of the game as soon as the campaign ends so you can start playing it 3 months earlier. If you simply want to add more copies of the brand new base set to your bundle, go right ahead!\nSaar Shai (Agent \"Steel Storm\") - Creator of The Agents, Saar is one of those quirky inventor types, who not only has outlandish ideas from his armchair but also gets off his butt and works really hard to make them a reality. From flexible screen interfaces, to ring device controllers, and from game-theory platforms to card games with a twist, Saar's mind comes up with weird and wonderful ideas all centered on making the 'user experience' as fun, rewarding and engaging as possible. With a background in intellectual property and advertising and a day job running a start-up, Saar is now turning his first love - gaming - into his full time passion.\nDanny Morison (Agent \"Dark Mechanic\") - Illustrator of The Agents, Danny was brought up on a diet of 80's cartoons, lots of Transformers and also an early fixation with dinosaurs, so he began drawing from a very early age. He loves science fiction and fantasy, and especially how you could create worlds and characters with just your hands and imagination. After leaving university with an Illustration degree under his belt, Danny since worked as a storyboarder, character designer, concept artist, illustrator and poster and flyer designer, but never gave up his initial love of science fiction and fantasy. His style is maybe a bit different to the industry standard but he hopes to one day be able to live off what he loves doing most - creating fantastical worlds, colorful illustrations and drawing really, really big robots!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI believe that I've got the risks down to a bare minimum.

Battles are fought by skillfully flicking different types of wooden pieces across the game board.  The board and obstacles are setup according to the instructions on a series of room cards. \nPlayers shoot their Heroes across the board, trying to kill all the monsters in the room. Once all the Heroes have completed their actions, the Overseer performs all the monster actions in retaliation. When all the monsters are dead, the Heroes collect their treasure and move on to the next room.  Items to upgrade your Hero can be purchased from the Merchant.\nIf the Heroes have survived all the rooms, they will battle their most powerful opponent, one of the Catacomb Lords. The Heroes win when the Catacomb Lord has been defeated.\nCheck out the Kickstarter Exclusive Add-Ons at the bottom of this page!\nHeroes\nCatacomb Lords\nGame Play Video\nA quick introductory video of what it is like to play Catacombs that we put together at our office.

Receiving a BFA in Illustration from Art Center College of Design, and working steadily illustrating a variety of projects since, he has a particular love for that space where art meets gaming.\nWhy use Kickstarter?\nWe've been building the Catacombs world since 2009 and are very proud of the original game and expansions. We are now looking to improve on the original and make the best possible version.\nWe will be doing this in various ways. The first is by updating the art. While the original game art is dark and gothic, we will be moving to a brighter and more playful style. Some aspects of the original game were created by an artist but much of the graphic design was done in-house. With this new version, we will be hiring a professional artist to do a complete art conversion.\nThere will also be upgraded components including new pieces and improvements to the boards which will be bigger and have new graphics.\nWe are also trying to be more environmentally responsible. The FSC, or the Forest Stewardship Council, is an international organization that strives to improve forest management on a global scale. This can mean protecting biodiversity, areas of environmental sensitivity and worker's rights among other things. Although we can't be 100% FSC compliant, we will be striving to get as close as possible. \nIt takes a lot to design and deliver a board game. Not only are the costs of manufacturing and distribution on the rise, but the time and effort needed is a full-time job.  Without your help, we won't be able to make this project happen.\nThanks so much for your support!\nStretch Goal List\nThese Add-Ons are available starting at the $55 Level and will be available in both English and German. Check the FAQ below for more details on how to pledge for Add-Ons.\nThe Zombie Horde Kickstarter exclusive add-on introduces a new monster family based on the zombies.  The set includes 7 monster reference cards and 18 wooden pieces.  The full monster list:  zombie (the original from the base game updated with limited edition artwork), claw zombie, tomb zombie, zombie faerie, zombie ratman, zombie knight and zombie necromancer.  More details available here.\nThe Chicks In A Catacomb Kickstarter exclusive add-on introduces four new powerful heroes for maximum replayability:  the forest sprite, amazon, huntress (with her wolf companion) and the fire mage with the ability to summon an antient. Additional spells and other content will be included.  More details available here.\nThis Add-On is intended for people who already own the original Catacombs base game but would like a set of wooden pieces with the new art. It's also for anyone who would like to have an extra set of wooden pieces.

Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter at www.IndieBoardsAndCards.com to be informed of our next project.\nHave a question? Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nCoup gets even bigger with a special edition expansion.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce this exciting expansion for all the fans of our hugely successful Coup kickstarter last year. That project exceeded even our highest expectations and I am confident that almost every one of our backers got a great game that they enjoyed and played with their friends.  It was clear that many of those friends ended up buying a copy for themselves because we went through a bunch in a very short amount of time (and are still waiting for the reprint of the retail version to arrive).  That kind of response is amazing, Rikki and I couldn't be more excited than to have so many people enjoy this great game.  Making games that are fun to play and get enjoyed around the world is why we make them!\nReformation is exciting expansion to Coup, and to celebrate the successes of the game we are launching a special edition of the expansion via kickstarter.  Reformation KS Edition starts off where our last project finished - it is a special version of the expansion that won't go into distribution and it already has all of its stretch goals unlocked.  If you want to be the first to get this special edition and get it at a great price then you will want to pledge for this project.\nAnd if you missed getting Coup last year, or want to get both the Reformation Expansion and the Coup base game at the same time we are also offering a special combination package (Reformation & Coup KS edition) that has many of promo items that you might have missed.\nIn addition to developing great games, we have also been focused on improving our US & international shipping processes.  That means we can offer even lower shipping costs to almost everywhere in the world and we are offering a special \"add on\" rates for those that might have missed out on one of our earlier releases.\nSo thank you in advance for your support - we are super excited to be able to bring another great title to your gaming table.\nDriven by their successes, the resistance has gained popular support and entire regions are in open rebellion.In a desperate attempt to stay in control, some government leaders are publically supporting the reforms demanded by the resistance.But allegiances are constantly shifting, and can be bought for the right price.\nThe opportunity for intrigue and bluff has never been greater.The cost of failure couldn\u2019t be higher.Even with talk of reformation, only one can survive.\nReformation is an expansion to Coup, a copy of Coup is required to play.Reformation adds Allegiances \u2013 players are either in support of the government (Loyalists) or the resistance (Reformists). Reformation also includes the Inquisitor variant, and additional role cards to expand play up to 10 players.\nOriginally introduced in a very limited edition at Essen 2013 that sold out in hours, Reformation is a perfect expansion to an already great game adding a new layer of manipulation and deceit for Coup fanatics. If you\u2019d like more information about Reformation please read this review posted here.\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nCoup is a lightning fast game of bluff and manipulation for 2-6 players.If you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer:\n If you don\u2019t already have Coup, you will need to get it in order to use the Reformation expansion.The Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels (starting at $30) is a great way to get both at the same time or to upgrade your retail copy to include all the nice little extras of the kickstarter edition (alternative art cards & foil coins).\nWant to combine the two reward levels and get one (or more) copies of the Reformation & Coup Kickstarter Editions with one (or more) of the Reformation Kickstarter Editions?  See update #6 for details by clicking here.\nWe made this very easy for everyone and reduced the chances of a project delay at the same time!Based on our past kickstarter projects we are going to include all the stretch goals as soon as the project funds \u2013 we have everything ready to go to the printers to reduce the time between your pledge and when you receive your rewards.That might sound like a cope out, but this isn\u2019t a project where you get the planned retail version of the game and a few extras \u2013 the rewards in this project are a very special edition of this expansion that won\u2019t be available through game distributors.This project is really intended for the Coup fanatics out there!\nSo as soon we reach our funding goal, every copy of rewards will include these stretch rewards that won\u2019t be part of the Reformation expansion retail edition:\nGold Foil Box \u2013 To keep costs as low as possible, the retail version of Reformation is packed in a blister card and everything fits in your original Coup box.That won\u2019t work if you have either of the kickstarter editions; it certainly won\u2019t work if you have both the Reformation kickstarter edition and the Coup kickstarter edition.We\u2019ve redesigned the Reformation box in a very attractive gold finish that is sure to grab everyone\u2019s attention that sees it.But it isn\u2019t just a pretty face \u2013 we\u2019ve made the box slightly wider and taller so that it fits all the cards and coins with just a little extra room.It is still a compact box so you can bring it everywhere that you might want to enjoy Coup.\nMore Alternative Art Cards \u2013 The alternative art cards from kickstarter last year have been a huge success, so we are doubling down here and introducing two more sets of alternative art cards for all 6 characters \u2013 two new dukes, two new contessas, two new captains, two new assassins, two new ambassadors and two new inquisitors.These alternative art cards aren't just pretty to look at, they serve a functional purpose as they make slight modification to how the game is played with the potential to introduce more logic into the game.When combine with Coup kickstarter edition (or via the Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels) you will have enough alternative art cards to play up to 10 with unique art on every card.\nGold Foil Coins \u2013 Reformation doesn\u2019t really need any more coins to play than what comes in the Coup box, and the retail version won\u2019t have any additional coins.But these new gold foil coins really do shine, and they are so much fun to play with.Just don\u2019t let the other players target you because you have one!\nAnd if you back at the Reformation & Coup KS levels ($30 and above) you\u2019ll also get these stretch goals from our past Coup kickstarter rewards:\nAlternative Art Cards \u2013 The original set of alternative art cards for all 6 characters two different dukes, two different contessas, two different captains, two different assassins, two different ambassadors and two different inquisitors.In total it is enough to play up to 10 players with different art on every card \u2013 quite a fun experience especially combined with the Allegiance mechanics in Reformation!\nSilver Foil Coins \u2013 The shiny coins were a big hit and we are bringing them back for those that missed them the first time.These are something that the printer wasn\u2019t sure they could do, but they turned out great and add just enough to the game to really make it stand out on your table.\nFor a complete diagram of what comes in each version of Reformation - please see UPDATE #2 by clicking here\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Coup Reformation.Prices for each of these add-ons are shown as $X / $Y / $Z.US and Canadian Shipping address add $X for that item, EU addresses add $Y and every else in the world adds $Z to their pledge to get that add on.All add on items will be shipped at the same time as your Coup Reformation rewards and to the same address.These special prices are for the retail versions only and do not include promotional items from past kickstarter projects.\n The Resistance: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 watch it played on TableTop: \nThe Resistance: Avalon: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 Watch it played on Shut Up & Sit Down:\nFlash Point: Fire Rescue: $28/$35/$42\nUrban Structures or 2nd Story or Dangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansions): $10/$14/$15\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion):$28/$35/$42\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion):$8/$10/$10\nWatch Drakkenstrike's video review:\nSnowdonia:$50/$60/$65 \nJungfraubahn & Mt.

Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $97 ($23 + $60 + $14).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $23 (International Shipping, non-EU Address) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $103 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $29 (Brazil Shipping) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $29 reward level and pledge $109 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nWe will ask which add-ons you wanted in the project survey that will be sent out shortly after the project ends.\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this special edition of the expansion - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.  \nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of at this time of the year.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio.   Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner. \n\nThis is a first edition of the expansion - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. \n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Our Quest ends tomorrow!", "update_content": "Our latest social deduction game by Don Eskridge, designer of The Resistance and Avalon is ending soon on Kickstarter!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition is up (and in it's final hours).

Issued to neighboring regions, he called for only the most skilled architects to aid in the construction of a grand tower--one so tall that it would touch the heavens!\nIn Tower, players take the role of talented architects who must collect, purchase, and build their way to victory--but watch out for the unsavory thugs of the black market, who would happily help you along just as quickly as they would stab you in the back on behalf of your competitors... it all depends on who's footing the bill. The first player to build all three of his/her tower segments is the winner!\nHere is a wonderful play-through of a 2-player game from All Us Geeks:\nWant more information?\nClick here for the full rulebook.\nClick here for the Print & Play files.\nEach copy of Tower comes with:\nBefore this campaign, a prototype of Tower was available at The Game Crafter for almost a year where it found its way into the homes of many play-testers and reviewers. Additionally, Tower has made a few public appearances at local gaming events. Here are some things that people have had to say about Tower:\nTower also received a heaping helping of constructive feedback that I have used to tighten the experience and clarify the rules. The result is a game that is intuitive, fun to play, and a joy to look at thanks to the beautiful and whimsical illustrations from artist Derek Bacon.\nHere's a review from To The Table:\nHere's a video featuring Jenni Brush and Cody Parcel--two of Tower's play-testers:\nHuge thanks to Ron Petersen for filming and putting this together!\nClick here for the full Father Geek review\nClick here for Tower's BGG page\nIf you would like to add one or more of the items below to your pledge, simply increase the dollar amount of your pledge by the price listed under each add-on. After the campaign is over, but long before shipping begins, I will send out a survey to ask you what add-ons you included in your pledge.\nFor example, if you pledge at the $29 level, but would also like to have inventory randomizers, simply increase your pledge amount by $4 for a total of $33. If you would like to have both the inventory randomizer and the game mat, increase your pledge by $24 for a total of $53. Due to shipping costs, you must back at the Builder level or higher to get an add-on (This of course includes the Early Builder!).\n$4 - Market Inventory Randomizers\nThis add-on includes 18 cardstock tokens with the same designs found on the inventory spaces of each market tile. At the start of a game, they can be randomly distributed over each space to make things more unpredictable.\n$20 - Roll-Up Game Mat\nIllustrated by Derek Bacon, this unnecessary-but-totally-righteous roll-up mat depicts a beautiful view of the city and has spaces for all of the game's components. This mat measures 11x17\" and has an 1/8\" rubber backing.\n$25 - Extra Copy\nGrab additional copies of Tower for only $25 each.

We finished 500 backers strong, but did experience some delays. We were fortunate enough to hit every stretch goal we set, which resulted in a long period of art creation before finally sending off the final game to the manufacturer.\n\nI've also been an avid Kickstarter backer, and have noticed many trends that can hold up a game in development. To avoid these delays, I've taken steps to finish as much legwork as possible ahead of time:\n\n\u2022 Thanks to Tower's time at The Game Crafter, I've had a year to collect feedback and hone the game's rulebook into something I'm very confident is clear, concise, and appealing. Furthermore, and again thanks to The Game Crafter, I've been able to nail down all of the specs on Tower's printed components.\n\n\u2022 Derek Bacon has been working on Tower's artwork for a long time, and I'm pleased to be able to say that it was 100% complete (barring a few possible stretch goals!) before the launch of this campaign.\n\n\u2022 I have been in talks with Doug Vine from Quality Playing Cards & Games since May of last year.

Heroes Wanted was designed and thoroughly tested over the last year to ensure the most awesome game experience possible. Whether from fellow designers, knowledgeable reviewers, or players like you, the feedback is universal: this is a fantastic, unique game with wide appeal and an insane amount of replayability.\nWe have put together the best team possible. Travis R. Chance's first published game Infamy was recently released and lauded as a Top 10 Game of 2013 by Dice Tower's Dan King. Nick Little was the key developer of Infamy and is the designer of the forthcoming game Abracazebra.  Additionally, we have a roster of talented artists, as well as creators of other successful Kickstarter projects such as Grave Digger and Henchmen. Our collective understanding and insight into all elements of project production ensure not only the highest quality product, but also that Heroes Wanted will be print-ready and manufacturing will begin immediately after our Kickstarter ends.\nThe game is full of original, incredible character and board illustrations by the very talented Ryan Howe and Christopher Byer.\nAs backers, you will be the very first to receive Heroes Wanted.\nAll backers will receive any over-funding goals we achieve throughout the campaign (and we have some cool ones in store).\nA print and play download version of the game will be provided to all backers at the end of the campaign. This will be BYOM (bring your own meeples... and pawns... and dice.)\nThe game and art content is already designed, now we need the capital to manufacture and ship the game to awesome backers like you!\n DESPITE WHAT THE GRAPHIC SAYS, WE HAVE LOWERED OUR $150K STRETCH GOAL TO $140K!!!

Whether you are playing solo, in campaign mode, or duking it out against other eager crime fighters, Heroes Wanted offers a near limitless amount of replayability and customization.\nWatch our gameplay walk-through video for a taste of the Heroes Wanted experience:\nHeroes Wanted utilizes a unique hand management system that presents players with interesting, tactical decisions each turn. Players will use powerful cards for a variety of actions, allowing them to move, attack, and defend from not only villains and minions, but also each other. These actions vary based upon your hero type: Cosmic, Mutant, Tech, and Vigilante. Each hero type has access to specific special action cards, mechanics, and strategies.\nHeroes Wanted is not just about beating up the bad guys. Each hero is more than just cards and mechanics. Quirks immerse players into the personality of their hero using an innovative, modular game feature that adds hilarious interactions to each game. Quirks represent the, well\u2026 quirky aspect of your particular hero. Sure, you want to be in The Champions of Zeta City, but on your terms!

But rest assured: we have done extensive research. We've talked with many existing publishers, game designers, and successful Kickstarters all with the single aim of bringing the best quality product not only in play but also in production. We've spent thousands of hours designing and playtesting over the past year with strangers, friends, and family of all ages and gaming demographics. We've spent months planning the manufacturing and deployment of Heroes Wanted, developing relationships and contacts in China so that we will be prepared to upload files and begin printing immediately following this campaign. We are as confident that we will be able to get this game in your hands promptly and at a level of quality that exceeds your expectations as we are that you will love it.\n\nOur biggest obstacle right now is quite simply funding successfully. Despite a very saturated hobby market where new games emerge weekly, we are confident that Heroes Wanted is not only a game worth backing, but one that gamers will keep in their collections for years to come. What we lack in custom plastic minis, we make up for with dynamic mechanics, tons of replay value, fantastic art, and as much fun as you can possibly pack into a box.\n\nThere are, of course, unforeseen issues that can impede any project like this. As we are having the game manufactured in China, it will be in a container being shipped across the sea. Issues with international customs could delay shipping, despite our legwork. And, while we have spent months cultivating relationships with these manufacturers, it is important to remember that this is our first game as publishers. Despite our lateral experience as designers, it is important to remind our backers of this fact while reinforcing that Heroes Wanted has been a labor of love for us for this last year.

Decide how many cards to play. Compare with your opponent to determine the result. Use special abilities to swing things your way where you can. You win the game when your opponent has discarded all their cards. What could be simpler? It ain't rocket science! Well, actually there is an argument for that possibility!\nFind oddball Aeronauts rules here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xb96d4jx2ans2ae/UM5RGuPSvz\n\"A more telling testament was my youngest asking to play [oddball Aeronauts] the next day, rather than rushing off to play the latest video game he and his buddies are into.\" - Norman Hunter, 'Big Game' reviews\nTo get a real feel for the gameplay, check out Rahdo Runs Through gameplay overview video -\nIf you want to try the game for yourself with our black and white, 54 card prototype Print & Play beta, then be our guest - http://goo.gl/41TYpA\n\u201coddball Aeronauts is a fun and light game with a quick pace. Easily portable, it would make for a great road trip game.\u201c - Derek Weller, \u2018i heart print and play\u2019 preview\nPlay-in-the-hand - Anywhere! Because oddball Aeronauts doesn't require a surface to play on it can literally be played anywhere! On a train, in the school yard, in a convention queue, in the college library (get back to your books you!), between gaming sessions - these are all very good and highly commendable places and circumstances for playing the game. \nWhat's in the Box?\nIn the Pilot Set you will get 81x cards: 2x core Faction decks of 24x cards, 6x Event cards and 27x deck-crafting cards. Plus you get the rules and a Leading Player Token.\nSimply shuffle the core Faction decks, add in some Events and play.\nWhen you've got a feel for the game you can start using the deck-crafting cards which are just sat there waiting for you to customise your factions.\nThe Purpose - The purpose of this project is to deliver a copy of the oddball Aeronauts Pilot Set right into your hands so you can start playing as soon as possible.\nThe Goal - The goal is to raise the funds to see the game through to completion, this includes getting it produced and shipping it out to you so you can get your sticky mitts on it.\nThe Plan - Like the game, it's simple. We've created the game and thoroughly play-tested it. We've created the world for the game and produced the majority of the artwork:\nThe card art is entirely unique to oddball Aeronauts. The core cards are almost complete and the remaining artwork is being done in-house by the same artist - Ash.\nWe have the manufacturing quotes, we've worked out our shipping costs, and we have worked out exactly how to fulfil all pledge levels and stretch goals with a solid timeline that results in . . . . .\nProjected Fulfilment Date - August 2014 for the Pilot Set.\nName the Crew\nWe want you to name card characters - approximately every two weeks we'll offer up a Pirate, Pendragon crew or Officer and ask you for name suggestions. At the end of the submission period we'll use one of the suggestions to name the character in question, then the name will appear on the card. Alongside this we will run a 'flash story' with the chosen name and character/s involved. You can find examples of previously chosen names and flash stories on our site here: http://themaverickmuse.com/oddball-aeronauts/oddball-tales/\nLook out for the chance to name the 2x Pilot Set Captains - only backers will have this opportunity.\n\"once you get familiar with how the cards work, it becomes a fascinating game.\" - Jonathan H.

One amongst those has stood out - an oddball Adventure Game where 2 to 6 players adventure in the oddball Realms.\nBut clearly this is future project which we'll be developing quietly in the background whilst bringing out the inevitable expansions to oddball Aeronauts - new factions, more cards to customise the existing factions, and deck rigging.\nWe'll also be calling on you to contribute flash stories and character ideas, so look out for more information on the oddball Realms appearing on our website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn 2008 we successfully self-published the War for Edath game. Using everything we learned from publishing that game (good and bad) we will use our experience to launch this Kickstarter project, along with further wisdom learned through researching the Kickstarter platform and observing (even backing) other projects.\n\nWe've factored in a buffer for unforeseen circumstances: printing set-backs, sea-monster attacks and the like. So we have a few weeks grace - if we need it - in there.\n\nNB: The custom cards will be started only after the standard Pilot Set art has been completed. These may be shipped separately but as soon as they are printed and ready they are on their way to you.\n\nWe've kept the project focused and streamlined in order to ensure fulfilment runs smoothly, i.e. you get your game lickety-split.\n\nPlease message me direct if you have any questions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "oddball Aeronauts 2 : Double the Trouble! - Live!!", "update_content": "Highly esteemed oddballians & Mavericks\nThe Maverick Muses cordially invite you to help deliver our newest baby \u2018Double the Trouble\u2019 into the world to join his/her sibling 'oddball Aeronauts'.\nYes, the Kickstarter for oddball Aeronauts 2 (affectionately dubbed 'Double the Trouble') is now live and we would be honoured to again receive your support.\nIf you would be so kind.\nBestestest wisheses"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "oddball Aeronauts 2 : Double the Trouble!", "update_content": "Remember, Remember, 5th November \nGunpowder, Treason and plo..\nHmmmm . . . scratch that!\nGunpowder, Boarding or Sail!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Missing In Action!", "update_content": "Sometimes it happens. oddball dirigibles take to the skies and vanish forever as if they passed across the Barracuda Triangle.

You can order the game on the official webpage!\nAbout Province\nProvince is a two player game where you must manage your resources and workers to build, complete goals, and score the most victory points to win! It features eurogame strategy and only takes about 25 minutes to play. It also fits in a 4\" x 4\" bag, so it's easy to take with you.\nTo succeed you need to manage a communal worker pool representing the available workers in your town. Players move their workers to generate resources (Labor and Coin) that are used to build the various Structures, which in turn effect resource generation. But your opponent can also move the workers leaving you without the resources you need! \nIf you want to know more you can download the current draft of the rules here. A number of fans have also provided translations of the draft rules into other languages: German, French, Spanish (Spain), Italian, Czech, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), and Mandarin Chinese. More are coming!\n(Now that the campaign is over the rules above will not reflect the final version, please check the official website or BoardGameGeek for updates!)\nOr for a quick fix, check out this \"How to Play\" video!\nThere are also a lot of subtitles options for the video, so if English isn't your first language, give those a try!\nWe've had offers for translations into Norwegian and Portuguese. So check back soon for those!\nCurious what other people think? We sent a the game to TheOneTAR to get some feedback, and she decided to make this video:\nWeaponsgrade has also put together a preview with a more in-depth overview:\nStill not sure about something? Ask a question in the comments!\nWe\u2019re no strangers to designing games with an economy of means. Last year we made a single card game called Shift that boiled down the essence of a Japanese style dueling CCG. This is a big box game with a small footprint. We\u2019ve designed and laid out all of the components to make it affordable and quick to deliver to everyone! The design work is done, and this game will go to press and out to backers as quickly as possible. By keeping the game small, we'll get it to you faster and spend more time making new ones. We\u2019ve got a busy year planned, and we\u2019re ready to print! \nWe care about how games are made and how they get to you. The game will be manufactured in the United States, so you're also funding proper living wages for the people making your game.\nYou\u2019ll receive a fresh slice of chipboard with all of the pieces ready to punch out and a bag to keep everything in. You might get even more! See below!\nWant more copies than we have on offer? Just back this project at the 4 copies tier, and add an additional $5 (+$2 for international) per copy.\nWe\u2019ve carefully picked stretch goals that stick to improving the quality of the final product. So please share this widely with your friends and family! The more people who support Province, the more awesome it will become!\n\n  Shift was our first Kickstarter project, and we learned a lot doing it. Sam designed the game to go on the back of his business card. Once we finished Shift, Sam set about designing a new game for his business card, and thus Province was born (but this time he's actually put it on his business card)!\nWe learned a lot last year, and we\u2019re working harder this year to bring you more! We've got a lot of scalable projects in the works, and we'll work to grow the games that people show the most interest in.

Each tile is made up of Fences to stake out land, and Brands to determine who the top dog in each area will be.\nOn a player's turn they will draw and play a tile, adding it to the map however they like.  Players want to make sure that their brands are not alone, but also are not out numbered.  \nWhen a tile is played that completes a fenced in area players score points based on the next biggest brand in the enclosure.

As for replay value, it\u2019s higher than expected for a game of this size.\" - MITCH LAVENDER \n\"It's portable, it's small, and it's really fun. The scoring system is where the game shines.\" - David Libby, BGG user\n\"The scoring mechanic is pretty clever: to score big, you want to build a big town, but not only do you need a lot of your brands in it, you also need somebody else to have a lot\u2014but not quite as many as you. That tension is what really makes the game interesting\" - Jonathan H Liu. - Geek Dad \nhttp://geekdad.com/2014/02/this-town-aint-big-enough/\n At TMG, we REALLY love games and publishing games. Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic micro games. Not just micro components and a micro footprint, but also a micro price.\nIt wasn't until about September of 2013 that we figured out a viable method for providing games like these at a quality level the fans of TMG have come to expect.\nSo, we have embraced a pay-what-you-want methodology with one modification, a minimum support level which covers our costs. At the suggested pledge level of $5, then we (TMG and the game designer) make a decent amount from your pledge.\nMost of all, we want to be able to bring these great tiny games to you, your friends, and your family. If this project goes well, then we will be able to bring more like this to you in the future as well. So, please share this project with your friend.\nShortly after starting TMG, I went to my first GAMA Trade Show in 2009.  At that show, I met a lot of people who would become very important to me.  Among those people was Jay Cormier.\nHe showed us Belfort, which we picked up and through extensive development efforts it became the game that it is today.\nAt that time, he showed us several \"games on the go\" as he called them.  They were very small games without many components which has good to great gameplay.\nThe best of them that we played was called, \"This Town Ain't Big Enough For The 2-4 Of Us.\"  We played it then, and we loved it then.  Of course, at the time, we were mostly clueless and did not even have our first games published.\nOur first games were only finished designs with artwork being made.  So, we had no clue how to make and sell such a game.  Of course, a couple of months ago, we figured it out.\nThankfully since that time, Jay and Sen both reminded me that this game would fit into the line.  So, they dusted the game off, reviewed it and then sent it to us.  We played it and loved it.\nSo, now we are bringing it to you.\nCheers,\nMichael", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are pleased to be bringing you the game This Town Aint Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us.

Playdek is excited to be partnering with one of the most legendary game designers, as well as you the fans, to bring out a refreshing, immersive new take on the tactics genre.    \nIn the hands of the veteran tactical RPG master himself, Unsung Story will re-imagine a classic game genre, as Yasumi Matsuno weaves together one of the complex and rich game worlds that he is known for, with inspiring class based tactics game play.\nHistory is written by winners, and tells the tales of heroes. But where there are winners, there are losers, and wars are not won by heroes alone. Behind the veil of history, there are countless stories that lie forgotten. Reliving these hidden tales is the concept behind the Unsung Story.\nUnsung Story: Tale of the Guardians presents an epic sweep of history through the eyes of the ones that make it, but are overlooked by the passing of time. It presents a fundamental twist on the hero\u2019s story, as it immerses gamers through the experiences of those lashed to the great wheel of history!\nThe Unsung Story timeline covers many chapters of the sprawling war-torn history of the fantasy world of Rasfalia. The central plot follows the struggles of heroes who fought in the Seventy-Seven Years War between great kingdoms and empires. \nThe story for each hero will constitute an episode, with each episode being comprised of many stages of game play. Each episode will depict a part of the Seventy Seven Years\u2019 War from the vantage point of various protagonists. Some episodes will span a single year, while others may take place over a decade or more!\nFilled with intrigue, warfare, betrayal, alliances and espionage, Unsung Story is a detailed and immersive game world that players will bring to life through their actions and decisions. It will tie you not only to the names that history remembers after the conflict has ended, but also with the characters behind these immortalized individuals. \nWithout these people, the unsung ones, the course of the history of Rasfalia would have taken a different turn. You will connect to these unsung heroes through your decisions and experiences, as you live these events through their eyes.\nFor more information about Unsung Story from Yasumi Matsuno, check out our Update #11 here:Detailed Design Insight from Yasumi Matsuno\nUnsung Story is an exciting turn-based, tactical war simulation RPG that plays across a great epoch, through individual story episodes. YOU, the player, research and explore the vast history of this conflict that nearly tore Rasfalia apart, by reliving past battles and political events. \nYour viewpoint into this series of intertwined history varies from battle to battle. In one fight, you may command a group of knights protecting a great empire, while in another scenario you may lead a group of revolutionary soldiers, made up of commoners, who are fighting to topple the same empire!\nBattles take place on a 3-D landscape, with an immersive player controlled camera, while episode and scene selection is made through a detailed 3-D world map. Units that you command are profession based, and within each profession are multiple classes. \nEach class within a profession has certain characteristics, and you can change classes within a profession to suit your tactical needs! The world is also rich with magical creatures that are not only foes on the battlefield, but under certain conditions can be commanded by you as well!\nThe character professions, replete with individual classes, provide you with deep game mechanics that you can mold to your individual play style, and adapt to the scenario at hand. You will build your front and backlines by combing these classes into various groups or parties, based on the needs of the battlefield.\nHere is a visual look into the game from a game play perspective. The battle system for Unsung Story is a turn based system that puts importance on speed for each units actions. Therefore, faster units will act on their turns first. The image below represents an example battle stage, as seen by the player, with the player\u2019s party in blue and the opposing force in red. All of the world stages will be richly modeled and detailed, with various terrains and elevations.\nInstead of a square tile system, Unsung Story will use triangular tiles, with units standing not at the center of tiles, but at the intersections. This gives units six possible directions of movement.  \nThis image below depicts different target choices for the player in this triangular based system. In this example, the Active unit has three options:\n1) Use attack \u201cX\u201d on the adjacent Enemy A\n2) Use attack \u201cY\u201d on Enemy B, two tiles away\n3) Use defense \u201cZ\u201d to aid the adjacent Ally C\nThe attack radius shown above is a radius of 2, in other words. A, B, and C are all within the acting unit's range. A and C are well within range, and B is at the edge of the range. The purpose of this system is to explore what more can be presented to the player, by way of multiple action choices, while having a consistent six possible direction choices available to them.\nThis is a concept of what the look and feel will be as you play through the game. It\u2019s not an in-game render but hopefully helps to convey some of the level of detail that we will put into the game.\nIn Unsung Story, classes are spread across three game play types that allow for unique party construction:\nWarrior types that are geared for attacking and defending \nMage types that use magic for attacking, healing and buffing \nMonster types that excel in the use of specialized attacks\nWith this perspective in mind, the system is then made up of five primary class types:\n\nThis is a class connection map that shows the options for leveling characters across class types and professions.\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize attack power. They fight with long swords, massive axes, spears, and maces, for example.\n\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize defense. They are equipped with a shields and other defensive equipment, and will protect their party from enemy attacks.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield offensive and support magic, including the ability to strengthen a party\u2019s attack abilities.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield defensive and healing magic, and can strengthen a party\u2019s defensive position.\n\nThese are characters that command mythical beasts and monsters. The tamed monsters can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes.\nAll of these class types have a Profession, which are a cultural/intellectual/craft alignment, and each profession has an affiliation bonus with another profession. \nA unit\u2019s primary class type and sub-class is determined by the type of weapon equipped, and by using various weapon types, a player\u2019s character can gain XP in any class level this way. Units will be able to freely switch between classes that align with certain professions, as each weapon will belong to one of the primary classes and any experience points earned will be applied to levels for that class.\nThese branches show various class types aligned to certain professions.\nFor example, equipping two different Defender weapons, the Knight\u2019s short sword or the Hoplite\u2019s short spear, will both earn experience points toward the Defender primary class level.\nWhat makes the sub-class different is that their special skills in battle will vary between subs. Though they will still have different character stats, they will have unique skills available to their sub-class type to use in battle. This is also key to class development because the skills a unit can learn when leveling up depend on its sub-class at the time.\nEssentially, the system allows you to shape a unit\u2019s development by choosing which sub-class it is, and in turn what skills it learns, thus giving each character its own identity.\nA Tamer Class putting a dragon under his control.\nThese four listed classes are the classes you will be able to choose from as your backer reward for all tiers that specify a Kickstarter Edition class:\nWar Mage: Profession \u2013 Clergy\nThe War Mage is a member of the battle caste of the Clergy. In addition to powerful magical arts, the War Mage can wield Short Swords, Daggers, and Slings, along with Grenade Weapons, and imbue them with enchantments.\nBallast Knight: Profession \u2013 Noble\nThe Ballast Knight is part of the Nobility, and heralds from the upper elite of society. This access to wealth allows them to bear costly yet powerful weapons and armor. Some of the weapons the Ballast Knight wields are the Great Sword, Short Sword, Axe, and for mounted knights, the Lance.\nPolearm Knight: Profession \u2013 Pioneer\nA Polearm Knight is the upper echelon of the rank and file, the commoners who make up the majority of the Rasfalian cultures. A fierce and heroic fighter, Polearm Knights are known to wield Pikes, Halberds, Scythes, and other pole weapons.\nAerolest: Profession \u2013 Estate\nThe Aerolest is a highly skilled, highly educated warrior, immersed in mathematics and the sciences. Known to design and develop their own secretive and extremely deadly ranged weapons, the Aerolest uses various types of Bows, Crossbows, and Scorpios.\nUnsung Story is the inspiration and creation of an incredibly talented set of veteran video game developers and content creators. We\u2019re incredibly proud and excited to be able to bring together this amazingly accomplished set of creative professionals. Of course, our studio is full of fantastic folks who will also be part of this great creative team:\nBy supporting Unsung Story and backing this Kickstarter campaign, You will help us to bring on world class creative individuals who have worked with Yasumi Matsuno on his previous visionary works, and have left their mark on that collective vision! \nHitoshi Sakimoto is a legend in his own right, having created the scores for some of the most memorable games of all time, including his collaborations with Matsuno on Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII. \nAlexander O.

Visit our website for details, and thanks for stopping by here!\nLagoon: Land of Druids is a game about forging the destiny of a world. Players lead circles of druids in search of enchanted sites that offer magic powers and the energy you'll need to bend Lagoon's destiny. Each site belongs to one of three different energies that compete to dominate Lagoon:\nEvery action you take alters the balance of power among these three energies. The energy with the most sites on the board at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny. Position yourself on the winning side of destiny, and you win!\nLagoon: Land of Druids supports 1-4 players. Most games are completed in 60 minutes or less. A game with 4 is a team game. \"The team actually works really well,\" says UndeadViking in his video review below (\"What People Are Saying\" section).\nThe recommended starting tile setup for new players is shown below. Like all setups, it includes one site of each energy to ensure the game begins in a place of balance between the three energies.\nGame setup for two players.\nPlayers alternate turns, using their druids to perform various actions. Common actions include exploring a new site from the bag, moving around the world, summoning a fellow druid back into play, and unraveling a site to remove it from play. \nAdditionally, every site on the board offers a unique magic power. If your druids occupy a site, you can use its power. A fun twist is your druids share their site powers with one another. So if you have five druids on different sites, each of them could use any one of the five site powers. This opens up a lot of tactical play and fun combos.\nMidpoint of 2 player game. Each player has a stack of unraveled sites and acquired seed tokens at bottom left and right.\nThe heart of the game comes down to manipulating how many sites of each energy are on the board, and this is where you'll be trying to outmaneuver your opponents by making better use of all the site powers to carry out your agenda. Explore new sites aligned with an energy you want to support, and gain a seed token matching that energy. Unravel and remove from the board the sites of energies you wish to oppose.\nAt the end of the game, the energy with the majority of sites in play becomes Lagoon's destiny. If you supported that energy better than any other player, you win! The game tracks loyalty to the dominant energy as follows. Seeds of the dominant energy remaining in your supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it's removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.\nUndeadViking Video Review\nGame play explanation begins at 5:35.\nTestimonials\nAdam P. McIver, Designer of Coin Age: \"Lagoon is a board game oxymoron. It somehow manages to feel immediately familiar while also being fresh and different. It simultaneously seems like a classic game and the hot new thing. The rules are easy to teach, learn, and understand but they combine to give you seemingly endless combinations and countless strategies.\nDavid has done something really extraordinary here. He's effortlessly walked the line between Eurogame elegance and Ameritrash atmosphere, blending theme and mechanics so perfectly that it should make every game designer jealous. I really hate him. (JK, I love him but reluctantly.)\nMy impressions of Lagoon were solidified while the game was still a prototype with no real visuals to speak of, and now that I've seen the artwork, my eyes have exploded right out of my head. I have no idea how I'm managing to type this right now, but convincing you to support Lagoon is that important. It's that good. Trust me.\"\nJason Tagmire, Designer of Pixel Lincoln: \"Lagoon feels like Magic the Gathering meets Summoner Wars meets a very thinky game of rock, paper, scissors. A very subtle, beautiful game.\"\nBen Pinchback, Co-Designer of Fleet, and Eggs and Empires: \"Lagoon is a gorgeous looking game and a real brain burner under the hood. Each decision is meaningful and fun. This is the type of game you think about long after you're done playing.\"\nDarrell Louder, Designer of Compounded: \u201cLagoon is a fantastic game where options and gameplay grow as the game goes on. It\u2019s a brilliant puzzle that I love to unravel every single time I play. Probably the best game I played at BGG Con 2013.\"\nMichael Mindes, Founder of Tasty Minstrel Games: \"Lagoon is fun, intriguing, and as you can see the artwork is amazing. I will be an excited backer on day 1 and I expect great things for this game and its designer David Chott.\"\nKyle Hendricks, Game Designer and Player Extraordinaire: \"There is a damn good chance that Lagoon will end up being in my top 5 favorite games of all time.\"\nThe components included in one copy of Lagoon are listed below. Every single one of the 54 sites has a gorgeous, unique illustration to vividly bring the world of Lagoon to life on your table! The hex tiles are a large 3.5 inches wide (as big as Eclipse tiles for those familiar with that game).\n1 rulebook \n1 round-bottomed drawstring bag for randomizing site tiles \n1 token draw bag for solo mode\n4 player reference cards \n4 player markers / exploration aids\n16 Elemeen seed tokens \n16 Vowelon seed tokens \n16 Deonin seed tokens \n40 cardboard druid tokens (5 each of Mushroom, Hare, Stag, Fern, Owl, Dragonfly, Turtle and Moon)\n40 WOODEN, screen-printed druid tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n36 WOODEN, screen-printed seed tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n24 double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n3 advanced double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n1 BONUS site tile!\n* Prototype components, graphics may change in final version. Forthcoming art will replace gray placeholder illustrations.\nI believe in Lagoon, and want you to believe in it too. So I've made a FREE print and play version of Lagoon: Land of Druids available for anyone to download. Print a copy and play at home today!\nDownload the Lagoon Print and Play\nDownload the Lagoon Rulebook\nI've worked hard to ensure my first board game design will be produced to a high standard of quality. The art will enchant you, and you'll have fun exploring all the possibilities of Lagoon's rich game play. But I have plans to make Lagoon: Land of Druids even more alluring if the project overfunds.\nMy philosophy for stretch goals is that they should make the game better without jeopardizing the schedule or the ultimate success of the game. There's a ton of exciting enhancements we can do within these parameters, and I have a succession of sweet options in mind! \nThe most effective way to achieve upgrades to the game is by sharing this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Please share Lagoon far and wide the world over!\nFirst Stretch Goal - $22,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nA 5th druid circle will be included in the game! \nBackers chose the Owl to be the emblem of the 5th druid circle! This provides an alternate art design for the emblem representing your druid circle, as you boldly forge Lagoon's destiny.\nThe initial four druid circle designs included in the base game are shown above, and the owl design will be completed early this coming week!\nPlease note, however, the addition of these tokens does not allow Lagoon to support 5 players. The balance of Lagoon's game dynamics is excellent with 2 and 3 players, but it does not scale well to 4 or 5 individual players. This is why the 4 player game is played with teams, which feels different but truly makes for a very fun, balanced experience.\nSecond Stretch Goal - $25,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTHICKER COMPONENTS! \nThe Lagoon: Land of Druids punchboards will now be 2.5mm thick instead of the original 2mm. This will make all site tiles, druid tokens, seed tokens, and player markers/exploration aids thicker! Thicker components are more durable, are easier to pick up, and feel more substantial and satisfying to use. They also look a lot more impressive on your table.\nThird Stretch Goal - $30,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSOLO PLAY MODE!\nLagoon: Land of Druids will now be playable for a single player! This will be a great way to play when you're a druid circle of one, or when the game first arrives and you're eager to learn it on your own. More details on this experience will be added soon.\nFourth Stretch Goal - $35,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nCHUNKY THICK COMPONENTS!\nThis enhancement will increase the thickness of the punchboards once more, from a thick 2.5mm to a chunky 3mm! That's right, we're on the threshold of magnificence, where .5mm tips the scales and pushes us into chunky land!\nThis is the thickness every prototype of Lagoon has used for its tiles, and I'm thrilled that this upgrade is well within reach. Considering most board games use 2mm or even 1.5mm thick chipboard for components like Lagoon's tiles, I think you'll love the heft of 3mm tiles in your hand and how impressive they look on your table!\nFifth Stretch Goal - $40,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTWO ADDITIONAL BACKER CHOSEN DRUID CIRCLES!\nA 6th and 7th druid circle design will be included in the game. Note this does not increase the player count above 4, as explained in the first update.\nBackers are nominating nature-themed emblems on the comments page now! To promote druid diversity, the two new emblems will be non-plant, non-fungus, non-bird, non-mammal emblems, as those are already represented. Lastly, I reserve the right to filter out suggestions that aren't thematic.\nSixth Stretch Goal - $50,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSIX ADVANCED SITES ADDED!\nSix \"advanced\" sites will now be included with Lagoon! That's three additional site tiles. Check out Flaming Lotus below, one of the advanced Vowelon sites! \nThe six advanced sites offer potent magic to your druids. They didn't initially make it into the base game because their usefulness is less straightforward, or they're a little tricky to use. But exceedingly useful they are! Now you'll be able to swap out three tiles from the base game for the advanced tiles, or play with all 27 tiles if you want a slightly longer game.\nSeventh Stretch Goal - $60,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nWOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nEvery Kickstarter copy of Lagoon will now include FOUR player sets of wooden druid tokens. That's 20 total druids, which is the full complement for the largest player count of 4. The tokens will be 4mm thick wooden discs, 1mm thicker than the punchboard druid tokens. Also included will be emblem stickers to label the members of each circle of druids.\nThese wooden tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter. I want to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, and that's why these wooden components will not be standard equipment in the retail version of the game. They won't be exclusive to Kickstarter backers, but they will be free to you.\nEighth Stretch Goal - $65,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSCREEN-PRINTED WOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nThe four wooden sets of druid tokens added previously will be upgraded from stickers to screen-printing. The druid circle emblems will be painted directly on the wooden discs. More attractive and durable than stickers, screen-printed wooden druid tokens make a classy and refined addition to Lagoon. And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nNinth Stretch Goal - $75,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nEIGHT SETS OF SCREEN-PRINTED DRUID TOKENS!\nA full eight sets of screen printed wooden druid tokens are included with every backed copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids. That's a total of 40 wooden druid tokens! This includes the four original emblems (Stag, Hare, Fern, Mushroom) as well as the four chosen by backers: Dragonfly, Owl, Turtle, and Moon.  And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nTenth Stretch Goal - $80,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nLAGOON ART DIGITAL WALLPAPER 3-PACK\nThree digital wallpapers of Lagoon art have been unlocked! If you can't wait until then, the sixteenth update has a nice treat for you!\nEleventh Stretch Goal - $90,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n16mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nRendering of seed tokens. Final design may differ.\n36 wooden seed tokens with screen-printed seed designs on both sides are now included with backed copies of Lagoon. This is in addition to the 40 wooden druid tokens unlocked previously, tricking out your copy of Lagoon with a grand total of 76 wooden tokens! This will complete the upgrade of all tokens from punchboard to painted wood.\nSeveral things to note about these tokens:\nThey will NOT be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter!\nThe game will still include all the punchboard seed tokens.\nThese seed tokens (16mm) are smaller than the punchboard seed tokens (19mm). If that saddens you, please take a look at the next stretch goal.\nThis goal provides 12 wooden seed tokens in each energy, whereas there are 16 punchboard seed tokens in each energy. Twelve tokens is actually the number all prototypes of Lagoon have used, which is plenty. We're doing more punchboard seeds because having extras may be handy and we have space for them.\nTwelfth Stretch Goal - $100,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n19mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nAll 36 wooden seed tokens are now upgraded from 16mm to 19mm. The larger size is the same as the punchboard seed tokens.\nAchieving this stretch goal makes every Kickstarter copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids a deluxe experience with a full 76 wooden tokens that will not be included in the base retail version of the game. That's 40 druid tokens in 8 different designs, as well as 36 seed tokens in 3 different designs. \nThirteenth Stretch Goal - $125,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nBONUS PROMO SITE!\nEach backed copy of Lagoon will include a bonus site tile! This promotional tile will introduce a new site type to Lagoon, the totem. Totems are game changing sites that don't behave like the others. Just one totem can completely change the feel of a game, so this bonus site will pack a punch! \nThis promo tile will NOT be included in the base retail version of the game.\nFourteenth Stretch Goal: $150,000\nWEEKLY LAGOON LORE!\nI will lovingly write and share with you a new chapter of Lagoon's lore and history once a week until the game goes out to backers.\nThe first chapter would be delivered by the first week of April, so we're talking at least 18 chapters! Each chapter would profile a new character, give background on a significant location, or cover some overarching topic in the world of Lagoon. We're not talking book sized chapters, but there'll be enough meat on these bones to flesh the world out.\nI could not produce Lagoon without the faith and support of Kickstarter backers. To respect this trust placed in me, I promise that backer copies of Lagoon: Land of Druids will be shipped out before the game is available for purchase at conventions or retail stores. \nI also pledge to keep my backers well informed at each step in the process of producing and delivering Lagoon: Land of Druids. If you ever have any questions or concerns about this project, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nLastly, I'm pleased to announce Lagoon: Land of Druids is now an EU Friendly project!\nIf you've made it all the way down here, thank you for giving my game your attention! Lagoon is the culmination of a dream going back many years to publish my own board games. My favorite games have evocative themes that are tightly woven into the mechanics. I love opening a game box and discovering an entire world beckoning me inside. When I sit down to play a game, I want to feel like I'm exploring a living system filled with mysteries to be solved and dynamics that grip me but aren't easily mastered. To me, that's magic in a box. That's what I want most when I sit down to play a game. \nI've put a lot of love into this game, and I hope when you sit down at your table to play Lagoon that your experience has a handful of these sparks pulling you in and creating memorable experiences with your friends and family.\nI have a big vision for this game and its future, and a dream to publish other outstanding games that are also set in the world of Lagoon. If this world resonates with you, I'm delighted that we've connected! I believe so strongly in what I'm doing that I actually quit my job four months ago to devote most of my time and energy towards building Three Hares Games. It may sound crazy, but I'm taking a leap forward towards forging my own personal destiny, and I'm grateful to anyone who plays a role in it.\nI started a blog to document this wild journey, and invite you to follow along if you like.\nCheers,\nDavid\n Three sizes available in three designs.\nGrizznant, Ancient Forest Lord\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\n Jokulmas, Trickster\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\nElixona, Queen of Dreams\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks for this project are possible delays with art, manufacturing, shipping and fulfillment. The schedule includes several weeks of buffer time at different stages in order to absorb a decent amount of unforeseen delays without jeopardizing on-time delivery.\n\nMost of the art has been completed already, and the remaining pieces are scheduled for completion before this campaign even ends. My graphic designer has worked in the board game industry for many years and has the experience to ensure the pre-press phase goes quickly. \n\nThe game will be produced by Panda Game Manufacturing, a very reputable company I've established a good working relationship with going back to August. I'm working with a well-recommended and responsive freight company to manage the logistics of getting the manufactured game from China to warehouses in other countries.\n\nI've analyzed several different fulfillment scenarios to get games to backers, and have evaluated three vendors to handle most of this process for me. I believe I've settled on the most efficient approach for fulfillment. As the project proceeds, I will continually monitor this aspect and shift my strategy if a more efficient approach is possible.\n\nAnother factor I want to disclose is that I will be on a family trip to Alaska at the beginning of August, which could overlap the timeframe that rewards are being distributed to backers. Fortunately, I am not planning to directly handle fulfillment myself, so I don't anticipate this causing problems with that process being carried out by my fulfillment vendors. I do mention this though because problems could arise in that timeframe that require my attention. I have verified that internet access will not be out of reach where we are staying, so I should be able to work productively while on this trip if required.\n\nI am prepared and motivated to meet any obstacles along the way, and diligently resolve them.

Including the mini-expansion and potential stretch goals, there will be 5+ options to keep Fleet and Fleet: Arctic Bounty fresh and new!\nTug Boat and Artisan Fisherman\nBay Cards:\nCrewmen and Gone Fishin' are two new ways to expand gameplay that can be added to any combination of Licenses and Boats and Dock Cards from Fleet and/or Fleet: Arctic Bounty!\nGone Fishing:\nGone Fishing is a great new way to approach the License Auction for experienced and new players alike. The designers recommend using Gone Fishing when teaching new players Fleet or if there is a skill imbalance. It takes the sting out of not winning a License and provides a fun risk/reward choice as the game moves forward. Gone Fishing is a great way to lighten up Fleet just a little bit! It's not just for new players though, for an experienced group of cutthroat Fleet-ers Gone Fishing provides a new layer of strategy in the Auction.\nGone Fishing\nCrewmen:\nCrewmen are hired when a License is purchased and provide even more intrigue and strategy to the License Auction!\nCrewmen Cards\nHire Crewmen License Card\n  One player (1p) and two player (2p) Variant Cards:\nCan't pull a whole crew together? Fleet: Arctic Bounty includes a new official 1p variant and a 2p variant that spices up the 2p Auction.\n  The designers worked really hard to address the players that loved Fleet but did not enjoy the 2p Auction and it turned out AWESOME! (that's why we HAD to offer the PnP version of it to backers so they could try it out with Fleet RIGHT NOW!)\n1 Corporation License (1p/2p Variant)\n2 Captains (1p/2p Variant)\n  WOW!!! That is one packed box o' Fleet: Arctic Bounty!\n\n\nRetailers\nIf you are a retailer and you wish to discuss terms for purchasing and shipping multiple games, please contact us and we will discuss this with you.\n\n\nThis is a big sweet wooden Fleet die! It can be used with the Weather Authority and Casino Licenses are rolled to see who goes first and then used as an alternate start player marker. It is big, wood, and awesome!\nThat darn near makes Fleet: Arctic Bounty a stand alone game! We are very excited about Salmon, will be a very cool new addition!\nAll of this will be included in Fleet: Arctic Bounty if these stretch goals are achieved!\n  BRAND NEW ADD ON!!! The Big Box!!!\nAdd-on #1:\n+$5 Fleet Mini-Expansion - The Fleet mini-expansions includes 8 Salty Captain Cards, 8 Inuit Fisherman Cards, 3 Wharfside Casino Cards, and 3 Nunavut Weather Authority cards.\nAdd-on #2:\n+$7 Fish Meeples! - The really awesome Fish Meeples that were available after the last campaign are here! 100 Fish Meeples!\nAdd-on #3:\n+$2 Salvage Yard - An awesome add-on license, the Salvage Yard is a kickstarter exclusive! 4 Salvage Yard Licenses!\n\nAdd-on #4:+$25 Fleet - Don't miss out on a chance to grab an extra copy of Fleet to share with a friend!

Use the 50 Fish Meeples add on if you already have 100 Fish Meeples or if you have already purchased 100 Fish Meeples in this campaign and want enough Fish Meeples for 5-6 players! \nAdd-on #6:\n+$7 The Big Box - One Box to Hold Them All (plus a sweet custom insert)!!\nTake a look at this neat-o artists rendition!!

We feel it is important that people who buy Fleet: Arctic Bounty receive a game that is well made and will be in playable condition for many years. Fleet: Arctic Bounty will be produced using the best printing, box and components available.\n\nThanks for your support of Gryphon Games and Arctic Bounty!\n\nPlease direct any questions to: customer-service@eagle-gryphon.com\nFleet and Fleet: Arctic Bounty (FAB) are small games.  They fit into a USPS Small Flat Rate box tightly--and that's a good thing.  That costs $6 in the US.  We pay this and send those to you (if you are in the US) for \"free\".\nCanada\n In Canada, we plan to send all the Canadian Backers' orders to one single person or company that would agree to having us send all copies to them and then out to individuals.  Assuming this works we still need to pay for shipping all the games to Canada, and customs, and the costs of internal-to-Canada postage and materials, as well as some labor to actually send these out.  So please add $16 (for the first game) for shipping if you are a Backer in Canada. And add $8 for each additional game in the same order delivered in Canada.\nCanadian backers using the Crewmates tier pay $175 (135+16+8+8+8) so only $29 per copy shipped!\nGermany and other EU countries\nUnfortunately the small size of Fleet does not help us in the EU -- where the rates for us to send anything from .1kg to 5kgs are all the same.  That is great for bigger and heavier games but not for Fleet. So we have arranged to send the Fleet games internal to Germany to an individual in Germany who will send them out, and that allows us to tell German backers that they can add $16 to their pledge for the first game sent to an address in Germany and $8 for each additional game sent to that address.  \nGerman backers using the Crewmates tier pay $175 (135+16+8+8+8) so only $29 per copy shipped!\nKeep in mind that Fleet and Fleet: Arctic Bounty each count as separate games when interpreting the shipping pledges needed.  If we can find someone in France, Italy, Spain, and other countries that multiple backers might live in then we need to know that.  Otherwise we will use our warehouse in The Netherlands to send out all EU orders.  And these orders will cost $22 added to each pledge for shipping for one game and an additional $8 for each additional game.\nEU backers using the Crewmates tier pay $181 (135+22+8+8+8) so only $30 per copy shipped!\nAustralia\nThe rates to Australia are the same as those to Canada because of a new relationship we have with a distributor in Australia.  So add $16 for the first game and another $8 for each additional game.\nAustralian backers using the Crewmates tier pay $175 (135+22+8+8+8) so only $29 per copy shipped!\nElsewhere in the World\nFinally, if you live somewhere other than Canada, Germany, the EU, or Australia, please add $30 for shipping the first game to you and $12 for each additional game to the same address.  We realize that shipping is expensive and we do not like paying this much more than any of you do either.  We do subsidize shipping expenses, and we certainly do not profit from them at all.  Thanks for your understanding.\nOther International backers using the Crewmates tier pay $201(135+30+12+12+12) so only $33.50 per copy shipped!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEagle and Gryphon Games has participated in 20+ successful Kickstarter projects completed in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and all of our projects have shipped out either in the same month we originally projected or within 30 days thereafter. We have been more than 30 days earlier than projected, but never more than 30 days later. Even so, there are always unpredictable events which can occur that might delay our projects. We will do our best to avoid them, but there is always the risk that the project might be delayed. Shipping can be a particularly difficult challenge when it involves destinations outside the US (and sometimes even within the US as well). We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us. We have been producing board games for over 10 years and we have a good reputation for the quality of our productions because we visit and choose our Chinese partners/factories carefully. However, mistakes happen occasionally that we cannot control--such as missing or defective components. When they do, our customer service department will work with you to take care of production problems that might arise.

At every $1500 interval after $20,000 we will add 1 special bonus card to every copy of the game! These cards are added on top of whatever other stretch rewards we hit! Cards include such characters as the Alchemist, Miner, Scavenger, and of course RATS! Enjoy!\nBonus Stretch Reward Cards!\n$21,500 - Alchemist Unlocked!\n$23,000 - Woodsman\n$24,500 - Miner\n$26,000 - Scavenger\n$27,500 - Architect\n$29,000 - Rats!\n25k Stretch Reward Sneak Peek! When we hit 25k the Gardens Mini Expansion will be added to every copy of Tasnia!\n30k Stretch Reward - When we reach 30k we will upgrade all the cards to a linen finish and we will add the Vagrant Card, 1 gold resource card, and 2 silver resource cards! Those backers with the \"Enhance Pack\" will receive the black peeple pawn!\nTasnia is a resource gathering game that also employs tile laying. Players draw resource cards to form a hand of 6 cards and then they spend these resources (Wood, Stone, Iron, Laborer, Carpenter, Mason, Silver and Gold) to purchase portions of a building. These portions come in the form of tiles that can be used to construct medieval buildings. Players compete to build the biggest and best buildings using these tiles. Players then score points based on the buildings they have created and the player with the highest score wins! In addition there are special cards like the Baron, the Hero, the Scoundrels, and the Merchant that allow players to manipulate the rules to their advantage and to hinder other players from winning.\nTasnia is a game designed for 2-4 players and takes about an hour. It is recommended for people 8 years old or older, however I have played it with 6 year old children with very few issues.\nThe idea for the game came from playing with castle blocks with my 3 year old son. Like most game designers I am always in a state of looking for new ideas or expanding on old ones. While constructing my medieval village with my son I considered the idea of each block costing a certain number of resources. From there the idea grew and I settled on the use of laying tiles and of using cards for the resources. Many hours of play-testing honed Tasnia into a wonderful mix of strategy, luck, and of course building blocks. My kids spend a lot of time simply building houses and castles with the tiles alone and this is a testament to the core mechanics. \nTasnia makes a great game to play with all ages and is suited well for people new to gaming and hardcore gamers alike. The idea of building things with blocks strikes a cord with most and draws us all back to our childhood. So let's build this game together!\nAll prototypes for Tasnia where produced by The Game Crafter and I strongly recommend their fantastic service!\nTake a moment and check out the rules: Tasnia Rules\n75 resource cards Bonus 300gsm Card Stock!\n70 2\" x 2\" building tiles (Printed on both sides)\nFull color instruction booklet\n2 part rigid set-up box with custom molded insert.\nBonus x2 Money Lender Cards!\nBonus Beggar Card!\nBonus Dukes and Dames Mini Expansion!\nBonus 4 Wooden Tokens!\nBonus 4 Jumbo Player Cards (350gsm)\nWelcome to the Tasnia Shoppe!

You can place them in their homes instead of the card. The acrylic gems are used in place of the wooden disc in the Dukes and Dames expansion. These will be included once we hit 20k and additional peeples will be added as we hit other stretch goals! These items are not essential to play, but are meant to enhance your copy!\nTile Magnets! - These magnets are fantastic in quality. They are actually 2\" x 2\" metal button magnets and are a welcome addition to any fridge!

The discs are used by players to put claims on tiles they can not afford during their turn. The disc forces other players to pay a bit more for that tile if they want it. Players can therefore use these discs to try and save a tile until their turn comes around again, or to make another player pay more for a tile they need!\nBonus Stretch Reward Cards!\n$21,500 - Alchemist\n$23,000 - Woodsman\n$24,500 - Miner\n$26,000 - Scavenger\n$27,500 - Architect\n$29,000 - Rats!\n25,000 - When we hit this stretch goal we will add the \"Gardens\" micro expansion to the game!

Also we will no longer be striving for the stretch goal of booster packs, instead we will be striving for Chapter 2 of the Corrupted Forest. \nThis game is a fusion of Tabletop RPG games, like Dungeons and Dragons, and card games. It uses a 20-sided dice system along with playing cards. The game can have has many players as the Game Master wants. One player plays as the Game Master, which plans and controls the world the Heroes live in. The rest play as Heroes\u2019 and try to survive in the world the Game Master creates.\nThe Heroes can completely customize their own character through diverse vendor decks, which they use to purchase gear and abilities from. The Game Master may also place down a vendor deck for the Heroes to buy from.\nThe Game Master makes his own campaign deck filled with Environment Cards, Creature Cards, and Ally Cards. He uses this deck to create a world for the Heroes to live and fight in. The more cards you have as a game master the better off you are at making any kind of scenario and encounter you would like.\nThis tutorial is a brief overview of the simple mechanics in Heroes Tale RPCG. When you get into the game you find there are many more intricacies, and challenging battles tactics that await you and your friends.\nThe Corrupted Forest is the first set of what we hope to be many more, with your support. The theme is based on the main antagonist, Ulek The Corrupter. Ulek is a terrifying demon that is using his relentless power to twist the once great Onabi Forest into a kingdom of evil. The forest guardians have given in to Ulek\u2019s will and turned against Onabi The Forest Spirit and all looks very bleak. The Eastern Empire, which borders this forest, has sent many troops in to purge this evil that is plaguing their land. However, no hero has yet to return, and that is where this tale begins\u2026\n60,000 Stretch Goal Achieved!\nEach Champion Set will now come with one signed copy of the game by the creators.\n64,000 Stretch Goal Achieved!\nWe will release an early digital download of the game before it is shipped accessible to backers only. Date for this has not yet been decided; however this will occur before the month of November.\n68,000 Stretch Goal Locked\nWe will make the Heroes\u2019 Tale Compendium open for digital download. The Compendium will dive deep into the Lore of Heroes\u2019 Tale as well as have commentary from the creators.\nMore to come upon unlocking a Stretch Goal\u2026\nThe Caltakan are a proud Northern race. They are privileged in being one of the few races to have set up one of the largest governmental bodies known as the Caltakan Monarchy. Using some of the most refined metals in all the land to construct high-quality weapons and armor, selling them off at the highest bidder. The Caltakan Monarchy is well-known for its political neutrality and welcomes all form of trade within their grand inner mountain cities. Passive by nature the Caltakan hold strong bonds with their comrades and would sooner charge the strongest of foes before they leave a friend behind.\nThe Wabii are one of the craftiest races. They have constructed their homes high in the treetops to protect themselves against large predators and raiders. With a strong understanding of southern plant ecology they have constructed many different alchemic potions to use as weapons against invaders. Nothing like pouring gallons of Carruvian frog acid on incoming intruders, which is sure to make any army think twice about climbing up to raid a village. The Wabii however do not have a centralized government for good reason, most of their cultural leaders are pirates and thieves. Nevertheless, many of the Wabii do live peacefully amongst the other races. \n\u201cAll will answer to my call\u2026 and you are no exception, Mog the Dreamer.\u201d\n-Ulek the Corruptor\nMog the Dreamer was one of the strongest guardians in the forest second only to Nallafrax. As Mog slept his dreams would make the forest grow lush and beautiful. Whenever great danger would threaten the forest it was he who would be on the front lines of the defense, and so he was, when Ulek made his move\u2026 Now Mog is a prisoner in his own body. He is no longer known as Mog the Dreamer instead he is now known as Mog the Nightmare, one that destroys everything in his path. Some say that Mog weeps for the damage he causes, as rain clouds follow in the wake of his destructive path.\nMog the Nightmare is one of four champion level creatures that will come in each core set of the game. We will have more to show with Mog the Nightmare in the next few days.\n* We are still currently working on getting another video done it should be ready with in the next few days.\nIllustrations by Amanda Cha, Andrew Theophilopoulos, Deanna Schneider, Katherine Laczin, Shaun Elis, and Victor Maury\nZbrush by Joseph Stachnik\nCharacter Design by Deanna Schneider \nDesign, Creative Direction, and Animation by Christopher Merlino.\nArt Direction by Andrew Theophilopoulos .", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell some of the challenges that come along with this project are: finding talented artist and having a high quality manufacturer.

See the FAQ section below\nHelp bring the smash indie hit of 2012 back!\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce a collaborative effort with Rikki Tahta & La Mame Games to make this fantastic game more readily available for everyone to enjoy.  We have everything ready, including the incredibly amazing artwork that this game deserves - all we need now is some help to fund the production and shipping to get games to you.\nThe Resistance: Coup\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.  But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.  In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nIf you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review of the 1st edition from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer  Note - this is 1st edition of the game. Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different.\nThere are a number of other great reviews for this game, including these links:  Undead Viking Video Review, Trent Hamm - Written Review, I Slay The Dragon - Written Review\n\nRikki Tahta - the designer of Coup explains his game to the BGG team at Essen 2012.  Note - this is 1st edition of the game.  Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different\nPromos\nCoup Promos - Every pledge reward level will include a set of cards for \"The Inquisitor\", an alternative role card that can be used in place of the game's \"Ambassador\" role.  And as a stretch reward, we are also including an Inquisitor token for The Resistance.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos. \nThe Resistance promos - Also included in every reward package are dsytopian themed Merlin & Assassin cards. If you are a fan of the art from The Resistance, and want to add these roles from The Resistance:Avalon, you'll love these promos.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos.\nThe Resistance Avalon Promos - if your pledge rewards include The Resistance: Avalon, you'll also get a copy of the cards needed to play the Excalibur and Lancelot variants of this game.\nAlso included in every reward level will be the two fixed cards for The Resistance Avalon.  These cards correct the misspelled word \"Unkown\".\nAdd-ons\nExcalibur/Lancelot promos - these are included at no additional cost for each copy of Avalon you are receiving as part of your rewards ($35 & $50 pledge levels). If you want to add the Excalibur/Lancelot promo cards on their own you can do so by adding $6 to your pledge, as an alternative you can get these from the boardgamegeek.com store for the same price.\n\nMayDay Premium Sleeves in the 65mm x 100mm size can be added to all reward levels for an additional $3.99. These are high quality sleeves perfect for keeping secret information secret. The sleeve packs contain 80 sleeves - and Coup with promos is at 30 cards now, so you will have some extras to share with your friends or to use on a second set of cards.\nExtra copies of Coup for the ten packs - The highest of our reward tiers, you can add additional copies of Coup for $12 (US shipping) or $15 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the ten pack.\nExtra copies of Coup for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - You can add additional copies of Coup for $13.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nAdding The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the six & ten packs - you can add either of these games for $15 (US Shipping) or $20 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the six & ten packs. These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.\nAdding extra copies of The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - you can add either of these games for $15 These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nTo include any of these add-ons - first click the \"manage pledge\" button, then increase your pledge amount without changing your reward level.\nAt the end of the project kickstarter will send you a project survey (about 6 weeks before games are ready to ship) - in that project survey I will capture all the information I need to get all the information that I need to get your rewards to you including numbers and composition of your add-ons.\nAll the Add-ons are priced per unit (eg, Add-on The Resistance $15/$20 is for one copy of the game).\nStretch Rewards\nWe'll introduce a limited line of stretch goals for this project - a combination of promos and exclusive promos cards featuring alternative art.  These promo cards will highlight your contribution to this project and I am sure will be highly sought after the project ends.  \n$10K - Box upgrades - see update #1, we are upgrading the game box with a very elegant and attractive foil finish box.\n$15K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Captain - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$20K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Contessa - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$25K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Ambassador - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$30K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Duke - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$35K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Assassin - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game. At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players!\n$40K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Inquisitor promo - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game (the Inquisitor promo won't be in the retail game either!). At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players with either the Ambassador or the Inquisitor roles!\n$50K - The Resistance token of \"The Inquisitor\" - This is an optional role for Don Esridge's The Resistance, familiar to Avalon fans as the \"Lady of the Lake\".\n$70K Extra Set of Coup Roles -  a second set of the Exclusive Promo role cards that have already been unlocked.  With these extra cards you can play up to 10.\n$90K More alternative art - We'll replace the 6 role cards from the $70K reward with new alternative art cards.  This means that you can either play up to 10, or you can play up to 6 with unique art on every card.  These are also Exclusive Promo cards.\n$110K \"kickstarter edition\" game box -  Final details aren't worked out, but I am thinking that we would include the kickstarter logo on the box side and on the box back (in place of the bar code).  This will only be done for the first printing - so it will be another very unique item that you can only get if you were part of this project (or getting this game in Essen 2013).\nKickstarter editions of the game will feature a dual sided player aid. One side will have the all the roles for the retail version and the other side will replace the ambassador with the inquisitor. Just another small way to thank you all for your support and distinguish the version of the game that you are getting as backers.\n$130K Coin Upgrade - an upgrade to foil backed coins that feel very futuristic. We are still experimenting with different holo foils to find the one that is going to work the best - but here is what we are looking at for the $130K stretch reward upgrade coins:\n\nNew stretch rewards are added as they are unlocked.  Promos are things that aren't going to be included in the retail version of the game. Exclusive promos are items that are even more limited than our standard promos, and will only be available through Indie Boards and Cards (at events like Essen for example) or our direct representatives. We aren't limiting any of these promos to kickstarter, but it's still not going to be easy to get the exclusives outside of kickstarter.\nWhat is the \"World of The Resistance\"\nIndie Boards and Cards started by publishing three games in 2010 - the biggest success of those games was The Resistance designed by Don Eskridge.  The Resistance is a game of secret identities, deduction and deception for 5-10 players.  The game play instill a deep sense of mistrust among the players, and makes for a great time among friends and families.   The setting for The Resistance is a dystopian future, but a rather bland future.  As the popularity of The Resistance continues to grow there have been more and more requests to develop a comprehensive back story for the game.  Coup is the first step in this direction, and I am optimistic that we will see the story behind The Resistance provide more background for future games from Indie Boards and Cards.\nIf you are not familiar with the game play of Don Eskridge's The Resistance, you can get no better explanation then watching this celebrity filled cast playing the game:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this edition of the game - I am just not sure that the game is going to be  popular enough to print in the minimum required print runs and sell them via distribution.  \n\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game - the promos for Coup, The Resistance and The Resistance: Avalon.  Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you.  We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production. \nWhat are the shipping costs to Canada?\nKickstarter only lets you list one international shipping charge, so if you are getting the $35 or $50 pledge rewards sent to Canada - please select \"Ship to the US\" (this is a manual process) and then add the extra $ to your pledge as follows:\n$35 Pledge Levels - $15 extra (Pledge $50 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $20 Extra (pledge $70 for this reward level)\nInternational Shipping - Outside of Canada - Kickstarter should Charge this automatically\n$35 Pledge Levels - $20 extra (Pledge $55 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $30 Extra (pledge $80 for this reward level)\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools.   Be sure to look for The Resistance, Flash Point: Rescue, and Gauntlet of Fools wherever games are sold. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I promise that if you keep your comments positive and proactive that the project will get more in the way of stretch goals and get your rewards to you sooner. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. Have an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Ready to go on a Quest?", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition is up (and in it's final hours).
