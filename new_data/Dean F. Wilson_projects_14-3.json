Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "HEL: The Last Saga is a cooperative fantasy adventure viking board game, created by the duo behind SMOG: Rise of Moloch by CMON, game designer David Rakoto and art director Christophe Madura.\nThe game offers players the chance to lead a small group of Heroes, each with their own rank, occupation and background. Despite all these differences, these survivors will have to cooperate if they want to survive the cold, hunger and hostile threats, but they will also have to unveil the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of the colony founded by their lost King to be worthy of the Saga that will retain their name.\nHEL: The Last Saga is a highly narrative campaign game, with paragraphs to read according to what the players accomplish. The game mechanisms mix exploration, tactical combat with resource management. Storytelling and background are ubiquitous and replayability comes from the unique way you have to replay a failed mission.\nClick on the image to know more about the HEL-in\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\n\n\n NARRATIVE ALL THE WAY\nTell. Listen. Choose or test. Everywhere. Anytime. The game engine is based on the discovery or the triggering of events that lead to narrative chapters. These events can be hidden on the game board, placed on the turn track or on any other game component. The story  unfolds as you resolve these chapters by making choices, performing tests or simply listening.\nUNIQUE HEROES\nPlay strong characters. Each Clan member has their own story, strengths and weaknesses. You will learn about them as you play them, by acquiring new individual Hero cards in a non linear way. Some of these cards will be the result of choices you made during the adventure.\nSCENARIO BASED \nConquer a mysterious land, found a colony and resolve mysteries. Scouting missions, search or rescue parties, raids, escape, defence, investigation, or intrigue. Whether it's located on the modular and expandable wilderness game board or in the colony camp, each scenario provides a new challenge to overcome in order to gain access to the next scenario.\nPREDATORS & PREY \nFace hidden threats, which are controlled by a predation-based AI system. Use your perception and your pets to detect these threats before you face them, as an ambush can be fatal. Your enemies are vicious enough to target the most vulnerable or the highest ranking members of your group.\nWORSHIP SYSTEM\nBeg your gods to help you. Use your willpower, offerings, and the fervour of your companions to obtain permanent modifiers that will benefit all who share your faith.\nSURVIVAL... \nExploit scarce resources to survive and keep your clan together. Hunt for food. Collect that precious wood that will be a source of heat and an essential material for your constructions. But above all, maintain high morale to avoid sinking into defeat.\n...HORROR\nNight will eventually fall. For months. Second half of the campaign will take place into darkness. But only for Heroes who survive long enough to see the sunset. Forget every little knowledge or petty victory acquired. New rules. New threats. New objectives.\n\nThe USA, European Union, Canada, Australia, and UK will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe above is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns and an estimated final weight of the Core pledge at 5kg. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGeneral\n\nThis is our ninth Kickstarter and we\u2019ve learned a lot from our previous eight. Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is being printed and ongoing for a delivery by the summer, Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves this year. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest development is finished and is going to production now and Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production this summer.\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates at least once a week, plus our posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our videos on YouTube.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is June 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\nIf these terms are not acceptable to you, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Faithful pledge.

Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \n*** For backers in China, please read this update.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.  If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 have been delivered. Solomon Kane is a big scope project that will be delivered in two waves this year. Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is now on the ship to the HUBS. Super Fantasy Brawl is on track and production is ongoing for a delivery by the summer, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters is on track and will go to production next month.\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates at least once a week, plus our posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our videos on YouTube.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is March 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops. This requires smart management of three types of units: Archers, Spearmen and Cavalry. Players place these soldiers one by one, playing the Tactics cards that create another layer of interaction.\nGain meditation by shooting with the Monk Archer, then spend meditation on a Cavalry Squad Leader to move your Cavalry around the battlefield faster, and \u2013 finally \u2013 finish off by getting extra Honor for each of the Cavalry\u2019s engagements thanks to the Banner Holder. There are endless possibilities for great combos and memorable plays.\nOn top of that, your Advisors and General might give your troops extra abilities, such as shooting twice or looting twice the resources!\nAll of the above makes the Great Wall one of our most strategically involving designs that will be appreciated by many different groups of players:\n                            - those who love euro-styled games with their intricate economies and engine-building,\n                            - those who love over-the-table play,\n                            - and finally, those who simply like to wage war on a beautiful map.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

The two games have the same parents: the designer Antoine Bauza, the illustrator Na\u00efade, and the publisher Funforge for artistic direction.\nWith Namiji, the family grows with a hitherto unseen adventure!\n\u201cIn ancient Japanese, Namiji refers to the wake and eddies visible behind a boat.\u201d\nAntoine Bauza, designer of Namiji.\nIn Namiji, you are fishers from the Japan of yesteryear, navigating south of the Japanese archipelago, a few kilometers from the famous Tokaido road. You will need to have a fruitful day at sea to win the game.\nTo do this, you will have the opportunity to contemplate magnificent marine species, to fish with a line or a net to fill your racks with colorful fish, and haul in your crustacean traps.\nYou can benefit from stops to improve your fishing equipment, and you will also have to contend with the gods of the sea by setting offerings afloat, or by fulfilling their wishes that they express during your contemplations with the Sacred Rocks, for which they will reward you.\nFunforge is currently working on the rulebook. Please note that the PDFs below are prototypes, and the rules currently have neither illustrations nor nice layout. These are not the rules as you will receive them in your game box; however, the rules have been playtested hundreds of times by the designer and the Funforge team. The rules themselves have long since been approved and are final.\nPlease click on the picture to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l\u2019image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\nDuring my forty-one years of existence, gaming has always occupied an important portion of my agenda. I have done a lot of role-playing games, and I have written a few. I long wanted to work in the videogame industry before discovering the modern world of board games in the early 2000s.\nAs a primary school teacher, I started to conceive my first prototypes. My first game, Chabyrinthe, was released in 2007, followed by Ghost Stories in 2008. In 2010, 7 Wonders appeared (Kennerspiel des Jahres 2011), which was an enormous success and permitted me to devote myself entirely to creating games.\nDriven by my passion for Japan, I designed several games around the them of the Land of the Rising Sun: Takenoko, Hanabi (Spiel des Jahres 2013), and in collaboration with Funforge, Samurai Spirit and Tokaido. Building on its success, Tokaido has been joined by two expansions, Crossroads and Matsuri.\nI am also one of the co-founders of Team Kaedama (a team of 4 game designers), and I take care of the logistics for la Radio des Jeux, a French podcast dedicated to the world of gaming.\nFor me, Namiji is the perfect opportunity to refresh the gaming experience you can appreciate in Tokaido, as well as revisit the graphical universe of Na\u00efade\u2026 and to share it all with you!\nFor me, the adventure really begins with Tokaido. At that time, it\u2019s been two years since I started the occupation of game illustrator. I was delighted because I am passionate about the ancient civilizations.\nThe Japan of the feudal era is obviously one of these civilizations that has long fascinated me. In addition, by that point, I had learned to read and write Japanese, and most of my interests came from Japan (manga, video games, figurines, movies).\nI did some research on boats, marine species, fashion of the era, Japanese archipelago, crustacean traps, fishing equipment and so on.\nAs with Tokaido, the final result here with Namiji is pure, white, peaceful\u2026\nFor both games, I wanted to keep an alchemy between the gameplay and the artwork to obtain two board games of which I am extremely proud.\nI hope that you will enjoy this new journey as much as I enjoyed retracing it through my art.\n\n\n\n\n\nROLL FOR CRIT: \u201cThere is a very good game to look forward to here. I am looking forward to see this more in final production state. I had a lot of fun.\u201d\nSPIKEYBITS: \u201cFunforge has a new title in the Tokaido universe coming out called Namiji. Not an expansion but a completely new game. Instead of walking the Eastern Sea Road, you are fishermen sailing around the islands of Japan. I\u2019m definitely dying to play more of this one.\u201d\nNERD CALIBER: \u201cI look forward to seeing it on Kickstarter later this year.\"\n\nTHE BOARD GAME KAPTAIN: \u201cAfter the game (played at Gen Con), they (Funforge) showed us some art and mini designs. The art and minis looked amazing! Be sure to look for Namiji on Kickstarter in November. It was really fun.\u201d\nGOING ANALOG:\u201cIt gave us the lovely, serene feeling of Tokaido but with more critical decision-making, more push-your-luck, and a fun puzzle element with fish collection.\u201d\nROLLING DOUBLES: \u201cRolling Doubles got a quick preview of this sequel and it looks to keep the foundation of Tokaido intact but moving & evolving the formula forward with Namiji! It. Looks. Wonderful.\u201d\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time. You\u2019ll also be able to add any new add-ons at this point or complete your pledge in any desired way.\nIf you change adresses before we ship your rewards, you\u2019ll be able to access your survey anytime after we\u2019ve send it at this link: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/funforge/namiji-the-next-chapter-in-the-tokaido-universe\nPledge levels will be available in French and English. You will choose the language of your pledge in the Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign.\nWe will also provide rules as PDF only (not printed) in the following languages: German, Italian, and Spanish. Note that these files are not yet available, and will be provided between the end of the Kickstarter campaign and delivery of the games.\nLes niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais.

Please, keep in mind that these costs may increase depending on the evolution of the campaign (e.g. unlocked stretch goals, which would increase the weight of the parcel) and on potential add-ons you would add to your initial pledge during the Pledge Manager phase.\n USA: \u20ac12\u201315 to most states, \u20ac40 to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\n EUROPE: \u20ac12 to France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. \u20ac15\u201320 to the rest of the EU countries. \u20ac20\u201325 to the non-EU countries.\n CANADA: \u20ac20 to most cities\n LATIN AMERICA: \u20ac45\u201380 to most countries.\n ASIA: \u20ac15 to China and Hong Kong. \u20ac20\u201330 to most other countries.\n OCEANIA: \u20ac20\u201330 to Australia. \u20ac35 to New Zealand.\n FRENCH TERRITORIES: \u20ac40 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\n REST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): \u20ac80\u2013100 to most other countries.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nWe DO NOT SHIP to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Russia, and Syria.\nPlease note that these prices are NOT including the possible brokerage and/or customs fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country, these fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you).

This will contain any Stretch Goals unlocked for the regular Roleplayer pledge. \nThe Washington Z.C.

Missions properly, you'll need the 2nd Edition Tiles Set, below: \nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days).

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Join CMON in a time travel experience, revisiting and altering the past by funding immersive soundtracks for 3 of our biggest Kickstarter campaigns of the past: Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, and HATE. In addition, backers will get a brand new digital Art Book for Zombicide: Green Horde (including Black Plague content as well), accompanied by the digital versions of the Rising Sun and HATE Art Books. \nThe CMON Time Machine campaign is structured a bit differently than other campaigns. We're taking you to revisit past Kickstarters, Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, and HATE looking to fund brand new Soundtracks for them, as well as Digital Artbooks: The Kickstarter Exclusives from Rising Sun and HATE, and a brand new one for Zombicide: Green Horde and Black Plague.\nWith this also comes a new chance to pledge for those campaigns, acquiring these games along with many of their exclusives, as well access to a Time Vault (in the Pledge Manager) where many other leftover Exclusives from past campaigns (Arcadia Quest, The World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch, Zombicide: Black Plague, and Blood Rage, to name just a few) will be available.\nThere will be no Stretch Goals offered in this campaign and no new Optional Buys beyond the ones offered in the Pledge Manager system.\nThere will be a restriction of 1 pledge per backer.\nThe Time Vault is a Pledge Manager that gives you access to a plethora of Optional Buys from old campaigns, stored in our US warehouse.\nEach Optional Buy in the Pledge Manager system will be available in a specific limited quantity. Also, each backer will not be allowed to get more than 1 copies of very sought after items, or 5 of items that are easily available.\nBackers with $1 Time Vault pledge (with exception of those who have pledged to any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns) will gain access to the Pledge Manager only 48 hours after backers with a Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, or HATE Pledge (or any of the Bundles). So those backers will get first pick at the items in the Time Vault.\nThe Asia-Only Time Vault Pledge and Asia-Only HATE Pledge are separate from the other pledges. They give access to products in our Chinese warehouse, so these pledges will ship from China to Asian countries only.\nAsia-Only pledges give access to a different Time Vault, containing a smaller selection of items and in different quantities from the US Time Vault.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter (or other crowdfunding platforms) since its initial campaign, with any remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for shipping basic pledges. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.  \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that, aside from the Asia-only Pledges (Time Vault and HATE) which will be shipping from our Chinese hub to Asian countries, all products will be shipped from the USA. Non-US backers shipments will likely incur increased costs and possible customs fees. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is December 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late there may not be enough quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

We call this totally different BG experience a Dream Crawler \u2013 you will dive into surreal and artistically crafted world and follow one of a kind co-op / solo campaign adventure for 1-4 players. Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience. The constant state of discovery and the unknown keeps you glued to the table. The game mechanisms are well integrated and just pull you deeper and deeper into this dream world. A dream world I don\u2019t want to leave!\u201d \n- Rolling solo\n\"Etherfields is a magical combination of mechanics, card driven story, and an experience that just draws you in and does not want to let go. \"\n- theMCGuiRE review  \n\"Creative use of components and fantastic art really delivers on the idea of adventures in the dream world; creating an immersive and evocative experience.\"\n - Ready Steady Play \n\u201eAll in all, Etherfields is really, really unique and very, very cool game. Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

NOTE THE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\n\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*** For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a mission-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes,  who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side  takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to  achieve their objectives.\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a mission which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game,  number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to  achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing  sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game.  The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards... everything the  heroes need to play a mission. The villain box contains the miniatures,  tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the  fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals you have unlocked during the first campaign.\n This pledge level allows you to pick and choose what you want, and then decide on your pledge level \u20ac total. A default pledge of \u20ac7 has been set, as this is almost the lowest value element of this campaign. Once you have made your selection and have totaled its\u2019 value, you can directly enter that total \u20ac amount as your pledge.\nFor example: All you want is the Suicide Squad add-on (26 \u20ac), Batman Inc add-on (26 \u20ac), White Rabbit (6.5\u20ac), Carmine Falcone (6.5 \u20ac), and Nobody (6.5 \u20ac) from the picking zone. A total of 71.5\u20ac\nSo, select the \u201cYour choice - Open pledge\u201d pledge level and enter that total amount of 71.5\u20ac, overwriting the minimum pledge amount and you are set.\nAdventure mode racked up 42 missions in season 1, is still supported with 9 NEW missions in season 2. And, some of the new season 2 characters can also be used in S1 core box adventure mode missions.\nFinally, all season 2 characters come with their own tile, opening up a wider Versus mode selection pool for the 10 NEW versus mode missions.\nWhy are there two prices?\nThere are two prices displayed on season 2 elements, the lesser one is exclusive to this KS campaign, and the other will be the price per item once the Monolith WebShop goes live.\nFYI - We anticipate that the Season 2 Batman product will be available on the Webstore several months after the Season 2  kickstarter has been delivered.\nRed Hood \u2013 thank you gift miniature\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN HOW TO GET RED HOOD\nIf your pledge includes ANY elements from season 2, then the Red Hood is yours - free.\nPledge during the \u201cLate pledge \u201cstage or \u201cNo reward\u201d pledge level and you can also pick him up as an add-on pledge within the pledge manager for \u20ac6.5.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\n\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT BATMAN INC.

Intake opens your nasal passages far wider than nasal strips, stays on through sweaty exercise, and doesn't collapse upon inhale. \nSee the rest of these testimonials and others at the bottom in \u2018Testimonials from GEN 1 Users\u2019.\n\nSeen enough? CLICK HERE to be among the first people to get our new breathing device!\nClean each side of your nose with an included alcohol wipe to remove any dirt or oils from the skin. \nUsing the applicator, apply one adhesive tab to each nostril just above the pinch point. Press the edges of the tab into your skin. \nApply the Intake band over your nose. The magnetic ends of the band will \u201cclick\u201d into the tabs, opening your nose.\nUnlike some campaigns, we don't aim to make money on your shipping fees. By calculating shipping after the campaign is over, you save up to 30% on shipping fees. \nShipping charges above are estimates. Final shipping charges will appear on the post-campaign survey and may vary slightly from these estimates.\nUS estimates apply to the lower 48 contiguous states only. Alaska/Hawaii shipping is charged at \u201cRest of World\u201d level. \u201cRest of World\u201d prices are an estimated range.\nThere\u2019s sort of a biological catch-22 when it comes to nasal vs. oral breathing\nGenerally speaking, our noses are more efficient breathing machines than our mouths. When you breathe through your nose, you\u2019re able to pull oxygen into all five lobes of the lungs, whereas your mouth can only pull oxygen to the two uppermost lobes. This act of fully stimulating the lungs has a positive domino effect on the body, ultimately boosting blood flow and helping protect organs and muscles from damage. \nHere comes the catch: During increased heart rates, our noses physically can\u2019t inhale quickly enough to deliver air at the rate our bodies need. So, we rely on breathing through our mouths, which can deliver the requisite amount of oxygen, but can\u2019t create the positive domino effect achieved through nose breathing. \nIn fact, chronic mouth breathing actively hinders physical performance and recovery. \nSounds like a problem, right?\nThat\u2019s where Intake comes in. The Intake band keeps your nasal passage ways open at their widest capacity, allowing you access to deep breathing like never before. Intake ensures not only that you\u2019re getting the most out of your workout, but that your body has full access to the processes it needs to be at its absolute best. \nDEHYDRATING and IRRITATING - Your mouth can\u2019t filter air the same way your nose can, so the air you take in orally can cause inflammation in your lungs and throat. Exhaling through your mouth can also contribute to whole body dehydration, as water molecules leave your body more rapidly: you can see this on cold days, when the temperature makes the water vapor visible.\nUPSETS BLOOD PH - Nasal breathing balances CO2 levels in the bloodstream, which helps to keep the pH of our blood in its proper range. Mouth breathing decreases CO2 level, which in turn makes blood too alkaline. \nCAUSES PERPETUAL STRESS-STATE - Breathing through your mouth causes hyperventilation, which triggers the sympathetic nervous system and activates our fight-or-flight response. When this side of our nervous system is activated, our focus drops and our stress response goes up, contributing to feelings of anxiety and depression--despite the endorphins exercise can stimulate.\nINCREASE NITRIC OXIDE - Nitric Oxide is formed in the nasal cavity, and it\u2019s vital to your body\u2019s function. It\u2019s a vasodilator, which means it allows your blood vessels to relax so that blood flow increases and your body is able to deliver more oxygen to your muscles and organs. This means optimal endurance and stamina, and faster recovery. \nBOOST COGNITIVE FUNCTION - Nasal breathing stimulates the amygdala and hippocampus, balancing your mood and improving short term memory and focus. It also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with feelings of centeredness and relaxation. \nMAINTAIN HEALTH - Breathing exclusively through your nose protects your immune system in two ways: your nose filters particulates and humidifies the air reaching your lungs, which cuts down on inflammation, and the nitric oxide in your sinus cavity acts as an antimicrobial, helping to inhibit pathogen growth before it can enter your body.\nMost of our users are professional athletes--but you don\u2019t have to be to benefit from Intake. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re just regular humans who wanted to feel good when we were going for a jog or winding down with a yin yoga class. \nThe solution we found works so well that we want you to have access to it too, whether you\u2019re an Olympic trainee or a desk jockey or somewhere in between. The idea behind Intake is simple: if you can breathe your best, you can be your best, no matter where you are. \nThe hours you spend recharging are just as important as the ones you spend up and running\u2014if not more. While we designed Intake for high impact activity, many of our test phase users have also used Intake for sleep, and have reported feeling more rested and energized upon waking. Deepen your sleep, cut down on snoring, and utilize your breathing like never before.\n\nAfter over a year of development and testing we are excited to offer the new and improved Intake Breathing System to Kickstarter FIRST!\n The improvements to the Intake Sport Band:\nNew contours for increased comfort & fit across the bridge of the nose\nNew softer edges for additional comfort against the skin\nEven radius for custom printing capabilities\nChanges in Intake Tabs:\nNew method of manufacturing for minimal exposure of adhesive to air for better adhesion.\nNew pull tabs for easier application\nNew sweat channel to expel sweat built up under the steal disk\nThe Intake Band comes in sizes Small, Medium, and Large, and the sizing is determined by the width of your nose. We\u2019ve designed the range to be fairly universal\u2014if you\u2019re of average size, a Medium is a good place to start. Based on our test phase users, we typically recommend a small for kids and teens, a medium for women, and medium or large for men.\nHere\u2019s where it gets a little more complex: if you\u2019re wearing Intake for high-impact activity, or in a sport that requires goggles or a faceplate, we recommend sizing down. A smaller size band will create less pull on the adhesive tabs, making the band more likely to stay put.\nIf you\u2019ll primarily be using Intake for sleep or lower-impact activities (for instance, a moderate gym set), we recommend choosing your normal size or even sizing up\u2014the larger sized bands are less convex, meaning they\u2019ll pull your nostrils open wider and allow greater airflow. However, this also means they\u2019ll pull harder on the adhesive tabs, meaning you\u2019ll potentially get less run time out of the tabs.\nWe get it: this is kind of a weird product. Before we started Intake, we\u2019d all heard about the benefits of breathing through your nose, but we\u2019d likened it to eating broccoli: good for you, but weird to do all the time. Well, we\u2019re here now to tell you that nasal breathing is both good for you and decidedly not weird to do all the time. Actually, it\u2019s pretty incredible\nSo, we\u2019re launching a Kickstarter campaign because we think this product--while humble--is truly revolutionary, and we want to share it with you. Through our research and test phases, we\u2019ve realized that having a little help breathing through your nose can radically improve your athletic endurance, your recovery, your mental aptitude, and your mood. \nOur Kickstarter target is to raise enough money to make our production process more efficient. With support from our backers, we\u2019ll be able to increase both the accessibility and affordability of Intake, and be able to develop different product models for our increasingly diverse customer base. \nThe faster we\u2019re able to adapt to accommodate our growing market, the more people we will be able to help. Ultimately, this all boils down to one single, driving force: we want to help you breathe your best, because that means you can be your best.\nJust try it for yourself. You\u2019ll feel the difference.

(2017)\nWe launched in 2018 with our first generation product, a magnetic nasal breathing strip that our users tell us is--not to toot our own horn--the best on the market in terms of oxygen flow, comfort, and durability. \nOur original design was conceived by athlete and medical entrepreneur Jim Castillo (if you\u2019ve ever been in need of a knee brace, you can thank him for designing the most widely-used model).\nWant to know more?

We wanted to make sure we were bringing a product that was truly effective and revolutionary in the sphere of athletic gear, and one that the Kickstarter community could feel confident putting their money behind. We have invested our own capital to build Intake before turning to crowdsourcing: we\u2019ve been running this company successfully for over a year, and have already met and overcome a number of challenges on our own. We\u2019re still new, but we\u2019re seasoned, and this means we will be able to use our Kickstarter funding more efficiently than if we didn\u2019t have this past year of blood, sweat, and tears under our belt.\n\nThe time and money we\u2019ve already put behind Intake has allowed us to work the kinks out of our manufacturing process, make improvements to our design, and fine tune our materials, meaning we won\u2019t be using your money to experiment. We\u2019ve locked down 6 patents and have 9 pending, meaning Intake can\u2019t (and won\u2019t ever) be duplicated or reproduced. We know what we want, and we\u2019ve paved the road to get there, so you can rest easy that from here on out, it\u2019ll be a pretty smooth ride.\n\nThe machinery used to manufacture our tabs was built by our team, and therefore can\u2019t be replicated. This is good because it ensures our manufacturing process is a trade secret; however, if there\u2019s a problem with our machinery, we can\u2019t outsource to another factory. So, if something does go wrong, our process is held up until we can correct the issue ourselves, causing slowdowns in production.\n\nThere are always risks associated with international shipping.

Based on the award-winning Bloodborne video game by Sony Interactive Entertainment, the board game brings the beloved title to life with amazing miniatures! \nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Full Moon: All-In Set, Forbidden Woods, Forsaken Cainhurst Castle, Hunter's Dream, Upper Cathedral Ward, Yahar'gul Unseen Village, Byrgenwerth.\nScale comparison.\nMichael Shinall has been posting a series of updates, exploring the multiple aspects of the game's gameplay:\nHunter's Axe Overview\nBlade of Mercy Overview\nKirkhammer Overview\nBeast Claw Overview\nStake Driver Overview\nInsight and the Campaign\nPositioning and Combat\nBoss Encounters\nSkills and Upgrades\nCampaign Overview: Razing of Old Yharnam\nPainted by BigChild Creative. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this: \nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

For this reason, we've decided to thank you by giving away a few SG Kickstarter Exclusives. During the campaign, a number of SGs and Add-ons will be released, dedicated to all those who believe in our project.

The renaissance influence of the setting has a strong impact on the choice of clothing and names, deeply immersing players into this extraordinary atmosphere. \nWhile many other external sculptors have helped us give life to our ideas, it was Fernando Armentano and Tommaso Incecchi, who headed up the work.

Following a massive investment in terms of human resources, Dungeonology is the result of the efforts of a team that is passionate about its work and strives for excellence in every creative field. \nOur past projects, Nova Aetas, Sine Tempore and Black Rose Wars, are proof of the passion we invest in the development of our games and the quality we achieve thanks to our high-level professionalism. \nDungeonology is a project that was born more than 2 years ago.  \nThe game has been play-tested at numerous trade fairs by loads of groups, from occasional players to test the entertainment factor and more hardcore players to perfect the mechanics.\nThanks to this preliminary work, we will be able to send the core game, Circe and all aesthetic expansions in rapid time, making sure you receive the game before October 2019. Many of the SGs and Add-ons have already been developed and tested, ready to be unlocked and produced. Should we exceed the expectations of the project, all the rest of the material will be sent by May 2020. Thanks to the experience acquired in previous projects, we are fully aware that if certain objectives are reached, we will need to ask you for more time. \nBut we trust that by having the base game and part of the SGs and Add-ons straight away, the wait will be made a little easier.  \nYour rewards will be shipped from our international hubs. Based on your location, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or the United States (U.S.A. and the rest of the world).   \nIn most cases, you won\u2019t be hit with customs or VAT either, as we offer Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.     \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping costs to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.    \nDue to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes either domestically or internationally.    \nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for the cost of shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases due to unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you may select. \nWhy are the materials shipped in two waves?\n                          We've experimented with various shipping methods  over the years and after a number of calculations, we've reached the following conclusion:\n                          Generally speaking, it costs more to ship in two waves, but the difference is offset (or almost) by the greater number of shipments made, also thanks to optimized processes in the sorting centres.\n                          Moreover, double shipments offer two distinct benefits: firstly for you backers, who receive the game much quicker than you would for a normal KS project, and secondly for us editors insofar as we're able to optimise the process, thus lowering the error rate in shipments. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAn ambitious project like Dungeonology will require great effort for us as both individuals and a team. We are aware that the huge work to get to production and the subsequent distribution may suffer hitches and delays, but our team will do everything we can to prevent and correct any delays. \nWe will strive to get you your game on time. \nWe have collectively produced, or helped to produce, many projects and we are learning and improving our skills every day.\n\nWe promise to keep you informed on the project with regular and frequent news so that you can always be sure of your investment.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfill your game you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after 14 days may be processed via PayPal or the payment reversed through Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are issued through payment reversal via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is funded in USD.

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard core pledge of Reichbusters: Projekt Vril. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns. They include not only the core box and exclusive O\u2019Reilly Hero, but also assume that all planned stretch goals are unlocked as well. This will give an estimated weight of 9-10kg for the core pledge. We do it this way instead of giving an estimate without stretch goals to ensure that there are no nasty surprises when the pledge manager opens. Should all planned stretch goals not be unlocked then the final weight of the core pledge may be less, and the final shipping cost may also be correspondingly less. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.\n USA: $34\n CANADA: $37\n EUROPE (EU): $34 to France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Denmark. $37-$42 to other EU countries\n EUROPE (non-EU): $42-$69\n LATIN AMERICA: $105-$158\n OCEANIA: $42 to Australia. $84 to New-Zealand\n EASTERN ASIA: $42 to China. $48-$74 to other countries\n REST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $84 to Israel. $105-$158 to other countries\n HIDDEN FACE OF THE MOON (Solar system): Contact us.\nSpeaking of optional buys, should you decide to take the Gung Ho! all-in pledge, then below are the shipping estimates for that. As before, these estimates assume that all stretch goals have been unlocked and added to the core pledge, which gives an estimated weight of around 16kg for the all-in.\n USA: $43\n CANADA: $50\n EUROPE (EU): $43 to France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Denmark. $46-$63 to other EU countries\n EUROPE (non-EU): $63-$91\n LATIN AMERICA: $160-$221\n OCEANIA: $53 to Australia. $130 to New-Zealand\n EASTERN ASIA: $52 to China. $67-$84 to other countries\n REST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $120 to Israel. $160-$221 to other countries\n HIDDEN FACE OF THE MOON (Solar system): Contact us.\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible. For this reason, rewards are sent to all backers at the same time. Due to the unpredictability of the postal services we cannot guarantee the order in which they arrive.  \nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game is a semi co-operative tactical action game for 1-4 players designed in the rich and unique Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122 universe. \nAssigned a dangerous quarry by the Hunter\u2019s Lodge, players choose a tribe and class for their hunter and embark on an adventure through the wilds. A variety of machines and unexpected events lurk along the way, and awaiting them at the end of the trail is a lethal boss fight.\n Combining innovative and dynamic game mechanics with strategic deck building, Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game offers players a unique experience on each playthrough. Hunters can develop along several skill paths and purchase a wide variety of ammunition and equipment from merchants, as well as facing entirely different encounters each time.\nThe Seeker Pledge includes:  \nHorizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game  \nThe Lawless Badlands Expansion  \nThe Sacred Land Expansion  \nKickstarter Exclusive Aloy model  \nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\n After investing heavily in our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working closely with carefully selected manufacturing partners, the quality and detail produced in our industry-leading miniatures is simply world-class. We\u2019ve collaborated with Guerrilla to ensure each machine and model has been through a strict approval process to capture the essence of their videogame counterparts, really immersing players in the beautiful world of Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122.\nWe anticipate that many of you looking at this Kickstarter might be brand new to crowd-funding, and have taken the decision to keep things as simple as we can. Historically most Kickstarter projects tend to charge a little bit more than they strictly need for the initial offering and then \u2018bump-up\u2019 the perceived value through stretch goals.  \nTo minimise this confusion, for this Kickstarter we have given you one pledge level at an amazingly good price, including a plethora of models and even two additional expansions from the start. This comes in a beautiful Limited Edition Box, and the stunning Kickstarter exclusive Aloy model. However, the world of Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122 is a diverse and detailed place with many wonderful characters and powerful machines worthy of making into miniatures. Rest assured, stretch goals will still be making an appearance \u2013 you\u2019ll just be adding content from brand new expansions rather than fleshing out the core game over the course of the KS campaign. \nAnd the best bit is that your pledge will include every one of these stretch goals that get unlocked during the campaign, for free! So, the more people who support the project, and the more goals get unlocked, the more value we can squeeze in for all you awesome backers!\nEach hunter has a distinct playstyle with a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. The Nora Outcast is a highly skilled and resourceful archer; the Banuk Survivor lives on a knife edge, pushing themselves to the absolute limit. The Carja Warrior is a flashy but lethal duellist, and the Oseram Forgesmith smashes their enemies around with powerful sledgehammer blows.\nRemember, if one hunter dies, then it's game over for everyone, so pay careful attention and work with your allies. Don\u2019t leave an errant Watcher to run out and alert the other machines! Each session presents players with a host of variables and challenges to change their game experience and will keep them entertained for hours on end. \nChoosing a path to follow from the Tracking Deck offers players a difficult choice. They can choose to take the easy path, progressing with little resistance but earning few resources to spend with the merchants or to boost their attacks; or they can take a more challenging trail, encountering more formidable adversaries. Overcoming these foes will not be easy, but can earn precious materials to empower the hunters for their next encounter. The choice is yours\u2026 \nCombat is deeply tactical, offering players meaningful choices at every turn. Hunters can sneak through tall grass and remain hidden until the time to strike is right, but every second which passes means the machines are one step further along their patrol routes. Wait too long, and your prey will leave the playing area and you\u2019ll fail the encounter \u2013 attack too soon, and you\u2019ll make enough noise to attract the attention of every enemy in earshot. \nAs the game goes on, players will soon learn to adapt their strategy to each type of enemy, all of whom react differently to the hunters. Some have vulnerable components for the players to tear off, providing extra resources or disabling powerful attacks. Others are lethal foes who will need to be finished quickly, before they pin a hunter down and tear them to pieces. \nAlthough the players are working together to bring down their prey, they must still be aware of their allies. Hunters earn glory points during each encounter for performing particularly heroic or devastating attacks, attracting the attention of the ever-vigilant Hunter\u2019s Lodge. After each battle, the Lodge awards Sun tokens for the players with the most glory \u2013 and at the end of the game when their quarry is at last overcome, the player with the most Suns is declared the victorious winner!\nAfter each successful encounter, the players will be able to visit merchants to upgrade their decks with improved ammunition, new weapons, or stock up on potions. They\u2019ll also be able to level up, each progressing a skill path unique to their hunter and which allows further customisation. The more difficult the encounter, the higher tier of merchant they will be able to visit, and the further they\u2019ll be able to progress their skill tree. \nDesigned to be deep enough to satisfy experienced tabletop gamers whilst also remaining accessible to newer players, Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game is quick to learn but difficult to master. Fans will encounter the enemies and machines they fell in love with when playing the original videogame, and newcomers will find themselves drawn into this incredible world.\nOptional purchases are also available to backers during the campaign. To purchase an Add-On, simply click the \u2018manage your pledge\u2019 button, and increase your pledge amount by the amount of any Add-On(s) you\u2019d like to include. After the Kickstarter campaign ends, you will then be able to select your options via our pledge manager.  \nThe Frozen Wilds expansion is set in the icy north where the Banuk make their home, including unique tiles, equipment, and tracking cards to represent this wintery land. This expansion allows players to play as two proud new hunters from the Banuk tribe, and includes their hunter decks and upgrade cards. Also included are highly detailed models for the Scorcher and Frostclaw (2 of each), and rules for encountering them in your games, as well as rules and cards for introducing daemonic machines. Find out more about the Frozen Wilds HERE\nThe Thunderjaw expansion allows players to upgrade their quarry to the next level, and test themselves against this terrifying foe.

Find out more about Huge Machines HERE\nThe Heart of the Nora is an alternate play mode expansion, allowing players to enjoy the game as some of their favourite characters from Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122 and replay this iconic quest from the videogame. This expansion features the ancient war machines from the time of the old ones - a Deathbringer, and two Corruptors, as well as reference and behaviour cards for these powerful enemies. It also features additional tiles and a deck to allow players to replay the quest, replacing the tracking cards found in the main game.\nYou can also purchase multiple Seeker Pledges by increasing your pledge amount by +\u00a3100 per pledge. The 'Extra Seeker Pledge' gets you an additional copy of the core game, Lawless Badlands expansion, Sacred Land expansion and Kickstarter Exclusive Aloy Model with all applicable stretch goals.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and will be collected via our pledge manager system.

We have ensured that the pledge reward offered is packed with fantastic value and Kickstarter exclusives to compensate for any potential delays. However, if this unacceptable to you, please do not back this project and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.\nWe are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan.

Cultists are summoning one of the Elder Ones to consume our world, and it is up to the ragtag group of investigators to face the nightmarish forces and disrupt the ritual long enough to make the Elder One vulnerable. And then kill it dead.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Season 2 Expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, Art Book, Extra Dice, Frost Dice.\nDesigned by Rob Daviau and Eric M. Lang, the game features monster artwork by Adrian Smith and investigator artwork by Karl Kopinski. Investigators come from all walks of life, each bringing a unique skill to the team, as well as two other generic skills.\nArt by Karl Kopinski, sculpts by RN Estudio.\nMadness is always at your side when battling unthinkable monstrosities from other dimensions. In fact, the investigators already start the game with a diagnosed insanity, which will will be triggered by your encounters with the occult. You may be doomed by your mental breakdown, or learn to use it to your advantage. The closer you are to losing your mind completely, the more powerful your skills will become.\nArt by Filipe Pagliuso.\nSummoning the Elder Gods are fanatic cultists, and the hosts of nightmarish monstrosities aiding  them in their cause. Each of these enemies possesses its own special ability and combat strength. They are not controlled by any player, but instead have their behavior triggered by Mythos cards used for each specific episode.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Sculpts by Thierry Masson, Yannick Hennebo, Remy Tremblay, Michael Jenkins, Edgar Skomorowski, and Jose Roig.\nThe Death May Die core box contains smaller boxes that hold the modular elements to create each unique game session. Players choose one of the two available Elder Ones and combine their contents with those of one of the six available Episodes. Each of these boxes contain unique figures, tokens, and cards that are only used when playing with those elements. The Mythos deck used in each game is a combination of cards from the chosen Elder One box and the chosen Episode box. Each Episode not only indicates the map setup using the various tiles in the game, but also new actions the investigators can perform in order to accomplish the tasks required to disrupt that episode's ritual. They each also bring their own Discovery cards for players to explore, and the monsters' behaviors and abilities are tailored to each unique story.\nHastur, known as the King in Yellow, and his disciples brand the world with their terrible Yellow Sign. Those that suffer this doom quickly meet their fate by the hands of death or madness.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Disciple sculpt by Thierry Masson. Hastur sculpt by JAG.\nCthulhu, The Thing That Should Not Be, will bring his sunken kingdom of R'lyeh into our world, plunging the earth into a nightmarish reality.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Cthulhu sculpt by Michael Jenkins. Star Spawn sculpt by Aragorn Marks.\nThe Elder Ones start the game off the board; as they move along the summoning track their growing presence invites chaos and insanity into the world to accompany their grand awakening. Eventually they cross over and the real nightmare begins. If the investigators have managed to disrupt the ritual, the Elder One becomes vulnerable and may (just possibly) be killed for good. If not, the investigators now have to contend with an immortal behemoth hunting them while they try to accomplish their tasks. Either way, killing the Elder One will not be easy, not by a long shot, as each time it's bested it grows more enraged and powerful. In the end, either all investigators will fall or death will come for the Great Old One.\nInvestigators, Cultists, Star Spawn, Cthulhu and Hastur painted by Robert Karlsson. Byakee, Deep One, Ghoul, and Shoggoth painted by Fabrizio Russo. Cthonian, Fire Vampire, and Hunting Horror painted by Angel Giraldez. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nIn their mission to thwart the cultist's plans, investigators engage in more than combat. If they can get some respite, they can discover all sorts of things to potentially help them in their tasks. Discovery cards are unique to each Episode, and present the investigators with challenges or choices that will grant them different resources, companions or negative effects.\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box comes with:\n45 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n17 Terrain Tiles\n30 Plastic Tentacle Tokens\n8 Custom Dice\n5 Counter Bases\n10 Investigator Dashboards\n186 Cards\n120 Tokens\n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nUnspeakable Pledge - $100\nBackers with an Unspeakable Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSculpt by RN Estudio. Painting by Robert Karlsson.\nJulia is an incredibly level-headed investigator. Given the extraordinary circumstances she finds herself in, it's amazing how she can keep her wits about her. Her unique skill allows her to take wounds instead of stress, greatly increasing her chances of success in any given encounter. Though it may cost her life in the end...\nR'lyeh Rising Pledge - $250\nBackers with a R'lyeh Rising Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive R'lyeh Rising expansion, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nAs the production of this statue is extremely expensive and time-consuming, delivery of it will be staggered. However, all backers will receive the rest of the base pledge at the same time. \nCheck out THIS UPDATE for for answers to some pressing questions, extra gameplay information, and shipping cost estimates.\nLet's not be coy, the heart and soul of the R'lyeh Rising expansion is its colossal figure of Cthulhu! This cyclopean creation is something never before seen in the world of board gaming. Its base is 44 x 44 cm wide, and it stands 57 cm tall to the tip of its wings. In fact, this thing is so huge that his base becomes the board on which the game is played! This plastic statue was sculpted in terrifying detail and will come pre-assembled, with the exception of the clip-on wings, so it can be proudly displayed for all to see.\nSculpt by Remy Tremblay (Julia figure included for scale).\nR'lyeh Rising is a wholly unique Episode, the epic finale to Death May Die, not only bringing its own set of tokens, Discovery cards, Monster cards, and Mythos cards, but also drastic changes to the game's base rules, as the figures move and act freely upon the behemoth's rocky base.\nPainting by Angel Giraldez (Cultist figures included for scale).\nPLEASE NOTE ALL FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON team dives into a gameplay overview of Death May Die with Episode 1 - Blasphemous Alchemy:\nFind out more about the Season 2 Expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the Black Goat of the Woods HERE. \nFind out more about the Art Book HERE.\nFind out more about the Extra Dice HERE.\nFind out more about the Frost Dice HERE.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is July 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and Zombicide: Green Horde.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Cthulhu: Death May Die.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Whether you are new to Heroes of Land, Air & Sea or a seasoned warlord, welcome.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge for all the spoils of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea or you can add to your current collection with the all-new expansion Pestilence.\nTo Order Add-Ons, manually increase your pledge by the total dollar amount of your desired add-ons. Shipping charged separately for Add-Ons in PledgeManager.\nWant to see the Pre-Painted Minis up close? Click HERE to enlarge.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is an easy to learn and easy to play 4X game. The depth is in forming your strategy. You can learn all you need to play from the video below.\nClick to read the full review!\n    Click HERE for more reviews of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea!  \nTo show off the new content first, the order of contents below is as follows: Pestilence, Base game, Order & Chaos.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea: Pestilence - ALL NEW CONTENT\nClick to enlarge!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea: Pestilence introduces 2 new Factions, 20 new Spell Cards, 24 new Exploration Tokens, and an all new Floating Continent and Sunken Continent.\nBoth the Floating Continent and the Sunken Continent are usable with any player count.\nThe Floating Continent is the starting island for the Birdfolk and is accessible via ferry routes and air vessels. \nThe Sunken Continent is the starting island for the Merfolk and can be placed over any island. It is seeded with water exploration tokens instead of land tokens, but remains traversable only by land units and air units, like other islands.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea (Base Game)\nClick to enlarge!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea: Order and Chaos \nClick to enlarge!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is a 4X style board game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) that was designed to recreate the experience of RTS (Real Time Strategy) games for the tabletop. It plays roughly 30-45 minutes per player and, with the inclusion of expansions, supports 1-7 players. It features rules for free-for-all \u2014 2 vs. 2 \u2014 2 vs. 2 vs. 2 \u2014 3 vs. 3 \u2014 and solo play.\nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, players will choose one of the many factions offered from the collective total of the base game and available expansions, and then develop this faction from the ground up over a series of rounds. These developments include growing your work force and army, constructing buildings and towers useful to your goals, recruiting heroes to lead your army, acquiring vessels that travel by sea and air, and expanding your reach to all areas of the map.\nThroughout the game, players will engage in epic battles, vie for area control, cast powerful spells and carefully manage resources. In addition to an economy of goods, the game features an action economy that requires players to find balance between committing their serfs to build, gather resources, and select the actions required to proceed through the game.\nThe game concludes one round after a player meets one of four end game triggers. The four end game triggers correspond with the 4x's: eXplore (all land exploration tokens have been revealed), eXpand (all the serfs and warriors of a single player are in play), eXploit (all three towers of a single player are in play) or eXterminate (a player's capital city has been destroyed). The player with the most victory points wins the game. Victory points are acquired in numerous ways that include the final level of your capital city, battles you have won and lost, regions you control and units in play at the end of the game.\nThe Factions of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea\nThe base game features the classic factions of Humans, Orcs, Dwarves and Elves. The Order & Chaos expansion features the Lionkin, Undead, Lizardfolk and Goblins. The new expansion, Pestilence, introduces the Birdfolk and Merfolk.\nMercenary Mini Expansions\nThe Mercenary Mini Expansions offer a wide range of Heroes that can be recruited by any player without prerequisites. Mercenary Heroes possess some of the most powerful abilities in the game and can be recruited alongside your faction's regular Heroes. \nNomads Mini Expansion \nThe Nomads Mini Expansion features 2 different play modes. You can either use the Nomads as Mercenaries or as NPCs (non-player characters). \nIf used as Mercenaries, a player is able to recruit 3 Nomads to join their army. In many ways they function as enhanced Serfs. While they cannot build, they can follow/muster actions and collect extra resources. They also reduce the resource collection of opponent's in adjacent regions and offer a late game boost to exploration. Their strength depends on how many are in play, so try to keep them all alive. \nIf used as NPCs, they cannot be controlled by any single player for long. Each round, 1 is added by the player who starts the round. The regions adjacent to Nomads produce 1 fewer resource. If left unchecked they can really hinder the progress of nearby players and the more there are in play, the more difficult they are to defeat. But, defeating one allows a player to capture them and use them to follow/muster a single future action. Then they return to the supply. \nAdditionally, the Nomads Mini Expansion introduces 6 new spell cards. These spells allow players to leverage the Nomads for their own gain, by either befriending them or enraging them.\nSiege Engines Mini Expansion\nThe Siege Engines Mini Expansion features 6 siege constructs. Like Mercenaries, these units can be recruited by any player without prerequisite. They offer abilities uniquely focused at giving you the edge in certain types of battles. For instance, the Ballistae offer ranged attack and are powerful against Heroes and Air Vessels. The Catapults also offer ranged attack and are designed to destroy towers and sea vessels while the Siege Towers have a singular focus on laying waste to Capital Cities. \nPestilence Booster Pack\nThe Pestilence Booster Pack provides the additional card sleeves needed to sleeve the extra cards added with the Pestilence Expansion. It also features 14 new Spell Cards and 2 new Vessels.\nThe Dragonscale Yacht is a new Mercenary Vessel featured in the Pestilence Booster Pack.\nNote: the 2 Vessel Stands used for the Dragonscale Yachts come inside the Pestilence Expansion box, NOT inside the Pestilence Booster Pack. The stands are the same as the ones offered in the Base Game and the Order & Chaos Expansion.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea 2nd Printing Update Kit\nIf you own the first printing of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea and its expansion products, this 2nd Printing Update Kit is for you. It will come with physical copies of any rules, player boards, and cards that have had any text changes. After swapping these in, your game and expansions will be the same as the versions offered in the 2nd printing. \nThe 2nd Printing Update Kit is offered for free with pledges to the Pestilence Expansion. It will also be offered at cost (plus shipping) in the PledgeManager. \nPre-Painted Hero and Mercenary Minis\nClick to enlarge!\nIf you're like me, you're not a painter but you enjoy having painted minis. While it's not feasible for us to have all the minis pre-painted, we can offer it for the Heroes and Mercenaries at roughly $2 per mini or less. \nWe will also back this option up with a *Money-Back Guarantee. If you'd like to take advantage of this offer, refer to the reward tier you have selected and manually add the amount listed to your pledge. \n*Money-Back Guarantee: If you are not satisfied with your pre-pianted miniatures, we will offer you a no-questions-asked money-back guarantee for the price of the Add-On. We will replace your pre-painted miniatures with the un-painted versions and refund your money for the add-on. We just ask that you please send us your pre-painted minis and cover the postage of that shipment.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea App\nWe are currently developing a FREE app for Android and iOS that will assist you in playing Heroes of Land, Air & Sea. We expect to have this app available for download in August. \nThis app will offer the following awesome features:\nRule References - So you can spy on your opponents' powers without asking them what they are. \nGuided Play - To help first time players with setup and round structure.\nFirst Player Selector - You know... to help you pick who will go first. :)\nScore Calculator - To assist with the accuracy and execution of end game scoring.\nLore Library - So you can read all about the world of Aughmoore and its inhabitants wherever you are. \nEvents of Aughmoore - A mini expansion that features 50 different events. Each event will last one round and will alter the conditions in which the game is played. There are currently no plans to produce a physical version of this expansion. We ask that you download the free app to enjoy these events. \nOther Pledge Options\nTo pledge for these options, you will need to enter the exact amount + shipping (see below) for your pledge, but you will not select a reward tier. \nYour pledge will be transferred to our PledgeManager after the project is over. There you will be able to select these packages and apply your pledge to cover their cost. \nIf you'd like pre-painted Heroes and Mercenaries, add $25 for Order & Chaos Only or add $40 for Order & Chaos + Pestilence + Extras.\nOrder & Chaos Only / Order & Chaos + Pestilence + Extras  \nUnited States, Canada, Germany, China: $15 / $25 \nEuropean Union, United Kingdom, Australia: $20 / $30\nHong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan: $25 / $35\nNew Zealand: $30 / $40\nLatin America, Rest of World: $55 / $65\nPLUS Customs Friendly Shipping is being offered for the U.K. and select parts of China.\nInstead of surprising you with shipping costs AFTER the project is funded just to offer you a low upfront price, we are charging the shipping now. You will NOT be hit with additional shipping charges from us after the project ends. In most cases, you will not be hit with customs or VAT either as we are offering Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.  \nYour rewards will be shipped at our cost to our international hubs. Based on where you are located, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or New Hampshire (USA and the rest of the world).  \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via an email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping charges to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.  \nDue to the size of the rewards and risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.  \nShipping rates for the two primary reward tiers are described below: \nPestilence / Everything  \nUnited States, Canada, Germany, China: $15 / $25  \nEuropean Union, United Kingdom, Australia: $20 / $30 \nHong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan: $25 / $35  \nNew Zealand: $30 / $40  \nLatin America, Rest of World: $55 / $65\nThe most effective way to assure that we reach all potential upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!! \nHere are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nGamelyn Games, LLC is a passion-driven game publishing company based out of Arizona.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have many years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturer that we have used for numerous projects. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 5 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Once your game has been packed for shipment, we do not offer a refund.

This is a turbulent time, with bandits lurking in the wilds of the countryside, and pirates roaming the high seas. Evil taints the hearts of men, and many give in to temptation. Many, but not all. Against this tide of corruption stands Solomon Kane. This mortal hero fights his lone crusade, aided by the silent might of the immortal Virtues. Together they fight against the implacable Darkness. This is the fearless opponent who tries to thwart our hero at every turn, and who must be overcome by the players if Solomon Kane is to emerge victorious.\nDarkness has emissaries too, and these Shadows are also attracted by Solomon Kane\u2019s faith. Shadows are not physical beings \u2013 they are the essence of the nameless horror that hides just out of sight, the lurking danger you think you glimpse from the corner of your eye, or the secret dread that sends shivers down your spine. This can drive lesser men to madness, and even Solomon Kane could be overwhelmed, for whilst his faith is strong, Darkness is powerful too. Solomon Kane can see neither Virtue nor Shadow, yet he can feel both, and he has his faith. This tells him that Good must triumph over Evil. It is up to the Virtues to ensure that he is right.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\u201cSolomon Kane\u2026 considered himself the fulfiller of God\u2019s judgment, a vessel of wrath to be emptied upon the souls of the unrighteous.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe central figure in the game is Solomon Kane himself. He is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs who roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest. All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa \u2013 even to the shores of the distant New World of America.\nSpace Marine (Warhammer 40K), Warrior (Rising Sun), Vampire (Solomon Kane), Conan (Conan), Solomon Kane (Solomon Kane), Leonidas (Mythic Battles), Bandit (Solomon Kane), Khorne Warrior and Stormcast Eternals (Shadespire)\nHe neither knows nor questions why he is driven to do this. It simply must be done. To Solomon Kane, he is doing God\u2019s work. To his enemies he is a relentless fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon. At least, it does when the Virtues are on his side.\n\u201cHow I overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe Solomon Kane core box comes with 4 complete Adventures: one each in 1 Act, two in 2 Acts, and one in 3 Acts. These stories are the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, Death's Black Riders, and the Blue Flame of Vengeance - all based on original tales from Robert E Howard. We unlocked three 1 Act original stories, the Witchfinder General, L'Ogre and Beast of Bordeaux. With 10 Chapters per Act, this gives you 110 Chapters to explore, about 60 hours to play these stories once, and many, many hours of replay value.\nWe have many stretch goals planned for this Kickstarter campaign, adding new miniatures, Adventures, and other surprises. All stretch goals that we unlock during this campaign will be added FREE to every Puritan pledge, and every additional copy of the core box you pledge for.\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOALS\nThe Puritan Pledge contains many, many hours of game play, and stretch goals add even more. However, if you\u2019re enjoying Solomon Kane we will be revealing some additional content during the campaign that you may want to add to your pledge. If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-on, just click the Manage your Pledge button at the top of this page, and increase your current pledge amount by the amount of the extra items that you\u2019d like to add. Kickstarter doesn\u2019t let you specify what you want at this stage, so we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed. The system we use for this is called a Pledge Manager, and all backers will be sent a link to this after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\n(To find more about All-in bundles, click here)\nRED SHADOWS\nTHE ART BOOK OF SOLOMON\nThe Right Hand of Doom\n(To find more about this expansion, click here)\nHEART OF AFRICA\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAGAINST THE VAMPIRES\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAMERICA - THE NEW WORLD\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nEach player takes the part of one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with a special combination of abilities that reflect their unique role. Together they must help Solomon Kane achieve his mission.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nCourage\nCourage is bold and sometimes reckless. She cannot sit idly by, and encourages Solomon to resolve everything with action!

She encourages Solomon to keep his wits about him, and be aware of what is going on around him. Her speciality is exploring the environment, and avoiding nasty surprises.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\"The battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell. \"\n Allied Mortals\nSolomon Kane is a loner, and only begrudgingly accepts the aid of others in his quest. However, when others need his aid he is quick to come to their assistance, and this means that his Adventures against the Darkness sometimes include companions. \nN'Longa is not included in the Core Box. But you will see him soon!\nN'Longa and Solomon Kane, blood brothers\n Solomon Kane\u2019s only regular companion is N\u2019longa \u2013 a self-styled \u201cmighty worker of nameless magic\u201d. Despite their significant differences in outlook, they get along perfectly, saving each other from death on more than one occasion. It is hard to say which one of them relies more on the other. \nJack is a hot-headed, somewhat naive, but well-meaning young man, whose main goal is to protect Mary and her honour. He falls in with Solomon Kane when the Puritan comes to his rescue.\nMary is the archetypical damsel in distress. If Jack can't save her, then Solomon Kane will always be ready to protect any innocent in peril.  \nThe wrong place at the wrong time, that\u2019s the best way to describe the unfortunate traveller. He really should have waited for daylight to cross that moor\u2026\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n Darkness is the natural opponent of Light. It is a combination of all the secret, unsavoury feelings and deeds which men are capable of. It lurks in the blackness, moulding the essence of the night into its minions, and sending them to plague the mortal world.\nShadows  \nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nThe main servants of Darkness are the mist-like Shadows. They are not really creatures at all, more embodiments of a terrifying idea. One that can drive mortals to insanity and death.\nMortals  \nThrough his many Adventures, Solomon Kane encounters a wide variety of misguided, malevolent, or just plain evil individuals who all do Darkness\u2019 bidding \u2013 whether they realise it or not. These range from simple thugs, through cannibal tribesmen, to otherworldly and magical creatures. Solomon Kane must overcome them all.    \nSolomon Kane and Jack Hollinster ready to confront Fishhawk and his pirates\n Latest Rules Playthrough - The Blue Flame of Vengeance - 3rd July\nPlease note that components and rules used in this video are not final and are subject to change.\nSolomon Kane\u2019s lifelong fight against Darkness is told in a series of Adventures, based on the stories and characters created by Robert E. Howard. Adventures are broken down into 1-5 Acts, depending on their length. Each Act is itself broken down into 8-10 Chapters. A gaming session will typically be a single Act, or part of one. Depending on the time you have available, you may play through a whole Act, or be able to complete only a few of its Chapters. If this is the case, you simply use the game\u2019s save function to remember where you have got to, and you can return to complete the rest of the Adventure another day.\nChapter 1 - \"Skulls in the stars\"\nWhen you play through an Act, you naturally start with the first Chapter. One player reads the narrative text aloud and follows the instructions on the card. The players then do their best to help Solomon Kane overcome whatever challenges the Chapter throws his way, and then they move onto the next one.\nEach Virtue Turn, the controlling player rolls their Fate dice to see what resources they have available to pay for actions. These dice can be donated to other players, or saved for later Turns, as well as buying actions immediately, and deciding how to coordinate these actions and share these resources between the players is a big part of the game. Solomon Kane takes the concept of cooperation very much to heart, and the players need to be discussing and working together throughout the game. Even when it is not your Turn you are involved in vital decisions.\nAllocating dice during your turn\nAfter each player\u2019s Virtue Turn comes a Darkness Turn. This is where the AI deck acts to thwart the players and destroy Solomon Kane. It can move its minions on the board, trigger unpleasant events, or simply sap the will of the mortals to carry on.\nThe Act continues with the players resolving one Chapter card after another, with their Adventure unfolding as they do. After many trials and obstacles, a final Chapter card will tell the players whether their actions have been enough to achieve victory, and whether they have won or lost. Solomon Kane is a pure co-op game, and players either all win together, or all lose together.\nCARDS\nSolomon Kane uses a number of different card types to tell the stories. These are:  \nChapter Cards  \nThese tell the steps in the story. Each Chapter number has a number of different options represented by different cards, some easier to complete, some near-impossible. This is a little bit like going through a choose-your-own adventure book, but instead of simply picking what you want to do, the players have to achieve a particular effect with their actions to decide what happens next. \n(To find more about Chapters, click here)\nChapter cards come in two main types: Story and Scene. A Story Chapter contains the next piece of the tale to read aloud. A Scene Chapter contains the map layout, miniatures, and objectives to play it out on the board.\nDarkness Cards \nThe Darkness deck is what drives the player\u2019s opponent. Each card is divided into several sections, each applying in a different circumstance. This allows the AI to be flexible and to react differently to each situation. Using them is simple: just flip the top card of the deck at the start of each Darkness Turn and do what it says.    \nEvent Cards  \nWhen a Shadow triggers an Event, the next card in this deck is revealed. This is usually bad, though not always. Occasionally the Light shines through the Darkness and a brief reprieve is granted to Solomon Kane and his companions.   \nVirtue Cards\nEach Virtue has their own unique 10-card deck of Virtue cards. These cards list the possible actions for that Virtue, together with the cost in Fate dice to perform each one. In principle, any Virtue can do any action, though only some of the actions will be available at any one time. During the game, players must carefully manage their decks, ensuring that their active cards give them the most useful range of options for the task at hand, and work well alongside those of their companions.\nDiscovery Cards  \nThere are many secrets in Solomon Kane, and whilst the Adventures are based on Robert E. Howard\u2019s tales, they have been greatly expanded. Where Solomon chose one path in the original works he now has a choice. That is, the players collectively have a choice to decide, by their actions, which path to take. Discovery cards hide many of the possible outcomes from the players, and keep the elements of tension and surprise: you must decide before you know for sure what will happen next. This means that even if you have played the Adventure before, there will be fresh elements each time. \n(To find more about Discovery cards, click here)\nMAP TILES\n Each Scene Chapter has a map, made up of 1 or more of the many double-sided tiles from the box. Maps vary in size and shape, each offering a unique puzzle for the players to unpick. \nFATE DICE\n Each Turn, a player rolls 3 Fate Dice to see what energies are available. The fate dice show Bravery, Determination, Fear, Pain, and (of course) Faith.\nEach of the Virtue cards has a number of slots for these resources, and the action on that card can be bought by filling those slots with matching results on the Fate dice. The ability to save some rolled dice for future Turns, and donate much-needed resources to other players makes for a lively discussion. What is the best thing to do?  \nDASHBOARDS\nVirtues\nEach player has a dashboard for the Virtue they are playing. These are all different. They include unique actions, effects of the Virtue\u2019s aura, and spaces for reserved and donated dice.  \nCourage Virtue dashboard with attached Virtue cards\nAdventure track\nThere are four game values that are tracked throughout the game. Three of these are measures of Solomon Kane\u2019s abilities: Strength, Clarity, and Compassion. Each of these is linked to a specific type of test: Strength to Fighting, Clarity to Exploring, and Compassion to Talking. As the game progresses, these tracks may rise and fall. In addition, there is a fourth track: Danger. This monitors the overall Danger of the situation. The more it rises, the more perilous the situation gets.\nEach of the Virtues is linked to one of these tracks. Their actions will often draw upon it, and in the process can lower or increase its value. However, these tracks apply to every Virtue. Even if it is Courage who is most tied to the Strength track, all Fight tests triggered by any Virtue will apply its modifier to them. So, whilst each Virtue looks after its own track, their management of it will impact every player, requiring them to work together.\nMINIATURES\nSame scale, different sizes!\nSolomon Kane includes a huge selection of beautiful 35mm scale miniatures, ranging from the man himself, through dastardly foes and innocent bystanders, to the towering Virtues who aid him. Although nominally 35mm (the height of an average man), the miniatures are all different sizes depending on the individual they represent. This gives us a range from 27mm tall children to the 90mm tall Virtues. Each miniature is a carefully-sculpted masterpiece, full of character. To further enhance this, and to give the painters among our backers even more to enjoy, each sculpt also has its own unique scenic base.\nEach model has its own unique scenic base!\n KANE'S CRUSADE\nThe Mythic Games Ambassador Programme has over 30 Ambassadors across six countries who tirelessly share out games with board game communities. We have already hosted over 60 events and demonstrations while also attending major conventions such as Cannes and UKGE. We have over 50 more events planned already which you can find listed on our Facebook page including attending Paris est Ludique, Origins, Gen Con and Essen SPIEL.\nSeveral hundred public demos organised for Kane's Crusade\nSolomon Kane is a simple fellow, and to reflect this we have only a single core pledge level: the Puritan.\nHowever, we also believe in rewarding our most loyal fans, and those who believe in us the most.

This is based on the costs for our last campaign and the assumption that the final weight will be comparable. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. If the game is significantly lighter than Joan of Arc, then some of the higher end costs may drop.  \n\nUSA: $32\nCANADA: $35\nEUROPE (EU): $32-$40\nEUROPE (non-EU): $40-$65\nLATIN AMERICA: $100-$150\nOCEANIA: $40 to Australia. $80 to New-Zealand\nASIA: $40-$70\nREST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $100-$150\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible.

Producing thousands of complex products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date. \n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon began delivery earlier than originally planned, and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is currently on schedule to hit its planned date. We are confident that Solomon Kane will deliver on time too. \n\nThat brings us to communications: we think they are very important. During this campaign we will post at least one update every day. Afterwards, we will continue to keep you regularly updated with all the latest info in our famous weekly \u201cWhat\u2019s up Wednesday\u201d updates. This means that you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s going on in the adventurous world of Solomon Kane!\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \n\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \n\nIf you apply for a refund more that 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\n\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \n\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\n\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

You won't have to choose your language as the products include both languages.\nTous les niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous n'aurez pas \u00e0 choisir votre langue car tous les produits incluront les deux langues.\n For those who missed our previous KS and would like to know much more about this game, have a look at our previous campaign where we launched Mythic Battles: Pantheon\nThis pledge level includes all the new products from Mythic Battles except the sleeve card packs. Please note that this pledge level also includes the \"1.5 upgrade kit\" for free those who pledged during the first KS.\nMythic Battles is a fictional universe and a range of games that\u2019s constantly evolving. Knowing this, we have been listening closely to our gaming community for player feedback, whether it comes from groups of friends or tournament players. When we combined our observations with yours we have come to realize that some units, game modes, and confusing rules need to be addressed and/or revised. And so for this reprint, we felt our best course of action was to implement some of these changes into MB 1.5.\nHere is some examples of changes we\u2019ve made:\nThe villager mode has been removed because it saw very little use. Additionally, villager miniatures do not appear in the base box and only in an add-on that we chose not to reprint for this campaign.\nA pictogram has been added to the troop maps and dashboards to more easily identify which set (Mythic Battles: Pantheon OR Ragnar\u00f6k ) the miniatures belong to. We have done this in anticipation of Mythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k and us wanting things to be clear for organizational purposes.\nA pictogram has been added to troop maps and dashboards to indicate, in addition to color, the unit type (troops, monster, hero, god or titan).\nBoth rocks have been removed. Indeed, it turns out that players had a lot of trouble assembling them and they hindered the readability on the board and sometimes obscured some miniatures. In addition, during our editing of the rules, we reviewed our wording and realized that only trees and columns are considered \"3D elements\" which obey specific rules. So the rocks\u2019 placement is static/immovable and the 3D pieces were merely an attempt to add dimension to the board.\nFor the \"skirmish\" scenario, we have created a \"built\" mode in addition to the \"draft\" mode. Thus, players who wish can dial their warband ahead and optimize their combos to face their opponent. In this way, it is also easier to focus on painting the figurines that make up their favorite bands.\nWe took advantage of the space gained by removing the rocks to replace the generic power tokens with specific tokens. Thus, in the core box, Arachne will have her own \"web\" token, for example. Some pieces will have a front with a different color from their back to facilitate their use in the \"built\" mode.\nThe system of stat clips that we designed did not seem to live up to the expectations of players. We\u2019ve discovered that even if they glide perfectly in the rails of the dashboards and framed the row of characteristics, they did not hold their position in the event of an unexpected bump. So we have revised this design by adding a rubber rear piece to the stat clips. Now the stat clips remain in place. As these are meant to be clipped and unclipped at will, in the box you will find 20 stat clips (with their backs), which is enough for a classic four-player game. Thus, add-ons will no longer contain new stat clips. If you pledged during the first MBP campaign and you do not pledge anything during this campaign but you want to receive the 20 stat clip backs for free, you will just need to make a request during the pledge manager that will follow this campaign. If you have pledged during the first MBP campaign and you pledged for at least one product during this current campaign, you will receive the 20 stat clip backs for free. If you want to have more than 20 stat clips backs, you will be allowed to buy them during the pledge manager.\nThe core game box gives you a complete game with dozens of stretch goal extras. You don\u2019t actually need any more to have months or even years of replay value. However, you can never have too much of a good thing, and the mythology we\u2019ve based Mythic Battles: Pantheon on is vast, so there was a lot we couldn\u2019t fit into the core box.\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please just click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Mythic Battles: Pantheon Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\nYmir, ancestor of the Giants, was born in the Nine Worlds long before the gods. His brutality incited the gods to cast him into the Ginnungagap Gulf, a yawning void from where all life sprang. From his blood, the gods created the oceans and drowned the giants, and from his body they made Midgard, the land of men. They believed Ymir was dead, but in truth, he channelled his rage and hatred and slowly reformed at the bottom of icy depths. There in the darkness, Ymir\u2019s power swelled and his mind festered with one monomaniacal desire: revenge.\nSculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron and painted by Martin Grandbarbe\nOdysseus mini only for scale\nYmir will come as a MBR add-on during this Mythic Battles: Pantheon 1.5 Kickstarter campaign. However it is fully compatible with Mythic Battles: Pantheon (MBP). The game system is the same, but certain mythological features (characters, battlegrounds, etc) will inform new gameplay features.\nThe 2018 Ymir Expansion also includes an exclusive alternative head. This means you will be able to choose the head you want to use on Ymir. But it also means that if you pledge for Ymir during Mythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k in 2019, you will not receive this exclusive head. Now, if we do happen to launch another MB KS during 2018 (hey, anything is possible), we reserve the right to release this head at that point too, but will not be including it in the 2019 Ragnar\u00f6k Kickstarter. In short, if you know you want this exclusive option, now is the only time we can guarantee its availability.\nFrom left to right: the classic Ymir's head & the exclusive 2018 alternative head\nFrom left to right: the classic Ymir's head & the exclusive 2018 alternative head\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\n Dionysus was conceived during an adulterous union between Zeus and the mortal Semele, daughter of the King of Thebes. After his mother\u2019s death, he was sewn into Zeus\u2019 thigh and kept safe until he reached maturity. To enter the Greek Pantheon, he had to contend not only with his mortal origins, but also with Hera\u2019s potent and fiery jealousy. By exploiting the intoxicating power of wine, he managed to reconcile Hera with her son Hephaestus, and thereby proved his divine legitimacy. Dionysus has been worshipped as the god of wine and excess\u2014known for his orgies and merriment, but also for his fits of rage and madness.\nOdysseus mini only for scale\nThis new set of 10 translucent battle dice is exclusive to 2018 Mythic Battles campaigns. This means that you are able to pledge for them now or maybe later if we decide to launch another MB KS in 2018. But after that, we will no longer produce them.\n The card sleeves will be manufactured to premium 100 micron thickness with a matte finish, matching current market leader standards.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\nPoseidon was lucky. Of all Greece, his realm was the least affected by the return of the Titans and the resulting devastation. Now, he thought, was his chance to step from his brother\u2019s shadow and claim the crown for himself. But first there was a small matter of revenge. That upstart favourite of Zeus: Athena. She was going to pay for winning Athens from him.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n This is not the first time Hera has been upset by her husband Zeus, and his wandering eye (and hands, and other parts). However, it has to be the most dramatic fallout. Since she released the Titans, several Gods have died, the rest have lost their immortality, and Greece lies in ruins.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\nTo show her independence from Zeus, Hera conceived Hephaistos alone. Although he was born crippled, he quickly became the patron god of blacksmiths, fire and volcanoes, and the most outstanding craftsman among the immortals. Hephaistos made many exceptional gifts for both mortals and gods, including the arrows of Artemis and Apollo, and the impenetrable armour of Achilles.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n   They are here! All four of these powerful characters are classed as Titans in the game, though as some of you will know they aren\u2019t always regarded as Titans in the background. Regardless of their technical classification, and call them what you will, on the battlefield they are bigger and more powerful than Gods!\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n    When Hades left the Underworld to fight alongside his fellow Gods, he left his wife, Persephone, in charge. She, in turn, enlisted the aid of Aeacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus, who had all been famous lawgivers in life. They would help her to decide the correct treatment for each soul. That, at least, was the plan, and it worked for a while. Unfortunately the gates of the Underworld were open, and the dead began to escape back up to the realm of the living. Eventually the Judges followed suit, and now fight alongside the Gods, among the ruins.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n     The story of the Trojan Wars is one that all Greeks know well, and the fabled exploits of the many Heroes who fought in it are taught to every child. Now, in the time of suc h catastrophe, when the Gods are fallen from Olympus and walk the Earth as mortals, these legendary Heroes return to seek glory and honour once more.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n   In game the Manticore is a versatile and potent unit. It is the first 5RP unit released, and it is worth every point. Its basic stats put it on a par with the Hydra or Cerberus. However, it\u2019s quite a different beast. It lacks Cerberus\u2019 Guard talent, which makes its role very different. It cannot regenerate like the Hydra, meaning it cannot pile in to the enemy with quite the same abandon. So what\u2019s so good about the Manticore, and what\u2019s it\u2019s role?\nMainly, the Manticore serves to sow chaos and death across the battlefield in a rampage of carnage. It\u2019s fast. A basic move of 2 is bolstered by the ability to fly, which means that it can ignore enemy units and terrain to get at whatever or whoever it wants. The crowning glory in its mobility is its 5 activation cards, 1 more than either Hydra or Cerberus.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n     The campaign pits two players against each other: one controlling Echidna and her kin, the other controlling the Gods and their Heroes. You can use the contents of this box, or swap in any of her other children you may have.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n This expansion contains just two miniatures: Oedipus and the Sphinx, but they are potent forces in the game. They both have unique playing styles, which add an interesting twist whether they\u2019re being used in their dedicated campaign or in skirmish mode. Lots of replayability squeezed into these two.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n As you all know, Mythic Battles: Pantheon is played on different boards each divided into areas. Each of these areas has a terrain type, indicated by an icon. If the ground is empty of 3D terrain, then no rule applies except in special cases (stairs, water, \u2026). If you place a 3D terrain element on an area, the terrain type is then activated, and a small special rule applies.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n    The Thermopylae map board includes 1 double-sided, 60cm square, mounted map, plus 1 scenario. The map shows the battlefield, the cliffs, and the nearby sea into which you can force your foes. It offers a nice choke point for movement that gives the whole map a very different feeling than the others. Movement is restricted and controlled, and positioning is critical.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n     The Compendium includes 3 complete, and very different, campaigns. Each was written by a different author (or authors), and takes the core of the Mythic Battles: Pantheon game and twists it in a new way. We\u2019ve tested these scenarios extensively over many months of gaming, and are confident you\u2019ll enjoy them as much as we do.\nThe beautifully painted miniatures you see in our campaign were painted by a number of artists, including the talented Martin Grandbarbe, who wrote this guide.\n This Extension Kit allows you, with a very few components, to play two 2-players games at the same time.\n This upgrade kit allows you to upgrade your V1 set MBP to version 1.5.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n This is a Deluxe Storage box for all the cards and oddments that come with a full set of Mythic Battles: Pantheon. You don\u2019t need to have everything to use it; we just decided that if we did a Storage box then it might as well fit everything inside.\n Here\u2019s a video of a 2-player game by Beasts of War:\n 4-player video (part 1) by Tric Trac: Explanations & set-up\n 4-player video (part 2) by Tric Trac: Beginning of the game\n4-player video (part 3) by Tric Trac: Combat!\n Let's Play -  Regelvideo - Einf\u00fchrungsszenario Teil 1 von 2 - Brettspiel\n Mythic Battles: Pantheon is a miniatures board game that puts you in an Olympian God\u2019s sandals! It offers several game modes: from tactical battles against other Gods, to scenarios and campaigns that\u2019ll take you on an epic adventure across the devastated ruins of Ancient Greece.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO DOWNLOAD THE RULEBOOK\nThe Titans have escaped their prison in Tartarus to wreak havoc and devastation upon the world. Seeking revenge on their jailers, they attacked the home of the Gods - Mount Olympus itself! The battle was long and closely-fought, but in the end the Gods were victorious. Even so, the battle cost them dearly.\nThe surviving Gods are greatly weakened and have lost their immortality. The only way to regain this power is to assimilate the energy stones called Omphalos. The first to absorb enough of this energy will become the new ruler of the Gods, and can create a Pantheon in their own image.\nA typical army is made up of one God and their group of fighters. Here, Athena, the Lernean Hydra, Achilles, Odysseus and a group of five hoplites. Illustration by Stefan Kopinski.\nThe Gods, monsters, and heroes of Mythic Battles: Pantheon are represented by incredibly detailed miniatures. They\u2019ll make your tabletop come alive!\nEach miniature possesses unique powers: Zeus throws lightning bolts, the Hydra regenerates, Achilles is almost invulnerable\u2026 These powers can be combined to create devastating effects. At the start of each game you choose a God, and then build a warband around them. Choose wisely!\nEach character has an individual Dashboard which lists their cost, statistics, powers, and skills. These can change as the character takes wounds.\n STAT CLIPS\nIn order to track the changing stats of each unit their dashboards can be fitted with specially designed stat clips. These plastic clips simply snap on to a dashboard, showing the current stats in a window. As the unit takes damage, the stat clip slides down the track to show the modified stats.\nThe core box comes with enough clips for a 4-players game. Clips are removable and can be swapped between dashboards.\nPlastic production miniatures - Zeus (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron), Ares (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Athena (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani & Aragorn Marks) & Hades (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon).\n The Gods are the most powerful miniatures in your army. However, since having your God slain means you are out of the game, they can also spell your defeat.\nPlastic production miniatures - Heracles, Achilles, Leonidas (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Odysseus (sculpted by Irek Zieli\u0144ski) and Atalanta (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani).\nPlastic production miniatures - Medusa (sculpted by Aragorn Marks), Minotaur (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Cerberus (sculpted by Edgar Ramos), Hydra (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron).\n All miniatures presented in this campaign will be plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nOne feature of Mythic Battles: Pantheon is the number of large miniatures included in the game. The Gods in particular are all at least 65mm (2.5 inches) tall, and some of the Monsters also tower over normal mortals.\nMythic Battles: Pantheon plays a lot on scale. The Gods are gigantic, as are some of the creatures you can recruit into your army.\nA LOT OF SPEARS\nThe universe of Mythic Battles: Pantheon, counts many a spear, sword, and other long, thin weapon among its vast armoury. To avoid all the bent weapons we so often see in other board games\u2019 PVC miniatures, we\u2019ve decided to innovate by making some of the weapons in ABS (hard plastic) instead.\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components. To be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates for the Core Box + Stretch Goals, and costs may rise based on weight increases from any optional buys you choose.\nAccept the conditions and import taxes of the country you selected for your delivery. We can not refund the orders not delivered or for which the import taxes are too high in the destination country.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014. Since then, Monolith created and successfully delivered 4 top Kickstarter projects driven by one goal: to create immersive games served by great gameplay mechanics and topped with high-quality components.

NATEDE connects to your home or office Wi-Fi, so you can manage NATEDE from everywhere. It features also Bluetooth, which makes the first connection and setup much easier.\nNATEDE\u2019s mobile app dashboard shows real-time monitoring of the IAQ (Internal Air Quality). The wave frequency changes depending on the IAQ levels.\nFrom the mobile app it\u2019s possible to manage NATEDE\u2019s fan speed and select one of the four available operating modes.\nIt's also possible to see a detailed breakdown of the pollutants in your environment.\nNATEDE\u2019s app features a Statistics section where you can monitor the levels of the measured elements such as humidity, temperature, VOCs, PM2.5 and CO. Premium users will also be able to monitor CO\u2082 levels.\nWhen NATEDE detects high levels of pollutants in the air, its app will send a notification and it will ask for information on your activity to better understand your habits and tailor the experience to your needs.\nThe core technology of NATEDE is phytoremediation, which means that it uses the natural power of common plants to clean toxins in the air. This was studied by NASA in the \u201980s and implemented by Vitesy with almost 3 years of research at PNAT and LINV, two of the most important laboratories on plants neurobiology in the world. \nPlants placed in NATEDE metabolize a significantly higher amount of pollutants as opposed to plants potted in regular vases given that the air purification process happens throughout the whole plant, including its roots.\nNATEDE also features a new and improved technology unit that supercharges this effect.\nNATEDE combines phytoremediation with a new incredible filtration process: photocatalysis. \nNATEDE's superpowers come from the so-called photocatalysis: light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances instead.\nFor people who suffer from asthma and allergies, the NATEDE light-powered air purifier is a great ally to breathe clean air and improve your health.\nThe photocatalytic filter inside NATEDE can capture and eliminate VOCs, viruses and bacteria, and it can significantly alleviate odors from pets, cigarettes and cigars, cooking, mildew, etc.\nAnd the best part of photocatalysis is that this filter does not need any replacement!\nNATEDE\u2019s technology has been scientifically tested\nPLANTS\nIt\u2019s now more than 3 years that we have been testing our products and our technology. Our main partners are PNAT and LINV, the most prestigious research labs on plants neurobiology in Europe, both spin-offs of the University of Florence, Italy. PNAT and LINV proved the effectiveness of our system and work closely with us to improve our products.\nResults from 2016 PNAT/LINV analysis\nAdditional 2017/2018 PNAT/LINV analysis\nFLUID DYNAMICS\nAfter the success of our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2016, we started working with fluid dynamics engineers to perfect the airflow and to improve the purification range. NATEDE has an incredible purification range and guarantees a perfect and silent air flow.\nSee results\nPHOTOCATALYSIS\nPhotocatalysis is a natural process by which the light strikes a mineral (titanium dioxide - TiO\u2082 - a common mineral) and activates a chemical process that securely and instantaneously oxidizes and decomposes the organic matter at the molecular level to form water vapor and small parts of carbon dioxide. The combination of photocatalysis with the plant is just perfect and guarantees a great improvement in performance.\nCenter of Industrial Microbiology Test Report 2018\nComparing NATEDE to other air filtering\n                                                          Vitesy's technology has 3 worldwide patent pending applications.\nPLAY\n\nHaving a NATEDE means you can lay back and relax: the NATEDE app lets you take control of the air you breathe, hassle-free.\nWhether you are cooking, working, relaxing or sleeping, you can select the right functioning mode of your NATEDE.\nYou will be able to save energy while you are not at home with its night mode, or boost its fan while you are preparing those yummy recipes with performance mode.\nAnd if you need a good sleep to be ready for an intense day tomorrow, just make sure you breathe good air during the night.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, devices, and sensors are given the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.\nNATEDE can connect to other smart home devices, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home, who will directly report the quality of the air you breathe and will be able to manage it with voice commands.\nNATEDE features a proximity sensor that lets you turn it ON an OFF by simply moving your hand close to it. NATEDE is science, but you can do your little magic here.\nNATEDE features an intuitive LED guide that lets you see the quality of your air without checking the app.\nNATEDE features a self-watering system, which helps to further reduce water consumption \u2013 in addition to keeping plants alive while we are on the move or on long holidays - its water tank can bring water to plants for about a month.\nNATEDE's new photocatalytic filter, combined with the increased efficiency of the air flow, will also reduce smoke, cooking, and bathroom odors.\nNATEDE has a green soul: it is Made in Italy with sustainable materials often derived from natural waste. \nAt Vitesy, we are committed to a green lifestyle, we respect our planet, and while NATEDE purifies your air from harmful elements that can affect your health we are keen on avoiding an impact on our planet. \nThis is why we spent 2 years looking for the best combination of these materials.\nWe have created NATEDE starting from the concept of \"Circular Design Economy\", which refers to a sustainable design that thinks about our future. \nNATEDE is respectful to the environment in multiple ways: in its use of natural materials, in the lack of added harmful glues, and in its sustainable dismantling at the end of its lifecycle. \nAs a Nature-loving company, we leverage nature and we aim to preserve it as best as we can.\nAs a Technology-enabled company, we deliver the best in class of today's most advanced research in a sustainable future where Economy is based on Circular Design.\nAs a Design company, we are keen on thinking about your health and your future, while delivering a beautiful design object that will enrich your home, office, and your well-being.\nNATEDE Premium is made of ceramic and handcrafted by the best Venetian artisans.\nFor Kickstarter only, we are creating a Special Limited Edition. Every single NATEDE will be numbered and you will have a unique piece of Italian design. A series number will be put at the bottom of each NATEDE.\nNATEDE comes in 2 versions, regular and Premium, each one in 2 available colors, all able to adapt to any home or office style.\nPick your favorite color to enhance your own home or office style.\nNATEDE\nNATEDE comes with a power cord which plugs into the power outlet, and adapter.\n                                                                      What about NATEDE\u2019s production, logistics and shipping?\nAfter launching a first product in 2016, Vitesy has created an optimised supply chain that takes care of every aspect. Vitesy also secured a worldwide partnership with a leading shipping company \u2013 check out this video to learn more.\nTalking about partners, there\u2019s one we are super proud of: Eden Projects, an NGO that plants trees in developing countries.\nVitesy will donate 10 trees for every NATEDE sold.\nThanks to your support, as of today we have already donated 17,000 trees.\n                                                             Here is the list of our Partners: they are all leaders in their sectors.\n    We would like to thank:  \nAlireza Masrour & Plug and Play Ventures, Gert Gremes, Maria Anita Polese, the European Union, Ganis and Francescutti Family, Allison Romero, Ivana Kuchan, Alberto Rossetti, Michele Carlet & Check Up team, Ezio e Denis Maccan, Intertek, Adexe, Ceramiche ML, Ceramiche Rigoni, Ceramiche BS, Etra, Luca Turri and the TGT Family, Fabio Pivetta, IdealPack, Ranpack, Luca Bodin, Andrea Girotto, Giannattilio Usoni & Felice Fanizza, Adriana Turchet, Alessandro Trentin & Graffiti 2000, Microline, Euroetichette, Gianluca Minuzzi, Paolo Tonus, Marco Pasquin, Marcello Ceseratto, Talent Garden Pordenone taggers, Dario Fasiolo, Milica e Dimitrje, 221e, Carlo Cianfrone, Peter Oei, Quasar Media, Child and Youth Finance International, Andrea Petrussa, Luca Dovigo & Friulovest Banca, Ilenia Tommasini & Intesa San Paolo, SSA Informatica, Giorgio Pertegato, Mattia Attus, Politecnico di Milano, Universit\u00e0 Bocconi, Gabriele Agostinis, Stefano Mancuso, Camilla Pandolfi, Elisa Masi, Diego Comparini, Cosimo Taiti, Mauro Afflisio, Apple Italy, Serena Stramandinoli & Accenture, Il Posto di Follador, Shis Pordenone, Gennaro e Signora, Samanta Scaini, Daniele Boltin, Yassi Taromi, Valeria Boldrin, Katerina Ermolina, Valeria Galbiati e Gaetano Diodato.\nSpecial thanks to Kristalia.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur Mission\nWe\u2019ve set out to highlight the necessity of green ethics and to increase your quality of life by developing simple products that combine innovative technologies with incredible design.\n\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThanks to our first Kickstarter Campaign we created a well-structured company and now we are ready to launch a new product.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest!

Each story offers a unique puzzle and has optional objectives depending on how long you want to play.\nThe game features full character customisation, worker management, board exploration, roleplaying-style quests and strategic combat designed for replayability. Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThis Kickstarter adds four new World Packs to The City of Kings allowing you to pick and choose the new content you want to have:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma  \nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nSide Quest Pack 1\nHero Pack\nEach Character Pack contains 2 new playable heroes with advanced skills, a new 3 story adventure, and more terrifying creature abilities creating new puzzles for you to solve. \nThe Side Quest Pack tells you more about the world by adding 50 new side quests to The City of Kings, introducing the new \"Get To\" and \"Build\" quests to the game.\nThe Hero Pack adds 6 miniatures to The City of Kings, so you can replace your hero standees with beautifully sculpted miniatures.\nFor those of you who already own The City of Kings, an Upgrade Pack will be sent to anyone selecting the \"Create your own\" or \"World Packs\" tiers containing free copies of the updated Rulebook and Quick Reference booklets.\nDigital versions will also be made available shortly after the campaign for anyone who would like them.\nIn addition to new content for The City of Kings, during this Kickstarter we are offering our new standalone game, Vadoran Gardens for the very first time! Full details on the game, along with reviews and runthroughs are available at the bottom of this Kickstarter page!\n Retailers can find out more info about our retail options by messaging us directly.\nLast update at \u00a3340,000: 34xp | Quest total: 49xp\nThe City of Kings already contains 40 unlocked stretch goals from our first campaign, and we have already fully upgraded Vadoran Gardens to be the best it can be, this means we won\u2019t be adding anything extra to either game during this campaign.  \nHowever!  \nWe are going to be running an adventure over the duration of the Kickstarter which will give you the opportunity to unlock extra scenarios and stories for The City of Kings.\nThese will be released as free Print & Play files between August 2018 and February 2019.  \nHow do we unlock them? By earning XP! For every \u00a320,000 we raise, you will earn 2xp, and every day we will be releasing daily quests via updates, Facebook, Twitter and on our website where you can help earn bonus XP!\nThe City of Kings can be played in 2 ways, by choosing either a story or a scenario.\n7 Stories  \nThere are 7 stories to play, each story has its own objectives and continues a narrative introducing you to the world and characters. Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\n12 Scenarios\nThe 12 scenarios provide quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go  \nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.  \nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\n Creatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love. \nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\n  You can read the full review by Geek & Sundry here.\n You can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\n You can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\nYou can read the full player report by Robert Yates here.\n The following full customisation options can be added to any reward, simply increase your pledge amount by the amount shown below. If you have any questions please ask in the comments and we'll be happy to help you!\nAttention Acolytes! Old V\u2019Sheel, the High Priestess of the Vadoran Gardens is retiring, and maybe one of you will take her place. Go out into the gardens, study her lessons in Life, Nature, and Wisdom to prove yourself worthy of such an honor.  \nVadoran Gardens is a standalone competitive card-drafting and tile-laying card game, set in The City of Kings universe. Players take it in turns to play cards while trying to connect similar tasks such as feeding animals, watering flowers and cleaning relics, as they try and complete the lessons set by Old V'Sheel.\nVadoran Gardens is played over 10 rounds, in each round you will be set a lesson restricting the cards you can play.  \nOn your turn, you will pick up the card you selected on your previous turn (or during setup if it\u2019s the first round), and then place 1 card in front of you.\nThe first card you play will be placed on the table, every following card you play must overlap the last column of the previously played card. The card does not have to overlap all 3 squares in the last column, but it does have to overlap at least 1, giving you 5 options each turn.\nAs you explore the gardens, you will want to connect areas of grass, soil and water to score points and avoid the sand. You will need to connect animals, flowers and statues in specific ways to complete achievements while trying to return lost animals, pendants and tools to their homes.\nOnce you have played a card, you will then need to place your Player Token on the card you want for the next round, this decides both the card you get and turn order for the next round. You will always know what cards you have available for this round and the next, along with what restrictions will be in place, so forward planning is essential.\nYou can download a draft version of the rulebook here.\nIf you would like to get both Vadoran Gardens and The City of Kings then please select the appropriate tier for The City of Kings content you would like, and increase your pledge by \u00a317. You can do this when you select your reward by manually increasing the amount shown by \u00a317, and at the end of the Kickstarter we will ask you to confirm the \u00a317 is for Vadoran Gardens. \nShipping for Vadoran Gardens will be free, when added to any The City of Kings or World Pack rewards.\n You can read the full article by Creaking Shelves here.\n All shipping is EU, America, Canada and Australia friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Brazil due to their customs regulations. If this should change I will let you know.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva works full time creating the artwork for The City of Kings Universe and creates nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nHeriberto Valle Mart\u00ednez is our primary sculptor and created the amazing miniatures available during this campaign.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\n We would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings, Vadoran Gardens or just gaming in general!

We will be running more playtests as the Kickstarter campaign runs, but we expect any further changes to be minor. \n\nArtwork\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few tokens and bits of graphic design to finish off for the expansions but otherwise we are good to go. \n\nMiniatures\nThis will be the first time we include miniatures in our campaign, but we have chosen to work with the same company that is used by CMON to produce their miniatures and are confident the end result will be amazing.\n\nEditing\nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now is copy editing and proof readings of all the new content and rule updates to make sure we catch as many spelling mistakes as possible. We\u2019ve allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nManufacturing\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in the first print and we are confident in their ability to manufacture a great second print.\n\nShipping\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during the first campaign, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other. There were a few minor issues which we have learned from and are confident our fulfilment partners will deliver on time.\n\nFinal words\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The City of Kings was an incredible journey, we all learned a lot and I hope you will join me in this next stage of the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Follow along with updates and take part in The School of Games!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["611 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Create your own", "descp": "If you would like a custom selection of World Packs, addons and Vadoran Gardens then this tier is for you!\nUse the \u201cFull Customisation\u201d menu on the campaign page to choose your items, add up the total and pledge here.\nShipping will be added after the campaign based on the shipping prices shown at the bottom of the page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["227 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a317 or more", "title": "Vadoran Gardens", "descp": "One copy of Vadoran Gardens.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Vadoran Gardens", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["168 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a367.50\nAll the new content for The City of Kings, for those who already own the game!\nINCLUDES:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\nSecond print upgrade pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,374 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "The City of Kings", "descp": "MSRP: \u00a375\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["182 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3155\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter and all Deluxe upgrades!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["175 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3109 or more", "title": "The City of Kings & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3142.50\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3145 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3222.50\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter, all Deluxe upgrades and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,301 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Chapter 2 complete", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nIt is time for us to wrap up the campaign, by now everyone should have received their games and I want to thank you all for the incredible journey that has been Ancient Allies and Vadoran Gardens.

Through this campaign, we are seeking to fund our third project: Black Rose Wars. Just like our previous games, Black Rose Wars has required a huge effort on the part of the Studio and its creators. With a massive investment in terms of human resources, Black Rose Wars is the result of the efforts of a team that is passionate about its work and strives for excellence in every creative field.\nOur past projects, Nova Aetas and Sine Tempora, are proof of the passion we invest in the development of our games and the quality we achieve thanks our high-level professionalism.\n  Black Rose Wars is a project that was born more than 3 years ago and has been tested in all its parts to the extreme. Thanks to this preliminary work, we are able to send the core game, Crono and all aesthetic expansions in rapid time, making sure you receive the game before January 2019. Many of the SGs and add-ons have already been developed and tested, ready to be unlocked and produced. Should we exceed the expectations of the project, all the rest of the material will be sent by June 2019. Thanks to the experience acquired in previous projects, we are fully aware that if certain objectives are reached, we will need to ask you for more time. But we trust that by having the base game and part of the SGs and add-ons straight away, the wait will be made a little easier.\nYour rewards will be shipped at our cost to our international hubs. Based on where you are located, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or the United States (U.S.A. and the rest of the world).  \nIn most cases, you will not be hit with customs or VAT either as we are offering Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.   \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via an email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping charges to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.  \nDue to the size of the rewards and risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.  \nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAn ambitious project like Black Rose Wars will require great effort for us as both individuals and a team. We are aware that the huge work to get to production and the subsequent distribution may suffer hitches and delays, but our team will do everything we can to prevent and correct any delays. \nWe will strive to get you your game on time. \nWe have collectively produced, or helped to produce, many projects and we are learning and improving our skills every day. \n\nWe promise to keep you informed on the project with regular and frequent news so that you can always be sure of your investment.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we do not offer a refund.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Zombicide: Invader is a standalone cooperative board game for 1 to 6 players, taking the trademark Zombicide action into the far reaches of space! Players control a group of Survivors trying to defend their remote mining outpost from a swarm of infected aliens controlled by the game itself. The more experience and power the Survivors earn, the more Xenos invade the facility!\nThis sci-fi interpretation of Zombicide is as sleek as ever, playing fast and furious. The rules have been optimized to reduce setup time and make the game flow quickly, focusing the action on the struggle between the Survivors and the Xenos.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Dark Side / Promo Xenos / Plague Survivor Pack / Orphans Survivor Pack / Kabuki Survivor Pack / Tiles Set / Plastic Token Pack / 3D Plastic Doors / Deck Holders Set / Counter Base Set.\nThe game's character artwork was created by renowned artist Adrian Smith, and brought to life as miniatures by the talented team at BigChild Creatives.\nThe Survivors in the PK-L7 outpost came from all walks of life to aid in the Xenium mining operations, and are divided into two types: Civilians are incredibly resourceful, being able to find useful gear in any room of the facility, on the downside they tend to not be very well protected. Soldiers, on the other hand, usually wear heavy combat armor which give them an edge against the invaders. However, their military training means they'll only find gear in specific Security rooms.\nExplore the Survivors more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres. NOTE THAT MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED. CLICK THE IMAGE TO SEE A HIGH RES ALBUM\nWith some luck, Survivors may be able to use some advanced machines to aid their struggle. If you can find the right remote (or are a tech wiz) you'll be able to control the Falchion Sentry Gun to mow down Xenos, or maneuver the Peacekeeper Bot in coordinated attacks.\nIf they manage to last long enough, Survivors can become formidable fighting machines. The more Xenos they kill, the more experience they get, allowing them to unlock new skills as the game progresses. The equipment they find is arranged in their plastic dashboard, with slots for Hand weapons, armor and other gear that can be carried on the body, and a Backpack to store those things you may not need right now.\nSurvivor plastic dashboard.\nPrototype weapons are amazing silent killing machines, but they require an attached Energy Cell to use.\nSurvivors will need all the help they can get to face the Xeno invasion. These mindless creatures come in several different types. Workers are numerous, but manageable. Hunters are deadly fast predators you need to be always on the lookout for. Tanks can take a beating, and dole out an even worse beating. Keep your distance!\nThe different types of Xenos.\nXeno Worker figures 3D renders.\nXeno Hunter and Tank figures 3D renders.\nCertainly the worst of the Xenos is the hulking Spoiler Abomination! This nightmare can only be put down by concentrating your fire, or literally disintegrating it with Hellfire! Don't be fooled by its size, this thing can run you down when you least expect it. While its spawn cards give it extra activations, it will also leap forward if you ever run out of miniatures. The other Xenos may be threatening, but, make no mistake, this is the last thing you'll see before you die.\nSpoiler Abomination figure 3D render.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Spoiler Abomination also fills any room it moves into with a terrible alien substance we call Mold. This thing eats through doors and walls, completely destroying the room and changing the layout of the map. This Mold may spawn even more Xenos, but worse yet, if it spreads too far, the base will be irrevocably lost (and so will you). Burn it down before it's too late.\nExplore the Xenos more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nUse a flamethrower to burn that Mold to a crisp before it can consume the base!\nThe base at PK-L7 is all you have. Walking out into the planet's surface may be necessary at times, but it's a dangerous endeavor. You'll need to get an Oxygen tank in the Supply room if you want to walk out the airlock. And you better arm yourself with a melee or energy weapon, since the outside atmosphere keeps bullet weapons or flamethrowers from working.\nThe tiles feature several different Zone types, like Exterior, Oxygen Supply Room, Airlock, Security, and Corridor.\nZombicide: Invader comes with:\n9 Double-sided Game Tiles \n72 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n6 Dice \n125 Mini Cards \n15 Mold Cards \n50 Tokens \n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nThe journey into the unknown doesn't end here!\nThe Zombicide: Black Ops expansion raises the intensity to new heights while bringing new challenges for an elite group of Survivors! The Soldiers of Black Squad can be added to your roster, allowing you to play the game with up to 12 players at the same time!\nThese battle-hardened soldiers have been called in to deal with the situation on PK-L7, and find a base already being consumed by the Mold. The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.\nThe Black Ops tiles feature explosive Xenium Pod Zones.\nThis dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.\nBlack Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 \"Crawley\" Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.\nExtra arsenal for the Black Ops.\nExplore Black Ops more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nZombicide: Black Ops comes with:\n3 Double-sided Game Tiles \n9 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n29 Mini Cards\n10 Mold Cards\n39 Tokens\n1 Rulebook \nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China and Thailand, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n\u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 30th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is May 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde, with wave 2 shipping soon.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, and HATE, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Invader.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Dinosaur Island is the product of an insanely successful Kickstarter last Spring. We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

(Check the \u201cWhy Kickstarter Exclusive?\u201d section for details)\nTraduction de la page en fran\u00e7ais\nEnglish and French (printed copies) - Spanish, German (as PDF downloads)\nNew to Kickstarter?\nHere is a guide to guide you through all the steps from pledging on Kickstarter to getting your game!\nThe Base Game Pledge for the core boxes gives you a complete game experience with dozens of stretch goal extras for even more replay value.\nHowever, the Batman universe is so vast that we couldn\u2019t fit all of it into the core boxes.\nThe expansions listed below all add new miniatures, new gameplay, new game boards, new scenarios, or a mix of all of these. They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content.\nHere is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager.\nClick on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack\n                      The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion\n This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster. Each hero is represented on the game board by a blue miniature.\nFrom left to right: Nightwing, The Huntress and Robin\nFrom left to right: Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl, Batman and Catwoman\nBatman sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron\nThe Huntress sculpted by Edgar Skomorovski\nEach hero has their own hero board detailing their characteristics, skills, and traits.\nBatman, Jim Gordon, and Nightwing's hero screens\nThe hero board is made of 2 parts: a hero screen that slides into a bat-tablet.\nA hero screen and a bat-tablet forming a hero board\nThis hero board allows the player to control their hero to perform actions such as fighting or jumping from a walkway, by spending energy cubes from their reserve zone.\nThese energy cubes represent both a hero's life points and their capacity to act. The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become.\nBut when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds.\nThe double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones\nTo better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment:\nA hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills.\nEquipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nFinally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt.\nBat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nA hero setup\nFacing the heroes is one player: the villain.

They may activate up to 2 tiles per turn by spending energy cubes. But unlike the heroes, these cubes only represent the villain's ability to activate tiles, as each character they control has their own life point count.\nPlastic sample of the command board\nClose-up of the plastic sample of the command board\nTo better understand how the command board works, please watch the following video series from Wayne Entertainment:\nAll miniatures presented in this campaign will be of high-quality plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nThe scale of our miniatures is 35mm from feet to eyes. This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French.

Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne. Attention cependant : seules les r\u00e8gles et les sc\u00e9narios seront traduits en fran\u00e7ais. Le reste du mat\u00e9riel contient relativement peu de texte : le nom des cartes d'\u00e9quipement et le nom des personnages resteront en anglais. Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $20-$25 to most states.\nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nEUROPE: $20-25 to France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands. $25-35 to Spain, UK, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic and to most other countries.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nBRAZIL: $120-130 to Brazil (including customs and tax fees)\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia. $50-55 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $50-55 to Morocco, $80-85 to South Africa, $140-145 to most other countries.\nDOM-TOM: $60-65 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries:\nCuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

Doctor Babylon, LEGION\u2019s head of technology and development, has unlocked the secrets of the cosmic power source Dark Matter and plans global armageddon. In the wake of LEGION\u2019s ascendance, a crack-shot team of hand-picked agents known as MAYHEM emerges, whose sole purpose is to destroy LEGION and take the world back. Will you use LEGION\u2019s Dark Matter-powered doomsday devices and super-weapons to wreak havoc on Seoul: The City of Tomorrow or will you join the band of gadget-wielding misfits to dish out some MAYHEM?\n\nAgents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is a team vs. team skirmish boardgame for 2 to 4 players. The game is played on a modular 3D board that is fully destructible. You and your opponents will play through a radiant story where every choice you make will have effects that ripple throughout the campaign. Play as either LEGION, an organization of super villains who have taken over the world, or as MAYHEM, a band of anti-heroes who will do what ever it takes to stop LEGION.\nIn every game, use the modular tiles to set up an entirely new cityscape in near-future Seoul, Korea!\n3D BOARD! - Play on a board made of modular tiles with 3D multi-level buildings that are up to 240mm high! Use the buildings as cover or to dodge an attack by jumping behind a wall. Take the high ground to gain elevation advantages and attack bonuses against your enemies. The modular tiles allow you to make hundreds of different game maps.\nLEGION troopers have surrounded a building in which they suspect a MAYHEM agent is holed up. Why storm the building and risk injury? Lets just blow the dang thing up and pick up MAYHEM souvenirs!\nDestructible Terrain - You can drive enemies from behind cover by triggering explosions. These explosions and your attacks will often cause damage to a building which will eventually cause it to collapse.\nPictured are MAYHEM's Fortune character and one of LEGION's Swarm Troopers!\nUnique Characters - Every MAYHEM and LEGION character has their own highly detailed miniature and a Character Board that outlines their stats and abilities. Each character has a unique gameplay style and you will have to choose the right team for each mission. Finding the right combination of characters and tactics is half the fun of Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon. The other half is blowing stuff up!\nHollywood's Character Board shows all of his abilities, actions, upgrades and gadgets. Between games you can upgrade the character board.\nCustomizable Characters - Customize your characters before each mission with an arsenal of gadget cards that slide into their Character Board and Mayhem Cards that let them unleash crazy and hilarious powers.\nHere new hard won Gadgets are added to Fortune's character board.\nCharacter Progression - After every game, you will have the opportunity to unlock new Gadgets and buy upgrade tiles for your characters. Upgrades stay permanently in the character\u2019s board until you decide to reset the game.\nFast Skirmish Gameplay and Tactics - Alternate taking turns with your opponent in quick game play that keeps you involved at all times. On your turn, you take actions with one of your characters while your other characters regenerate some of their resources. There is no downtime and you fluidly take turns back and forth until the Mission ends.\nBackstrikes and Flanking Fire\nAimed Attacks\nHeight Advantage\nA close up of a game in progress. Fortune goes for the loot while Hardtack keeps Gaunt busy!\nStory Campaign - Play through an immersive campaign with a radiant storyline. Decisions you make have ripple effects that impact your future missions, assets, and abilities. Every group\u2019s experience is unique in an open world that can branch into dozens of different story-lines full of humor and awesomeness with hundreds of ways to win.\nHumor - Agents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is full of over the top action and humor. Get immersed into the Saints Row universe with hilarious card flavor text, mission comics, and sometimes helpful character public service announcements.  \nMultiple Play Modes:\n1 to 8 players\nPlayer vs Player (1vs1, 1vs Many, Team vs Team)\nCo-op against the AI (with Solo Add-On)\nSolo mode with  dynamic AI (with Solo Add-On)\nNote - We rate Pride of Babylon as PG-13.

But, those dang cars to make some tempting targets for the LEGION!\nThis stretch goal upgrades the Golem from an Ally to a Full Elite Unit!

And as we all know, bigger is better!\nNow you have a plethora (yes, I said a plethora El Guapo) of new toys for LEGION to play with and make the really bad guys even badder.\nSheherazade, Oni, and Kingpin have been upgraded with more toys to play with so that you have more MAYHEM options to wreak havoc with!\nAugust Gaunt, recording superstar, uses a mix of auto-tune and brainwashing headphones to control the minds of of his fans! With this stretch goal he will be able to manipulate the innocent civilians in the game, giving MAYHEM some real headaches.\nYou get so much cool stuff in this game that we wanted to include a way to store it effectively.\nLEGION needs a sweet ride to keep up with MAYHEM so here you go.  That may have been the fastest unlock yet...\n  To include an Add-On with your pledge, increase your pledge amount by the Add-On's value. When you receive your Survey after the campaign ends, you will specify what the extra amount is for. \nEx: You pledged for the $90 Hardtack's Headshot. You want to add the $20 - 'COPs' and the $10 - '300 Card Sleeves' Add-Ons to your pledge. Click on the pledge level that you chose, which is on the top right hand part of this page. A pledge detail window will open and there you can increase your pledge amount from $90 to $120. It is that easy.\nAnd thank you for your support.\nThe modern police force (Civil Overwatch Patrol) of near-future Seoul is composed of Androids. The COPs are programmed to enforce a safe environment using civil tactics. But what happens if an organization hacks into their system and overrides their programming?!  \nThe COPs are a fantastic Add-On that add game play elements.\nThese are more than just cards. The 'Athena AI' was developed for military training games and tactics analysis. Athena innovatively uses Object Oriented Programming in a card deck that rivals video game AIs! Now play solo or cooperatively with your friends against Athena as either MAYHEM or LEGION. \nThe Solo Ad-On will be shipped in a second wave three months after Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon has been shipped. This delay is necessary, since we estimate an additional total of 520 man hours to program the AI deck. A nominal shipping fee will be added during the survey.\nAfter saving the world in Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hell, Johnny Gat is back for more action and incredible campaign story lines! He is joined by his old hacker friend Safeword and the advanced human/nano-machine Lazarus!

When we were approached to develop a board game utilizing our military tactical engines, we were taken aback. But the more we thought about it, the more excited we became about the near future Agents of Mayhem world. We decided to go for it and founded our new Sci-Fi and Fantasy division - Apollo Games!  \nWe have applied all of our award winning experience into the over-the-top and humorous Anti-Hero vs Super Villain theme of Agents of Mayhem. Now you will need to utilize real world military combined arms tactics to succeed, even if you can jump over buildings, stop the bad guys with your looks, or conjure up monsters from the earth! On top of this, we have developed a campaign system like no other board game, in which every decision you make can affect you in the future. \nShipping will be charged during your post-Kickstarter campaign survey on which you will fill in your shipping address.

Our last two projects 'Mare Nostrum - Empires' and '878 Vikings' were so successful, that we unlocked all of our stretch goals. 878 Vikings English language games began shipping only 3 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Online Forum and BoardGameGeek ratings and comments are very high and positive.\n\n'Pride of Babylon' is 100% developed and project managed in the USA. We have full control of every aspect of the project. All stretch goals and game expansions have already been fully developed and playtested. All artwork is finalized and manpower has been scheduled and set aside to make sure that Pride of Babylon will ship in a timely manner.\n\nPride of Babylon is scheduled to ship by Sept 2018, 6 months after the end of the KS campaign!

This game is set to be printed in China with a printer that we have developed a relationship with for years. Past issues have been always taken care of in a professional and quick manner and we expect this good relationship to continue.\n\nWe appreciate your Kickstarter support, which allows us to continue to create unique and high-quality games.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Based on the \"Chronicles of HATE\" graphic novel by acclaimed artist Adrian Smith, HATE is a board game of brutal combat and conquest in a desolate world of savage warriors. Created by the same design team who brought you the Zombicide series, under the supervision of Eric Lang, HATE combines the gruesome artwork of Adrian Smith with exquisitely sculpted miniatures to immerse you in a universe of cruel survival by any means.\nTake control of your tribe and lead them in battle against your opponents. Each battle pits two tribes controlled by different players, clashing against each other to achieve objectives, massacre the enemy, and reap rewards from blood and land. As the Chronicle unfolds, players engage each other in numerous clashes in an effort to defend or conquer territories, trying to be the ultimate Tyrant and rule the wastes of the world. While the HATE core box initially allowed for up to 4 players to fight through a Chronicle together, more tribes have since been unlocked allowing the game to expand to up to 6 players. Explore the 4 original core Tribes here: Um'Gra, Um'Rak, Um'Kator, and Um'Cal.  \n  Find out more about these Optional Buys in these links: The Mother Prophecy, Tribe of Vore Nash, Tribe of Um'Tull, Tribe of Sarrassa, Battlegrounds of HATE, HATE Art Book, 3D Plastic Plateaus, 3D Plastic Huts, 3D Plastic Trees, Red Dice.\nThe Tyrant - Only a worthy tribe will be led by this legend, all others will cower under his hateful gaze.\nEach battle in the Chronicle has consequences, not only in terms of the control of the land, but also in the tribes that fight for it. Killing your opponent in merciless fashion and reaping all that which the land has to give increases your tribe's Hate and Resources. These then allow your warriors to gain new skills, turning them into ever more formidable killers as the Chronicle progresses. You will also be able to bolster your village, giving your tribe extra abilities and features to use in both short and long term. However, dismemberment and death may also be your fate in the battlefield, and you will also need to carry the burden of that in your struggle for power. \nTribe of Um'Gra - Blood-frenzied maniacs, their recklessness is their greatest strength, though it can often be their weakness.\n  The world of HATE is brutal, and is recommended for mature audiences only. The art of the game depicts acts of extreme violence, as well as nudity. To survive and thrive in this barren wasteland, you'll need to embrace the savagery of not only massacring your enemies, but taking innocents captive, torturing them, and even feasting off their flesh. You've been warned, this is not a world for the faint of heart!\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Gra.\nEach tribe is composed of 11 characters: 2 Youngbloods, 6 Warriors, 1 Shaman, 1 Champion, and 1 towering Prince. (The last belong to the Varn, a \"higher\" lineage of men, who grew monstrous as the ages passed, by feeding on the lesser kind.) Each of these have different stats and starting skills, offering their own tactical choices in battle.\nThe Character cards show your tribe's initial skills and stats.\n  Tribe of Um'Rak - Hive minded, they move as one, to strike like a horde.\nEach tribe also counts on their own unique deck of 8 Tribe cards that they can employ at different points of the battle, usually by spending gathered Savagery tokens. These cards reinforce each tribe's individual nature by offering powerful bonuses and abilities to outmaneuver your enemies.\nTribe cards can often turn the tide of battle.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Rak.\nWhen a player challenges another to battle, they choose among 10 different scenarios to play, depending upon how close they are to conquering the heart of the land. Each scenario contains a different terrain setup, as well as different objectives the attacker and defender must accomplish in order to be victorious, and different rewards they may gain from that.\nTribe of Um'Kator - Jacks of all trades, they are relentless and always prepared for changes in the tide of battle.\nBattles are fast and furious, taking around 40 minutes to play. Players maneuver and activate their characters around the board to crush their enemies and reap rewards. Ganging up on an opponent is a sure way to bring them down, or hinder their attacks. Use terrain to your advantage, holding the high ground to dominate your foes. Pillage huts you find to steal their resources or capture any innocents hiding within (being careful of possible ambushes), and harvest withering trees for the meager resources they may yield.\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Kator.\nIf you happen be knocked out in battle, though, you had better pray your allies keep your limp body safe so you may live to fight another day. If you're carried off by the enemy, a fate worse than death awaits you (usually followed by death). At the end of a battle, captives are dragged to the villages, where the sadistic choice of whether to torture them to death (to gain Hate) or kill and cook them (to gain Resources) is made.\nTribe of Um'Cal - Fearless berserkers, they leave a trail of blood where they go, even if some of it is their own.\nAt the end of each battle, all Hate and Resources gained by each tribe is tallied in the Chronicle sheet. Every few of these gathered unlocks a milestone, which allows you to upgrade your tribe in several different ways. Resource milestones help you upgrade your village. Your tribe's Village sheet shows the buildings you have, and the ones you can build, as well as upgrade. The more you upgrade your village, the more resourceful your tribe becomes. The Forge offers you several Feats of Savagery that can be activated during a battle by spending Savagery tokens to gain different bonuses. The Hall of Heroes allows you to conscript Mercenaries to your tribe, the Training Grounds allow your characters to learn extra skills, and the Shaman's Hut gives you more control over your Tribe cards. At the end of each battle, you may use your Chiurgeon to heal your warrior's scars, and the bigger your Oven and Torture Pit are, the more enemies you can cook or torture!\nVillage Sheet.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Cal.\nMeanwhile, Hate milestones allow you to choose Upgrade cards to add to your characters (those that have proven worthy in battle). These dozens of transparent cards contain a myriad of different skills for you to choose, including 6 of them which are exclusive to your tribe. The character cards are all protected by plastic sleeves, allowing you to simply slide the Upgrade card on top of them. Each character may have up to 4 different skills, becoming a legendary fighter. But be careful, such legends can still be killed and erased from the Chronicle.\nAdding an Upgrade to a Warrior.\n  Mercenaries come in all shapes and sizes, with varied abilities. They have their own goals, but you can force them to join your tribe!\nBeing wounded in battle can have drastic consequences. Any characters knocked down on the battlefield (those lucky enough not to have been dragged off and roasted) must make a roll to determine their fate. They may come out of it unscathed, or suffer a tragic death, but more often than not they'll go on carrying a scar to remind them of their failures. These can range from a mental debilitation, to a gouged eye or torn off limb, with the penalties associated with that. Scars are added to characters similarly to Upgrades, possibly cancelling a skill the warrior possessed!\nAdding a Scar to a Warrior.\n  The Mercenary figures, and the imposing Tyrant.\nOnce the Chronicle is over, how much Hate and Resources you accumulated, as well as the strength of the territories you conquered, will determine who becomes the Tyrant that rules the world, while their enemies cower under their merciless feet!\nExample of an epic battle between 4 Tribes!\nUPDATE: With the Stretch Goals unlocking an extra board and extra components, the game will also allow players to use a set of Optional Rules that introduce, at certain points of the Chronicle, massive battles involving more than 2 players. Form alliances in 2x1 or 2x2 battles, or go crazy in a free-for-all slaughterfest!\nDue to its violent, adult content, we have decided to make it so the entire HATE board game is Kickstarter Exclusive (or other crowdfunding platforms). This means the core box and any of its ancillaries can only be acquired through Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms, and will not be made available to stores through normal distribution channels. Limited quantities will be available to retailers who want to make a Retail Pledge to this campaign (see below), but if you're interested in HATE, this campaign is the only guaranteed place to get it.\nThe HATE miniatures are 32mm scale. However, the Princes and other members of the higher race are gigantic figures standing about 75mm tall! The pictures shown in the campaign are of resin copies, while the figures that will come in the game will be high-quality pvc plastic.\nOn the left is a resin figure, and on the right a first test sample of the plastic figure. As you can see, the detail already holds very well, even with improvements still being done to the mold.\nGame Components:\nAt the start of the campaign, the HATE core box includes:\n51 Highly Detailed Miniatures\n1 Game Board\n30 Terrain Tiles\nOver 100 Cardboard Tokens\n32 Tribe Cards\n51 Figure Cards\n88 Transparent Upgrade/Scar Cards\n44 Plastic Card Sleeves\n6 Custom Dice\n13 Counter Bases\n5 Scenario Dashboards\n1 Village Sheet Pad\n1 Chronicle Sheet Pad\n1 Rulebook\n  WIP RULEBOOK - Please note this is not the final version of the rules. This rulebook is still being developed, so rules and graphics are subject to change.\n  For $120 the Tyrant Pledge gets you the Kickstarter Exclusive HATE core box, which is sure to become even more impressive with all the Stretch Goals we hope to unlock and add to it!  \nOur own Eric Lang and Michael Shinall sat down to battle each other and explain to you the basic mechanics of HATE.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\n                                                                                            Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $60-$70 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $80 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n $35 to Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n $60-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n  To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE. Keep in mind this will be the only chance for retailers to grab some copies of this game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 29th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is January 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, and Massive Darkness. The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde are on their way to backers.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: wave 2 of Zombicide: Green Horde, and A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of HATE.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We also produce a news podcast, Board Game Breakfast and other variety shows, a series of popular \"Top Ten\" list videos, shopping guides, and more! All of this can be found at our website - www.dicetower.com.\n  Our show gets a majority of its funding from our Kickstarter campaign each year. We have four full-time employees (Tom, Sam, Zee, and our editor, Derek), as well as a part-time webmaster and Eric. Last year, our focus was on getting our own studio.  This year, our goals are\nImprove live streaming, both in quantity and quality\nHave amazing convention coverage\nIncrease the quality of our current Youtube shows\n We're asking for your help as we pursue our goal of covering the entire world of board games.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Chronicle X is a 1-7 player tactical board game, set in a Sci-Fi Retro 1980s, tasking players to either control the daring men and women that make up the military organization, Chronicle X, or the Overmind, a ruthless and cunning alien overseeing the invasion of Earth and the end of all human resistance. The Chronicle X player(s) have a diverse group of heroes to choose from to form their squad, but must also manage the expansion of their base of operations, using what scraps and materials they can to secure a foothold on the planet. The Overmind player has a cadre of alien troops to choose from to overwhelm the Chronicle X players, ensuring they will never save Earth.\n        Chronicle X miniatures are made from a specially produced HIPS-based material. It is able to hold an amazing amount of detail (similar to resin minis) while at the same time providing the durability needed for regular play. Each miniature is produced as a single piece, thus no need for assembly. You will be ready to play straight from the box!\nWHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET\nShown above and below are painted final production miniatures, identical to what you will find included in your game (with the exception of paint).\nAll base game miniature molds are already produced! We need your help to enter mass production and deliver Chronicle X to the world!\nPLAY\n\nThe entire production process will be completed within the EU (Poland), avoiding any fulfillment delays that can occur when production is performed in China. Chronicle X will be Archon Studio's second new game fully produced in-house after Vanguard of War, which is already in the midst of fulfillment to backers. We have the necessary machinery, a competent staff and will oversee the entire process from the beginning until the last package is shipped to our backers!\nChronicle X\u2019s miniatures are 32 mm scale but as you can see, we have models as big as almost 80 mm! Big or small, each miniature is brought to life in gorgeous detail as a single piece.\n      ABOUT GAMEPLAY. Chronicle X features a rich and robust rules system enhanced by quality miniatures and components. Below are some of the key aspects that make Chronicle X a challenging and rewarding experience for players.\nHEROES: Humanity\u2019s only hope for survival rests in the hands of a ragtag group of larger than life soldiers, scientists and terrorists. All the information a player needs to know about a hero is featured on their profile card, including special abilities and equipment. Each hero has a piece of signature equipment unique to them that can be upgraded throughout the course of the campaign. Heroes can also store equipment in their backpack, ready to use whenever battlefield conditions warrant it.\nDIALS: Each hero also has a unique Stat Dial. As a hero becomes injured, their combat capabilities decrease; moving the dial to reduce the hero\u2019s health on the card also lowers their other stats. Pride will be the downfall of any hero who thinks severe injuries will not slow them down. Luckily, heroes can utilize healing items to regain health, and thus, increase their stats. A wise hero will keep a healer close by, for their support can mean the difference between life and death in a battle against the Overmind.\nGAME BOARD: Each mission takes place on a board built from 4 tiles. There are 6 tiles included in Chronicle X and each contains a wealth of battlefield features, from terrain that blocks line of sight and movement, to open ground and cover that affects the attack or defenses of those standing there. There are also searchable squares for the heroes to find new items and equipment as well as Access Points that dictate models\u2019 starting positions. Both heroes and aliens must navigate the board and utilize the battlefield features to their advantage in order to crush their enemies.\nALIENS: Earth\u2019s defenders must face a variety of deadly adversaries brought from the depths of space to conquer Earth. From the Grays and their Commanders to the savage denizens of Devol, the Overmind player can customize their forces each mission to defeat Chronicle X and bring an end to humanity\u2019s foolish resistance.\nBASE OF OPERATIONS: Chronicle X\u2019s base of operations is an important advantage for the heroes between (and sometimes during) missions to sway the battle in humanity\u2019s favor. Using scrap components found during their missions, the heroes can build new rooms such as the Med Bay to fully heal their heroes before battle or the Communications room to allow them to alter the difficulty level of their upcoming mission. The heroes must use their rooms wisely as the Grays\u2019 army grows stronger with each mission.\nITEMS: To aid Chronicle X in its struggle against the invading aliens, players can gather resources and equipment to upgrade their base and outfit their heroes. From items such as high tech bullets and first aid kits to powerful weapons and armor that can be equipped to grant additional combat bonuses, the heroes can find a wealth of items to use when taking the fight to the Overmind. In addition, the heroes can also gather scrap components which can be taken back to their base of operations in order to upgrade the items they have found or even expand their base.\nDICE: Both attacking and defending are resolved using unique twelve sided combat dice that feature Hits, Defense and rare but devastating Critical Hits. These combined with modifiers, penalties and unique attack effects, such as Stun or Push, create a quick and intense combat system. Profile cards allow players to monitor their models' states, such as the hero statistic dial, that alters the model's combat effectiveness over time as the hero takes damage.\nShipping will be charged via our Pledge Manager system after the Kickstarter campaign ends based on the actual costs incurred to ship. Below is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and optional buys you choose.\nUSA & CA: $10 - $15  \nEU: $10 - $20 \nAustralia: $15 - $20 \nRest of the World: $20 - $30\nBy default, the games will ship after all items are produced. However, as the base games will be produced first, you will have the option of getting your base game shipped as soon as it is produced, with the rest of your pledge shipping later. This \u201ctwo shipments\u201d option incurs an additional shipping cost and will be available via the Pledge Manager.\nIn its short lifetime, Archon has helped 12 Kickstarter projects come to life by providing manufacturing and other services and products to companies.\nWe decided to make a name for ourselves as a creator of games not just components, so we designed, produced, and delivered League of Ancient Defenders (LOAD) and Vanguard of War (VoW) as a solo projects and wish to continue that work with the release of Chronicle X.\nWe are now 100% in control of our board game manufacturing process, including 2D concepts and art, 3D designs and all printed elements.\nEvery single component is made in Europe, avoiding possible delays caused by China shipping or New Year holidays.\nWe are using carton for cardboard elements supplied by a Germany-based supplier to guarantee the quality of the final product.\nThe graphics for our cardboard materials are provided by a local printing company that is 500 meters away from our manufacturing and assembly plant.\nArchon Studio miniatures are made from a specially produced non-PVC-based material.\nThe process is called Unicast and it\u2019s exclusive to Archon Studio products.\nOur current formulation of the manufacturing material (aR MK3) is able to hold an amazing amount of detail while at the same time providing the durability needed for regular play.\nEach miniature is produced as a single piece, thus no need for assembly. You will be ready to play straight from the box!\nWe are constantly improving the formulation of our production material to make sure our products meet the strict United Europe regulations and surpass customer expectations. We are happy to announce that products manufactured by Archon Studio pass all safety tests and our products are now marked with the CE logo \"Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene\".\nMoney-Back Guarantee\nWe are so confident you will enjoy Chronicle X, we\u2019re offering a full refund if you are not completely satisfied with the game. If you decide you do not like the game within 60 days after the Kickstarter campaign is over, we will refund 100% of your money. If more than 60 days have passed (but before shipment), we will refund the amount you pledged minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees. After a pledge has been shipped to you, you will have the right to return the product to us for a refund within 14 days of receiving it if you are not happy with the final product.\nDelivery Deadlines Will Be Met\nWe set extremely optimistic delivery dates for our previous campaigns and still managed to pull them off. As we are now in control of the entire production process, we know how much time the entire project will take, from the first 3D models until the game is delivered to you. We\u2019ve established a realistic delivery plan we will meet!\nArchon Loyalty Program\nIf you back Chronicle X now, you will be become a member of our Loyalty Program. As an Archon Loyalty Program member, if you also back our next Kickstarter, you will receive a guaranteed bonus miniature absolutely free! For the returning backers who decide to support Chronicle X, we are preparing a bonus Loyalty mini to be revealed prior to the beginning of the campaign.

Set in the heart of the Palace of Mists, the legendary comic book hero Okko and his traveling companions must hunt down powerful Oni (demons) and thwart their dark conspiracies.\nDuring each game, one of the players will take the role of the Oni and their lackeys as they attempt to achieve their objectives without revealing themselves or being forced to flee by the Heroes.\nMeanwhile, one to four players take on the role of Okko\u2019s legendary band of demon hunters as they carry out their investigation to uncover the identity of the Oni hidden among the palace\u2019s residents.\n          Before you start playing, everyone chooses a Hero, each of whom has their own skills and special abilities.\nA Hero is represented by the following:\nA Miniature which represents the character on the game board.\nA Character card which describes their characteristics (Speed, Might, Defense, Guile, Stamina and Natural Talent).\n A hand of Action cards that allows to use the Hero\u2019s specific skills.\nAn Initiative card is used to determine the order in which the Heroes take their turn. .\nA Mission card that sets a personal goal, which the Hero must attempt to achieve during the game.\n  During the Strategy Phase, each Hero chooses up to two Action cards to use in the coming round. These cards can be used in two different ways:\nAs Secret Technique: The card is placed to the right of their Character card, where it modifies the Hero\u2019s Attributes.\nAs a Special Talent: The card is placed to the left of their Character card, and enables the Hero to perform extraordinary feats.\nOnce each Hero has chosen their Action cards, they determine the order in which they will act by creating a deck of Initiative cards.\n  Around the edges of their Character card, Heroes have 4 Equipment slots to indicate which weapons and equipment they are carrying.\nEach Equipment card has its own characteristics and some may only be carried by characters of one of the 4 unique character classes: Hinin, Ronin, Samurai or Maotsukai.\n  One of the players will take the role of Oni, who has its own objectives. It will attempt to achieve these goals while attempting to prevent being unmasked by the Heroes.\nAs the game progresses, the Oni\u2019s control over the inhabitants of the Palace will become stronger and stronger. The Corruption track records the extent of the Oni\u2019s corrupting influence and the additional abilities its agents gain as a result.\n  The Heroes must investigate every dark recesses if they are to successfully analyze clues, interrogate courtiers and decipher documents scattered throughout the Palace of Mists.\n  At the end of the game, Recollections based on the various events that have occurred during the adventure are placed side-by-side, one after the other, to construct Tikku Memoirs. Each Recollection is worth a number of Victory points:\nIf the Oni or the Heroes managed to achieve a Mission tile objective (4 Victory points).\nIf the Heroes\u2019 accusations have successfully unmasked the Oni (4 Victory points).\nIf the Oni is defeated (2 Victory points).\nIf a Hero accomplishes their Personal mission (1 Victory point).\nOnce you have written the memoirs, it's time to compare the colors of the memoir\u2019s Recollections (blue for Heroes, red for the Oni). The party with the most Victory points, wins the game.\n        Okko Chronicles miniatures are on average 35mm in height. This scale is based on the height to the eyes of an adult human character.\nSome miniatures will be much larger, while others will have smaller proportions, depending on the characters they represent.\nFor us, the quality of the miniatures is a priority and you can expect a level of detail equivalent to those shown here.\n               Click on pictures for more details...https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/359037226/okko-chronicles/posts/2033968\n                                Without further indications, all Stretch Goals will be sent in separate boxes.\nThey are also included in the Ronin pledge.\nOkko is a comic book that chronicles the adventures of a ronin and his companions as they hunt demons and other evil creatures across the continent of the Pajan.\nThe saga is divided into 5 cycles, each inspired by a critical element that sets the tone of the adventure\u2019s narrative: The Cycle of Water, The Cycle of Earth, The Cycle of Air, The Cycle of Fire and The Cycle of Emptiness.\n.\nThe group of oni hunters is made up of the following Heroes:\nAs a venerable monk, Tikku recounts the exploits of his erstwhile companions.\nEspecially for this game, HUB, the author-illustrator of the Okko saga, has produced many new and impressive illustrations, along with several new characters to accompany Okko and his companions in their adventures.\n  If you wish to order more than one copy of the game, it is possible to add as many Ronin (\u20ac75) or Samurai (\u20ac90) pledges as you want.

Players carefully select their squad of characters then fight it out to complete life or death missions - that can help turn the tide in the battle to come! \nThese can be played as one-off narrative missions between elite fighting forces, but Vanguard is also fully compatible with your larger games of Kings of War. By linking battles in Vanguard to your mass battles, thanks to the innovative interlinked campaign system, victory in Vanguard could mean you\u2019ll gain access to better magical artefacts, new units or even the chance to deploy in better positions. Meanwhile, defeat could force your units to arrive late or your deployment options will be hampered.\nAs your troops successfully complete missions, they\u2019ll become a renowned force, so we\u2019re also developing an in-depth war band progression system to reflect that. As you play more games, your key heroes will gain new and more powerful abilities and discover new equipment - but wounds suffered might mean they pick up game-changing injuries!

It only excludes the stretch goals marked as MONSTER stretch goals.\n  Want to go in for a real treat? With the MONSTER pledge, you will get deluxe components on top of everything you get in the LEADER pledge, and MONSTER stretch goals that add further deluxe components.

In the Dice Pool Generation phase you collect dice from the track and all your mercenaries, these are your tools to prosper.  \n  You will use your dice to take actions using a \u201cworker-placement\u201d mechanic. In the Citadel, your dice allow you to improve your clan, acquiring traps, shields, potions, venoms, mercenaries, and more. The timing of your dice placement and the type of dice you use affects both yourself and other players.  \n  All of the mercenaries, resources, and items you acquire go back to your clan base, and once you feel equipped enough, you go out to the wilderness and face the monsters.  \n  Outside the Citadel, your dice become battle tools. You roll them in missions and battles, aiming to surpass target values. Careful, though, the choice of position in the battle is strategic, you compete with other players to take down the monsters or free the lands.  \n  You will have many opportunities to manipulate your dice results and increase your chance of success, using a multitude of items and abilities. You cannot simply hope for lucky rolls to snatch the crown, you will need to carefully manage your resources and do some proper planning to be successful.  \n If you capture or eliminate a monster or re-conquer a land, you will reap substantial rewards in form of glory and money. Use them to improve your clan even more. At the end of the game, the crown is handed to the clan with most Victory Points, which are generated by glory, reputation and a few more aspects which enrich the game even further.   \n  MONSTER LANDS will come with a printed English rulebook by default, but you can also choose to receive it in either Spanish, French, or German.

We are extremely excited and motivated! \nHaving learned from our partner CMON in the launch of B-Sieged, a game we authored, we now look forward to applying these learnings and \u201cdrown you with stretch-goals\u201d ;) \n But even more important than the campaign itself is the desire to provide you with a game that is both fun to play and beautiful to behold. \n Second Gate Games as publisher does not only release its own games like Monster Lands, but has also successfully started to publish licensed games of other authors, like Cat Box and Kitty Paw. Why is this important? Because it gives you reassurance that the company is not a one-off stunt, we are here to stay, with a long-term commitment. \n The people behind Second Gate Games: \n    Quite simply, because we couldn\u2019t do this without Kickstarter. As a new kid on the block in the board game publishing industry, we do not have the funds to finance a full production nor the means to gauge demand.\n  Kickstarter is a great tool for us as a company, but is also good news for you as a backer. We are creating Kickstarter exclusive stretch-goals and a Monster pledge level that would never have been possible in a retail environment.\n    The USA, the UK, the European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cFriendly Shipping\u201d. This means we will mass import the product into these regions and handle and pay all the import taxes, you won\u2019t have to incur additional cost.\nThe games will be produced in China by LongPack Games, an experienced board game manufacturer with a proven track record. Prototype quality has been outstanding. For the overseas freight, we are working with global forwarding agents that allow visibility of the shipment at any time, as they are on their way to the various distribution centers. We will be using established fulfillment companies like Ship Naked, Quartermaster Logistic, VFI, Aetherworks, Happyshops, and others, specialized and experienced in the fulfillment of Kickstarter projects, to cover the distance from distribution centers to your home. \nAll steps included, we calculate the product should arrive at your home end of September 2018. [EDIT from Nov. 2: we have adjusted the expected delivery time to end of SEPTEMBER 2018, in order to include the Heavy Weapons and 5p expansion set. Unfortunately, we cannot edit this information in the original pledge boxes]\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, which we will do with the help of Backerkit, the leading Pledge Manager platform. Above you will find the shipping cost you will have to expect per region. In the case of single unit pledges, these are maximum prices.\nWe say \u201cmaximum\u201d because these prices may go down further, but never up. Shipping prices fluctuate, but our pledge to you is that, for single unit shipments, we cover any potential additional cost beyond these shipping quotes, which are already subsidized by about 4\u20ac. And what\u2019s even better: the more volume we ship, the better we can streamline and optimize shipping, and we want to give back to the community by reducing shipping cost further.\n              ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe creation process for a board game is a complex enterprise, especially for a game like ours with hundreds of components: design adjustments, approval processes, pre-production samples, printing & assembling, freight shipping, handling in logistic centers and finally the last shipment to your door. If anything goes wrong or isn\u2019t perfectly right, there is a risk of delay at any of those steps. This is a simple reality that you as backer need to be aware of. If anything did indeed go awry, we would communicate this to you openly.\n \nHowever, we feel that we are well prepared for a good fulfillment process and minimize the risk of delay, for the following reasons:\n \n1. We have done about 95% of the illustration work and graphic design of the game, we are almost ready to push the button.\n2. We already went through the production process with LongPack, while producing prototypes with mass-production techniques. So we are familiar with their requirements, leadtimes, and processes.\n3. Our manufacturer has a proven track record in the gaming industry and the quality of our prototypes has been outstanding. Communication has been very smooth so far and we are sure this will continue.\n4. We are working with specialized fulfillment companies like Ship Naked or HappyShops, we are sure they can handle all your pledges easily, they have the systems and the experience.\n \n Let us also point out that Monster Lands is not a one-off stunt for us.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "        Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is a narrative miniatures board game that plunges you into the heart of the Hundred Years\u2019 War. In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

This extension adds new models, a new game play, new hexagons to give you even more play time and fun, and a new special scenario.\nLeo's baby. Dragon / Human size comparison (Dragon supplied unpainted. Leo not supplied at all)\nThe Dragon is supplied with the Archangel Saint Michael, one bombard, two artillerymen, ruins, 4 hexes, 6 hexagons of destruction and a special scenario featuring the Dragon, played by one player, and an army of human soldiers assisted by angels, played by the other players (1 or 2).\nClick here to find out more about this Add-On\n\u201cI loved loved loved this, and spent two days with the scenario bubbling in my mind around the other tactical options I could have taken!\u201d\nWarren (Beasts of War)\n\u201cThe miniatures are all cool. The amount of terrain that\u2019s going to come in the box is also amazing. Had a great time playing it.\u201d\nSam Healey (The Dice Tower) - in the Top 3 of the best games that Sam played at Gen Con 2017.\n\u201cTime of Legends: Joan of Arc stole the show for us. Mythic Games had pictures of hard plastic miniatures painted up, and they looked incredible.\u201d\n Techraptor at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cWithout a doubt, hands-down, my big giant experience at (GenCon) was Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.

The plot: an elite group of warriors attempts to fight their way into the stronghold of a previously unknown enemy \u2013 an enemy that proves ever more threatening the further they go.\n  We will charge for shipping through our pledge manager after the campaign ends. To be fair to all backers, shipping will be calculated based on the actual costs to ship the rewards you select.\nYour rewards will be shipped from our international hubs, depending on where you are located. We ship from the UK for EU backers, China for Asia Pacific backers, Canada for Canadian backers, Australia for Oceanic backers, and the US for US backers and the rest of the world.\nOur current estimate for shipping costs for a standard game package are listed below. Please note, these prices are estimates only.\nUSA: $12 - $18 to most cities. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCanada: $15 - $30 to most cities.\nUK: $12 - $18 to most cities.\nEurope: $15 - $20 to Western Europe. $20 - $30 to Northern Europe. $30 - $40 to Eastern and Southern Europe.\nAsia: $15 to China and Hong Kong. $30 - $40 to most other countries.\nOceania: $15 - $25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nLatin America: $60 - 70 to most countries.\nAfrica: $50 - $60 to most countries.\nUnfortunately, due to complications with import laws and customs, we are unable to ship to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nThe fabled Beasts of War created one of their popular \"Let's Play\" videos for Warforged: First Contact, using prototype miniatures, tokens and board.\nHost Justin McAuley praised the game's mechanics and looks forward to the future developments. \"I think this going to be a really fun game,\" he said. \"It's going to be very interesting to actually see what happens with all the different scenarios and the ways you can play through it.\"\nWarforged: First Contact is a skirmish-level exploration game where the Iron Legionaries of the Terran Authority investigate a dimension-spanning shrine-portal of the alien Mantra. The Iron Legion will need to use tight coordination and clever tactics to overcome the limitless hordes of the Mantra and battle their way to the heart of the shrine-portal.\n2+ Players using Iron Legion versus the Mantra (additional players take command of separate Iron Legion squads; the Mantra player acts as \"dungeon master\"). \n20-60 minutes play time depending on the scenario.\nUnique and accessible command card activation system. \nA wide selection of friends and enemies to use from lowly expendables to mighty heroes. \nTraps, alien conditions and reinforcements shift the odds through a game. Victory is rarely assured and games remain exciting to the last throw of the dice.\nMODELS\nWarforged: First Contact uses one-to-one model representation so one miniature equals one soldier, hero or one of the strange beings the Mantra deploys. These are 28mm to 32mm tall, corresponding to human-height models (roughly) because that\u2019s the accepted standard for models and we wanted models that people would want to collect \u2013 not least for us to collect too! The models will be produced in resin, ensuring even the smallest of details from the renders is retained.\nCOMMAND CARDS AND ACTION DECK\nEach model in a game is represented by a command card which includes all the characteristics and special rules for that model. On each game turn all of the command cards are shuffled together and then drawn one at a time, with each model activating and taking their actions when a card of their type is drawn.\nAn activated model has two actions that can be used to move or shoot (or shoot and shoot, or move and move). Models can be set to overwatch for lurking foes that activate later in the turn, but positioning is crucial as models can only use their ranged attacks in a limited front fire arc.\nThe Iron Legionaries are tough fighters that are well-armed for ranged fighting with rifles and a variety of heavy weapons. They can also field a mighty Ironclad in support.\nThe Mantra forces vary greatly; Chorals are quick but fragile hand-to-hand fighters that become deadly when massed, hulking Descants have the ability to pound Legionaries both up close and from a distance, while the Deva are winged terrors quite capable of ripping through an entire Legionary squad.\n HEROES\nIn the Warforged universe heroes are those who can harness Fracture energy and channel it. Unique hero skill cards are included in the action deck whenever a hero is present. The Warforged: First Contact base game includes two heroes, one for the Iron Legion and one for the Mantra, with many more planned for the expansions.\n\nKara is commander of the Iron Legion forces, one of the Authority\u2019s Awoken whose connection to the Brand is so strong it has unlocked truly superhuman abilities. Kara is a virtually unstoppable force in close combat, and her very presence can inspire her Legionaries to fight to the death and beyond.\n\n\nAngra is the thrice-blessed prophet of the Ganth race, vanguard of the Mantra and the first truly divine to arrive in the reality shard occupied by humanity. So far he is not impressed. Angra wields the heaviest firepower available to the Mantra in the shape of his triple-barrelled Fury cannon.\n\n\nMAP TILES\nSci-fi dungeon crawler/tactical skirmish games typically have linear corridors, square rooms and 90 degree corners. We wanted a more eclectic environment for the interior of the Mantra shrine-portal and the flexibility of the mighty hexagon for our map movement and ranges. Warforged: First Contact features a number of unique multi-hex tiles designed to be modular in nature to allow a wide variety of maps and re-playability.\n\n\nEach tile is named and has its own Discovery card detailing typical Mantra force, reinforcements and whether any traps and/or special conditions (like low gravity or blinding light) may be placed on them.\n\n\nThanks to the multi-dimensional nature of the shrine-portal (ok, and game designer artifice) these tiles can be used and re-arranged across multiple scenarios.\n\n\nAndy Chambers and Tuomas Pirinen are veteran game developers with over 50 years of experience between the two of them. The titles they have worked on include Warhammer, Warhammer 40,000, Mordheim, Battlefieet Gothic, Necromunda, Gorka Morka, Starship Troopers, Space Marine, Titan Legions, Epic 40,000 and many, many others. Recently Andy also took part in the highly successful Kickstarter campaign for Dropfleet Commander.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCumulatively, our team has decades of experience in game design and production. We know, therefore, there can always be issues that arise during production and shipping. We will do our best to mitigate any issues that arise and keep our backers informed through regular updates.\n\nFor this project we have teamed up with Ninja Division Publishing to take advantage of their production experience and strong network of partners in manufacturing, shipping, logistics, and distribution to help ensure a smooth delivery of Warforged: First Contact to your tabletop.\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2018, but this is only an estimate. Backers in different regions of the world may also receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund your money within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we offer refunds minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). Once we have begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we will refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds 14 days after the close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Several adventurers have been brave enough to attempt to discover the secret of the temple, yet none returned to tell the tale. What could this secret be? Why do so many go about risking their lives? Are they aware of what lies ahead of them? The Kingdom of Artheastam has come to the decision to send its three most excellent warriors to face the peril. This will surely not be watched from the sideline by either the offspring of darkness or the Mountaindeep or by the dispersed spacebenders. The future of their world is at stake, and they want to get hold of their legacy. In Magitics, players control a team of heroes that must confront the other heroes in a variable arena. Their aim is to be victorious and gain a crystal with magical powers hidden by Sethemet, the space-time magician.\nMagitics is a tactical fighting board game for 2-4 players set in a mystical and magical world. In this conflict, all players control a group of heroes. During the battles, the heroes gain spells, magic items and valuable loot to strengthen them. The players' aim is to overpower their opponents in combat by making tactical decisions, or to outright defeat them.\n  Action point driven mechanism: Players have a specific amount of action points to spend for a hero in each turn. Manage action points and combine your skills to ensure success. Plan ahead, as multiple activations of the same action will cost you more.\nHero customization: Power up your heroes by gaining items, loot and cards.

This is our second crowdfunding project on kickstarter, following the success of our first project, Ave Roma, which met the target in a bit over a day and closed on almost 400% funding. All extra copies of Ave Roma sold out in one day at Essen 2016 and it\u2019s currently undergoing its second printing due to the huge demand. A few lessons were learned from that campaign, we are sure we have an even better process for the packaging and delivery of our games worldwide. \n\nThe idea of Magitics was born 6 years ago and since then, the development and play testing took hundreds of hours. The game had many changes over time, but during the campaign all the graphics, rules and minor fixes will be finalized and applied. Our new main manufacturing partner is located in Poland, they have plenty of experience with several large publishers already. We are certain that we will have high quality components produced. As in our previous campaign, shortly after the campaign ends, the game will be in production. The fullfillment will be done through Happyshops and Funagain. For the freight shipping we will use our usual partner Kuehne + Nagel. When the production is done we will send out the games to our fulfillment partners immediately.\n\nWe want to keep you updated with all the relevant information about the progress of the project. We are confident to give you the best possible product and support. :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "A-games\n10 created \u00b7 44 backed\nA-Games started releasing games in 2014.

Playtime: 60 - 90 minutes.\nAfter the successful Kickstarter last year, we are back with an extreme expansion that brings a LEGACY campaign to the Saga of Alpha Centauri.\nBackground Story\nIn a future where the Solar System is ruled by a tyrannical government, a band of outcasts escapes to a star system light years away. There they discover an ancient human colony with a dark secret that threatens to destroy the Earth itself. You are all that stands between the Earth that abandoned you and it\u2019s total destruction.\nTake command of a ragtag space fleet and fight to save the Earth with nothing but a handful of outcasts and your ingenuity. Build, explore, and fight as you try to survive long enough to warn the Earth of the coming menace.\n  With this campaign we are trying to enhance our game even more. So, as a reward all backers will receive for FREE the Upgrade Pack v1.5 + Stretch Goals, which includes all of the following:\nNew and updated rulebook. We will split the rulebook into two. One for the Core Rules and one book for the Scenarios. We will be adding an index, an appendix giving more detailed information on some cards and we will be moving things around to make them easier to be found. We have also integrated all the comments we received during the last year, and we adjusted the core rules to make the game more strategic and less based on the dice rolling.\nUpdated Cards. You will get reprints of the cards that we have upgraded based on playtests and the requirements of the future expansions. These cards include Actions, Events, Units and Power Ups.\n5-6 Player Upgraded Components: If you get the 5-6 Player Addon from this campaign or you already own it from the previous campaign, this pack will contain the extra upgraded components for that add on too.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE: Two new special events available only to kickstarter backers\nFor a more in-depth analysis on the changes, please visit the relevant thread in BGG:\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/article/25595982\nCheck out the cool Ravager miniature that is included in the Upgrade Pack!\n    What is a Legacy Game?\nFrom BGG: \"Legacy games are board games that change over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. Players will often make physical changes to the board game by marking the board/cards and placing stickers over the board as well as often destroy components. The changes made in a Legacy game are always permanent, so what is done can not be undone.\"\nLegacy Mechanics\nBy Constantine Kevorque\n\u201cThe main asset of the a Legacy game is the story. You need to have a world where everything is happening, and then create a base story with various smaller scenario arcs which, when combined, take you through a really good adventure. We are fortunate to have based this game on the digital game Universe-Online, which has a very elaborate sci-fi lore.\u201d\n\u201cThe next step was a no-brainer, we hired a professional story writer to help us out. We gave him the existing lore, guidelines on how the story should go, and we let him work his magic.\u201d\n\u201cOur main advantage while designing the Legacy campaign was the existence of the core game. Given its nature, and the ability to support various scenarios with completely different gameplay, we already had a very good foundation for our Legacy game. By incorporating all the comments from the community after the initial release of the project and by making certain changes to mitigate the luck factor. We removed most of the difficult balancing problems we had and ended up with a stable mechanism.\"\n\u201cSo, the Legacy campaign uses all the core mechanics, and spices them up each session with specific variations, similar to what scenarios do. During each session, you will read an introductory story that will set the stage, and then you will be given specific instructions and rules that will set the gameplay and objectives. Sometimes there is only one objective, sometimes there will be sub-plots too.\u201d\n\u201cWhen playing a Legacy game, you are expected to perform certain permanent actions that modify the components of the game in such a way that you can not go back. Our game requires 8 successful sessions for you to finish the storyline. To make sure that you have at least two tries for each session, we have limited the Legacy actions at the beginning < during the Setup Phase> and the end of each session < during the Resolution Phase>. This makes each session replayable on its own.\u201d\n\u201cFor example, you may open a box at the beginning of a session, which will add new components, and you may use components and mechanics at the end of each session to save your progress and apply permanent changes. Because you will be using components from the core game, all permanent changes have been designed to affect only the Legacy components. In case we need you to apply a permanent change to an existing core component, we will be giving you a duplicate of that component.\u201d\n\u201cJust like the scenarios, each session might have a completely different gameplay than the previous one. Each secret package may add any combination of cards, tokens, hexagons, stickers and of course miniatures <!!!!> to the game. When you finish the Legacy campaign you will also gain access to two scenarios that you can play over and over again using those revealed components and miniatures.\u201d\n\u201cEach session is playable by 1 to 4 players. You can play one session with 4 players and the next with 2 or whatever combination you like. The game scales automatically without any issues, and it takes 60 to 90 minutes, depending on the number of players.\u201d\nIn a nutshell...\nWe can NOT disclose the contents of the Expansion since that would be a huge spoiler for the campaign, but we can tell you what our plan for this expansion is going to be:\nAffordable Legacy Games! Since the \"Legacy\" part of the game is an expansion, the cost of each season will be half the usual price of Legacy games.\nMany hours of gameplay. This Legacy Campaign can be played from 8 to 16 sessions of 60 to 90 minutes each.\nSOLO Legacy Mode. Our campaign can be played solo. In addition, you may play ANY of the sessions with 1 to 4 players. No matter whether you played previous sessions with more or less players, each session will adapt to the current number.\nAdded Value. As soon as you finish the Legacy Campaign, you will gain access to two scenarios that you can play over and over again, which will also use the hidden \"stuff\" that you will unlock during the Legacy Campaign. So, each Legacy Season will always extend and add to your core game!\n    This addon includes enough sleeves for everything in the Core game, the upgrade pack and the 6-player addon. We will make sure you receive enough sleeves even if we unlock many stretch goals.\nNote: The 5-6 Player addon applies ONLY to the core game, NOT to the Legacy. The Legacy Campaign is playable only with 1 to 4 players.\nSpice up your gameplay with this new expansion for Centauri Saga. This Expansion works for 1-6 players, the Arena Scenarios and the Legacy Expansion!\n                          Visit our Facebook page and give us a LIKE to help unlock those goals\nhttps://www.facebook.com/vesuviusmedia/\n            Click on the image bellow to download the rulebook for the CORE game.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends.

Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of the reasons a production could be delayed. Vesuvius Media Ltd should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties. In addition, some of the items shown might differ from the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing or they are damage, please contact us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com, and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible.\n\nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all damaged items and email them to us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible. The games shipped through this campaign will be sent out in a larger and stronger package, which will better protect the contents against damage.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nOur current estimation for delivery is October 2017. We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\n\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nAs soon as this campaign is over, you will be requested to complete a survey through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order. Keep in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated date. Please give us an address that will surely not change (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house around October, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery).\n\nSHIPPING\n\nPlease read the Shipping section above.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\n\nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. This is done due to weight limitations for group shipments. Even though the items you ordered will be shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nUPDATES\n\nThrough this campaign you may receive updates on Vesuvius Media's other upcoming projects.

You and up to 3 friends play the roles of the surviving leaders and must defeat the armies of Vesh over a series of 7 stories. Each story offers a unique challenge and has optional objectives depending on how long you want to play.\nThe game features full character customisation, worker management, board exploration, roleplaying style quests and strategic combat designed for replayability. Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThe City of Kings can be played in 2 ways, by choosing either a story or a scenario.\nStories\nThere are 7 stories to play, each story has its own objectives and continues a narrative introducing you to the world and characters. Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\nScenarios\nScenarios are quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go\nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.\nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\nCreatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love.\nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\nWe have spent the last 2 years building a world for The City of Kings, designing characters, writing stories and detailing events spanning 13,755 years. We wanted to go further than a theme and design a world which you can immerse yourself in for years to come.\nAs you play through the game you will experience the Cloud Keep War and learn about the key characters who came together for one last fight, as they tried to stop Vesh from claiming the entire world.\nYou will encounter survivors in need of assistance and they will offer you side quests further describing the world you are in.  \nThanks to unlocked stretch goals we can now add even more lore to the game by including back stories for each of the characters and all of the enemy factions.\nOver time we plan to release more stories, written materials, and much more as we continue to share this world with you.\nThe City of Kings was designed for both video and board gamers. The inspiration for the game comes from a life time of video gaming and many of the mechanics were inspired by MMORPGs. Combat is based around the holy trinity, character progression uses skill trees and creatures are procedurally generated.\n Retailers can find out more info about our retail options here.\nYou can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\nYou can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\n \"It is proper cracking.\" - Lucy\n\"I can't stress enough just how great it feels to play a game in which players become a close team through trying to beat the scenarios Frank has painstakingly worked on without enforcing co-operation... it's something else.\" - Jamie\n\"It reminds me of Mage Knight and Descent\" - Nick\n\"it\u2019s one of the funnest games I\u2019ve played. Especially as a video game player it feels like World of Warcraft as a board game. Heaps of praise for it overall. It\u2019s amazing how polished it is.\" - Ryan\nWe asked our playtesters what their favourite parts of The City of Kings were and put together a Top Ten Features list based on their feedback.\nYou can customise your pledge by clicking the 'manage pledge' option at the top right of the campaign page (it's green) and then manually edit your pledge amount, increasing it by the amount your customisations cost.\nAll customisations will be available after the campaign has ended but at higher costs and will incur extra shipping. You can save up to 50% on customisations by getting them during the campaign.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\n You can download the images here.\nWe have spent months planning our fulfilment process, arranging bulk shipping to warehouses around the world including the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. All with the goal of offering you the cheapest and most efficient shipping possible. But please keep in mind, this is a big game with over 1,000 components and is estimated to weigh between 5 and 6 kg (11 - 13lbs) so it is not cheap to ship, yet we are confident the level of replayability in the box will give you endless hours of gaming and offers great value for money.\nBackers may add multiple copies of the game to their pledge but must include the additional shipping fee for each additional copy, as listed above.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva is the amazing artist who spent the last 18 months creating all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\nWe would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings or just gaming in general! \nHere's where you can find us:\nTwitter | Facebook | YouTube | Instagram | Board Game Geek\nOur official website: www.thecityofkings.com\nThe long journey\nFrank first started posting about designing The City of Kings on Board Game Geek back in 2015, you can read the work in progress posts here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a large, ambitious project, but I am on Kickstarter today because I believe The City of Kings is ready and that I can live up to all the promises I am making on this page to deliver a great game.\n\nWhilst this is my first Kickstarter, I have backed over 150 other projects, spent months studying and preparing for manufacturing, shipping and fulfilment and have worked on many high pressure projects in the last 10 years.\n\nDesign\n\nThe game has been designed and tested by countless people spending hundreds of hours testing the game. There are still a few scenarios to finish off and the stories may be enhanced if we hit our stretch goals but I have allowed time for this in our plan and have no doubts the game will be finished on time.\n\nArtwork\n\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few icons and bits of graphic design to finish off prior to print but otherwise we are good to go. We have allowed time in our plan for any artwork needed for stretch goals to be produced without impacting the delivery dates.\n\nManufacturing\n\nWe have been working with manufacturers and getting quotes for nearly a year, we are confident we can deliver a high quality game for the prices stated and will be looking at blank samples and pre-production prints before starting mass production.\n\nOur prototype has had much praise for the quality of the components and we are convinced we will get an even better response with our end product.\n\nShipping\n\nWe have arranged shipping, importing and fulfilment around the world working with multiple companies who have been tried and tested by countless Kickstarters. There are always unknowns but I am confident we are as prepared as any Kickstarter can be.\n\nFinal words\n\nBeing this is my first campaign, I want to assure you I have picked over every detail, from rigorous playtesting of the game to having a full understanding of shipping logistics. Everything that can be done to make this successful and deliver on time has been done.\n\nThis is my passion, and I hope, the first steps to my future.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "    Heroes of the Great War: Limanowa 1914 is a tactical war board game based on the events of the Eastern Front of the Great War. In December 1914, the armies of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the Russian Empire faced off in the region of Galicia and the Carpathian Mountains. The stakes were high - the battle was a turning point on the Eastern Front, as a victory here would open the way straight to the heartland of the enemy. The players' goal is to lead their side to victory by accomplishing a set of historical strategic goals - which they can only achieve in close cooperation with their ally.\n  Tactical War Board game\nMost historical wargames are too overwhelming for casual players and most war-themed board games are too simple for hardcore wargamers. Heroes of the Great War: Limanowa 1914 is designed to be a great fit for both groups: you can play the simplest version even if you rarely play board games, or use and master the vast array of options the game has to offer to create a complex and realistic battle simulation.\nHistorical Accuracy\nIf you care about historical accuracy, this game is for you: the miniatures are exact representations of the armies of the Great War - guns, uniforms, beards and moustaches. The generals' skills are based on their life and battlefield prowess, and unit abilities represent their real-world functionality. Even the town layouts look similar to their real-life counterparts!\nRealistic Battle Simulation \nHistorical accuracy is also true for unit behaviour. In Heroes of the Great War, all units (different types of infantry, cavalry and artillery) and features (railway, battle cards, etc.) are based on historical events and real-life military tactics. You will surely find mentions of such actions in history books.\nModular structure\nThe unique modular structure of the game board ensures replayability and variety. The game board consists of four pieces, and each piece in itself can host its own minigame. You can play either a long, several hour campaign on the big board, or a short, 1-hour skirmish minigame on one of these pieces.\nExpansion possibilites\nWe designed Heroes of the Great War to be the first instalment of a series. We already have many ideas about possible expansions, all of them connecting to the base game and its map but bringing new features, locations, and units (including new generals) to the main board. If you are a fan of huge maps and vast armies, brace yourself: expansions are coming.\n  Find out more about the historical background of the crisis at Limanowa on our website: \n  Adapt to the circumstances\nThe game board precisely displays the battlefield with forests, heights, settlements and strategically important roads and railway lines. The units are sent to attack the opponent or set up for defense with the lay of the land in mind. \nDuring the battle, the weather can also be a factor to be reckoned with. During rain, the roads may become unusable, making advancement and manoeuvring harder. In snowy weather, attackers have a serious disadvantage and artillery observers can not see the enemy units due to the snowfall.\nThe terrain, the weather and the strategic and tactical target locations are crucial elements of an effective battle plan\nMaster your army  \nEach unit miniature (or token) represent a sizeable military force on both the Austro-Hungarian and Russian side. These units have different combat values (Attack, Defense and Replacement) and special abilities which influence their tactical and strategic utility.\nThe players control three main types of units during the battle: infantry, cavalry, and artillery.\nThe units' base snap colors represent their allegiance, while the loss indicator chits show the damage they've taken in combat\nInfantry possesses the highest combat values and the best close-combat abilities, and when used appropriately and en masse, they can spearhead an offensive and break through the enemy lines.  \nThe strength of the cavalry lies in its manoeuvrability. Thanks to their speed, they can quickly reach places threatened by the enemy or outflank opposing units.  \nThe role of artillery is to crush the opposing forces from a distance or to support the allied infantry and cavalry during their fights.\nEach army corps is led by a general (Hadfy, Szurmay, Orlov, Eck) who has unique abilities and the highest combat values. Including these, there are 57 units in the base game.\nIssue commands with battlecards\nAs generals, the players can give their units ad-hoc or secret orders, represented by battlecards. The 40 battlecards in the game can be divided into two groups: strategic and artillery. The players' battlecards are kept hidden from the enemy until they are played. Each player starts the game with only a few of these cards, but they can acquire more by destroying enemy units or accomplishing certain strategic or tactical objectives. The more cards a player possesses, the bigger his or her chance to win the smaller encounters or to counter the enemy's maneuvers and actions.  \nHone your skills as a general\nThe rulebook is complemented by a handy Example Booklet, demonstrating many possible encounters that can come up during the battle. This can be a great help for new players to quickly learn the different unit abilities and the subtleties of battle tactics in Heroes of the Great War.\nIf you are interested in the rules in detail, check out the game\u2019s rulebook!\n   If you\u2019d like to try the game before backing it, check it out on your tablet or PC at Tabletopia.\n  If you'd like to try the game offline, print the Print-and-Play trial version, and give the game a go! \n  Hussar Colonel box\nThe Hussar Colonel Box is our all-in-one offer: it includes the base game, all miniatures and stretch goals, and a Kickstarter Exclusive, metallic Acting Player badge - a total value of \u00a390 for the price of \u00a375. This box is only available during the Kickstarter campaign, and won\u2019t be released in retail - this is your only chance to get one! \n\n  Lieutenant box\nThe Lieutenant box is the retail version of the game - it includes neither Kickstarter exclusives nor miniatures. It has everything you need to play the game, with double-sided unit tokens representing the troops. It comes with two booklets: the Rulebook and the Example Booklet which answers your questions through in-game examples and possible scenarios.\nCossack Captain box\nThe Cossack Captain box does not include any gameplay elements, but it contains all the miniatures from the Hussar Colonel box. If you are a collector or a miniature painting enthusiast, the Cossack Captain box can be an ideal choice. You can also use it to replace the cardboard unit tokens in the Lieutenant Box with historically accurate miniatures. All unlocked miniature-related stretch goals also apply to the Cossack Captain Box. \n\n       \"the artwork on the cards, the rules, some of those overviews is really simple awesome, and really fall in love it from first time I saw them\" - jPlay\n\"let say already: very, very strategic game\" - jPlay\nMore reviews are coming soon!\nThe shipping cost of the game is not included in your pledge - it will only be charged after the campaign, when the pledge manager launches.

Beyond role-playing, we were keen players of board games in our pastime, as a leisure activity. In addition to this, all of us are seriously interested in matters of history, military campaigns and battles, and - owing to our background in mathematics - we find the simulation of real-life historic events a compelling challenge. In modelling these into a virtual world - the world of board games -, we rely on the help of numbers, while playing careful attention to balanced gameplay.\nWe began shaping our first board game concept around 2010 in our free time, at the time only at amateur level. Over time, these first ideas developed into specific game plans with concrete substance. As early as these initial phases, we strived to put plans for our own games into practice and see our old dream come true: our rudimentary ideas and concepts developing into marketable games popular with the public.\nThis game is Heroes of the Great War. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1: This is our first Kickstarter project, but we feel that we are up to the challenge. In order to perform better in the world of crowdfunding we\u2019ve invested countless hours not only in product development, but also in Kickstarter research and marketing - and we can\u2019t wait to see the result! We also got a lot of help from Mindclash Games (http://mindclashgames.com/), who already ran two successful Kickstarter projects (Trickerion and Anachrony).\n\n2: The estimated delivery date of the game is March 2018, but as with most projects that are produced overseas, there can be unforeseen delays in production and shipping. Also, while we will be striving to distribute the game in an even timeframe, due to the logistics of international shipping backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\n3: Although it is our first mass produced game, many members of our team have a several years of experience in 3D printing, scanning and modeling, as well as small-scale quality production at Basiliskus 3D (http://basiliskus.hu/en/). Some of us were also working on successful KS projects like Conan and Anachrony. Thanks to this, we are confident that we can efficiently manage the mass production progress, especially its most challenging part, the plastic miniatures.\nThe other half of the team is working at Digit\u00e1lis Legend\u00e1rium (https://facebook.com/digitalislegendarium/), creating historical animated movies and many other things to popularize history.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Rising Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan (up to 6 players with the expansion). As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. \nHere's a look at everything included in a base pledge:\nAnd all the Optional Buys you can get:\nClick to learn more about Dynasty Invasion, Playmat Board, Art Book, and Metal Coins.\nCreated by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage, with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey.\nChoose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle.\nEach of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies.\nKoi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable.\nKoi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nDragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next.\nDragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nBonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally.\nBonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nLotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray.\nLotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nTurtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces.\nTurtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nPlayed over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided.\nThe Political Mandates.\nDuring the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side.\nWhen players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits.\nKomainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite.\nOni of Skulls and Oni of Souls.\nOni of Hate and Oni of Blood.\nRiver Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure).\nThe miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic.\nAlliances are formed. Alliances are broken.\nAt the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances.\nDo not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale.\nThe Kami await the worshippers.\nWhen players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play.\nEach Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins. Sometimes losing a battle may win you the war.\nWhen Winter comes, all politics and fighting are over. Players gain extra points for winning battles in as many different provinces as possible, and also for certain upgrades they may have gathered. As the snow falls, the new Emperor will ascend! \nGame Components:\n58 Highly Detailed Miniatures, including 10 warriors for each clan and 8 huge monsters.\n40 Counter Bases\n137 Tokens\n5 Clan Screens\n5 Political Sheets\n53 Cards\n6-fold Gameboard\n1 Rulebook\nYou can take a look at the Work In Progress Rulebook HERE.\nFor $100 the Daimyo Pledge gets you a Rising Sun core game as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Phoenix monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock!\nThe Phoenix comes with its amazing miniature and Season card. \nThe Phoenix has otherworldly powers of resurrection. Whenever it is killed, it automatically reappears in the same province and raises the honor of its clan.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only. \nThe honorable CMON crew gathered to play a session of Rising Sun.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Daimyo Pledge", "descp": "*Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nRising Sun Core Box\nPhoenix Exclusive Monster\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29,207 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Rising Sun on CMON Comics - Vol. 1!", "update_content": "Konnichiwa, honorable backers.\nWe hope you're safe and healthy.\nIt has been years since the Rising Sun campaign launched, and we knew right away that this was something especial.

Gather your squad of Giant Killer Robots (GKRs), build your deck, and face your rivals in the ultimate fight for fame, fortune, and sweet salvage rights. Scheme, strategize and strong-arm your way to victory as you dominate the media landscape, one billboard at a time. \nTHE ROBOT RUMBLE STARTS NOW!\n      GKR: Heavy Hitters is a standalone, customizable tabletop game for 1-4 players, combining high-quality collectibles with dice-rolling, mech-building and tactical play! Pilot your Heavy Hitter (the biggest, baddest robot on the board) and a squad of three Support Units through the ruins of an old city, competing to either wipe your opponent off the map or reduce four skyscrapers to rubble.  \nKEY GAME FEATURES\nA unique hex-based tabletop gameplay experience\nx4 Giant high-quality Heavy Hitter miniatures up to 139mm tall\nx12 highly detailed Support Units  standing up to 47mm tall.\nx10 Buildings that break up the landscape and alter the way you play, every time\nx193 cards with unique artwork from Weta Workshop artists\nFour corporate Factions, each with its own weapons and abilities\nFour Pilots with special skills\nFive distinct phases of play\nTwo ways to win!\nTHE WORLD OF GKR\nThe story goes like this...Big plague. People died. Governments fell over. Things got bad, real fast. Fortunately, the corporations saved the day! Under their command, things got a whole lot better. But what to do with all those abandoned cites? There\u2019s money to be made in the salvage rights. But which corporation gets them? Enter the Giant Killer Robots League.\nAIM OF THE GAME\nThere are two ways to win GKR: Heavy Hitters. Defeat your opponent through brute force, or reduce four buildings to rubble by Tagging them with advertising. Winning is a careful balance of managing energy, repairing damage, earning new Pilot skills, gathering and using sponsor-endorsed upgrades, and moving into positions that give you tactical advantage for your unique weapons.\nCHOOSE YOUR PILOT\nPart superstar athletes, part celebrity spokespeople for their corporate Factions, these guys have been chosen as much for their ability to drive Heavy Hitters as for their ability to drive ratings. Pick your Pilot carefully! Each will unlock special skills and upgrades on the Achievement board to help you strategize your way to victory. \nCHOOSE YOUR FACTION\nGKR: Heavy Hitters features four unique corporate Factions. Each has a squad of GKRs ready for you to take control, including one Heavy Hitter and three Support Units with a whole heap of special abilities. As Pilot, you get to pick one Faction to fight for. Which will you take into combat?!\n   DEPLOY PHASE\nThis is your chance to deploy your Support Units to the field. The Combat, Repair and Recon Units come with attack and defence capabilities unique to your Faction. \nMOVEMENT PHASE\nNext, move your Heavy Hitter and Support Units into a tactical position on the battlefield.\n  COMBAT PHASE\nTime for the smackdown! In the Combat Phase, Factions attack and defend against each other with the roll of the dice. Rather than turn-based order, weapon speed determines who strikes first.\n  Every Heavy Hitter has an arsenal of Primary Weapons, Secondary Weapons, and Orbital Strike. Primary Weapons are broken into 3 classes: Energy, Missile, and Ballistic. Use your cards wisely! If you sustain damage, you lose cards. If you lose all your cards to damage, you\u2019re OUT!\n TAGGING PHASE\nThis is your chance to assert advertising dominance on the battlefield. Place four Tags on a building and you demolish that Building. Demolish four Buildings, and you win the game!\nFor each Building you Tag, you also earn a Sponsor Card. Use \u2018em throughout the game to give you a tactical advantage through hacking, counter-hacking, or even a spot of corporate espionage.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of a Sponsor Card. They can tip the balance between sweet victory and humiliating defeat!\nRESET PHASE\nThe final phase of the round is the Reset. Draw new Faction Cards, replenish your energy and get ready for another round of robot rumble!\n\nUpgrade to plastic Dashboard available in Stretch Goals!\n         No game is complete without putting it through its paces in the playtesting arena.

This may be our first Kickstarter, but rest assured, this isn\u2019t our first rodeo: we\u2019ve created and delivered high-quality consumer products for more than 15 years. We have fantastic relationships with our manufacturers and distributors, who - like us - have very high standards when it comes to quality and meeting deadlines. \n\nIn this industry of manufacture and logistics, there\u2019s always the possibility of unexpected delays on matters like production, shipping and customs. Best laid plans, and all that. While we can\u2019t foresee every bump in the road, here\u2019s what we do know: We\u2019ve put many, many months of planning and love into making sure that the manufacture of GKR: Heavy Hitters goes as smoothly as possible. We guarantee you that this product has our full attention, with a dedicated team on board every step of the way. In the extremely unlikely event that we are unable to deliver the game, we\u2019ll refund all pledges in full. That said, we\u2019ve got no reason to expect that this will occur. \n\nIf we do hit speed bumps along the way, we\u2019ll get the message out to our backers openly, honestly, and immediately.\n\nOur goal is to share the world of Giant Killer Robots through a fantastic game that\u2019s an absolute blast to play.

Deep in the foothills of a secluded land stands a castle where creatures of lore and legend reside, and from here they strike out at the world and cause unspeakable terror. For too long the local villagers have lived in the shadow of this place, but no more! A call to arms has been made, and heroes and adventurers from across the land have answered the call! The villagers now come to destroy that which gives evil life, and they cannot be allowed to succeed! \nVillage Attacks is a cooperative castle defence game for 1-5 players that sees players taking on the roles of the most infamous and feared creatures of folklore and legend! Deep in a remote part of the world, you and your monstrous brethren have taken up residence in an immense castle in the foothills of lands where most fear to tread. But the local village has had enough of the evil that lies at its door and has decided to lay siege to the castle in an effort to drive you out and destroy whatever ties you to this world. \nAll Pitchfork pledges will also receive the Kickstarter exclusive Grimlord Town Hero as part of their pledge!\n If you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this page and simply increase your pledge amount of the items you'd like to get. We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards via our Pledge Manage sent to you after the campaign ends.\n Find out more about Horrors of the Sands here\nFind out more about Greed & Fury Here\nFind out more about Terror & Anguish Here\nFind out more about Fear & Torment Here\nFind out more about Dread & Malice Here\n Find out more about Doom & Suffering here.\nFind out more about Wrath & Ruin Here  \nFind out more about translation Here \nFind out more about translation Here\nThe villagers are controlled by the game itself, making Village Attacks a completely cooperative experience. The villagers may be weak, but they are not alone! News of your malevolent presence has spread far and wide; hunters and heroes have come from all corners of the globe to vanquish you! Some have come for the fame, others for the glory, but they share a single goal; your doom!\nThe castle interior is constructed using a modular tile system made up from beautifully illustrated game tiles that allow for near limitless combinations and layouts. The villagers will attempt to reach the heart of the castle and destroy it, but they must be stopped! Only by slaying enough villagers and breaking their morale will you be able to drive them from your home for good. \nThe castle interior is constructed from tiles of varying sizes and types\nTraps can be placed to fight back the tide of Villagers\nThe entire village is at your gates! From lowly peasants to seasoned hunters, all have come to see to your downfall! Even great and renowned heroes from across the land have answered the call.\nTown heroes have their own unique stats and are very dangerous!\nCastle defence is the fundamental framework of Village Attacks, but it really is just the beginning. Missions in Village Attacks are played in two ways; either in a classic castle defence styled game where waves of enemies are attempting to destroy the Castle Heart, or as stories that feature a myriad of interesting special conditions and objectives. Objectives will require monsters to complete a set of tasks outside of defending the castle, like summoning monsters, barricading spawn points as they open up on the map and rescuing fellow monsters that the Villagers have captured and are trying to leave the castle with! \u201cStories\u201d will be multiple mission campaigns that are linked together through a narrative. Actions in previous missions will have an effect on the conditions and requirements of later missions in the story.\nVillage Attacks uses custom dice to control the outcome of your turn. Dice results can be used to move your monster, activate your abilities, purchase traps, defend yourself from incoming attacks and even stored for the next round.\nCustom dice are the currency of Village Attacks\nEach monster possesses their own unique abilities that they are able to level up by slaying villagers and completing objectives. Monsters are categorised into types, which can affect how they interact with the enemy forces. Hunters and Town Heroes deal extra damage to monsters that match their types, creating another level of strategy and planning.\nAs you slay villagers and complete objectives, Monster abilities can be levelled up\nThe backs of the dashboards tell the legends of the creatures you play as.\nThe Game Overview tile is used to keep track of stats as the game is played\n The subject matter of Villager Attacks has been painstakingly researched, and all of the creatures are from rich and interesting tales from antiquity. From well known classics such as Vampires and Banshees, to more obscure yet equally fascinating legends such as Vodayanoys and Djinns-  all of these are brought to life in the world of Village Attacks. Monster dashboards contain the tales of each fabled creature, and even elements of game play have been inspired by the stories that surround these fabled monsters.\nVillage Attacks contains:\n5 Monster miniatures\n32 Peasant miniatures\n24 Hunter miniatures\n5 Town Hero miniatures\n1 Rule book\n14 game tiles\n1 Game Overview tile\n5 monster dashboards\n5 Town Hero tokens\n6 custom engraved dice\n40 Villager Spawn cards\n20 Trap cards\n20 Village Event cards\n40 coloured clip on bases\n1 dice bag\n 80+ tokens\nAll of out miniatures are 35mm scale and mass produced from high quality PVC plastics which is the same as our previous Kickstarter Endure the Stars.\nClick here to view the WIP rulebook for Village Attacks!\n  Watch this video to see Village Attacks in action!

One always starts with those closer to his city. \nThe player gets 2 monsters out of the forest, from the top of his monster pile and moves them on the path. If the boss is on top of the pile, he goes alone and moves along the path. \n(1) The goblin, already present on the path, moves one square. (2) Another goblin arrives and moves one square too. (3) An orc enters the path and moves two squares.\n Every Tower on the path can shoot a monster of the same colour, present in any of the 4 squares surrounding it. Every tower can shoot the boss. \nWhen a monster is hit for the first time, he loses a life point and is turned on its \u201cinjured\u201d side. A monster on its \u201cinjured\u201d side is captured if it loses another life point. The player places it on his City dashboard and wins 2 crystals.\nThe first blue tower shoots the blue monster so it is flipped on its wounded side. The red tower shoots the orc which is also flipped. The second blue tower can\u2019t shoot the spider because it is a yellow monster.\nIf at least one Boss has been killed, the game will end when the Night phase is over. Player with the most Victory Points wins the game.\nYou get Victory Points by saving as much guards as possible, by wounding, or killing the Boss, and by completing challenges.\n   An event card is revealed. The effect of the new card will be applied during the next round.\nEnglish texts are temporary and will be translated by a professional after the Kickstarter campaign.\n  Starting with the first player and turning clockwise, every player will play one of the 4 following actions.\nExcept in the situation where the player chooses the \u201cDraw 2 Cards\u201d action, he can play on card from his hand after having played his initial action.   \n The gameplay video is made by us with a prototype. Pictures are work in progress but the element sizes are near the final ones.\n  With all your crystals gathered in your city, you ended up catching the interest of your neighbors, especially these Green Skins living in the mountains. \nHeaded by a brutal leader, they are coming down the mountain in hordes to raid your city\u2026  \n  Fortunately for you, your city is greatly walled, and a large number of guards are watching over its doors\u2026 but how long can they hold if the monsters are camping at the feet of your walls, and attack them every night?   \n \nLuckily your workers have mastered the art of building towers. Once in place, they should slow your enemies down, if not destroy them!   \n  Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n    Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n                          Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n     Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n  Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n  WARNING!

During the first campaign I learned SO much and built a great rapport with many dedicated and enthusiastic backers.

When it comes to game manufacturing Panda has reputation second to none.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter project (second attempt at funding) as a creator; however, I bring almost two decades of experience working on, managing and delivering complex creative projects like this one.

With clear and honest communication throughout the campaign right up to the happy moment when Quodd Heroes arrives at your door.\n\nAs a more than frequent backer of board game projects on Kickstarter, I know the kinds of issues that can arise during production and fulfillment. Delays are often an unpredictable and inevitable part of the process, but by choosing to work with reputable partners for manufacturing and fulfillment I aim to avoid any such issues. How have I set up for success? The majority of the game is already print-ready and the 3D character models for the core box are completely finished.

No two campaigns are ever the same!\nAt the start of each Chapter, one of the Gentlemen will be nominated as the Leader and will assign Role Cards to the other players on the team, giving them a unique ability. For example, the Bouncer can dish out extra damage during a battle, and the Samaritan can heal teammates. All the Gentlemen of The Unicorn Club also have a Class, and will upgrade their skills in different ways throughout the campaign. The Classes are: Knight, Dilettante, Mekamancer, Arcanist and Monster.\nTo succeed in their mission, the Gentlemen will have to use some of the fanciest inventions available. Remember to get the right equipment for each of the characters, since some are adept at ranged combat, and others like to get their hands dirty with melee combat. Learning how to use them as a cohesive unit is key to victory! Some special equipment or actions might require a rare and special resource to be activated: ETHER. But beware! Once used by the heroes, Ether becomes available for the Nemesis to use on one of his henchmen, activating their special abilities. So the more Ether the Gentlemen use, the more powerful the Nemesis becomes!\nWhile the Gentlemen have special class abilities and the most modern machinery at their disposal, the Nemesis will be able to use unpredictable Chaos Cards they have in hand to surprise the heroes. As the game evolves, several cards will be acquired and can be constantly activated when their Ether cost is paid. Those permanent cards can allow the Nemesis to bring various types of surprises to the game, such as summoning new Minions, boosting an attack with dice, etc.\nPlayers will have to carefully make their decisions according to the style of each Villain character. When playing with the members of the Grotesque Company Circus, for example, you will find that Titus is a strongman who is heavy on the muscles, but light on the brain power, and the Hammersmith Sisters are two heads sharing one body... but they hold a single talent for swinging a mallet!\nThe crew from the circus: The strong Titus, the Killer Clowns and the crazy Hammersmith Sisters\nEach member of the The Cult and the twisted family of the Grotesque Company Circus has their own double-sided dashboard, presenting 2 different options of abilities for the Nemesis player to choose. While Tobias and Emerson will always gain a bonus when the other one is killed (an effect of their Blood Brothers ability), in different scenarios you can choose if you want to play with a version of Tobias that spawns new zombies or with a version of him that deals more damage to opponents!\nThe mighty Moloch and The Cult Agents\nIn Rise of Moloch, the direction of the game unfolds like a play being performed. However, in this play, the actors are writing the script as they go! All of the action and drama takes place over the course of six different Chapters. The board will change each Chapter, with the streets and buildings of London coming together to form the stage for the play. Just as with any good performance, Rise of Moloch has Intermissions between the Chapters. Normally, this is a time for the audience to ruminate over what they\u2019ve seen and wait for the next part of the play. But in this story, the Intermission is where some of the most crucial decisions in the game will take place, since this moment is all about getting stronger for the future Chapters of the game!\nFor each Chapter of Rise of Moloch, the board is set up with different tiles to form a stage. Each stage will be a mixture of indoor and outdoor locations constructing the streets, alleys, and buildings of London. The players will have to negotiate their way through doors, walls, and obstructions if they want to complete their tasks. The Chapter unfolds across that stage, with each side using the environments and their team of characters to defeat their opponents.\nDifferent overlays and setups: No scenarios look alike!\nAfter a series of fierce encounters with the Agents of the Nemesis (which work like bosses for each Chapter), the intrepid Gentlemen may end up suffering too many Wounds, which will give them a Torment Card. These cards add even more to the story, causing effects like losing an equipment card, a skill, or even having their number of actions reduced! Of course, on the brink of losing their minds, some of the Gentleman might find extra strength and perform a counter-attack action!\nThe right Activation order is key to victory!\nAt the beginning of each round, Activation cards are laid out secretly on a special dashboard, and both sides take alternating turns revealing the cards. A clever and unexpected sequence of activations can find your adversary unprepared, paving the way to a strategic victory!\nThe Unicorn Club!\n  Rise of Moloch comes with:\n63 Highly Detailed Miniatures (5 Different Gentlemen; 6 Bobby Minions; 4 Special Chapter Characters; 13 Agents of the Nemesis; 10 Killer Clowns; 25 Zombies (10 Regular; 5 Zombies in Flames; 5 Royal Guard Zombies; 5 Dismembered Corpse Zombies)\n5 Heroes Dashboards\n14 Villain Dashboards\n220+ Mini-Cards (30 Chaos Cards, 20 Torment Cards, 6 Role Cards, 20 Gear Cards, 20 Artifact Cards, 20 Common Arsenal Cards, 15 Expert Arsenal Cards, 10 Royal Arsenal Cards, 40 Upgrade Cards, etc..)\n5 Player-Aids\n12 Scenery Rooms Overlays\nOver 150 Cardboard Tokens\n1 Activation/Intermission Board\n1 Nemesis Board\n1 London Fire Board\n1 Rulebook\n1 Campaign Book\n8 Custom Engraved Dice\nHERE you can download a work in progress version of the rulebook.

The miniature is also followed by a new art and new abilities - the same character is also present on the base game, but with a different game experience!\nAmbassador Pledge - $120\nThe Ambassador Pledge gives you a copy of Rise of Moloch Core Box, with the Kickstarter Exclusive Alternate Hero Emma Swanson, all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock and a copy of the Kickstarter Exclusive expansion The Embassy!\nIn this exciting expansion for The World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch, the intrepid Gentlemen are sent to investigate strange events surrounding the mysterious Embassy. The Embassy brings an all new three Chapter campaign to Rise of Moloch, beginning with a daring escape from an infected Police Station to the very depths of the London sewer system! But it\u2019s not only the map that has changed in The Embassy, the Nemesis themselves have changed into a new threat!\nAll the Miniatures from The Embassy Expansion!\nThroughout this campaign the Gentlemen will not suffer Torments, but rather Mutations, which can range from bladed arms, enhanced senses, to lashing tentacles! But while these Mutations can grant immense power, they come at a steep cost- each round there is a chance the alien host dwelling within might take over, forcing that Gentlemen under the control of the Nemesis! Can the Gentlemen uncover the secrets of The Embassy before succumbing to alien infection?\nA new pack of rooms and overlays!\n  The Embassy: Agents of The Nemesis and Minions. The alien infection is spreading!\nRise of Moloch: The Embassy Expansion comes with:\n2 Gentlemen Miniatures (Elisabeth Sparkle and Lord Baron Mantes)\n3 Villain Miniatures (Lord Swanson, Ambassador Nail and Kenny Jones)\n8 Minion Miniatures (Infected Constable)\n1 New Campaign, including 3 New Chapters and a pack of Overlays\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nAll of the miniatures in this campaign will be in plastic, and come pre-assembled and unpainted.\nCMON gathered a brave group of gentlemen to face off with Michael Shinall, a Senior Developer on Rise of Moloch in a short gameplay video to give you an idea of how the game plays:\n      The channel Man Vs Meeple took a first look at Rise of Moloch, check the video below:\n    Find out more about The Dragon expansion HERE.\nDelve into The Mekasylum expansion HERE.\nUnearth The Wheel expansion HERE.\nRead up on these Gentlemen of Her Majesty's Service  HERE.\nExplore Baker Street HERE.\nFind out more about this Art Book HERE.\nDiscover the Kingdom Death Crossover HERE. \n                                                                              Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $70 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. $15-$30 to most other countries.\n$35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n$40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n$55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n$60 to Iceland and Israel.\n$70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n   To learn about Retailer pledges, please click HERE.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rise of Moloch.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Take on the role of an iconic Myth hero in a desperate fight to protect the city of Farrenroc from the legions of Darkness that seek to despoil its holy walls.\n                Dark Frontier is a stand-alone game. It does not require Myth.\n               Dark Frontier combines high adventure with resource management, programmed action selection, and epic conquest to create a unique gaming experience to further enrich the world of Myth.\nDuring a siege, damage is tracked by removing pieces from the large Farrenroc miniature.\nPlayers take on the role of iconic heroes from the world of Myth, aiding the besieged city of Farrenroc in its never-ending quest to push back the Darkness. Each hero has a small deck of five actions: Travel, Battle, Encounter, Fortify, and Quest. Three of the five are selected and placed in one of three time slots (morning, day, and night).\nThese selections are made for all heroes and the enemy at the same time, then shuffled. Each time phase is played out by drawing and executing the action, be it a hero or an enemy. Players will need to discuss their planned actions with each other and play them in the appropriate time slots. All the while, the enemy is moving to destroy Farrenroc by any means necessary.\n    The forces of Darkness spread across the land, methodically crippling Farrenroc's influence in hopes of eventually laying siege to this last standing beacon of Light. Each game of Dark Frontier pits the heroes against a single army, contributing its own unique minions, captains, boss, and treacheries. Heroes must contend with these threats while also mustering the support of the land to unite against a mutual foe.\nFor more information on the Agents and Allies expansion check out update 3.\n           Adam and Brady Sadler are an experienced game design team and have produced games for publishers such as Fantasy Flight Games and Cryptozoic Entertainment.

Delays are often an unpredictable and inevitable part of the process, but by choosing to work with reputable partners for manufacturing and fulfillment I aim to avoid any such issues. How have I set up for success? The majority of the game is already print-ready and the 3D character models for the core box are completely finished. When stretch goals are met, I\u2019ve already scheduled my plan to account for additional design, art and 3D modelling required for manufacturing. \n\nWith your help and support we can make this project a great success!

They are listed below.\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please just click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Y\u014dkai Quest Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager.

Set in a fantasy, Japan-inspired world, the miniatures included are designed with \u201cchibi\u201d look; this means a cute way of design, with the characters having big and expressive faces.\nClick to download!\n  \u00a1Clic para descargar!\nThis is a beta version for Y\u014dkai Quest Rulebook. Y\u014dkai Quest Rulebooks will be always available for free download.  \nIn addition, new campaigns and scenarios, and more game support components will be also available to download for free.\n    In Y\u014dkai Quest, a game is played in stages, each one represented by a board.\nThe chosen scenario to play will specify which board must be set at each stage, where the spawn points of the y\u014dkai are placed, the entry point of the heroes and what they must accomplish in order to advance to the next stage.\nGame board preview - WIP\nAt the final stage, the final boss awaits. Heroes must defeat these powerful enemies to win the scenario.\nThe Game Box will include a variety of scenarios, and a complete campaign with its own history and development, well described in the Adventure Book.\nScenario Sample: Click to download!\n  Hero Card\nPlayers can choose between different heroes: the brave samurai, the stoic monk, the fiery gunslinger, the righteous priest, and many more! Each hero has a unique set of traits: movement, health, defence, melee power, reach and ranged power. All these traits are listed in the hero's card.\nLearn more about Y\u014dkai Quest classes\n  In Y\u014dkai Quest there are three classes: Bushi, Shinobi and Sennin. Each hero belongs to one of them! Class serves to describe a type of hero, and it is also used by items, indicating what heroes can use them.\nSome Ryo's abilities\n  At the beginning of a game, the player will configure the abilities the hero will be able to use during the fight: these abilities will make the hero more defensive, capable of helping other heroes and/or have access to powerful attacks.\nThe ability cards must be placed on the dedicated slots of the hero dashboard. These cards have one ability on each side, so when you place one with the chosen ability upwards on the dashboard, the ability left downward cannot be used.\nChoose wisely!\nEach turn, each player draws a card from the Energy Deck, gathering energy points for their hero. Energy management is crucial! When using their abilities the heroes consume this \u201cenergy battery\u201d, so not depleting the reserve unnecessarily is guarantee of success.\nAlso, some of the cards from this deck provide temporary enhancements to the heroes\u2019 capabilities, like powering up their attack or recovering life points. Help is always welcome!\nIn Y\u014dkai Quest two types of 6-sided special dice are used, with the icon of a Katana or a Helmet printed on their faces.\nRed die: four faces with a Katana icon and two faces with a Helmet icon.\nBlue die: four faces with a Helmet icon and two faces with a Katana icon.\nThe steps to resolve the attacks in Y\u014dkai Quest are:\nThe attacker throws the combination of dice indicated either in the basic attack or in the ability card.\nThe results with a Katana are kept.\nThe defender throws their defence combination of dice. For each Helmet result, one Katana result from the attacker is nullified.\nThe final number of Katana results obtained by the attacker is the number of wounds taken by the defender.\n  The y\u014dkai are the enemies in the game; they will be constantly spawning from settled points in random amounts, decided by drawing cards from an specific deck: the Spawn Deck.\nThis deck must be prepared before the game, following the scenario guidelines; what monsters appear will depend of these cards.\nAt the beginning of each turn, one card for each respawn point must be drawn from this deck: based on the number of heroes, the card will indicate the number of y\u014dkai that will appear!\n  In the final stage of a scenario, a powerful boss will appear. These enemies are a constant threat for the heroes and defeating them is a challenge: they will use powerful attacks, call forth more y\u014dkai to their aid, and more.\nThe action doesn't stop, be ready to make wise choices and think strategically.\nBy defeating certain amounts enemies, or by completing specific stage objectives during the game, the heroes can draw a card from the Treasure Deck.\nThese cards represent weapons to wield, armors to wear and consumables heros can use. Items cards provide improvements to the capabilities of heroes and useful consumables for the most dangerous moments during the game.\nThe scenario is the leitmotif of the game; it will indicate all the details for each stage that compose it: which board must be set, the respawn points and deck, the heroes entry point, and the conditions to pass through the different stages and achieve victory.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager, based on the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you select.\nWe have multiple international shipping hubs to help minimize your shipping and customs costs. We will ship rewards to these hubs at our costs. These hubs will then ship all rewards to backers in their region.\nCurrently we have shipping hubs for USA, European Union, Australia and Canada.

It offers several game modes: from tactical battles against other Gods, to scenarios and campaigns that\u2019ll take you on an epic adventure across the devastated ruins of Ancient Greece.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO DOWNLOAD THE RULEBOOK\n  Each God, hero, or monster possesses spectacular and unique powers. The game blends elements of drafting forces, card management, and special dice to enable skilful use of combos and player influence over chance.\nThe Titans have escaped their prison in Tartarus to wreak havoc and devastation upon the world. Seeking revenge on their jailers, they attacked the home of the Gods - Mount Olympus itself! The battle was long and closely-fought, but in the end the Gods were victorious. Even so, the battle cost them dearly.\nThe surviving Gods are greatly weakened and have lost their immortality. The only way to regain this power is to assimilate the energy stones called Omphalos. The first to absorb enough of this energy will become the new ruler of the Gods, and can create a Pantheon in their own image.\nA typical army is made up of one God and their group of fighters. Here, Athena, the Lernean Hydra, Achilles, Odysseus and a group of five hoplites. Illustration by Stefan Kopinski.\n  The Gods, monsters, and heroes of Mythic Battles: Pantheon are represented by incredibly detailed miniatures. They\u2019ll make your tabletop come alive!\nEach miniature possesses unique powers: Zeus throws lightning bolts, the Hydra regenerates, Achilles is almost invulnerable\u2026 These powers can be combined to create devastating effects. At the start of each game you choose a God, and then build a warband around them. Choose wisely!\nAfter you've chosen your God, you get a recruitment point budget to buy their followers with. This budget depends on the number of players at the table. In the more narrative campaign mode, you play with a pre-selected team of fighters that evolves from one scenario to the next.\nYour warriors fall into four different categories: Gods, Heroes, Monsters, and Troops. Each type has its own advantages, and you may build your army with any combination you like \u2013 the only restriction is the overall cost. If your God only wants Monsters to fight beside them, that\u2019s fine.\nClick the link to download the first scenario of our Hephaestus campaign.\nEverything you need to use a character in the game is written on their character dashboard.\nEach character has an individual Dashboard which lists their cost, statistics, powers, and skills. These can change as the character takes wounds.\nSTAT CLIPS\nIn order to track the changing stats of each God, Monster, and Hero, their dashboards can be fitted with specially designed stat clips. These plastic clips simply snap on to a dashboard, showing the current stats in a window. As the unit takes damage, the stat clip slides easily down the track to show the modified stats.\nThe core box comes with enough clips for all 14 dashboards, including the KS Exclusive Apollo. Clips are removable and can be swapped between dashboards if you choose.\nThe cost in recruitment points tells you how useful a character is in battle.\n  Plastic production miniatures - Zeus (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron), Ares (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Athena (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani & Aragorn Marks) & Hades (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon).\nThe Gods are the most powerful miniatures in your army. However, since having your God slain means you are out of the game, they can also spell your defeat. \nPlastic production samples\n    Plastic production miniatures - Heracles, Achilles, Leonidas (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Odysseus (sculpted by Irek Zieli\u0144ski) and Atalanta (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani).\nHeroes are often leaders, they enhance the use of troops and offer greater control over your army.\n  Plastic production miniatures - Medusa (sculpted by Aragorn Marks), Minotaur (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Cerberus (sculpted by Edgar Ramos), Hydra (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron).\nMonsters are formidable in battle, though they lack the ability to command others.\nPlastic production samples.\n    Plastic production miniatures\nUnits of Troops are represented by more than one miniature. Troops are the only kind of unit that can return to play after being destroyed.\nAll miniatures presented in this campaign will be plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nOne feature of Mythic Battles: Pantheon is the number of large miniatures included in the game. The Gods in particular are all at least 65mm (2.5 inches) tall, and some of the Monsters also tower over normal mortals.\nMythic Battles: Pantheon plays a lot on scale. The Gods are gigantic, as are some of the creatures you can recruit into your army.\nA LOT OF SPEARS\nThe universe of Mythic Battles: Pantheon, counts many a spear, sword, and other long, thin weapon among its vast armoury. To avoid all the bent weapons we so often see in other board games\u2019 PVC miniatures, we\u2019ve decided to innovate by making some of the weapons in ABS (hard plastic) instead.\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\n    Activation cards allow you to activate the illustrated unit on your turn. Art of War cards work kind of like Jokers.\nYou activate the units in your army by using the cards that make up your deck. Each unit has 3-5 Activation cards. This means that before exhausting your deck, you\u2019ll be able to activate them that many times. Particularly fast or aggressive units tend to have 5 Activation cards. More cautious or slow units only have 3.\nThe second type of cards are Art of War cards, a kind of Joker that can be spent to trigger special effects such as drawing 2 extra cards, searching your deck for a specific Activation card, activating a second unit, or using a special power. Clever use of your Art of War cards is often the key to victory.\n  Mythic Battles: Pantheon\u2019s special dice are marked 1 to 5, with one blank face\nCombat in Mythic Battles: Pantheon uses special dice. When a unit attacks, you\u2019ll roll a number of dice equal to your fighter\u2019s attack rating. Each die is read individually and needs to equal or beat the defence rating of the opposing warrior to injure them. Blank faces count as misses.\nEach 5 may be re-rolled, and the new result is added to 5. This allows you to hit enemies with a defence greater than 5.\nOn top of the re-rolls, you can discard any rolled die (except for blanks) to add +1 to the result of any other die. If, thanks to this, you obtain a 5, it can be re-rolled. Each die with a final result that is equal to or higher than the defence value of the attacked warrior inflicts 1 wound. Move the statistics clip down by one line per wound.\n  The Olympus and Styx boards, ravaged by the cataclysm. Artwork by Georges Clarenko\n  The Labyrinth and Tartarus boards, ravaged by the cataclysm. Artwork by Georges Clarenko\nMythic Battles: Pantheon is played on a series of lavishly illustrated, mounted boards (60x60cm). Each is divided into a number of areas for game play. Your miniatures are placed in one area at a time, and move from one area to the next. The symbol in each area\u2019s center tells you what type of area it is. The number in each area tells you the maximum number of units it can hold. You can place trees on a Forest area and broken columns in a Ruined area.\nThe boards are also compatible with the Conan game both in style of art and general layout. This means that owners of Conan can use the Mythic Battle boards for new scenarios.\nThere are four boards in the Mythic Battles: Pantheon core box: Olympus, Tartarus, Styx and the Minos Labyrinth.\nHere is a close-up picture of an actual Conan board. Mythic Battles: Pantheon's boards will be of the exact same quality.\nOlympus has been put to fire and sword after the battle against the Titans. This board is ideal for beginners, offers a great variety of terrains, favors movement, maneuvers and close combat. \nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\nTartarus is the prison of the Underworld. It is there that Monsters and Titans were safely locked away\u2026 until they escaped. This sinister board requires zigzagging between the giant chains and spherical metallic prison, unless you have the Climb skill - particularly valuable here.\nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\nThe antechamber of the river Styx was the place where souls prepared to embark upon their journey into the Underworld, but it is also the route through which they\u2019ve escaped, ever since Hades no longer watches over them. This board is rugged and movement isn\u2019t easy. Only the smallest units can sneak into the crevasses flooded by the Styx. This is a more complex board that favours ranged attacks.\nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\nThe palace of Minos was built above the labyrinth in which the Minotaur was imprisoned. The cataclysm caused the collapse of the palace, and this board is now composed of two levels. On the upper floor, you will have a view over the maze and can easily take on anything that moves. But there are only two ramps to access it, so controlling these can be vital.\nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\n  Here is a quick presentation of the rules by Paul Grogan:\nPlease note that this video displays dials that were used in an earlier version of the game. We changed them to the current enhanced more ergonomic dashboards.\nHere\u2019s a video of a 2-player game by Beasts of War:\n 4-player video (part 1) by Tric Trac: Explanations & set-up\n 4-player video (part 2) by Tric Trac: Beginning of the game\n  4-player video (part 3) by Tric Trac: Combat!\n  4-player video (part 4) by Tric Trac: Debriefing the battle\nCheck out our other videos on our Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeD16Wayf5GLJtyzsL6EMHA\nBased on our Conan experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), Japan (Japanese backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package that is roughly the same weight as Conan (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. \nUSA: $20-$30 to most states. $30-35 to Alaska, Hawaii & Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $20-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $18-$30 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package, there is too great a risk of the package being sent back to us.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\n  We are actually not one but two companies. Monolith is the publisher of the very successful Conan board game, who broke records when it was launched on Kickstarter and whose first wave has just been delivered to backers (everything but the 3 expansions which will arrive soon). Since Monolith's team was so busy coping with Conan's extraordinary success which meant much more work than expected, another team was gathered to work on a new project so a new company was created: Mythic Games.\nBeing prepared: it\u2019s not just for Boy Scouts. It is, in fact, one of the main lessons learned from Conan, and which has been applied to Mythic Battles: Pantheon. That preparation has taken many forms.\nThe rules are written and laid-out in a beta version accessible now. They have been played over a thousand times, so they work!\nWorld-class artists have helped to create a visual framework for the game, to help you understand the vision.\nTo help the physical production of the game work smoothly, Monolith hired an experienced production manager. She regularly visits the factory to check the status of each element in the process, just as she did with Conan. Working with the same factory, and building on existing relationships, builds greater confidence in the manufacturing process and reduces the chances of unpleasant surprises during fulfilment.\nOne direct result of this additional preparation are the grey miniatures of the core box you see on this page. They are not mock-ups, 3D prints, resins, or carefully Photoshopped 3D renders \u2013 they are the first test shots from the actual production moulds. All the miniatures from the core box are at this stage already, giving time to refine and perfect this already impressive first test.\nOn top of the people from Monolith and Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Mythic Battles: Pantheon.

To this date, over 2,500 different players in France and abroad. This is without counting the hundreds of playtests that the game has been subjected to internally. Check out a few pictures of what we called the Mythic Tour, that brought us to dozens of cities for public playtests of the game: \n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTWO COMPANIES - ONE GREAT GAME\nHindsight is always 20/20, but you can\u2019t get it in advance. Or can you? By working together with Monolith, Mythic Games has been able to draw on their experience with Conan. This has allowed Mythic Battles: Pantheon to avoid many of the pitfalls which Conan discovered the hard way.\n\nSo, Mythic Battles: Pantheon is brought to you jointly by Monolith and Mythic Games. Each company has been responsible for specific parts of the process, playing to the different strengths and experiences of the individuals involved. \n\nThe teams have also adapted their work to the different stages of game production. As with any other manufactured product, some tasks happen at the start, others later on, and some continue throughout. In our case, as tasks were completed on Conan, the attention of the relevant staff shifted to Mythic Battles to apply their experience to the new project. Even so, the core Conan team was, and remains, focussed on that game alone: their task is not yet complete so they cannot move onto new ones. \n\nAs an example of this division of responsibilities, Mythic Games took care of the game design, art direction, communication, and the Mythic Tour to gaming events across France and beyond. \n\nMonolith, on the other hand, were focussed mainly on the manufacturing end of the process. Working with the same factory, and having just finished one demanding project, they have even been able to improve on the already excellent quality of the Conan miniatures. \n\nIn the future both companies hope to produce many more games, and by focussing on quality, and learning from their mistakes, they aim to produce games that are a pleasure to own and play.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nThe estimated delivery date for Mythic Battles: Pantheon is December 2017, but please keep in mind that this is only an estimate. Also note that due to logistical restrictions in different regions, some backers may receive their pledge rewards before others. We will be doing our utmost to avoid these situations and, in the unlikely event that we are unable to deliver the game, we will be refunding pledges in full. \n\nDue to the fact that the core box of Mythic Battles: Pantheon is 95% complete as we head into this campaign, and that we have already signed agreements with many of those in charge of production, delivery and distribution, we have no reason to suspect that this eventuality will ever occur. We\u2019ve successfully delivered Conan (only the three expansions and the campaign are not delivered yet, they are in production now and the estimated delivery is March/April 2017).\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, fees included. After which, we have a policy of no questions asked for a refund, but will be unable to refund you the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe (as we will not be refunded by them after this 14 day period), Pledge Manager and also the other charges for your payment (PayPal, VISA, credit card...). This represents approximately 15% of the full payment. Once we have started to process and packed your order, when the first ship leaves China, refunds will no longer be available. If any part of an order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the cost of this component, fees included. Refunds within the 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. Any refunds requested after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in the USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8-weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf these terms are not acceptable to you, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in stores.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sho-Riu, The Dragon King stands tall on a 90mm base\n    Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress is a brand new, fully cooperative, dungeon crawl adventure board game, set in Feudal Japan, and is part of the Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 game series!\n    Players take on the role of courageous Heroes, fighting back a tide of evil creatures and demons that have invaded their world! Play as the stalwart Samurai Warrior, using your mastery of the Katana and your bushido code of honor to defeat your foes in combat, the nimble and deadly ninja Assassin, using stealth and speed as weapons, the Traveling Monk, a member of an ancient Yamabushi order devoted to fighting supernatural creatures wherever they may be found, and the powerful and mystic Sorceress, who wields Elemental Magik to crush her enemies.\n    Set in Feudal Japan, the Heroes must brave the Forbidden Fortress; a feudal castle overrun with all manner of Demons, Ghosts, and Monsters inspired by Japanese myth and legend. The massive Oni, red beast-like ogres wielding giant clubs, stalk the halls, while deadly Tengu sword masters descend from the skies with their raven wings to attack the Heroes. Legions of Samurai Dishonored Dead rise from the grave, and writhing Acidic Tentacles burst from the floor to spit acid and feed on the Heroes with their razor sharp teeth.\nBut at the heart of the fortress lie the most terrifying and epic foes of all; the Harionago, a ghostly, demonic woman, held aloft by the twisting strands of her animated hair, which is also used to entangle and slash at the Heroes with its vicious barbs, and the towering Living Statue, possessed by Darkness to break away from its posts, wreaking havoc and smashing the castle it was once built to protect!\nWe've just added a Surprise Bonus to both Sumo and Shogun Pledges!\n Game Features\nIncludes 27 beautifully detailed, multi piece hard plastic, 32mm scale game miniatures for the Heroes and Enemies, each designed with dynamic poses and detail perfect for painting.\nImmersive adventures and story driven gameplay, using the expansive and popular Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 Game Engine.\nFully Cooperative, with all of the players working together against the game itself\nDynamically generated adventures, 12 different Missions, and 4 unique Heroes with many options for customization, the game is designed for massive replayability.\nEasy to learn with simple but fun gameplay and rewarding thematic story moments as you progress your Heroes.\nBuilt-in Campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level.\nHeroes can visit a Feudal Japanese Village between mission to re-stock and re-supply before the next adventure, having a mini-adventure in town.\nDouble-sided Map Tiles include a Forbidden Fortress of Feudal Japan on one side and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld on the back side for the Heroes to explore; stepping through a shimmering portal and continuing their adventures in an alien world inside of a massive living creature.\nOver 250 game cards, a full set of beautifully illustrated, double-sided Map Tiles, a host of dice and counters, and all of the large Hero and Enemy record sheets needed to play\nIncludes a CD Soundtrack of original Music, created to set the mood while playing.\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress can be played on its own as a stand-alone game, or it can be used in combination with any and all of the other Shadows of Brimstone products already available! It is fully compatible, in every way! For new players, Forbidden Fortress will make a great introduction to the world of Shadows of Brimstone, and for veteran players, it adds a ton of new content, including two brand new Worlds to explore - the Japanese castles and temples of the Forbidden Fortress and a living world inside a massive creature in the Belly of the Beast. It also includes a brand new set of Heroes and Enemies to add to your games. With the option of starting your Heroes in Feudal Japan or the Old West, or having a mixed party of Heroes, drawn from both worlds, the possibilities are endless!\nThe Belly of the Beast OtherWorld\nForbidden Fortress also adds a brand new OtherWorld on the back side of the Map Tiles\u2026 The Belly of the Beast! Backers from the original Brimstone Kickstarter may recognize this as an OtherWorld Stretch Goal that was not unlocked during the original campaign. When we started formalizing what would be in Forbidden Fortress, the idea of adding the Belly of the Beast as the OtherWorld on the back side of the tiles was a perfect fit! What could be more in keeping with the Japanese theme than allowing the Heroes to find their way through a portal that leads inside of an unspeakably massive creature; battling all sorts of living organs and parasites, and fighting off the Flesh Mites, Acid Blobs, and Parasitic Tentacles that inhabit this \u2018living\u2019 world.\nWhat You Get in the Core Set Box\nThe Core Set for Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress includes all of the following:\n(Note that the final version of contents may vary from those shown here).\nThe Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion\nThe Temple of Shadows was once the home of an ancient and powerful order of Yamabushi monks, dedicated to battling supernatural creatures throughout the land. It was foretold that one day the Great Dragon King, Sho-Riu would return to destroy the Earth, and only they could stop him. When the meteor came from the heavens and devastated the mountain, the Dragon King came with it. For generations the monks had been training for this moment, and as Sho-Riu descended on the temple, they gathered their strength and prepared to fulfill their destiny.\nBut their victory was not to be. Reigning down death and destruction, the Dragon King broke through the monk\u2019s defenses and utterly destroyed the order, devouring their souls and bringing Darkness and shadow into the sacred temple. Those few that survived were scattered and leaderless, but they would not sit idle. Traveling the roads and countryside, the last of the monks dedicated their lives to finding new Heroes that could one day fulfill the prophecy and reclaim\u2026 the Temple of Shadows!\nBuilding on the themes from the Forbidden Fortress Core Set, the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion adds a ton of new content for the Feudal Japan setting and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld. This boxed set includes:\n4 New Hero Classes\nEnforcer \u2013 An outlaw and a gangster, the Enforcer is an anti-Hero renegade who favors brute strength and intimidation over elegant fighting weapons and technique. His tattooed body is hardened and scarred from a lifetime of brutal brawling.\nGeisha \u2013 Beautiful but deadly, the Geisha is a cunning and stealthful fighter. She employs deception and trickery to evade and confuse enemies, while slashing with her hidden blade from behind. Her comforting presence can heal the Heroes, both body and soul, to keep them in the fight.\nSoldier \u2013 The Soldier is a veteran of warfare who has seen many battles and is an expert marksman with his Rifle. Though he does not have the style or family heritage of the Samurai, he is a hardened foot soldier that has access to a variety of different weapons and training.\nKitsune \u2013 A guardian spirit, the Kitsune has come forward to defend this world against the demons and creatures that would threaten to destroy it. Taking on a human-fox form, the Kitsune uses supernatural tricks and auras to protect the Heroes, while darting between enemies to deliver killing blows with her deadly blades.\n4 New Enemy Types\nChochinobake \u2013 These demon-possessed, animated lanterns swarm the Heroes, relentlessly biting and burning them with terrifying speed.\nTakobake Warriors \u2013 Once a noble clan, the Takobake have embraced the power of the Dark Stone. Using its energy to grow in strength, they have become mutated into tentacled monstrosities, twisted and evil.\nSkin Crawlers \u2013 These large, parasitic creatures burrow through the flesh and muscle walls in the Belly of the Beast, rising up from the pools of sticky mucus to assault any Heroes foolish enough to enter into their feeding grounds.\nThe Fallen Shogun \u2013 This dreadful leader of the Takobake clan was one of the first to discover the magical properties of the Dark Stone. Weaving it into his armor, and forging it into weapons, he has gone mad with power, mutating into a giant among men! Declaring himself Shogun, he now sweeps across the land with his legions of mutated soldiers, conquering any who would stand in his way.\nNew Material for the Forbidden Fortress and Belly of the Beast\nThis expansion also features 4 new double-sided Map Tiles with new rooms for the Forbidden Fortress on one side and the Belly of the Beast on the other, 6 New Missions for the Temple of Shadows, loads of new cards and counters, and much more!\n.\nWhat You Get in the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion Box\nThe Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion includes all of the following:\n(Note that the final version of contents may vary from those shown here). Box Cover Art is Stand-in.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThere are two Kickstarter Exclusive Hero Classes created for this campaign.\nAs part of the Sumo Pledge Level, a backer will get the KS Exclusive Sumo Hero Class.\nSumo \u2013 A massive and imposing figure, the Sumo has trained all his life for unarmed battle in the wrestling ring. But when Demons and Monsters sweep across the land, he answers the call, stepping out of the ring and onto the battlefield.\nMounted on a 40mm base, the Sumo is the first ever large size Hero. He uses his weight and strength to mercilessly crush his foes, pushing enemies around the board and body slamming them with unbridled fury.\nAs part of the Shogun Pledge Level, a backer will also get the KS Exclusive Samurai Daimyo Hero Class, which also includes 3 Armored Ashigaru Foot Soldiers for him to command!\nSamurai Daimyo \u2013 A clan leader and military general, the Samurai Daimyo uses strategy and tactics to outwit and outmaneuver his opponents. As a powerful commander and trained Samurai warrior, he leads his armies into combat, for honor and glory!\nThe Samurai Daimyo starts each adventure with up to 3 Armored Ashigaru Foot Soldier Allies to command. In addition to being a skilled fighter, the Daimyo is also a natural leader, and many of his skills and abilities focus on giving bonuses to the rest of the Heroes and his Foot Soldiers\nStretch Goals\nThere are 2 types of Stretch Goals that can be unlocked during the course of this Kickstarter campaign: Sumo Level Stretch Goals (marked in Light Tan) and Shogun Level Stretch Goals (marked in Purple).\nSumo Level Pledges will receive only the Light Tan Sumo Level Stretch Goals, while Shogun Level Pledges will receive both the Light Tan Sumo Level Stretch Goals as well as all of the Purple Shogun Level Stretch Goals. \nHow To Purchase Add-Ons\nTo purchase items from the Add-Ons Menu below, simply click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button at the top of this page and increase your pledge amount to include the additional cost of the items that you\u2019d like to get. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want yet, that will happen in the Pledge Manager after the Forbidden Fortress KS Campaign has finished.\nHow Does the Game Play?\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress is a fully-cooperative, Dungeon Crawl adventure game! That means that all of the players form a Hero team (or you can play solo) and are working together against the game itself, entering the torch-lit castle gates and exploring dark courtyards and mysterious chambers within a fortress that has been overrun with creatures and demons!  The team can take on different missions from the Adventure Book, each with unique set up and victory conditions. You may be searching for a sacred artifact, stolen from the nearby temple by demons and carried off to the dark fortress, or you might be tasked with sealing off portals that unspeakable creatures are pouring out of!\n1-4 Players (or up to 6 Players if combined with the Temple of Shadows Expansion) create their Heroes by selecting a Hero Class to play, such as the Samurai Warrior or Sorceress. That Hero Class defines your basic character stats - how much Health and Sanity you have, how good you are at hitting enemies with your Katana, how good you are at solving puzzles or dodging fiendish traps, etc. It also defines your basic starting Gear - do you start with a sword, a staff, shuriken? Also, any abilities that all characters of your Hero Class share (a Samurai\u2019s \"Code of Honor\" for example). Each Hero also starts with a Random Personal Item that gives them a bit more \u2018character\u2019, and they get to choose one of three Starting Upgrades unique to their Hero Class. This gives players a chance to start guiding their Hero\u2019s development right from the outset!\nOnce your team is ready to go, the players roll (or decide) what Mission they have taken on and the game begins! Each Hero is represented by a figure on the game board and all of the figures are placed on the Fortress Entrance Map Tile to start the game. All of the Card Decks are shuffled, each Hero gets 1 Grit Token, and the Depth Track is setup with the Hero Party\u2019s marker on the entrance and the Darkness marker deep in the fortress (at the opposite end of the track).\nAt the start of each turn, the Hero with the Lantern rolls 2 dice to Hold Back the Darkness! This roll needs to be equal to or greater than the number listed on the current stage of the Depth Track. If the roll is passed, the Heroes carry on without delay. If the roll is failed, the Darkness moves one step up the track toward escaping the fortress! But beware, if the Darkness marker ever reaches the entrance space on the Depth Track, it has escaped, and the mission is failed. As an added element of danger, if the Hold Back the Darkness roll is ever doubles (1-1, 3-3, etc), this instead triggers a random event from the Depth Event Chart equal to that number!\nHeroes now take their turn in order of Initiative, with the highest going first. During a Hero\u2019s Activation, they roll a die and may move up to the amount rolled. If a 1 is rolled, the Hero also recovers an extra Grit Token. Grit Tokens are used for a number of things in game. A Grit Token may be discarded to Re-roll any number of your dice just rolled (though no die may be Re-rolled more than once), or a Grit Token may be discarded to move an extra die roll worth of spaces during your Movement. A Grit Token may also be used to activate certain powerful character abilities.\nAfter moving, the Hero may attack if there are any enemies on the board, or if they have ended their move in a space adjacent to a doorway (an open exit from the map tile you are on), you may look down the hall and draw a random Map Card to place the next Map Tile, connecting it to the doorway you are looking through. Each time a new Map Tile is placed, you must also move the Hero Party\u2019s marker one step forward on the Depth Track, as the Hero Team delves deeper into the fortress. This is important because as the Heroes go deeper underground, it becomes harder and harder to Hold Back the Darkness (the number required to roll gets higher, the deeper the Hero Party has gone).\nNewly placed Map Tiles are always either a Room or a Passage. Passage Tiles have open doorways on all ends and can often split the path in front of the Heroes. They do not, however, contain Encounters for the Heroes to deal with. Room Tiles, on the other hand, always come into play with an Exploration Token on them. As long as there is an unrevealed Exploration Token on a Map Tile, Heroes may not look through Doorways on that Map Tile (you can\u2019t explore further than that room with the unrevealed token). At the end of a full Hero Turn (after all Heroes have been Activated), if there are one or more Heroes in a Room with an Exploration Token, that token is revealed!\nWhile exploring, Heroes can find large, swirling portals that the Enemies are coming through to attack, and they can step through those gateways into a crazy alien World, continuing their adventures on the other side! All of the Map Tiles are double-sided, with the Fortress on one side and an alien OtherWorld on the back side. In Shadows of Brimstone:  Forbidden Fortress, the alien World included is the Belly of the Beast! Stepping through the portal, the Heroes find themselves inside an unfathomably large creature, exploring the living passages and inner chambers of its massive body, dripping with goo and overrun with parasites and living defenses.\nOnce the Heroes have reached their objective for the mission being played, they will often have one final Epic battle with an Enemy boss to complete the Adventure!\nBetween Adventures, the Heroes can travel back to a nearby Japanese Village to re-stock and re-supply, having a mini-Adventure in Town before setting out on the next Mission.\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress has a built in campaign system allowing the players to keep their Heroes from game to game, finding cool new Gear and Artifacts that they can use in their continuing Adventures, while gaining experience and going up in level to unlock new skills chosen from their Class-Specific Skill Tree.\nGame Miniatures\nThe Miniatures included in Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress and the Temple of Shadows Expansion are multi-part HIPS hard plastic. They come on frames and do require some assembly. We have taken great care to make the assembly in as few pieces per model as possible, while still getting a high level of detail and fantastic, dynamic poses. This also brings an aspect of Hobby to the game as many players find it fun to customize and paint their figures.\nShipping\nThis project is US, EU, Canada, UK, and Australia Friendly Shipping!\nOur intent is to ship all Pledge Rewards and Stretch Goals for this KS project as a single shipping Wave.\nHowever, all extra Add-On items (added individually beyond your Pledge Level/Stretch Goals) will be shipped separately from the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals, and will  likely ship AFTER the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals.\nExtra Add-on items are US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia Friendly. They will be packed and delivered to our distribution centers in the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia (at our expense) and then shipped to individual Backer addresses from within the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia for Backers in those regions.\nShipping and handling charges are not included in the pledge levels. We will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter ends, based on the actual costs to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards (at our cost) to our distribution centers in the US (in Washington State), Australia, UK, Canada, and the EU. Backers will then be responsible for shipping charges from the most appropriate distribution center to your address. \nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package for the Sumo and Shogun Pledge Levels.  Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals, or fluctuating carrier rates.   \nSUMO Level\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. \nAustralia: $20-30 \nEU: $15-$30 to most countries\nOther European Countries outside the EU: $40-$100 \nCanada: $15-$20 \nLatin America: $65-$75  (Mexico $65, Brazil and Argentina $75.) \nAsia: $20-$80\nAfrica: $75 to most countries.  \nSHOGUN Level\nUSA: $15-$30 to most states \nAustralia: $30-40 \nEU: $30-$45 to most countries\nOther European Countries outside the EU: $50-$120 \nCanada: $20-$35 \nLatin America: $75-$90  (Mexico $75, Brazil and Argentina $90.) \nAsia: $30-$100\nAfrica: $125 to most countries\nWhat is Shadows of Brimstone?\nShadows of Brimstone\u2122 is a fully cooperative, dungeon crawl, adventure game, set in the Old West and mashed up with unspeakable horror. First appearing as a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 was released to retail in late 2014 and has been going strong ever since.\nThe game supports 1-6 players, has a standard game time of 2-3 hours, and includes a campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level. You can also visit an Old West Frontier Town between adventures to re-stock and re-supply before setting out on your next mission, and during the game, you can find the swirling portals that the terrifying enemies are coming from, and you can step through those gateways to continue your adventures on the other side, in another dimension or alien world. The map tiles are all double-sided, with the Old West Mines on one side and an alien environment on the other side.\nOne of the main features of Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 is that all of the players work together against the game itself, and that everything is card-based and dynamically generated as you play (the encounters, enemies, board layout, etc.), meaning that the game never plays the same way twice.\nFlying Frog Productions\nFlying Frog Productions, LLC is a premier traditional game company that focuses on fun, theme-heavy, story driven board games. Their first game, Last Night on Earth\u2122, made a big splash when it launched in 2007, and since then they have released many more games such as A Touch of Evil\u2122, Fortune and Glory\u2122, and Shadows of Brimstone\u2122, as well as dozens of expansions to provide continued support for all of their game lines. You can find more information about Flying Frog Productions at www.flyingfrog.net, flyingfrogwiki.com, as well as their pages on Facebook, Twitter, and www.BoardGameGeek.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an established game company, Flying Frog Productions has been making high quality, thematic, fun games for nearly ten years! We launched our first Kickstarter Campaign in October of 2013 for the original Shadows of Brimstone, and have been through the process, working out the pipeline and navigating the hurdles. That project was enormous, with many moving parts, and logistical challenges. We have learned many lessons from that experience that will go into making this new Kickstarter project even better! The success of the first Kickstarter campaign allowed us to hire additional staff in our studio and find new manufacturing contacts who can produce higher quality miniatures and components.\n\nMiniatures \u2013 We have been producing HIPS hard plastic, multi-part figures for over 3 years now, working with several factories to refine the pipeline and process. The results are figures that keep getting better and better detail and quality, both in the tooling of the molds and the sculpting of the figures. The miniatures in Forbidden Fortress are some of our absolute best to date, and we are very excited for backers to see the level of detail on these figures.\n\nDelivery Timeline \u2013 \"Is March 2018 a realistic Delivery timeframe for this project?\"\nYes. By going through the (admittedly long) process of the first Shadows of Brimstone KS, we developed the pipeline and the tools needed to complete a project like this. Most of the rules and systems for the game are already in place, and this project is all about adding a lot of fun new content that builds on the established Game Engine.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to giving this project a faster delivery time than the original Shadows of Brimstone KS:\n- The Pledge Levels are streamlined to give only 2 variations on Rewards to be delivered, Sumo Level and Shogun Level boxes.\n- Pledge Rewards will be packed and shipped from China directly to our distribution facilities around the world in the US, Australia, Canada, UK, and EU.\n- Extra Add-ons added beyond the Pledge Rewards and Stretch Goals will be packed separately on a per backer basis. Extra Add-Ons will be shipped separately using EU, US, Canada, UK, and Australia Friendly shipping to allow backers to add extra items without slowing down the main project delivery timeline.\n- The project has been scoped to better fit the production window and estimated delivery of March 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Lotus Level", "descp": "You get an exclusive Forbidden Fortress Art Print signed by the Flying Frog Team. ***This will ship from the USA***\nINCLUDES:\nSigned Forbidden Fortress Art Print", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Sumo Level", "descp": "You get the Forbidden Fortress Core Set Boardgame, the Kickstarter-Exclusive Sumo Hero Class with Male Sumo Miniature, plus all 'Sumo Level' Stretch Goals unlocked during the Campaign. ***Shipping will be charged after the campaign ends (see Shipping section for details)***\nINCLUDES:\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress Core Set\nKS Exclusive Sumo Hero Class\nSumo Level Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["638 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Map Maker (Sumo) Level", "descp": "You get the Sumo Level plus a location on the Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress Map will be named for you, and you will receive a poster-sized art print of the Map, autographed by the Map Artist and the Creators of the game.

The fears hidden deep down in the core of the human mind is amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing the mind, body and soul. Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp.\nForesight. Illustrated by Stefan Kopi\u0144ski\n  The game is based on a series of scenarios. Each of them has its own plot, special rules, winning and losing conditions, as well as its own game board, built from room tiles. Each scenario has a limited number of game rounds. If the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed by madness.\nThe Scenario Boards with Devour Marker moving forward along the devouring track.\nAs the Devour Marker progresses, more and more room tiles are flipped to the madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators. The double-sided tile represents the 2 states of a single room. The order in which the rooms are devoured is random, and is determined by flipping the room deck. Together with the random devoured effects, the game board will have plenty of dynamic.\nDevoured Room Tiles with Spawn Marker and Devoured Effect Tokens placed on them.\nIn the game, players will assume the roles of investigators who venture into the seemingly empty but perilous deep-sea mining site to discover the truth that lies behind the lost contact event, but only to find themselves trapped in a world of horror that originates from the debris of insane consciousness. \nLinking Minds. Illustrated by Stefan Kopi\u0144ski.\nInvestigators will have health, resilience, sanity, and escape attributes, as well as irreplaceable unique abilities. Different teams generate different synergies and strategies. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate abilities, to use the effects of items, and to re-roll dice. However, they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with exhausted tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his mind by permanently flipping the exhausted tokens into madness tokens. As the madness tokens accumulate, horror will haunt the investigators by resolving Madness Cards.\nInvestigator Dashboard with Wound Token, Exhausted Tokens, and Madness Token.\nTogether as a team, investigators will have to collect vital information, deal with fatal crises, experience horrific encounters, and struggle with the nightmarish monsters controlled by the game itself.\nInvestigators: Jared Drake, Felicia Armitage, Arthur Weyland, Samuel Smith, Roman Asimov, and Randi Carter.\nSix types of monsters will appear in each game session. Their monster cards, together with the investigator cards, form the turn order sequence. In the activation phase, investigators and monsters will take turns to act alternately. Careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they have a chance to act.\nInvestigators and Monsters take turns alternately.\nMonsters in the game are highly characteristic, not just in attributes, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. They will have health, resilience, range, damage, trap, and madness attributes, and act according to their action pools. Monsters are even more powerful when they are in devoured rooms.\nMonster Cards: Hysteria, Madness Within (epic monster), and Twisted.\n  Nightmarish Core Game Monsters.\nSometimes, investigators might even have to find a way to survive the ultimate epic monsters. Although most of the epic monsters have their own themed scenarios, they can be used in every game session with the epic monster variant, which pushes the game into extremely high level of difficulty.\nUnspeakable Epic Monsters.\nAs the story takes place in a deep-sea facility, there will be submerged areas. Before investigators perform actions underwater, they have to spin the drowning dial to exhaust oxygen. When the oxygen level is too low, they will receive massive internal damage, or even die instantly. A careful plan is needed before jumping into the hazardous submerged rooms.\nRolling dice according to the drowning dial, and take wound for each non-success result. Investigator dies instantly when the dial reaches the last degree.\nThere will be a variety of items and abilities to help investigators survive the world of horror. They can be found by taking search action. The Core Game comes with 44 Search Cards in 26 different types.\nThere are four kinds of search cards: melee weapon, ranged weapon, equipment, and ability.\n  The Core Game contains 44 search cards in 26 different types.\nDuring the game, investigators will experience horrific encounters and discover the debris of the realm of consciousness, by resolving Madness Cards and Consciousness Cards, bringing more strategy, flavor and in-game elements.\nThe Core Game contains 40 madness cards. Work in progress version.\n  The Core Game contains 40 consciousness cards. Work in progress version.\nThe combat and tests are resolved by rolling dice. The special 12-sided monster die will decide some of the monsters\u2019 special abilities.\nThe Core Game contains nine 6-sided investigator dice and one 12-sided monster die.\nThe world of madness is endlessly perilous. After cooperating closely and managing to escape the nightmare, a new horrific world is awaiting.

As the game unfolds you\u2019ll be forced to make difficult decisions to stay alive as the story takes unexpected twists and turns. \nWhat is Star Saga?\nStar Saga is the successor to 2014\u2019s Dungeon Saga, praised for its simple core mechanics that provided a perfect opening for new players. Star Saga will introduce refined and more streamlined rules, and feature both \u2018learn-as-you-go\u2019 gameplay for novice adventurers and more advanced mechanics for seasoned gamers.  \nWith completely new solo gameplay and deeper narrative elements, Star Saga delivers a true RPG dungeon crawler experience\u2026 in the depths of a subterranean base on a far-off alien world!  \nFurther campaigns and expansions will utilize the full scope of science fiction settings, from space stations and starships to alien landscapes and beyond.\n     GAMEPLAY \nStar Saga uses classic dungeon crawler mechanics: players move their characters through the environment, opening doors, picking up loot, and revealing more of the board as the game progresses. Combat is resolved with a simple system of opposed dice rolls, while player statistics, abilities and special rules are all laid out on wonderfully designed game cards, allowing most players to learn the game as they play. \n\u2022 1-5 Players: Control all the Mercenaries yourself, or team-up to complete your mission co-operatively and take down the mastermind behind the facility on Eiras!\n\u2022 Solo Play: Newly developed solo play rules allow the game itself to take the role of the villain with simple card-based AI. \n\u2022 Ready to Play: Star Saga will include all the pre-assembled miniatures you\u2019ll need to start playing right away. You\u2019ll get all the necessary game cards, tiles and components for the complete dungeon crawler experience in one box. \n\u2022 Advanced Rules: Newly refined advanced rules will provide everything that the veteran-gamer needs \u2013 campaigns, experience, character creation, mission creation, and more. \n\u2022 High Quality Figures & Packaging: The core pledge includes 54 highly detailed miniatures molded from premium plastic, with thick, high-quality double-sided tiles and counters. Packaged in a vacu-formed plastic tray to hold your figures firmly in place. For an example of component quality and how this game will be packaged and presented, see The Walking Dead: All Out War box opening here.\nFor a complete rundown on rules and a gameplay video, click on the panels below:\n    MEET THE MERCS\nCaptain Erika Dulinsky: Former Captain for the Reiker Corporation. The exact circumstances of her dismissal from Reiker are unclear - her records remain classified. Whatever the case, her leadership and tactical experience put her in high demand among military freelancers, while her courage under fire make her an invaluable teammate.\nCombat Utility Robot B07153: Designed as modular support, Combat Utility Robots have limited conversational skills and are almost exclusively task-oriented. That said, behavioral \u2018quirks\u2019 have been reported among older or battle-damaged units. \u2018Curby\u2019 is one such unit.\nFrancesco \u2018The Devil\u2019 Selvaggio: Soldier-for-hire with a predilection for close combat knife-work and demolitions. Selvaggio earned his nickname, \u2018The Devil\u2019, for his part in the fire-bombing campaign that laid waste to an entire planet. \u2018The Devil\u2019 has since made his way through the universe working for anyone with the credits to pay for his services, be they rebels, corporate snatch teams, or worse.\nWrath: The only Judwan ever recorded as being capable of violence.

Conceived by Sweden's gaming powerhouse Target Games, Siege of the Citadel had television advertising in the US and hundreds of gamers still own much loved copies across the world.\nSiege of the Citadel is set in the universe of Mutant Chronicles, created by Target Games, one of the bigger names in gaming in the 1990's. Target released the DoomTrooper collectible card game and translated it into 16 languages, three boardgames, a SNES and Mega Drive DoomTrooper video game, Comic Book miniseries and graphic novel from Acclaim Comics, the massive Warzone miniatures game, the Mutant Chronicles 1st and 2nd Edition roleplaying games, a Hollywood movie, Fantasy Flight Games' pre-painted miniature game plus - of course - the rebooted Warzone miniatures game and 3rd edition roleplaying game.\nThe Mutant Chronicles story took you on this full throttle dieselpunk sci-fi ride through a solar system beset by corporate intrigue and the invasion of a terrible dark alien force. With technology failing due to the insidious effects of the Dark Symmetry humankind must fight back against the Dark Legion hordes whilst dealing with in-fighting and conspiracy from within.\nThe Solar System is a roaring mayhem of death and war. The surfaces of the inner planets have been swept clean by the violent onslaught of the dark legions storming hordes of Nepharites, Razides, Pretorian Stalkers and Undead Legionaries. In the enormous cities of the far and distant future, heretics devoted to the destruction of humankind stalk the dark backstreets and gloomy alleys spreading their teachings of greed, jealously and war!\nThe Siege of the Citadel takes place during one of the great wars against the Dark Legion as humanity musters the greatest army ever under Cardinal Durand and the DoomTroopers of the Cartel. The stage is set for the final conflict as the DoomTroopers assault Alakahi's Citadel on Venus, the greatest of the Dark Legion citadels spewing foul legions of terror across the planets of the Solar System.\nSiege of the Citadel was one of the first games to use co-operative play, a rotating Dark Legion player, plastic character boards and track character progression between games.\nHere's a mockup of the new character board which controls two heroes allied to one of the Mutant Chronicles factions: Bauhaus, Imperial, Capitol, Mishima or Cybertronic. As the team progress they get to roll better quality Attack Dice for things like Attacks and other new actions.\nPlayers select one of five factions (each with a unique Faction ability) with two figures representing a team. Four players will co-operative on the mission, whilst the fifth player takes their turn playing the Dark Legion forces arrayed against them. In the next mission, another player takes over the Dark Legion and so on.\nCharacters have 5 wounds, but their team shares Promotional Points which are now tracked in units of 10 and through Rank cards which are changed as the heroes increase in experience. Teams have secret Secondary Missions which can often be at odds with the rest of the teams in the game, and special DoomTrooper cards give momentary boosts or tactical advantages.\nAs players take it in turns to play the Dark Legion they get to control the vast Citadel of Alakhai, its defences and the terrifying creatures ready to do battle with humankind. Each turn they will summon reinforcements, play Event cards to further challenge the DoomTroopers and try to defeat their friends with forces of the Dark Legion. In a cruel twist, if the Dark Legion player does well at this role, his DoomTrooper team will benefit from a boost of experience next time they play!\nWe'll be talking about a host of new features in the game including new actions, changes to the DoomTrooper and Event Cards and more over the coming days and weeks.\nHere's the first of several playtest videos to give you more insight in to how the game plays. \n Here's a playtest video testing some of the new tech rules\n  We're shipping from local depots in the USA, Canada, EU, and Australia which means we pay any duties on shipments in to those regions, and you just pay for cheaper local shipping. We also have a Chinese depot now and and prices have been updated for this region.  \nWe're assuming the DoomTrooper pledge will be over 2kg whilst the Dark Legion pledge will be around 5-8KG depending on the Stretch Goals unlocked which is why there is a difference in shipping. \n  Please choose our Retail Pledge through the Modiphius Webstore which is for a minimum of 8 copies of the DoomTrooper or Dark Legion pledges. You will be just charged the Pledge amount of $50 as a Deposit and can increase your order anytime between the end of the Kickstarter and the shipping date. You will pay the final balance only when we are ready to ship.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing a massive boxed miniatures game is a big undertaking. Cabinet Entertainment is run by Fred Malmberg who founded Target Games and has extensive experience in producing boxed games with miniatures, whilst the Modiphius team has experience of producing the high quality Thunderbirds Co-Operative game and Airfix Battles Introductory Wargame along with several successful roleplaying kickstarters. Even with all our experience things can go wrong in the process. Production and design errors can delay the schedule, so we have built in an extra long lead time for the development of the game. \n\nModiphius has experience of running 5 Kickstarters and is used to the unpredictable delays that can happen. We have worked with Cabinet Entertainment to get as much 3d design work completed prior to the launch of the Kickstarter and we are overseeing the redesign work with Richard Borg, Kevin Wilson, Eric Lang & Jay Little. \n\nModiphius has been instrumental in rebooting the Mutant Chronicles storyline and is intimately involved in the artwork and design of the universe, as a result approvals are very fast and we do not expect delays there. \n\nWith their previous projects the combined team have shown a dedication to producing excellent quality games and we're committed to making the return of Siege of the Citadel memorable for all the right reasons. With such a complex design and production process its normal to have production problems but with our combined experience we believe we can manage this and deliver you this fantastic game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "DoomTrooper Updates", "descp": "Get live updates from DoomTrooper Command & the Cardinal himself as the Siege progresses.

A lot of games try. But there are some games that do it perfectly. Vengeance is definitely one of them.\" - Undead Viking.\nVengeance is a miniatures board game that embodies the essence of pulp revenge movies like Kill Bill, Old Boy, Django Unchained and the like. You play a hero that has been left for dead by shady underworld gangs, out to avenge yourself.\nYou win by building your hero up into an unstoppable killing machine, mowing down the villains who wronged you, bursting into their bosses\u2019 dens to lay down your vengeance upon them in action-packed fight sequences.\nOver 80 testers in Europe and the US have participated in the game's blind testing process. The following are the elements of the game testers enjoyed most:\nfights feel fluid and dynamic, like an actual fight sequence, despite their being turn based. \nbuilding a string of combos and pulling them off during fight turns. \nthe variety of strategies possible. \nthe balance of chance and strategy/puzzle solving.\nThe Vengeance core game supports 1-4 players and takes 30 minutes per player to complete. The core game includes 4 gangs: Zuce Clan, Lordz, Tengu-Kai and the Hell Riders. The Rosari Gang Pack expansion adds a new gang, a new hero and the necessary components to take the maximum number of players to 5.\nHave a look at the quick guide here to get an idea of how the game works or read through the main rulebook here. You may also download the print-and-play files and give the game a spin here. \n Vengeance will include rules in French, Spanish and German available for download in .pdf format soon after the campaign ends.   \n        The core game comes with 80 highly detailed miniatures sculpted by Slawek Kosciukiewicz from Titan Forge. The Rosari Gang Pack adds another 10 miniatures.\n            Our primary social media channels are the following:\nBoard Game Geek | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram \nAt the start of the campaign we had a total of 537 fans/likes/followers there. As this total increases we'll unlock more game goodies through the social stretch goals listed above.\n  Rahdo Runs Through Review:\n    Undead Viking's Review:\n \"Action-packed, strategy focused, multiplayer experience, with a punch and a lot of bad guys! Had a lot of fun playing it. Highly recommendable.\" - Phray Dilla, tester.\n\"I love the cinematic action in the game, makes you feel like a character in a Tarantino movie or a Frank Miller comic. The adrenaline kicks in with the first roll of dice.\" - FrancoisZ, tester. \nTo buy the add-ons, all you need to do is to increase your pledge by the cost of all the add-ons you want. To do this:\nPress the \"Manage\" button next to your pledge on the Kickstarter project page. If you have not pledged yet, it will say \"Back this Project\".\nClick on \u201cChange Your Pledge\u201d. \nIncrease your pledge in the \"Pledge Amount\" box by the sum of all add-ons you want to order. \nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends you will receive a link to the project's Pledge Manager. \nWithin that page you will then be able to select the specific add-ons and quantities you want.\nYou will also be able to purchase other items there (games, expansions and add-ons) using paypal. \nNote: Upon campaign end Kickstarter pledges are final and can neither be fully or partially reimbursed through the Pledge Manager.\nThe game alternates between Montage and Fight turns. In Montage turns you heal and upgrade your hero with new abilities and items. You also scout gang dens to find the bosses who wronged you and take revenge in the Fight turn. This is done through a combination of a pooled dice draft combined with a selection of possible Montage actions unique to each hero. \nThe Fight turn is the heart of the game. Pick a gang den containing a boss you have beef with and burst in to exact bloody revenge. You gain VPs for killing the boss, clearing the den from all the minions or both for maximum points.\nFights are basically dice-based puzzles. In each round of the Fight you roll a set of dice and decide the order in which to play them. Upgrade skills and items allow you to swap die-results or string them together to perform enemy-slapping combos giving you more control over their fight actions. \n  Postage and packing will be calculated at the end of the campaign. It will vary depending on the number of stretch goals unlocked, their volume and weight as well as the number of backers from various regions.  Here are the current estimates: \n    Gordon Calleja is the designer of Vengeance and Posthuman. Gordon is also a video game designer and has done the game design for Will Love Tear Us Apart and Posthuman: Sanctuary.  He is also a game researcher and has written a book about game immersion.  \nAxel Torvenius is the lead artist on Vengeance.  He works in the video game industry and was concept artist on games such as: Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, Wolfenstein: New Order, Syndicate, Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness.\nSlawek Kosciukiewicz is the miniature sculptor for Vengeance and Lobotomy along with a long line of miniatures from Titan Forge.\nFabrizio Cali is an illustrator, 3D modeller and animator.  He worked on illustration, graphic design and video assets for Posthuman and Will Love Tear Us Apart. He is the hand behind Vengeance's den illustrations and the Kickstarter video creation and editing.\nDavid Chircop is the lead developer on Vengeance.

These guys were a huge help in the six months of blind testing the game went through. A heartfelt thanks goes to all of them and the 80+ testers they recruited and managed to make Vengeance the great game it is! \nVengeance received funding from the Malta Arts Council.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVengeance has already been developed in full and tested by a pool of over 80 testers around the world. Note that most of the stretch goals we have lined up have also been tested during this process. After this campaign finishes we will, however, be doing more blind testing to ensure clarity of communication in the rulebook and the game's graphic design. \n\nThen we will be preparing the final artwork for submission to the manufacturers. Most of this is done, except for some stretch goals we have prepared for the campaign. The whole team is very experienced in this process already so there is minimal risk in this part of the project completion.\n\nThe next step is manufacturing. We have been in contact with a number of manufacturers and we have selected three who are able to produce the game to our highest quality expectations. We have learned a lot through our first game, Posthuman and we are applying all the lessons learned in order to select the best and most reliable supplier of these. Titan Forge will be assisting with the manufacturing process of the miniatures. Having said this we are giving extra care to miniature production as it is the only part of the process we do not have direct in-house experience in.\n\nWe are also in contact with some of the most highly recommended shipping services in order to ensure a smooth process until the game reaches your doorstep.\n\nHaving said all of this, there may be some unforeseen circumstances beyond our control which may affect our meticulous plans. In that case we can assure you that we will do everything in our capacity to get the process back on track.

Our crazy powerful Gen Con promo card into the Kickstarter version only. This won't be in the retail box but it will be available from the Board Game Geek store. This is only for special occasions - use with caution!\nThat's where we got to in 30 thrilling days of our Unfair kickstarter campaign. You backers have been wonderful. Thank you all. We owe you the best game we can make for you now.\n  We pre-pack Unfair in a robust mailer box at the factory, and use quality fulfillment companies in each region to keep shipping costs as low as possible so you can back more games! USD$15 for shipping is included in the core pledge tier, and backers in some regions will need to pay additional fees as follows:\n  Unfair is the beautiful & lovingly cynical brainchild of talented new designer Joel Finch. It's literally a 5 year labour of love, designed so that he could finally play a game he truly loves with his wife Kate. The result? An accessible, inclusive, flexible, deep, re-playable and fun game we are excited to release as our second game.\nPacked with beautiful art by Mr Cuddington and Phillipe Poirier, Unfair will take you back to theme park days under bright blue skies where everything was awesome. But dig a little deeper and you'll discover that running a competitive theme park requires some tough choices. Every layer of the game is detailed, thematic and constantly surprising, from the name of cards, to their incredible art, card abilities and even flavour text.\nUnfair is a rich gaming experience, as fun or ruthless as you make it. We think you will keep finding more in it, play after play. And with your help, there is more to come.\nView the high quality PnP files & Rules.\nWe have the rules, the design, the art for the four initial themes already done - so why do we need Kickstarter?\nFirst, we want many gamer eyeballs on Unfair, before it's released, while we can still fix any problems. Retail distribution is very one-way, whereas with Kickstarter we can hear from players while your feedback can make a difference.\nSecond, while four themes is enough to play the game exactly as intended, additional themes would add variety. We have two more theme packs tested and ready to reveal as stretch goals. We want to include them in the main game but we need your support to do that.\nWe also use Kickstarter to recoup the cost of deluxe art and component quality for the games we make. So it gives you a richer game experience for your money, helps us gauge interest in our games, provides global marketing for them, and helps them sell better in retail eventually.\n\nIn short, with your help through Kickstarter, we can make games more awesome.\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe limit risks by offering a limited number of stretch goals we would otherwise include in later expansions in Unfair. This way we can complete production by October, have games to you in Nov / Dec, and be in stores by Christmas.\n\nWe have run a kickstarter campaign for Monstrous before. People loved the production quality but we delivered later than promised and learned some lessons. This time we will be better. \n\nAs with Monstrous, we printed a 50 copy pre-production print run to check the manufacturing quality of the game. People who played at Gen Con 2016 were delighted with our component quality. However, we have decided to upgrade the reference boards and playing card stock. And to insist on sharpened blades for card cutting.\n\nOur artists have proven very reliable and we have confirmed they can complete the listed stretch goal card illustrations by the end of this campaign, and we won't be pushing them beyond that.\n\nRules are complete and ready to print now. \n\nBackers' games will be pre-boxed in shipping boxes at the point of manufacture for faster and more consistent shipping. They will feature internal corner protectors to reduce risk of corner damage caused by dropped boxes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "A token gesture", "descp": "Roll up, roll up!

Till the sky falls, and all things are flawless and need no words at all.\"\n\u2014Tanith Lee (September 19, 1947 \u2013 May 24, 2015)\nSUMMARY\nHath No Fury is a collection of fantasy, science fiction, and urban fantasy tales by some of the leading proponents of female characters in the industry. These stories feature leads inspired by women from literature, history, and film\u2014exciting and intriguing characters in the vein of Ellen Ripley, Lara Croft, Joan of Arc, Marvel\u2019s Black Widow, La Femme Nikita, Katniss Everdeen, Hermione Granger, and Furiosa. \nDESCRIPTION\nMother. Warrior. Caregiver. \nWife. Lover. Survivor. \nTrickster. Heroine. Leader.   \nHath No Fury contains approximately 19 meaningful stories that defy the stereotypes. In this anthology, readers should expect to find super-smart, purpose-driven, ultra-confident heroines. Here, it\u2019s not the hero who does all the action while the heroine smiles and bats her eyelashes; Hath No Fury\u2019s women are champions, not princesses in distress. Embracing the strong warriors to the silent but powerful, to even the timid who muster up the bravery to face down a terrible evil, the women of Hath No Fury will make their indelible marks and leave you breathless for more.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe introduction for Hath No Fury will be written by none other than the great Margaret Weis, who has influenced more than her fair share of female authors and has done great work for women in the publishing and gaming worlds. \nEDITORS\nHath No Fury will be co-edited by Melanie R. Meadors (science fiction and fantasy author, blogger at The Once and Future Podcast, and Publicity/Marketing Director for RAGNAROK PUBLICATIONS and Mechanical Muse) and J.M. Martin (editor of the best-selling, award-winning Blackguards: Tales of Assassins, Mercenaries, and Rogues, owner and Creative Manager of RAGNAROK PUBLICATIONS). Both have extensive experience working in fiction and publishing, and have worked on many successful fiction Kickstarters, including Kaiju Rising: Age of Monsters; Blackguards: Tales of Assassins, Mercenaries, and Rogues; Genius Loci; and MECH: Age of Steel.\nCOVER ART\nHave a look at the awesome cover (art by Manuel Casta\u00f1\u00f3n and design by Shawn T.

They know what we have. And yeah, there have been problems. There are always going to be problems when something familiar goes scarce, turns from common coal into dearest gold. Hell, we saw it happen with coal and gold themselves, when Kentucky burned, when all the gold in the world stopped being enough to buy an extra drink of water.\n\nThey use gold in bee-shrines these days, decorate their plaster honeycomb with chains and coins and pray that somehow, their schoolyard alchemy will undo what man has done. Will turn the honey in the air into honey on the tongue; will bring back the bees. Oh, how they yearn for the bees. What once they swatted without thought has become a symbol of a better time, a better world, a better life for them and everyone that they care about. So we roll down the road like a traveling fortress, ever watching the hills around us, ever waiting for the attack.\n\nThis is the honeycomb structure of our hive:  \n\nAt the front, the bikes, four of them, two riding point and two hanging back just enough to form a blunted V-shape. They clear the road for us, keeping things rolling smooth. Any one of them can call off the ride if they feel like things are going sour, and any one of them would die to keep that from happening. They know how important what we do is to the survival of the state, to the souls of the people who watch us from the hills as we roll by, gold chains in their hands and honey in their hearts.\n\nBehind the bikes, the three advance cars, all pre-Burn, all kitted to run on whatever we grind and stuff into their tanks, all tough enough to take a direct missile hit and keep on racing the horizon. When we get closer to the fields the bikes will fall back and the cars will move forward, trading places in a dance that we have long since choreographed to perfection. While each bike has a single rider, each car carries two: one to hold the wheel and one to hold the gun. The lead car\u2019s gunner, Poppy, has been making this run for fifteen years. She wasn\u2019t in the first convoy, but she was in the second, and she has a bee tattooed on her left arm for every person she\u2019s killed in the process of getting the bees to the fields. When she takes her shirt off, it looks like a swarm taking flight, swirling endless toward the sky. When she puts her arms around me, it\u2019s like being in the heart of the hive.\n\nThe ink on her latest tattoo was still fresh and weeping when we loaded up for this trip. She\u2019s running short on skin that hasn\u2019t been striped black and gold and bitter with another life lost; she\u2019s said, several times, that she hopes she can make it just one run without adding to her arm. So do the rest of us. We\u2019ve always been hoping for that sort of peace.\n\nFrom Carol Berg's \"Book of Rowe\":\n\n\u201cWhat does he do in there? What is dancing with the dead?\u201d\n\nThe pulse in Merton\u2019s hand raced. I had him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you as we ride north. Tonight is for history and Navronne. You are willing to risk your future for me. I am doing the same.\u201d\n\nThe fortress bells rang midnight.\n\nAs I touched the brass latch of the garden door, Merton\u2019s wet cloak rustled behind me. His hand returned to my shoulder, heavier this time. The smell of honed steel was not my imagination.\n\nI pushed the door open. Dark and rain greeted us. They smelled of wet pine bark, of dry rosemary and rue, scents wakened by the moisture. A slender form, gray against the blackness, stood alone across the small courtyard. He\u2019d grown taller. Eighteen now. A man.\n\nI tried not to feel, not to see what my old playmate brought with him. But the shadows behind him squirmed and slid across the stone . . . extended fingers into the deeper darks in the corners of the little garden . . . twisted despair, sorrow, and magic into shapes that tainted the soul.\n\n\u201cAh, Saverian, you said we were to be alone.\u201d\n\nOsriel\u2019s cold anger shrouded mind and limb, crushing me to the ground. Surely my plan had fallen to ruin. He blamed me . . . \n\nA cloaked figure rushed from behind me, poisonous magic crackling from sword and hand\u2014Merton. But not alone. Others rushed behind him. Boots stepped on my hair, trampled my hand. Steel crashed on steel.\n\nI threw my arms over my head. This was wrong. My father said he\u2019d come. [Removed due to spoiler] should have been captive in moments. Too late, I recalled the journal mention\u2014my five, who could shelter in the ruined tower. Idiot girl. I\u2019d not imagined he had five comrades with him already.\n\nThuds, grunts, and clashes broke out on every side. A man screamed. Another moaned.\n\nI wrested my dagger from its sheath and lunged upward. Blazing orange light outlined battling duels and fallen bodies. Red fire gleamed from demonic eyes [removed due to spoiler], overpowering an opponent. I planted my dagger in a dark-clad thug who was choking a man in fortress livery...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe went through the bulk of our growing pains during the production phase of a previous crowdfunded campaign, so we have contacts, accounts, and resources in place now to make a smooth transition from funding to fulfillment\u2014that means a much smaller delay in getting the book in your hands.\n\nThe only setbacks I foresee on my end would be unexpected health issues or some unforeseen act of theft or disaster.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Order prevailed once. Quiet for so long, the Night is coming again. Can The Order regain its former strength and push back the tide of evil? \nVampire Hunters is a co-operative miniature-based board game for 1-4 players, expandable to 5-6 players. It brings the dark imagery of Vampire lore to your tabletop, as you play a newly recruited Vampire Hunter. Thrown into the Vampire den with a small band of comrades, use classic weapons like stakes, holy water and sunlight to destroy the creatures of the Night. Team up and make combination attacks. Craft makeshift items in the Den and buy quality equipment between Hunts. Learn new skills to take down these vile creatures.\nBut watch the clock: at sundown, you become the prey!\nVampire Hunters is defined by thematic, innovative and fast game mechanics that guarantee a unique and fun gaming experience. Sundown and the Awakening completely change the dynamics of the game. Many optional game modes ensure the game will always be fresh.\nGood Hunting!\n   We have released details of our translation plans, check our Translation Update! Click here.\n                              Hello new Hunters. There is a lot of catching up to do! Starting with the front page, you\u2019ll find an overview of the game, links to the beta rule book, how to play, game play and review videos and a list of stretch goals.\nPlease look at the two pledge levels carefully and select the one that is best for you. If it helps, Slayer is the best value sweet spot.\nThe Optional Buy banners are all on the front page too. Some, like dice, enhance the game without adding game play. Others, like the Nyx and Brith miniatures give you new options in the game. They are all optional and Vampire Hunters is a great game without them. None are required to play VH.\nAs well as all the information on the front page, there are many important updates. Here are summaries and links to help you find the information you need.\nWe will have a flexible Pledge Manager after the project closes. There are several questions about it in the FAQ and there is more information in an update.\nVampire Hunters is a 1-4 Player game. We have an Optional Buy that extends VH to a 1-6 Player game. This expansion adds a great deal of material and is showcased in this update.\nThere are several updates with details of game play. Optional Turned Hunter rules are described here and an alternative to co-op play, Competitive Mode, is described here.\nWe also have an in-depth look at the Hunts and Campaigns and the Final Battle. There are 12 Hunts linked into 2 Campaigns in Vampire Hunters and 6 Hunts with 1 more Campaign in From Blood To Dust.\nOur German, French, Spanish and Italian translation plans are described here.\nWe had a multi-part Stretch Goal to give all backers a complete miniature-based expansion, Swarms. You can read about the Mist, Bats and Rats here.\nWe have had two updates where you can suggest ideas for the game: Weapons and Special Abilities. Have some fun and get your name in the rulebook!\nIf you have more questions, check the FAQ and ask our backers. They are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic.\nSince the dawn of time, Day has given us life, but Night gives us something else entirely\u2026\nLost in History\nThese secretive and foul creatures first crept into the world centuries ago. Their lust for blood was unappeasable as they spread their trail of death. People called them the Night.\nChurches around the world trained small bands of knights and monks to combat this evil. The Order grew from one such band, with Hunters passing their agile and deadly skills from generation to generation, always keeping the faith. Even when the Night creatures gained ascendancy, the Hunters were strong of mind and did not buckle. For hundreds of years, they fought until the creatures became fewer and then vanished completely. Some believed it was the final victory; others said it was just a much needed rest before the Night returned.\nBut there was safety for now. Over the years, the memory of The Order and its brave men and women began to fade, becoming tales of Vampires for scaring naughty children.\nThe Return \nPeace can only last so long, the Night is back again, a malevolent force spreading through the empty and unwatched backwaters of the globe. The Elders are reviving the Night creatures and Vampires are adding victims to the body count \u2026 or to their ranks.\nVague memories of The Order exist in the memories of a few descendants. Can The Order regain its former strength and push back the tide of evil?\n  At its heart, Vampire Hunters is a thematic 1-4 player co-operative game. A second game mode and optional rules can be combined to enhance and customise your experience! Make Vampire Hunters the perfect game for your tabletop group.\nCo-operative Mode: You play as the team of Hunters and the Vampires are controlled by the game\u2019s activation cards. There are no rule changes for solo play, just choose how many Hunters you want to control.\nCompetitive Mode: There is one change here, a scoring system to find the best Hunter. Rate your Hunters to see who is pulling the most weight!\nCampaigns: Play stand alone or link your Hunts in an extended campaign. Manage the team\u2019s abilities and equipment as you get ready to defeat the Vampire Lord.\nNight is a core theme in Vampire lore and has a profound effect on Vampire Hunters. Hunters enter the Den during the Day, when Vampires are sleeping. Hunters move freely and attack at an advantage. It\u2019s best to be quiet, one wrong move and you can wake up a room full of Vampires! But round by round time ticks on until sundown and The Awakening. All Vampires are immediately revealed, they all wake up and all doors are opened. Some Vampires even have better stats at night! Get ready for a blood bath!\nThe Sun is a powerful ally! Burn vampires during the day by tearing down the boarded up windows. All Vampires in the room will be scorched to death! \n Or harpoon a creature on the Extractor and call Pete to drag the Vampire outside.\nIf you\u2019re a Vampire Hunter, you know you\u2019re going to be attacking Vampires! Rules for attacking are fast and furious. Make one unopposed roll, you\u2019ll be hunting Vampires, not hunting for dice and tables. But there are many variations, one time use weapons, fragile weapons crafted on the fly, area of effect weapons, noisy weapons, so \u2018fast and furious\u2019 does not mean dull and repetitive. Vampires attack using the same system, so there\u2019s just one system to learn.\nIs that Vampire too tough for you to take down alone? Team up in a combination attack for extra damage \u2026 but watch out! If you don\u2019t destroy the Vampire, you\u2019ll take a beating.\nWe have optional rules for playing as a Turned Hunter. You start playing normally as Hunters, but instead of being unconscious on the floor when your health points reach zero, you turn into a Vampire and play on. This rule can be added to both Co-operative and Competitive Modes.\nAs Hunts take you into more and more dangerous Dens, you\u2019ll need better gear. You might find useful items buried in trash heaps around the Den, but it\u2019s more effective to buy equipment and train for new special abilities between Hunts. Think carefully about what you buy. Money spent on abilities benefits you alone, but you can trade your equipment with your teammates to boost everyone as the situation changes. Plan carefully, inventory space is limited.\nHunters must maintain their focus or they will be Vampire bait. As Hunters perform various actions, their focus increases. There are little reminders on the game components to take your Focus rewards. During the game, you can spend Focus on crafting, buffing your attacks and activating special abilities or save for the downtime between Hunts and buy better equipment and training.\nClick on this button to download the full BETA rule book.\n   Click on this button to download one of our Play Test scenarios:\n\n  We know some of you prefer videos over rule books as a way to learn about the game.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Massive Darkness is a dungeon crawling board game for 1 to 6 players. With no game master and streamlined rules, players take their heroes on a series of quests to defeat the forces of Darkness. On their way they'll face many challenges, including a large variety of enemies that range from mobs of evil dwarves to gargantuan demons and spiders. To be victorious, heroes will need to acquire new skills throughout the campaign, find the the best loot to equip themselves, and learn how to use the cover of darkness to their advantage!\nHere's everything that's been unlocked for all backers: \nAnd everything you can add to your pledge:\nFollow these links to learn more about Elementals / Ratlings / Reptisaurians, Troglodytes / Warrior Priests vs The Spearmaiden Cyclops / Bloodmoon Assassins vs The Hellephant / Black Plague Crossover Set / Marble Dice Set / Frost Dice Set / Plastic Token Pack / Doors & Bridges / Chests & Pillars / Tiles Set.\nThe Darkness that had been vanquished long ago is rallying all manner of wicked creatures to its cause. The legendary Lightbringers who once stood against it are no more, and so it is up to a handful of untested heroes to gather their courage and venture into the dungeons to uncover the Darkness' plans, and stop them before it can spread throughout the land!\nThe Heroes: Sibyl the elf ranger, Bjorn the barbarian, Siegfried the dwarf berserker, Elias the wizard, Whisper the rogue, and Owen the paladin.\n  The heroes in Massive Darkness are represented by incredibly detailed miniatures, bringing classic RPG archetypes into the adventure.\nWhether venturing into the darkness on your own, or as a group of up to 6 companions, each of the heroes brings something different to the game. They each possess a couple of special skills that may guide their strategy in the campaign. Exploring the dungeon and killing enemies will also grant them amazing loot in the form of weapons, armor, and magic items, giving them lots of different gameplay options as they advance on each quest.\nEach hero has an amazing plastic dashboard to keep their Inventory organized, as well as track their Health and Experience Points.\nHeroes are not limited to their natural starting skills, though. At the start of a campaign, players decide what class they want their hero to belong to, represented by a Class Sheet. Your hero's class will present you with a multitude of skill options to acquire throughout the campaign. The XP gained from defeating enemies can be used in the middle of a quest to purchase new skills, opening up new gameplay options for your hero, or it can be spent to immediately execute your class' powerful Signature move. By the end of the campaign, your hero should be able to accomplish amazing feats with all the skills they've amassed!\nShadow Barbarian, Bloodmoon Nightrunner, Pit Fighter Berserker, Nightshade Ranger, Paladin of Fury, or Battle Wizard. Each Class offers a myriad skill possibilities for you to unlock quest after quest.\nHowever, acquired skills can only be used once players reach their indicated level in the current quest. That means Massive Darkness offers an exciting skill progression not only throughout the overarching campaign, but also self-contained in each game session.\nThe Forces of Darkness come in all shapes and sizes!\nMassive Darkness pits a host of varied enemies against the heroes. As you delve deep into the dark, you'll encounter challenges in varied numbers, varied sizes, and varied strength and abilities. Enemies may spawn in several different ways: They may be lurking inside a room the heroes explore, they may pounce on the heroes as a surprise ambush, they may be patrolling the corridors ahead, or they may be called as reinforcements by an Agent.\nAll enemies' behavior is controlled by simple game rules. On the Enemies' Phase, they all move to try and attack the hero with the most XP. Depending on whether their main attack is Melee, Ranged or Magic, they each move in a different way, and then attack the most experienced hero they are able to.\nEnemy miniatures: Orcs, Goblins and Dwarves come in many variations of Agents, Bosses, and Minions.\nThere are several types of enemies lurking in the darkness. The most common are Mobs: Led by a Boss, several Minions move together to try and overwhelm the heroes (their numbers varying according to the number of players). Players will need to mow down all Minions before they're able to defeat the Boss itself. There are also Agents, these lone enemies are a respectable threat by themselves, but they will also call for reinforcements round after round unless they're eliminated.\nAnd then there are the Roaming Monsters! These gargantuan foes may spawn in levels far ahead of what the heroes currently are, and will require teamwork to be brought down (or it's no shame to try and hide from them).\nThe Roaming Monster figures can hardly be called \"miniatures\" (Owen for scale reference).\nBosses, Agents, and Roaming Monsters, all come carrying a random piece of treasure, one level higher than themselves. That means generally the best loot in the game won't be found inside a dusty chest, but in the hands of your foes. But don't think your enemies just carry this treasure for your benefit. If a weapon matches the kind of attack that enemy is able to perform, they will get all of the weapon's bonuses on their attacks! That means the same kind of enemy can present a host of different challenges depending on the treasures they are equipped with.\nThe Goblin Archer Boss gets the bonus dice from the Composite Bow it carries, but the Liliarch gets no benefit from a magic weapon such as the Orb of Darklight.\nAll combat in Massive Darkness is resolved with a single dice roll. There are two levels of Attack dice and two levels of Defense dice. Players add the attacker's dice and defender's dice together (taking into account any extras from equipment or skills) and make a single roll, quickly determining the outcome of the combat. Both the attacker and defender may possess special enchantments that will be triggered if their dice roll special symbols.\nAttack and Defense dice.\n  A couple tiles showing light and dark zones.\nThe tiles that make up the dungeons present zones illuminated by torches, and other zones that are shrouded in darkness. This offers some strategic possibilities the heroes will be wise to take advantage of. When not seen by any enemy, a hero may spend an action to enter Shadow Mode. While in Shadow Mode, heroes cannot be seen or attacked, as long as they are in a dark zone. Enemies will ignore them unless they happen to bump right into them. The hidden hero can plan in order to attack from a dark zone, causing the oblivious target to lose some defense. Players can also try to control where the enemies move to, since heroes in Shadow Mode are ignored when determining the enemies' primary target.\nSibyl the elf evades the Goblin Archers patrol by hiding in the shadows. They'll never see her arrows coming!\nThe Massive Darkness core box comes with:\n75 highly detailed figures, including:\n  6 Hero figures\n  63 Enemy figures\n  6 large Roaming Monster figures \n6 plastic Hero dashboards \n6 color plastic bases \n12 color plastic pegs \n12 custom dice \n9 double-sided game tiles \n280 cards \n6 Class Sheet pads \n111 tokens \nRulebook \n  Lightbringer Pledge - $120\nThe Lightbringer Pledge gives you a Massive Darkness core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Roaming Monster Cyclops Cliffbreaker, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nThe Cliffbreaker Cyclops is a towering behemoth that should cause any sane hero to run for cover. Not even the strongest magic armor can withstand the massive boulders thrown by this giant. Heroes simply don't get to roll any Defense dice against its devastating attacks!\nThe imposing Cliffbreaker Cyclops figure (next to Whisper, for scale).\n  Note that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nAll of the miniatures in this campaign will be in plastic, and come pre-assembled and unpainted.\nCMON gathered its bravest party of adventurers and they ventured into the darkness to record a gameplay video for you.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\n                                                                                                          Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. $15-$30 to most other countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 24th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2017, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage and B-Sieged. The 2nd wave of Zombicide: Black Plague is almost finished with delivery.\n\nWe have five ongoing projects currently: The Others which is about to ship to the distribution hubs, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, XenoShyft: Dreadmire, Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, and Rum & Bones: Second Tide, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Massive Darkness.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

It would seem the factory ended up printing the colored symbol on top of the solid black color, so it became very hard to make out properly.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game is a strategically challenging, deeply immersive combat exploration game for 1-4 players set in the Dark Souls\u2122 universe. Players choose from a number of core character classes and explore dangerous locations full of monsters, treasures, and deadly boss fights.\nDesigned specifically for the Dark Souls\u2122 universe and introducing a number of innovative gameplay mechanics, with world-class miniatures faithful to the rich universe, this game delivers an experience that captures the very essence of the original video games.\nClick here for Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game 101\nWe don\u2019t like complicated Kickstarters, so we\u2019ve made this one as simple as possible. There is just one pledge level for gamers, and one pledge for retail stores.\nAs the campaign progresses, some stretch goals will unlock an \u2018Add-On\u2019 which is an optional item to purchase; to buy one of these, simply increase your pledge amount. This also drives the campaign total up thereby unlocking even more stuff!\nThe best bit is that every 'non Add-On' stretch goal that gets unlocked during the campaign will be included in your pledge! So the more people that support the project, the more goals get unlocked, the more value we can squeeze in, and the bigger the box we're going to need!\nRead the FAQ Here\nClick here to read the first AMA with Mat Hart, one of the Game's Designers.\nClick here to read the second AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the third AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the Reddit AMA with Mat & Rich\nClick here to read the fourth AMA with Richard Loxam\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game is much more than a classic dungeon crawler. Just like the Dark Souls\u2122 video games, this is a game that requires strategic thinking, clever planning, and exemplary execution to succeed.\nDragon Slayer Ornstein & Executioner Smough\nTo triumph, players must explore dangerous locations, discover and defeat enemies, and collect equipment and treasures before ultimately facing the boss in an epic fight to the death.\nThe Player Characters - Knight, Warrior, Herald & Assassin\nPlayable in either Solo or Co-op modes, players choose their role from a number of core Dark Souls\u2122 character classes. Each class has a distinct role to play in the game, with a unique set of strengths and abilities.\nWith multiple difficulty modes and a high-level of replayability, this is a game designed to be deep enough to satisfy hard-core tabletop gamers whilst remaining accessible to newer players.\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game features an exciting \"fast setup, long reveal\" mechanic that gets you into the game faster and builds the location and encounters as you explore.\nWith no fixed scenario layouts, it\u2019s as simple as choosing the direction to explore, placing a new tile down and flipping a card from the Encounter deck.\nEach time you decide where to go, you will experience a new danger as you explore, with each new location a real risk to your hard-won progress. If you die, then you drop everything you have collected and reappear at the nearest bonfire. So do you return to the bonfire to rest and spend Souls to strengthen up, but in doing so fully reset the locations? Or do you press on and pray that the next encounter isn\u2019t beyond your capabilities? After all, the next location may contain a clue to the Boss and how to defeat them\u2026\nCombat is both fast and deadly. Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game rewards clever players and punishes \u2018button mashing\u2019. Players must learn enemy behaviors in order to fight more effectively, with classic fighting game style combat windows. \nThe Titanite Demon mini-boss\nThe game features a \u201cdynamic positioning system\u201d which makes combat fluid and ever-changing. With the game state constantly shifting as combatants move around the battlefield, players must stay alert to danger and opportunities. \nEquipment, armour, and weapons are discovered or earned during play, but with limited slots players must think carefully about what is best to keep and use. Using a simple stamina management system, players can potentially leave themselves exhausted and vulnerable. Death is usually swift to follow a poor decision in combat.\nThe Dancer of the Boreal Valley boss accompanied by a group of Hollow\nUsing our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working with one of the finest board game manufacturers in the world, the quality and detail in the miniatures is world-class. With the entirety of the Dark Souls\u2122 universe available to use, one of the hardest decisions has been to narrow down which enemies and bosses to include in the core game.\nThe Gargoyle mini-boss\nThe Core Game contains:\n3 Boss Models\n5 Mini-Boss Models\n4 Player Character Models\n4 Large Grunt Models\n12 Grunt Models\n7 Double Sided Game Tiles\n2 Double Sided Mini-Boss/Boss Tiles\n4 Player Character Boards\n3 Boss Dials for Tracking Damage\n60 Equipment Cards\n40 Treasure Cards\n26 Boss AI Cards\n36 Encounter Cards\n15 Coloured Dice\n100+ Game Tokens\nPrepare to Die...\nCheck out the prototype Boss Fight versus the Dancer of the Boreal Valley and people's reactions to it...\nAdd-Ons will unlock as the campaign progresses. To purchase these Add-Ons simply increase your pledge amount by the amount stated. After the Kickstarter campaign ends you will then be able to select your options via our pledge management system.\nThe Mega Boss Expansions (+\u00a328) are additional purchases you can make to enhance your board game experience. These models are big - the Gaping Dragon is around 12-15cm tall! They also come with additional items to support their gameplay:\nA Tileset for the Mega Boss Encounter (vary in quantity dependent on the boss)\n1 Boss Dial for tracking damage\nA Unique Mega Boss AI Deck that fully replicates their movements and attacks within the actual game itself\nSpecific Mega Boss Treasure Cards\nThe Gaping Dragon\nBlack Dragon Kalameet\nThe Guardian Dragon\nThe Four Kings (4 Models Included)\nThe Darkroot Basin Expansion (+\u00a335) brings some iconic characters to the game including Sif, the Great Grey Wolf. This expansion comes with:\n2 Boss Models (Sif & Artorias)\n7 Large Grunt Models\n7 Grunt Models\n2 Boss Dials\nNew Treasure Cards\nNew Encounter Cards\nBoss AI Decks for Sif and Artorias\nIf you want to explore some new locations within the universe then the Darkroot Basin/Iron Keep Gaming Tiles Add-On (+\u00a315) is for you! These double sided tiles will feature artwork from the Darkroot Basin and Iron Keep environments from the game and will allow backers more options of exploration during their game play sessions.\nPlease NOTE that they are NOT required in order to use the Darkroot Basin/Iron Keep Expansions.\nYou can also purchase multiple Souls Pledges by increasing your pledge amount by +\u00a380 per pledge. NOTE: There is no Early Bird discount on these additional pledges. The 'Extra Souls Pledge' gets you a second copy of the Core Game with Applicable Stretch Goals.\n\"A lot of the minutia is even the same, like bosses changing attack patterns midway through battle (which is true of Dark Souls 3 at any rate), and you heal up using carefully managed Estus Flasks. Positioning plays an important role in these battles as each attack is limited to a certain selection of nearby nodes.\" - Eurogamer\n\"it looks like a very cool board game, with excellent miniatures, that may very well scratch the Dark Souls tabletop itch so many of us have had for so long now.\" - Forbes\n\"Steamforged Games' official tabletop game based on Dark Souls will adopt the series' notorious level of difficulty, according to the board game maker.\" - Polygon\n\"We really want to play that Dark Souls board game\" - Destructiod\n\"Steamforged has had experience with Kickstarter in the past.

This project is our first step towards changing this for the retailers.\nSteamforged Games Ltd are determined to support retail at every level. With our previous project - Guild Ball, we committed that after the project had launched all further products within the range would be direct to retail. We kept that promise. With Dark Souls\u2122 - we go one step further and are building support directly into the Kickstarter itself.\nThe Retailer Pledge level contains 6 copies Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game along with a number of other benefits:\nRetailer Bonus Unlocks - We have built into the Kickstarter several additional retailer bonus unlocks that once unlocked (via the number of retail backers in the campaign) will provide 'Add-On' purchases available only at retail and not purchasable during the Kickstarter by backers. These will not be limited runs but a general release available to all customers upon launch of the game in shops.\nCurrent Bonus Unlock Items\nExclusive Timed Access - You will be the first stores to receive the Core Game and the only stores to have 4 weeks early access to the launch day products and retailer exclusive stretch goal products upon release.\nExclusive Point of Sale Items - Along with your retail stock, we will send exclusive point of sale items as a thank you for supporting us from the start.\nTo help retailers guarantee their initial stock, you may purchase additional Retailer Pledges by increasing the pledge amount.\nWe will be supporting localisation options for the game and have confirmed the following languages currently: \nEnglish\nFrench\nSpanish\nGerman\nItalian\nWe are also considering other localisation options depending on demand during and after the Kickstarter campaign ends. You will be able to choose the language of your version via the pledge manager system.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: \nUnited Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers)\nUSA (US backers)\nCanada (Canadian backers)\nGermany (EU backers)\nChina (Asia Pacific backers)\nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers)\nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the core game (4kg volumetric weight). These are just estimates - costs may rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals and add-on purchases you choose.\nUNITED KINGDOM: \u00a37\nUSA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to most states. \u00a322 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. \nEUROPE: \u00a37 to Germany.  \n\u00a310-\u00a322 to most other countries.\n\u00a325 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n\u00a330 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n\u00a340 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n\u00a343 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel.\n\u00a350 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine.\nLATIN AMERICA: \u00a335-\u00a343 to most countries. \nASIA: \u00a37 to China and Hong Kong. \u00a322 to most other countries (no estimate available for Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia. \u00a322 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: \u00a350 to most countries. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline window will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan - again these are estimates:\nKickstarter Campaign Ends\n0 Day - Pledges are charged.\n1 Week - Survey sent confirming emails.\n1-2 Months - Pledge Manager sent to backers confirming add-on purchases, extras and taking payment for shipping.\n1 Month Before Shipping - Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost.\nShipping Starts\n0 Day - China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders. UK/RoW orders are sent to the UK hub by sea freight.\n2-5 Weeks - China sends EU/AUS/US hub orders prepacked by sea freight. Asian hub orders begin packing and shipping.\n6-8 Weeks - UK hub receives items and begins packing and shipping\n9-12 Weeks - EU/AUS/US hubs receive items, ship everything out to backers within 2 weeks.\n13+ Weeks - UK hub completes shipping of the UK and RoW orders.

These Heroes are drawn from five different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses:\nCaptains: Jack-of-all-Trade Heroes who specialize in buffing other Heroes.\nBrutes: The toughest of the tough, Brutes can take a ton of punishment and only get stronger for doing so!\nGunner: Ranged damage dealers, Gunners have the lowest HP of all classes, but can also dish out the most hurt.\nSwashbucklers: Like Gunners, Swashbucklers specialize in dealing damage, but prefer the up-close-and-personal approach.\nQuartermaster: While they don't deal the most damage, Quartermasters make up for it in raw utility: specializing in healing and buffing Heroes, and also enhancing your Deckhands and Bosuns!\nThe Deep Lords seek the power of the locker, and with it, to flood the world!\nLeft to Right: Carcharius [Captain], Ishmael [Brute], Kyria and Karl [Gunner], Waldorf [Quartermaster], Snapjaw [Swashbuckler]\nThe crew of Marea de la Muerta are motivated by power and greed!\nLeft to Right: Viana [Captain], Don Santiago [Brute], Gabriela [Gunner, El Latigo [Quartermaster], DeMarco [Swashbuckler]\nIn addition to your Heroes, your team will also control your ships' Deckhands and Bosuns, which collectively make up the ships' \"Crew\". The Crew make up the \"background\" characters of the fight, much like you'd see in traditional pirate movies - they follow a simple A.I. and path - so it'll be up to your Heroes to do most of the game-changing plays and moves. \nBut don't think they're useless, however, many Hero abilities and effects manipulate your Crew (notably Quartermasters) and can turn these unsung sailors into a truly game-winning force to be reckoned with!\nThe Crew of the Deep Lords: Bosun [shown on round base- 6 in the Core Box], and 3 Deckhands [on square bases- 8 of each sculpt in Core Box!]\nThe Crew of Marea de la Muerte: Bosun [shown on round base- 6 in the Core Box], and 3 Deckhands [on square bases- 8 of each sculpt in Core Box!]\nSecond Tide is no mere expansion, however, there have been numerous upgrades and changes made to enhance gameplay and your pirate experience!  The most notable of such is our new dynamic Leveling System!\nEach Hero has its own unique Dashboard, where its Coin, Damage, and Skills will be tracked\nEach Hero begins the game with their Basic Attack skill card. As they gain Coins, which are obtained from KO'ing enemies and Objectives, they can use those Coins to buy new skills, as well as level up existing skills!\nEach Hero has a set of three Skill Cards, which display their unique powers and abilities\nEach skill flips over to reveal its Level 2 version!\nIn addition to the Heroes and Crew, however, each faction has access to their own  Tide Deck -a deck of 30 cards, 20 of which are unique to that Crew, featuring faction-specific powers and effects. These Tide Cards can turn the Tide (Yarg!) of battle at a moment's notice - but be warned! Utilizing this power can draw the ire of The Kraken, and if it appears it can spell doom for your entire Crew! Slay him, however, and you'll gain the full might of his power, and come all the closer to total victory over your opponent!\nEach Crew has their own unique, 30 card, Tide Deck!\nBut that's not all! To round out all the changes listed above, we've also introduced a new Alternating Activation method of play! With this new system players will take turns activating 1 Hero (or their Crew), and then their opponent will do the same, continuing back and forth until everyone has gone.\nWith this method you can better react to your opponent's actions, as well as change your own strategies on the fly!

Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage and B-Sieged. Zombicide: Black Plague will deliver its 2nd wave very soon.\n\nWe have four ongoing projects currently: The Others which is in the final stages of production, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and XenoShyft: Dreadmire which are in mid-production, and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia which is starting production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Raid the Interstellar Express space-rail to earn loot, infamy, and the ire of C.O.W. and the Galactic Central Bank. In order to loot the train you\u2019ll need to first dispose of the meddlesome Tinstar Lawbots, who will do everything in their power to stop your heist. Team up with other Raiders, or do what bandits do best, double-crossing them when their chips are down. Anything goes when you\u2019re out to make a big score!\nOnly $50 to get everything shown below! \nClick to make me big!\n                                                                                                                                                      In Rail Raiders Infinite, players assume control of a bandit raiding the Interstellar Express space-rail. Raiders move from car to car searching for loot. The player who gets the biggest haul of double-dollars before the train makes it to the station wins the game. Combat and other actions are determined by rolling a \u201chand\u201d of five or more custom poker dice. The player who scores the highest hand wins the roll. \nTrain Cars, except for the locomotive and caboose, always start the game face down showing the roof side of the car. This way raiders don\u2019t know where the richest opportunities or the most Law Bots are beforehand. When a Raider moves onto, or starts its turn on, a face down car it may turn that car face up. Once a Train Car is turned face up, then Loot tokens are placed on the car and Long Arm of the Law cards are drawn equal to the numbers shown on the car. \nEach player takes control of a single Raider. Each Raider has a model and a card with a unique ability which only that Raider may use. A Raider may take three actions during its turn from the following choices: Move, Search, or Showdown. Any action type can only be performed twice during a player\u2019s turn. So while a player gets to take three actions only two of them can be the same type of action.\nMove: The Raider may move to an adjacent train car.\nSearch: The Raider may reveal a Loot token and draw the number of Loot cards shown. A Raider may not Search if a Lawbot is on the same train car.\nShowdown: The Raider gets into a shootout with Lawbots or opposing Raiders!\nAt the beginning of a Raider's turn, a High Noon card is drawn. High Noon cards have special effects which may affect the turn's game play. Additionally, the High Noon deck serves as a timer for the game. Once the High Noon deck has been exhausted, the train has reached the station and the Raiders need to jump off the train or be captured!\nLong Arm of the Law cards tell you how many, and what type of, Lawbots to place on the train car. Some Long Arm of the Law cards even have special effects that may swing the tide of the game allowing Lawbots to roll more dice, gain rerolls, or even speed up the train!\n The goal of Rail Raiders Infinite is to Loot. This is a train heist after all! Each train car has a number of opportunities to loot. However, you may only loot once all of the Law Bots on a car have been eliminated. Loot can include equipment and weapons, or the all precious Double-Dollars!\nRail Raiders Infinite dice are used to resolve shootouts and other situations within the game. Each die features six values: 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and Joker. Players roll a hand of five dice and then attempt to make the highest poker hand from the results. The player with the highest hand wins!\nTypically players only roll five dice. However, special circumstances may give players additional dice. Players can also use a Joker result as any value, significantly increasing the likelihood of a good hand. Some bandits and items of loot also have unique effects which occur depending on what was rolled. A good poker player always rolls with an eye for the best advantage in the given situation!\nThe above video covers core concepts and walks you through a basic Fight.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Here's everything unlocked so far for all backers:\nAnd here's everything you can add to your pledge:\nFollow these links to learn more about the Adventurers Set, Monsters Dice Set, Luke the Lucky, Promo Dice Set, Arcadia Crossover Kit, Colored Action Dice Pack, Treasure Chest Pack and Plastic Token Pack.\nMasmorra is the dungeon underneath the great city of Arcadia, which was used as a testing ground for prospective Guild Heroes. But since the warlock Malaphyas took it over, filling it with his monstrous minions, it's become a real challenge, beckoning the Heroes to brave its treacherous corridors in search of fame and fortune!\nThe Heroes brave enough to face the dungeon: Valerie, Jay, Mika, Greybark, and Algus!\nProduction plastic figures of the Heroes of Masmorra.\nMasmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia is set in the Arcadia Quest universe, but is in fact a completely new and different game. In it, 2 to 5 players each control a single Hero, competing against all other Heroes. They must explore the rooms of the dungeon, defeating monsters, evading traps, and collecting gold in order to be the first to reach the highest experience level.\nUpdate: The recently-unlocked Solo/Cooperative Mode allows the game to be played by 1 to 5 players, all banding together to make their way down to the last level and defeat Malaphyas before his dark ritual is complete!\nThe monsters you'll have to face in the Masmorra come in all shapes and sizes!\nAs the Heroes go exploring, the dungeon is revealed room by room, creating a different layout each time you play. Whenever a Hero moves into an unexplored section, they draw a new dungeon tile, adding a new feature to the dungeon. Dungeon tiles contain all sorts of suprises, such as monster spawns, gold stashes, deadly traps, healing fountains, dangerous chasms, teleportation gates, and even huge rooms filled with both terrifying foes and mesmerizing treasure! When stairs are found, the Heroes can go even deeper into the dungeon, accessing a different set of even more challenging and rewarding dungeon tiles.\nMost of the monsters you will encounter in Masmorra are presented as special dice. Many of the dungeon tiles you explore will cause one of these dice to be rolled and placed on the tile, representing a random monster spawn. There are two types of dice: one with normal monsters and another with more dangerous foes that will only appear in the second level of the dungeon. These beautiful dice have full-color illustrations of the monsters tempo-printed onto the dice surface. This process creates incredibly durable dice that will not fade with the normal wear and tear of constant gaming! Each face of the dice shows a different monster, with its attack, defense, and XP value.\nAt the start of each Hero's turn, they roll 6 Action Dice that will guide their actions that turn. After one optional reroll, the Hero needs to employ the results obtained to the best of their abilities to brave the dungeon. Melee is used to attack monsters; Ranged may knock them out before they can even fight back; Defense can block their attacks; Steps help you move quickly through the corridors; Elixir can heal you; and you can use Magic to change any other result to what you really need. The results can often be employed in many other ways, though, such as special attacks against the undead, disarming traps, opening treasure chests, etc. It's all about finding the best way to make the Action Dice work to your advantage!\nEach of the Heroes braving the Masmorra has their own unique starting ability, which they can use to perform special feats, or change Action Dice results in their own way. But more than that, each Hero has four other unique abilities they are able to unlock whenever they level up. Each time a Hero gains enough XP, he chooses which of their ability cards to upgrade in order to unlock a new ability. That means the same Hero can evolve in different ways each game, offering different options to the player. Unlocked abilities present several different ways in which Action Dice results and gold coins can be used to trigger all sorts of special effects!\nWhile Heroes don't directly fight each other inside the Masmorra (the Guild Code is oddly strict about that), they still have many tricks up their sleeves to hurt their opponents. At the end of their turn, each player gets to control the Monsters a little bit, possibly throwing them on top of the other Heroes (just be careful you're not just helping them kill more foes more quickly). But most of all, the Treasure cards Heroes are able to gather can either be used to help themselves, or to hinder others in a myriad of colorful ways. There is no player elimination in Masmorra, but getting killed can set you back quite a bit with some XP and Treasure loss.\nMasmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia comes with:   \n5 Hero miniatures \n 5 color bases \n 5 Hero dashboards \n12 Monster dice \n7 Action dice \n67 Dungeon tiles \n45 cards \n45 Tokens\n10 player aid sheets \n1 experience track sheet \n1 rulebook\nThe Masmorra core box also comes with 5 cards that allow you to use its Heroes in Arcadia Quest as well!\nHERE you can download a work in progress version of the rulebook. Please note that this file is not final and is still subject to changes.\nDungeoneer Pledge - $65\nThe Dungeoneer Pledge gives you a Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero Quan, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nQuan is a very experienced warrior monk, using his inner energy to aid him in his journey. With a surprise attack always at the ready, his natural ability allows him to turn any die into a Sword. As he gains experience, he'll be able to unlock lethal abilities like turning a Step into 2 Swords, or a Sword into 2 Bows!\nQuan's production plastic figure.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON crew got together to put their Heroes through the ultimate test: the dark corridors of the Masmorra! Check out how well each of them fared.\nFirst, we have a brief video giving an introduction to the overall rules of the game:\nAnd then, we have the full gameplay video:\nFind out more about the Adventures Set HERE.\nFind out more about the Monsters Dice Set HERE.\nFind out more about Luke the Lucky HERE.\n Find out more about the Promo Dice Set HERE.\n Find out more about the Arcadia Crossover Kit HERE.\n Find out more about the Colored Action Dice Pack HERE.\nFind out more about the Treasure Chest Pack HERE.\n Find out more about the Plastic Token Pack HERE.\nPlease Take Note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. \n  $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, and Blood Rage. We're currently in the final stages of delivering B-Sieged, and Zombicide: Black Plague will deliver its 2nd wave in the coming months.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: The Others and Arcadia Quest: Inferno, which are in mid-production, and XenoShyft: Dreadmire which is starting production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there.

After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Each scenario presents different quests that must be fulfilled in order to be victorious, and various monsters the heroes will need to defeat on their way. The monsters react to the heroes' actions, so no one is stuck playing the role of game master.\nThe Heroes of Arcadia!\nAs the heroes defeat their enemies and accomplish quests, their guilds rake in the coins, which will then allow them to acquire all sorts of powerful loot! From legendary weapons and armor, to new abilities and magic items. The combination of each hero's unique ability with all the different upgrades they earn through the campaign allows players to create amazing and unexpected combos!\nThe Monsters of Inferno!\nInferno is a standalone box, but also fully compatible with previous Arcadia Quest boxes. It contains a full campaign with 12 scenarios for players to explore. As players progress through the circles of Inferno, deeper and deeper into the Underworld, the campaign branches into two distinct paths. The path not taken results in quests the players will not fulfill, and therefore consequences that will come back to haunt them towards the end of the campaign.\nThe Angels. Will they help or hinder you?\nOne such key choice are the Angels. These secret protectors of Arcadia have been imprisoned by the Underlord, who is trying to corrupt them. If players rescue these Angels, they become powerful additions to their Guilds. But beware, the Angels that are abandoned to their fate will be consumed and come back as monsters to seek revenge on the heroes!\nProduction plastic miniatures of the Inferno monsters, angels, and heroes.\nGoing down into the infernal depths presents the heroes of Arcadia with a new set of challenges and opportunities, in the form of Damnation! This dark power permeates everything in Inferno, and daring heroes may want to use it to their advantage (and face the consequences). Weapons and equipment found in Inferno may become more powerful if a hero takes Damnation, monsters may offer the choice of taking Damnation instead of wounds (or flat out dealing Damnation to their target). However, accumulating Damnation may come at a high price. Some Upgrades are more effective against heroes with Damnation, some monsters more powerful against them, and specially Brimstone cards scattered through the scenarios may activate monsters to attack heroes who dabble too much in the dark powers!\nMany of the Upgrade cards use Damnation to punish or reward heroes.\nArcadia Quest: Inferno comes with:\n36 highly detailed figures, including:\n  12 Hero figures\n  5 Angel figures\n  19 Monster figures (6x Demoness, 6x Harpy, 2x Demon Pitcher, 2x Cerberus, Belly'aal, The Judge, The Underlord)\n12 color plastic bases\n8 Attack dice \n6 Defense dice \n9 double-sided game tiles \n4 guild dashboards \n276 cards\n300+ tokens\nCampaign Sheet pad\nRulebook\nCampaign Book\nExplore a brand new campaign, and add Pets to any Arcadia Quest experience with the Optional Buy Arcadia Quest: Pets expansion!\nFind out everything about the Pets Optional Buy box HERE.\nIf you wish to extend your campaign beyond the 6th scenario, don't miss out on the ultimate showdown with the Frost Dragon expansion box!\nFind out everything about the Frost Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nThe mad fight against the Chaos Dragon also takes place after the 6th scenario and brings a whole new epic experience to Arcadia Quest!\n Find out everything about the Chaos Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nNo epic campaign can end without a showdown against the majestic Fire Dragon!\nFind out everything about the Fire Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nHell of a Pledge - $100\nThe Hell of a Pledge gives you an Arcadia Quest: Inferno core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero King David III, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nKing David III is a natural born leader.

In Legends, Heroes brave a series of adventures as part of an overall narrative campaign. Between adventures, Heroes spend crystals they have earned from their exploits to unlock new skills and abilities or to craft bizarre and powerful artifacts. Legends introduces new and more powerful battle dice and deep tomes of information about the races, realms, organizations, and\u2014of course\u2014monsters that populate Crystalia.\nLegends not only provides the tools to build your own adventures, it also comes with two campaigns, each consisting of multiple adventures and an exciting story for your Heroes to take part in.

Rampaging through the Frostbyte Reach, the savage hordes have spilled out into Crystalia. Combining potent offense and a hardy resilience, the orcs are driven into further frenzy by the ferocious Rage Fiend Mini-Boss. Standing in their way is the Lightning Mage, whose crackling bolts arc through multiple foes with a single blast.\nCONTENTS:\nLightning Mage Hero Model\nRage Fiend Mini-Boss Model\n14 Orc Monster Models: 2 Skull Stone Spawning Points, 4 Neck Splitters, 4 Face Beaters, 4 Knuckle Smashers\nGame Cards: Hero, Classic Monsters, Arcade Monsters, Treasure Card\nThe Crown Guard warband represents the doughty men and women who join their local village militias, town watches, or regional military. Devoted to combined arms and defense, the Crown Guard can protect weaker monsters around them, shielding them from attacks. Occasionally, the Crown Guard are even forced to maintain the peace against rambunctious Heroes, or\u2014in more dire situations\u2014turn to the service of the Dark Consul.

Each time we reach a target dollar value, a stretch goal will unlock, awarding new riches for the backers!\n        An adventure a day keeps the Consul away! One new adventure will be unlocked every day. Most of the adventures are for your Heroes and will be digital downloads for you and your gaming group to enjoy. However, several adventures are up to the backers to accomplish. The community needs to complete the adventure to earn the reward. Once all of the adventures are unlocked, qualifying pledges will receive an incredible 21 FREE rewards just for backing!\n        Non-Player Characters (NPCs) | Adventures\nThe Dark Consul has created spawning points throughout the dungeon that unleash hordes of monsters to ravage Crystalia. Players assume the role of mighty Heroes who journey through the dungeon and destroy all of the spawning points. When they destroy a spawning point, a powerful mini-boss appears. The Heroes seek to defeat the hordes of monsters to earn loot, treasure, and valuable princess coins. Once the last spawning point is destroyed, the dungeon boss spawns and an epic battle for the fate of Crystalia begins!\nThere are two game modes included in Super Dungeon Explore: Classic Mode and Arcade Mode. \nIn Classic Mode, one player assumes the role of the Dark Consul. As the Dark Consul, the player controls all of the monsters in the dungeon, pitting their wits against the Heroes'. Classic Mode is perfect for players who enjoy having a dungeon that has all of the cunning and intelligence of a human opponent. Classic Mode is also ideal if you want to have full control over the game experience. A human Consul can judiciously use the monsters to keep the dungeon at a difficulty that suits the skill-level and enhances the fun of all the players.\nIn Arcade Mode, all players assume control of a Hero. The Dark Consul is automated through the use of unique arcade monster cards and command cards. Arcade Mode is a fully cooperative dungeon experience, that is ideal for players who love to work together to overcome challenges. \nTo learn more about playing Super Dungeon Explore, you can download the current rulebooks for both Classic Mode and Arcade Mode. \nPlease Note: These rules will undergo a moderate revision and update for their inclusion in Super Dungeon Explore: Second Edition.  For those who do not pledge for Second Edition (and those who do), the revised rulebooks will be available for free download at www.sodapopminiatures.com.\nLegends provides rules to add narrative meaning to your games of Super Dungeon Explore, and to link them together to tell an overarching story. While the focus of Legends remains upon using miniatures to explore dungeons and defeat monsters, players are encouraged to tell the story of what occurs between adventures. Haggling with cranky shopkeepers, bartering with the local thieves guild for rare potion ingredients, solving a sage\u2019s riddle, convincing a kobold cult to leave town, or just enjoying a quiet night at the local pub can all be rewarding experiences in themselves.\nNot final art.\nTo play Legends you must have a copy of Super Dungeon Explore, either The Forgotten King box set or the 2nd Edition box set available in this Kickstarter.\nLegends may be played using either Classic Mode or Arcade mode. Using Classic Mode allows players to take full advantage of Legends' narrative and roleplaying structure. Using Arcade Mode, players utilize premade adventures, such as those included in the Legends Consul's Grimoire and any digital adventures that we unlock during the Kickstarter campaign.\nADVENTURES\nAdventures are the heart and soul of Legends. An adventure can be a single normal game of Super Dungeon Explore, played straight out of the box. An adventure can also be a premade encounter designed by Soda Pop Miniatures, or a homemade narrative experience designed by your Consul. Adventures can also be linked to form a campaign.\nAdventures take 45 minutes \u2013 3 hours to complete, so it is always best to choose a time when players can sit down and enjoy an evening playing Super Dungeon. Plenty of delicious snacks and tasty fizzy beverages are highly recommended!\nEach adventure consists of the following components: Story, Objective, Monsters, Setup, Special Rules, Victory, and Rewards. These components detail how players set up an adventure, as well as the goals for both the monsters and the Heroes.\nThe time between adventures is called downtime. During downtime, Heroes may use loot, treasure, crystals, and other rewards they gained during the adventure to customize their Heroes to fit their own particular play-style and vision for their character. Here are some of the things that occur during downtime.\nAward Crystals: Heroes earn amethyst crystals for defeating monsters, overcoming challenges, or roleplaying during an adventure. Additionally, the Consul earns crystals which can be used to purchase new schemes and advance monsters.\nDisenchant: In Legends, the party keeps all cards they draw during an adventure in their backpack. All loot and treasure cards the Heroes acquired during the adventure must be disenchanted into their component crafting crystals. This includes both cards that were equipped and cards that remained in the backpack. Loot cards are worth one crystal of the same color as the loot. Treasure cards are worth three crystals of the same color as the treasure.\nCrafting: The party may spend crystals to visit the mighty crafter and enchanter, Gregorius Crystalpot the XXIV. Gregorius will take your hard-earned crystals and present you with a wonderful new item. Unfortunately, unless you\u2019re skilled at crafting yourself, you\u2019re never quite sure what you\u2019ll get!\nHero Training: Heroes may spend crystals to train, allowing them to learn new skills, increase their attributes and gain other advancements.\nShopping: Crystalia has an entire industry of shopkeepers who cater to adventuring Heroes, maintaining a rotating stock of unique items. Conversely, there is also a shady network of villains, monsters and other assorted evildoers who cater to the needs of the Dark Consul\u2019s minions. Heroes and the Consul may visit shops to purchase consumable goods, potions, and other one-use items for the next adventure.\nScheme: The Consul may spend crystals to purchase schemes. Schemes are one use cards that represent the various petty plots, dirty tricks, and machinations that monsters may use to defeat the Heroes.\nOnce the party has completed downtime, they\u2019re ready for the next adventure! \nCLASSES\nA Hero\u2019s relative power level is gauged by a system called classes. The Consul uses the party\u2019s class to help determine how powerful adventures need to be in order to remain challenging for the Heroes. There are six classes: C-Class, B-Class, A-Class, S-Class, X-Class, and XS-Class.\n\nA Hero\u2019s class and affinity determine what upgrade cards a Hero may possess. Heroes may only ever gain cards that are of equivalent or lower class. \n\nIn order to advance through the classes, a Hero must acquire crystals. Once a Hero possesses enough crystals, they are considered to have leveled up to the next class, and may begin to accrue skill and item cards appropriate to their new class. \n\nAND MUCH, MUCH MORE!\nThere's just too much Legends to contain within the structure of this Kickstarter, including: roleplaying in Crystalia, establishing a guild, dungeon creation, nonplayer characters, pages and pages of world information, and more will be explored in Super Dungeon Legends. As a backer you will gain first access to this exciting content, and even help shape the direction it takes!\n\nWe previewed several gameplay aspects on www.ninjadivision.com. You can view all the articles here. We will also preview more aspects of Legends in our updates.\n\nKickstarter is not a mere preorder. You are getting in on the ground floor of our vision for the future of Super Dungeon. In addition to receiving an incredible selection of models and gameplay content at a great price, you will get to see the process of Legends' creation\u2014both its ups and downs\u2014beginning with development, through production, until final shipment. \nThrough it all, we consider communication with our backers of primary importance. In our past campaigns we provided weekly, in-depth updates and never missed even one. We make that same pledge to our Super Dungeon Legends backers. You will know what is happening on the project, every step of the way!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through our store-based pledge manager, based on the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you select. \nTo help minimize your shipping and customs costs, we will ship rewards to multiple international shipping hubs at our cost. These hubs will then ship all rewards to backers in their region. Currently we have shipping hubs in Boise (USA and rest of the world), Canada, UK, Germany (European Union), Australia, and Hong Kong (Asia Pacific and Oceania, except AU). Depending on your region, this will help reduce or eliminate any additional import duties you will be required to pay. \nOur current estimate for shipping costs are listed in the chart below.\nPlease note that these are ESTIMATES ONLY and may change as we unlock more items or if you purchase additional rewards.\nAll pledges which are finalized after the pledge manager deadline (i.e. late) will ship from the United States, and will likely incur additional shipping costs and potential delays depending on your location. Packages which were undeliverable due to an incorrect or incomplete address being provided, or failing to notify us in a timely manner of a change of address, will incur additional shipping costs in order to be reshipped.

Their skills and abilities are the last, best hope of Talon\u2019s Coast.\nThe heroes will fight together against the forces of evil - controlled by the game system itself - to save the kingdom and break the spell that binds their souls.\nHero Sheet, 3D sculpt and (hand-painted) actual miniature\nThese heroes are not your run-of-the-mill adventurers - they are legendary characters, brought back to life by powerful sorcery. Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during the story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points, players regenerate the heroes' souls, returning them to their legendary status - with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.\nSword & Sorcery's game system represents the perfect evolution of the mechanics first used in Galaxy Defenders. From its forerunner, Sword & Sorcery inherits key features such as advanced AI for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and multiple tactical options during battles. At the same time, gameplay in Sword & Sorcery is fast and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, and includes new features never seen before in a game of this category.\nIf the close encounter with our dwarf cleric Thorgar was not enough to persuade you... Keep on reading! :-) Here are a few more reasons to back our project:\nUltra Detailed 32mm Scale Figures, sculpted by Studio Gutierrez, well known by miniature lovers as sculptors of the Infinity Miniature Game. You can have a sneak peek at many of the models we developed on SketchFab.\nSolo Play. A single player controlling two or more heroes can play the entire campaign.\nHigh Character Customization. 10 classes, 7 Soul Ranks (levels) per hero, 50 different hero powers, over 100 items including weapons, magic artifacts, and soul weapons!\nSophisticated Combat and Magic System. A detailed combat system based on two types of custom 10-sided dice and an intuitive cooldown management of spells and skills grants spectacular fights. No numbers or tables to check, just icons and quick strategic decisions!\nNo Player Elimination. When a hero dies, he becomes a ghost soul, an ethereal form able to use its unique ghost shout against enemies, and then he can resurrect spending Soul points at the gods' altar.\nNo Game Master required. An innovative A.I. system allows control and management of enemies by the players, giving them intelligent behaviour and creating interesting battles every time.\nModular Boards. Each map tile is double sided and created to be interconnected with any other tile, allowing the creation of endless new quests.\nStory-Driven Campaign. A story of intrigue and conflict awaits the heroes\u2026 Loot, treasures and traps are just the beginning!\n90 Minutes Experience. Quests are designed to be completed in about 90 minutes or less.\nExtended Replay Value. Each hero has two different classes to choose from. In addition, quests can be customized by swapping enemies, thanks to the challenge level system, and thanks to the randomly acquired powers, enemies represent a new, unpredictable challenge in every encounter.\nIf you want to know all about Sword & Sorcery gameplay, you can download the complete \"Beta\" version of the rulebook here.\nClick to download the rulebook in PDF format.

Omnivorous players and hardened designers, they are responsible of the game design and art direction.\nGT Studio: Fausto and Pedro Gutierrez are the amazing duo who sculpted, to the tiniest details, the legendary heroes and deadly enemies you will find in Sword & Sorcery.

Alessio Cammardella and Marco Matrone worked at his side, to develop the art of our game.\nPhroilan Gardner: Phroilan Gardner created the impressive image used for the Sword & Sorcery box cover, and his art is also going to be featured on Ares' upcoming Age of Conan - Adventures in Hyboria expansion. \n0One Games: Mario \"Longbeard\" Barbati is a veteran of map making for role-playing games. His company - OOne Games - was the first publisher in the world to leverage the Open Gaming license for producing PDF role-playing supplements.\nMatrioskArt: Adriano D'Ippolito and Francesca Michelon are the creative minds behind the complex, yet beautiful, graphic design that brings to life the mechanics of Sword & Sorcery and the other games designed by Gremlin Project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSword & Sorcery is our sixth Kickstarter project. \nWe already delivered three Kickstarters successfully - Sails of Glory, Galaxy Defenders-Season 1 and Galaxy Defenders-Season 2 - with very positive feedback from our backers. \nThe production of the rewards of the fourth and fifth Kickstarter (Age of Conan - Adventures in Hyboria and Wings of Glory-Giants of the Sky ) is in progress, and we plan to ship the rewards to their backers within the next 1 to 4 months.\n\nCreating high-quality boardgames and miniatures is not an easy task.

We prefer a reasonable delay to compromising on the level of quality we are looking for in our games in general, and in this product specifically.\n\nThere are also risks of delays, as with any game manufactured in Asia, related to transport and delivery to our warehouse in the United States. These are also routinely handled by our logistic staff, but unexpected delays due to customs clearance, strikes, and exceptional weather are always possible, and may influence the time necessary to deliver the games to our backers.\n\nThat said, we've looked at how past products have been delayed, and have adjusted our estimates to be a bit more conservative than in the past, to try to avoid repeating past problems and reduce the impact of unforeseen ones.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "Remember, remember, the Fifth of November!", "update_content": "Heroes!\nWe unveiled today the dates of the Kickstarter campaign to fund a completely new cycle of Sword & Sorcery, Ancient Chronicles, launching on November 5th and ending on November 21st. \nAncient Chronicles will be a new starting point for our game, suitable both for newcomers and for players who are already playing the Immortal Souls campaign, allowing them to enter the world of Sword & Sorcery again, in a campaign set in the distant past of the events narrated in Immortal Souls."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Sword & Sorcery is back on Kickstarter on November, 5th!

Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains, you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventure and encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nA random event hidden by the \u201cfog of war\u201c.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card you are standing on, the Event cards attached to it, the Character, Idea, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Item cards in your inventory.\nSome actions you can perform along your journey.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your ideas and abilities and serves as your life force. Every action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing at performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, therefore reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more achievements. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted every action could be your last!\nThankfully, you may add Idea cards to your hand when performing actions. Your Bonus, Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. Especially when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of succeeding.\nThe right idea cards at the right time can make all the difference!\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations. You will have to use your best survival skills to live through the many threats you will face in this land, and eventually lift your curses.\nFind or craft items to help you make it through risky situations or access locations that would be unreachable without them.\nFind an empty can.

And one of us happens to be pretty handy with a crayon too ;)\nSerious Poulp\nWe founded Serious Poulp in 2010 so we could persue our dreams of publishing the games we designed.\nWe started with Steam Torpedo, a tactical Submarine combat game for 2 players with quite a significant metagame potential and combo mechanic.\nNext up was 8 Masters' Revenge, a martial arts game for 1 to 4 players that revamps the standard combat game genre.\nNow, it's time for The 7th Continent, our third game, the one we've been working full-time on for the past 2 years.\nLudovic Roudy & Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends since childhood, we love all kinds of games!\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp which we founded in 2010 when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludo was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives whether they be from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent: Ludovic also creates all the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpSlayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the community manager for The 7th Continent.\nA passionate gamer and journalist and far too English for his own good. He currently works for the French-based board gaming site Tric Trac. He is an aficionado of any tabletop game featuring toy soldiers. You may have already heard of him from his work on the incredibly successful CONAN board game by Monolith.\nThe chat with Mr Jamie\nAs passionate gamers, we imagined a game that didn\u2019t exist, as far as we were aware, and that we would love to play.\nThis game is The 7th Continent: an exploration and adventure game offering many hours of solo or cooperative fun with friends.\nHowever, we wouldn\u2019t have started working on The 7th Continent without the prospect of launching it on Kickstarter.\nWhy?\nBECAUSE of the investment that this game implies. Be it in terms of time spent on its conception, design or illustrations. It can\u2019t be supported by a small company like Serious Poulp without a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nBECAUSE after 2 years of work on this project we cannot, unlike with our other games, continue without ensuring a certain degree of success through Kickstarter first.\nBECAUSE our goal is to not publish a standard run-of-the-mill board game. We want The 7th Continent to be an adventure of epic proportions with the largest game board ever created! We can do this with your support and all the stretch goals that we hope to unlock during the campaign.\nWe\u2019ve invested over 2 years of our lives and a significant part of our savings into this project, the first \"choose-your-own-path\" exploration board game. Now we need to know if all this work is going to bear fruit. If this campaign is not successful then The 7th Continent game will never see the light of day. Any possible commercial release will also depend on the level of the campaign\u2019s success.\nWe\u2019ve done all we can to make this dream come true, now the rest is up to you!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in October 2016.\nNo extra customs charges for EU, USA and Canada.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends, which will be managed through the Pledge Manager.\nHere is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (between 2 and 3 kg). Please acknowledge that these are just estimates and that we\u2019ll do our best to get you the best shipping deal possible.\nArea 1 - Mainland USA, Western Europe (France, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal): Between \u20ac10 and \u20ac15\nArea 2 - Canada, Australia, Rest of EU countries: Between \u20ac15 and \u20ac23 [update]\nArea 3 - Russia, Israel, Norway, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, North Africa, Maghreb, New Zealand, Vietnam, India: Between \u20ac28 and \u20ac33\nArea 4 - Rest of the world: Between \u20ac33 and \u20ac38\nMORE PLEDGES ?\nIf you want more than one pledge (including All Applicable Stretch Goals), the shipping cost for each additional reward - from the 2nd and up to the 7th and last - will be divided by 2!\nGame mechanics : 99%\nGame conception (terrain, events, characters) : 85%\nNarration (flavor and event texts, descriptions, etc) : 50%\nArtwork* : 45%\nProof reading and translation : 5%\nIf the project is funded, we will start production in summer 2016.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content).

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria. He's also the co-founder and president of Stonemaier Games, and he's written a book about crowdfunding.\nJakub Rozalski is the artist, worldbuilder, and creative director of Scythe.

Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Folklore the Affliction is a dark fantasy role playing board game for 1-5 players that does not require a game master. Adventure in a land steeped in fear, myth and superstition. Hunt or be hunted by creatures of antiquity and legend. Explore dangerous locales to find clues to the sources of evil sinking claws into the heart of the land, and decimating the populace. Defend the weak from the scourge of witchcraft and the demonic, the taint of lycanthropy and vampirism. Advance through highly immersive stories of epic scale with multi-layer character development in an on-going quest to drive the darkness back into the hell from which it came.\nwww.greenbriergames.com/folklore\nThere are many people that have embarked together on this quest to aide in the development of Folklore:The Affliction. Here are a few:\nAdam & Brady Sadler, designers of Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition and Warhammer Quest: the Adventure Card Game, have joined the team and are co-developing Folklore: The Affliction. Their experience and professionalism has taken the development of Folklore: The Affliction to new heights.\nJason Engle, is the artist behind Folklore:The Affliction and is responsible for bringing the depth and style that makes it such an artistically immersive game. No stranger to the fantasy realm, he has been creating and publishing his work for the past 16 years. He is easily recognizable by his art pieces for Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, Legend of the Five Rings, Pathfinder, and is the artist guest of honor from PaizoCon 2015. His talents bring the Folklore characters and cartography to life. See more of his work at jaestudio.com.\nEd Greenwood. In between game sessions you can continue your adventures in Folklore: The Affliction by reading novels from Ed Greenwood and members of The Ed Greenwood Group's Sessorium of Creatives. Greenwood is the creator of the Forgotten Realms\u00ae and a myriad of other worlds, universes, and shared settings and a New York Times best-selling author of literally thousands of works that have sold over a quarter billion units (250,000,000) in a dazzling array of formats in over 40 languages in more than 120 countries.\nWorking with the creative leads at Twin Fire Productions, Ed Greenwood is overseeing a series of almost 40 novels that will begin with his own Folklore tale: The Whispering Skull (December, 2016). This creative partnership will also be working together to create Quickblade role playing game adventures based in the Folklore setting giving fans a whole new way to explore and enjoy Folklore: The Affliction!\nBy backing us on Kickstarter, you will also receive the below Kickstarter Exclusive Pack of miniatures and stretch goal content that will be unlocked throughout this campaign!\n*Miniature count is all miniatures found in core game + Kickstarter Exclusive Pack.\nFor an introduction example of how an adventure is written in Folklore: The Affliction, download the Story Journal Preview (Click Here 6.5MB)! This sample adventure should take around 30 minutes to complete where a standard adventure typically runs 90 to 120 minutes with experienced players!\nPlayers choose their story, which contain chapters that provide convenient stopping points for controlling session lengths. Stories escalate in difficulty as the characters unearth lore to defeat ancient evils known as Afflictions and drive them back into the hell from which they came. Your party of 1-5 characters travel together, explore the world map, and encounter some surprises along the way! Search corridors and catacombs, solve puzzles, earn gear, set traps, avoid snares, gain companions, learn abilities, and more!\nOnce the heroes reach a site of interest, the game shifts into a miniatures-based dungeon crawl with map boards revealing those dark places where only the brave or insane would venture. Each character is able to interact with the tactical adventure maps, use their equipment, skills and weaponry to do combat with beautifully sculpted creature and Affliction miniatures.\nIf your character dies in Folklore: The Affliction, it is not the end. You continue play as your character\u2019s spirit! Ghost characters can fight with the strength of the spirit and duel otherworldly foes. The town physician can bring you back to life. That is, unless your spirit has gone to Limbo\u2026only the gypsies can help you then, for a price! Characters who pass into Limbo, a place beyond the ghostly realms, return to life with a tarot card which dictates their destiny.\n To see more about game play look at the beta of our rule book. Please note there has been very little polish so far, but the mechanics have been play-tested and are designer approved. We focused on giving you the mechanics, so it's not the full book.\nOversized Neoprene map: Shown above is our first prototype of the oversized map shown with the Dogmight wooden boxes and a banana for scale. This map is is 29\u201dx48 inches, 2.3\u2019x4 feet, 71x121.92cm, perfect size for your gaming table.\n\"There have been a lot of games that have tried to give an RPG experience in a boardgame format. I have played a lot of them. I finally found one that does it with Folklore.\" - Lance Myxter, Undead Viking Videos\n\"If you are looking for a really EPIC experience that is incredibly ambitious, this is really one you're going to want to check out.\" - Forrest Bower, Bower's Game Corner\n\"The best way to describe Folklore: The Affliction is as a meld between modern dungeon-crawling board games, like Descent, and classic Dungeons & Dragons role playing adventures.\" - The League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\u201cWhen I saw Folklore: The Affliction at Origins in 2014, I could tell that it was special\" - Keith Schleicher, The Gaming Trend\nOne of things that makes Folklore:The Affliction unique is the storytelling element that weaves the game together. Decisions made by the players change the story and fork the destiny of the outcomes in each adventure. This Intense story telling and combat action pits you against your most frightening foes with strategy building both on and off the battlefield, resource management, power consumption and item creation. Will you accept this quest to purge evil from this land?\nCooperative play for 1-5 players\nAdventure through a dark fantasy/horror role playing environment that will require working together to use the best group strategy for defeating the Afflictions and earning the best gear. The adventure intensity scales to match the number of players in your session. Protect yourself and your friends. Beware the powers of darkness which can make your friends become infected with lycanthropy or vampirism or become possessed.\nImmersive RPG style feel without a GM\nWith all the great games that have come before, immersive play often requires a Game Master, but in Folklore the Affliction, all the players cooperate as characters in the story! Everyone gets to play. The Narrative and intuitive creature AI challenges the players to use their gear and ingenuity to succeed or fail and ultimately steer the path of the adventure.\nTactical miniature combat\nDuring exploration, your characters will be challenged by their environment and engage in dangerous miniatures-based combat as well as non-miniatures based skirmishes. Characters battle in intuitive strategic combats and locales that require interaction even during combat. Who will hold off the Wraith in combat while another character races to the sarcophagus to close the lid? Will you choose to pull a lever while battling an undead horde in order to trap the rest of their forces behind a portcullis?\nCharacter development\nChoose your character's focus and profession, gear them up for adventure and combat, and customize then the way you choose by assigning advancement points and purchasing abilities and items.\nImmersive storylines\nEach game session is like playing through a dark fantasy/horror novel or movie. The narrative immerses the players as they make game-changing choices and interactions that can alter the course of the storyline and determine the outcome and the path toward victory.\nCampaign style play\nCompleting a story is not the end. Advance your characters, gain weapons, artifacts, companions, and abilities and bring them into the next story with all their gear. Customize each character your way as they advance by spending points in the skills and abilities you choose.\nDeath is only the beginning\nIf you have a fatality, you are not out of the game, you instead play on as your ghost with ethereal ghostly powers to rise up against evil from beyond the veil.\nFind companions\nGain or hire the townsfolk and the animals in this hell-oppressed place and lead them into the darkness as you face the evils that threaten to devour you all.\nEach character has their own skills and sets of unique abilities to acquire and master in their rise towards dominance in the war against evil. Each character is distinct in role and depth with unique customization and endless re-playability. Folklore is as much about character development, as it is about dark and gritty exploration and combat.\n1.) The Witch Hunter: A fanatical bounty hunter sworn to rid the land of evil magics. He is a tracker and a marksman with the crossbow.\n2.) The Telepath: A talented mentalist who can access unique and powerful abilities. She can crush the brain matter of her foes and throw enemies with the power of her mind.\n3.) The Avenging Madman: A revenge-driven farmer whose family was slaughtered by otherworldly forces. Vengeance is his only remaining purpose and rage is his weapon!\n4.) The Arcanist: A seeker of lost knowledge. Her understanding of the occult is peerless and she is able to harness the power of rituals.\n5.) The Archeologist: A world-traveler and scholar seeking knowledge of things ancient and mystical. He carries a whip that can hinder his foes.\n6.) The Exorcist: A priest sent to rid the land of evil. Formidable and feared by the followers of darkness, he is armed with a connection to the divine and has access to prayers.\nShow your support by sporting one of these nifty avatars here on Kickstarter or anywhere else you like. Download now!\nWith 8 successful Kickstarter under our belt, we have learned a lot about what it takes to get our games into your hands. One of the biggest things is how variable the cost of shipping can be. As such, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, according to the actual costs incurred to ship to your area. We will do this through our own Pledge Manager system after the campaign concludes.\nThere are two reasons we are doing this. First, it allows us to provide a lower rate on the actual pledge levels and structure a much tighter budget for the campaign and stretch goals since we do not have to estimate for shipping costs. Second, the funds raised for the project are 100% for the actual project itself rather than being partially inflated by shipping costs that may not be accurate.\nWe will be shipping through our various distribution areas. Depending on where you live, we will ship to you through our USA, Europe, or Australian centers.\nThough the pricing may vary due to any add-ons you pledge for by the end of the campaign, the core game pledge level has an estimated weight of 6.38 lbs. (2.89 kg) we are anticipating an average shipping fee to be about: \n$10-$15 to ship in the USA\n$10-$18 in Canada\n$20-$32 in the EU and Australia / New Zealand\n$54+ to ship everywhere else\nPlease note these are estimates and they may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we unlock, final box size and weight and also the current postal prices at the time of shipping.\nWe are all lifelong gamers in one form or another who have been leading dual lives. By day working normal jobs, by night (and on weekends) building games. In our spare time, we have formed a successful board game development and publishing company.\nGreenbrier Games has teamed up with Twin Fire Productions to produce this amazing game. We are very excited about Folklore and we are enjoying working with Twin Fire Productions on this adventure!\nPress Page:\nhttp://press.greenbriergames.com/sheet.php?p=project_folklore\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Greenbriergames\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FolkloreTheAffliction\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/GreenBrierGames\nWebsite: https://www.greenbriergames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our ninth tabletop game Kickstarter project. Our first project started with cardboard and ended up with custom miniatures, cards, dice and expansion packs. From our past projects we've learned the ins and outs of nearly every facet of the board game manufacturing world. We've learned how to set realistic goals for both ourselves and our backers, hopefully making the process rewarding for everyone involved.\n\nAs with any project produced overseas, there can be unforeseen production delays, shipping delays, and customs delays. So we've learned all about delays and ways to manage or avoid them. We know that some delays can\u2019t be predicted or avoided, so we plan extra room in our schedule. This way we can give you the best estimate for the day we can get our game into your hands- because we want to ship our products as much as you want to receive them!\n\nOf course, we've also learned to be realistic in the extra time needed for any extra content that may be added with our stretch goals. Any extra time we spend will be devoted to putting on the polish to make our game the best product it can be!\n\nSo, though there are potential delays in a manufacturing project like this, we are confident, with the experience from our last eight successful projects and our close relationship with our manufacturer, we will meet (or beat) our projected delivery date. \n\nThank you so much for your help making our dreams a reality!\n\n~ The Greenbrier Games Team\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #70", "update_userinfo": "Folklore Fall of the Spire now on Kickstarter!", "update_content": " Greetings Foklorians!\nWe are so excited to let you know (in case you hadn\u2019t heard already) that the next phase of Folklore is now on Kickstarter!

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "It's a grim but lucrative business being a mercenary out on the edge of civilization. You must explore the harsh wilderness and engage in deep tactical combat, where the decisions you make have an impact not only on your own character, but also the world around you.\nGloomhaven is cooperative game of card-driven combat set in a persistent fantasy campaign which will change and grow as you play the game.\nThere is always more to unlock and explore in the world of Gloomhaven.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards from their hand of ability cards which determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can play the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up.\nPlayers gain the experience needed to level up by performing certain actions in their ability card deck. Through leveling up, players will also get access to more powerful, higher level ability cards which they can use to customize their deck.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase powerful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nOne way to unlock items is to increase the prosperity of the town, which players can do by completing scenarios and making decisions during events between scenarios. Players will also have to manage their reputation during these events, as reputation will influence the outcome of some events and also affect shop prices.\nAs players interact with the town and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing career goals. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like more information about any aspect of the game, you can find a wealth of information on the Gloomhaven website and also the BoardGameGeek page which features a number of illustrated lessons on how to play the game.\nIn addition, here is a PDF of a preliminary draft of the rules.\nIf you learn through action or just want to get a better feel for the game, there are a couple easy ways to sit down and play the game on your computer.\nThe introductory scenario of Gloomhaven is available through Tabletop Zen (free) and Tabletop Simulator (this requires the purchase of software).\nYou can get the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop mod here. From there you can play around with it on your own, or sign up to be taught the game through this Google Doc. When you become familiar with the game, you can also sign up for pick-up games, or even be a teacher yourself.\nTabletop Zen now has an open lobby where you can go play around with the game on your own, or you can sign up for pick-up games or teaching games through the Google Doc. All that's required is a valid email address to sign up.\nKeep in mind that the game is not automated. Players will have to move the pieces around according to the rules, and communication between players is highly advised. Tabletop Simulator has accompanying voice software, but Google Hangouts is needed to play on Tabletop Zen.\nFor those interested, a PDF Print-and-Play of the first scenario is also available, along with the accompanying pages from the scenario book.\nThe scenario available online is just the beginning, though. A scratch on the surface of the world.\nGloomhaven is deep and expansive. It is a game of exploration and discovery; of branching story paths and decisions with real consequences. You always have a choice of which scenario to undertake next and which plot thread to unravel.\nMore than that, though, there is plenty of content to support multiple game groups. If you want to play the game with someone new, you shouldn't reset the game, but instead just pursue a different story line. Each party of adventurers will develop their own campaign, but everyone will interact with and expand upon the same world.\nGloomhaven provides a persistent world of permanent choices without the restriction of only being able to play with the same people time and again. It does this by focusing on the stories of individual characters instead of an over-arching linear plot.\nAnd a few comments from play testers:\nNew classes will become available to play when players meet certain conditions in the game. If you want spoil yourself on the surprise, or you just really want to check out more amazing artwork, click here to see what else you'll be getting, or if you want to get a detailed look at the miniatures, you can check out all the original sculpts by clicking here (also full of spoilers).\n(Note that all depictions of miniatures are digitally modified pictures of the original physical sculpts.)\nI love Kickstarter. This platform brings together creators and their audiences in such a wonderful way. I absolutely would not be able to get this game made without your financial support, but what really makes Kickstarter exciting to me is the opportunity to involve the community in the creation of the project.\nThis project doesn't just give you a great game that will show up on your doorstep in May. It gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. There is also a scenario design competition to allow the backer community to make a significant mark on the creation of the game.\nMy amazing play testers have helped me get this far, but now with your help, we can not only get the game made, but also continue working to make it as great as possible.\nAlso remember that if you purchase the game through Kickstarter, you'll get the game before it comes out in retail and it's a significant discount off the MSRP (estimated at $100-120), especially after considering the added cost for shipping.\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.\nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nPledging at the MINIATURES level will get you all of the minis for the included 13 character classes (12 base plus 1 stretch goal). Any additional stretch goals that unlock extra classes beyond that will also unlock extra minis for you. If you'd like a better idea of all the minis you're getting, head on over to the spoilers page.\nPledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH STANDEES level will get you everything that you would get at the $79 level, except that you will get cardboard standees of the character classes instead of the plastic minis. You will also receive all unlocked stretch goals, with the exception of additional minis (receiving standees of additional unlocked character classes instead).\nOr you can get the whole package - all the content, all the stretch goals all the minis. Pledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH MINIS level gets you this.\nNote that this level does not come with standees for the character classes. If you really want both standees and minis (this is redundant and in no way adds content to the game), you can pledge at the $64 level and do a $20 add-on. That will get you absolutely everything.\n$15 for shipping is included in the base game price. All additional shipping fees are added automatically when you pledge.\nThe game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAll three main rewards levels are also available as add-ons. You can add $20 to your pledge to get an additional box of minis. You can add $64 to get a copy of Gloomhaven without the minis. And you can add $79 to get a copy of Gloomhaven with minis.\nUp to 4 $64 and $79 add-ons can be added to your order this way, PLUS you can add up to 5 $20 add-ons as well. You will not have to pay any additional shipping fees on your order.\nIn the proud tradition of slaying helpless rats, I have decided that to reward backers of the Gloomhaven project, I will graduate to a slightly more formidable - but equally prolific - foe: the animated skeleton.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar or more to the campaign, I will foray into a host of fantasy-themed games and slay a necromantic abomination in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, last April. Isaac also designed and developed the game. He writes a weekly blog about board game publishing, design and whatever else he is thinking about at www.cephalofair.com.\nIsaac graduated last December with a physics PhD, but, with the success of Forge War, he is now designing and publishing games full time. It's turned out pretty well for him so far.\nJosh McDowell started playing board games after his wife encouraged him to find an inexpensive hobby. The joke is on her, as that encouragement turned into an expansive collection and regular schedule of playing games with his friends. He turned to his graphic design prowess to offset the costs and is now completely engrossed in all things board games. He lives in Indiana with his wife and three young children, gamers in the making.

My previous project, Forge War, was rather massive as well, and I managed to deliver the game to backers just 1 month past the projection.\n\nI have learned so much about Kickstarter fulfillment from that project, though, and I fully expect this project will deliver on time without problem.\n\nThere is still artwork and graphic design to be done, but we should be able to finish that up by December. I know problems with miniatures plague a lot of projects, but James is very nearly done with the sculpting and he is a seasoned veteran in the field, so I don't expect there will be any significant manufacturer issues with the miniatures. We've already made masters of 4 of the sculpts without problem.\n\nI would say the biggest challenge at this point is going to be finishing the content for the game - both creating it and making sure everything is balanced appropriately. A lot of it has been done, but there is still more to do. I firmly believe I and my play testers are up to the task.\n\nWe're projecting to have all the content done by December as well so that we can allow 2 months for the printing process and another 2 months to get the game shipped out to everyone.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #95", "update_userinfo": "The Gloomhaven sequel is live on Kickstarter, now with a gift for returning backers", "update_content": "Hello!

One player controls one of the 7 Deadly Sins, employing monstrous incarnations of these corruptive forces in an attempt to consume the world and bring about the apocalypse. The rest of the players cooperate as heroes of the F.A.I.T.H. organization who will attempt to fight back the invasion!\nHere's a look at everything unlocked so far:\nAnd everything you can add to your pledge:\nTo find out more about these add-ons, go to these updates: Apocalypse / Gamma Team / Delta Team / Sons of Ragnarok / Men of FAITH / Plastic Token Pack / Art Book / Lithography Portfolio.\nThis project is another collaboration involving the same team that created the smash hit Blood Rage: Eric Lang, who also designed other highly acclaimed games such as Chaos in the Old World, Arcadia Quest, and Dice Masters; Guillotine Games, the developers of the popular Zombicide series; Studio McVey, responsible for some of the best miniatures in board games today; and the amazingly evocative art of Adrian Smith, as well as other great artists such as Karl Kopinski, Stefan Kopinski, Paolo Parente, Miguel Coimbra, Jacopo Camagni, Richard Wright, and Georges Clarenko.\nIn The Others: 7 Sins, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).\nFAITH Heroes: Thorley, Rose, Brad, and Leah.\nThe heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH\u2019s victory.\nRocco, Morgana, and Karl in wolf and human form.\nCorruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn\u2019t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences. \nA Hero dashboard with a Tentacle token marking his Corruption Level, and a couple of Wounds.\nThe Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.\nPride Abominations, Avatar, and Controller.\nSloth Avatar, Controller, and Abominations.\nThe Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.\nThe Acolytes: Corrupted Hobos, Nuns, and Doctors.\nThere are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.\nThe Story Boards.\nThe board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it\u2019s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.\nThe tiles that form the city of Haven.\nAs the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!\nThe members of the Hell Club: Marguerite, Grin, Gourd & Vex, Dr. Gan, and Flay.\nHeroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity.\nThe Others: 7 Sins comes with:\n47 Highly Detailed Figures Including:\n  8 Hero Figures\n  1 Pride Avatar and 1 Sloth Avatar Figures\n  1 Pride Controller and 1 Sloth Controller Figures\n  6 Pride Abomination and 6 Sloth Abomination Figures\n  6 Corrupted Nun Acolyte Figures\n  6 Corrupted Hobo Acolyte Figures\n  6 Corrupted Doctor Acolyte Figures\n  5 Hell Club Figures\n10 City Tiles\n6 Boards for the Sins Player (2 Sins, 3 Acolytes, and 1 Apocalypse Track)\n7 Hero Dashboards\n70 Cards\nOver 70 Cardboard Tokens\n27 Sculpted Plastic Tokens\n7 Story Boards\n8 Colored Bases\n14 Custom Dice\nHERE you can download a work in progress version of the rulebook.

Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. $15-$30 to most other countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 19th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is March 2016, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, and Zombicide Season 3. The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, and Rum & Bones have been fully sent out and are being delivered to the last backers, and we are in the process of delivering Blood Rage.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: B-Sieged which is in the final stages of production, and Zombicide: Black Plague which is starting production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of The Others: 7 Sins.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will treat it as abandoned and will refund or ship on a case by case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active. You agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #63", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update - Hanjin Issue 5", "update_content": "Hello Sinners!\nThe EU purgatory is inching closer to the end.

You will receive the rewards for the tier you backed, but you will not be able to comment on the Kickstarter page (unless you pledge an additional $1 through Kickstarter).\nThank you for taking the time to check out Divinity: Original Sin 2, our biggest and most ambitious RPG to date!\nWhat the press says\n\"I can't help but think that another Kickstarter success could help make Divinity: Original Sin 2 one of the most engaging RPGs to date.\" - PC Gamer\n\u201cThis sequel has some wild new ideas and ambitions far beyond the scope of the already-impressive first game\u201d - Polygon\n\"It\u2019s exactly what I wanted from a sequel\" - Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"If successful Original Sin II is poised to shake up not just isometric RPGs but the whole RPG genre\" - PCWorld\n\"Divinity: Original Sin 2 already looks like the best kind of sequel; everything looks bigger, better, and deeper. At this point, waiting a whole year until I get to play it in full is going to be torture.\" - MMORPG.com\nA couple of quick facts\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 is a single- and multiplayer top-down, party-based role-playing game with pen & paper RPG-like levels of freedom.It features turn-based combat, a strong focus on systematic gameplay and a well-grounded narrative. \nDivinity: Original Sin 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Divinity: Original Sin, winner of over 150 Game of the Year awards and nominations. Winner of GameSpot\u2019s \u201cPC Game of The Year 2014\u201d.\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 is currently in development for PC in English. Subtitles will be available in German, French, and Russian. Other platforms and languages may be announced at a later stage, once development is more advanced. \nThe theme of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is how your origins affect who you are and what chances you get in life. \nAt the start of the game, you pick a single character and determine your starting stats, race, and origin story. \nYou'll be able to recruit up to three companions, each of whom is just as detailed as the character you're playing, with their own origin story and motivation to help you in your quest. \nThis makes it possible for each companion to become a player character in multiplayer mode; every party member is equally important to the whole.\nIn multiplayer, up to 4 players can play together, either cooperatively or competitively.\nDuring competitive questing, you\u2019ll pursue different plot-lines from other players, often because your personal motivations are in conflict with those of the party.\nTo loot or not to loot: You'll have to argue, reason, or duke it out.\nThere's no obligation to compete, of course. Many party members will manage to balance their own interests with those of the party. Should you find yourself in conflict, know that it's always possible to make up afterwards.  \nThe important thing here is that it's you who gets to make that choice.\nWith each new conflict-- whether between dwarf and lizard or elf and human-- you and your party members will have to choose sides.\nLike its predecessor, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game about systems and using those systems to get your way. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be manipulating the environment, using new types of elemental interactions, and exploiting people\u2019s weaknesses to achieve your goals.\nThat systematic approach now also applies to the narrative. A new dialog system will give you many more options to persuade both NPCs and your companions. You'll quickly discover that nearly all dialogs in the game are different depending on who is doing the talking.\nWe're developing a new crafting system that provides you with good incentives to use crafting to its fullest.\nWe're also introducing Skill Crafting, a new mechanic that lets you combine different skills and spells to create powerful new ones. With skill crafting, you can mix a \u201csilence\" spell with a \u201csummon spider\u201d spell to make a  \u201csummon stealth spider\u201d spell. A \u201crain\" spell combined with a \u201cgrease\" spell yields a \u201cgrease rain\u201d spell. (By the way, wet grease explodes if it comes in contact with fire. Just another elemental bang to ruin your enemy's day.) And you can mix bleeding spells like \"lacerate\" with a \"rain\" spell to summon a tempest of blood.  \nIf you're wondering why you'd want to do that, trying taking the \"leech\" talent (which heals you while standing in pools of blood), and you'll be singing \"It's Raining Blood\" in no time.  \nDivinity: Original Sin\u2019s combat system was one of its most beloved features. Development on Divinity: Original Sin 2 will focus on maintaining everything that made its predecessor so much fun, while still adding new types of tactical opportunities and challenges. \nIn addition to new forms of elemental interaction, we'll be adding things like push/pull mechanics (so you can, for example, push somebody into a surface you created), a cover system which will benefit rangers and magicians alike, and several new gameplay mechanics, like the ability to use Source Skills. \nTo use Source Skills you'll need to have \"Source Points,\" and unless you're very powerful, chances are you'll only have one at a time. There are several ways you can recharge your Source Points, and some of them are downright wicked:\nDark Sourcerers can recharge their Source Points by absorbing the bodies of the fallen or by sucking the astral energy out of the spirits around them. (Visible to the party thanks to the new \"Spirit Whispering\" talent). You may be tempted to start cutting down everyone you see which (just like in Divinity: Original Sin), is just as valid a way of achieving your goal as becoming the village hero. \nRemember, though, that nothing free in life is truly free, and following the path of darkness will not be without its consequences...\nWe're planning on adding tons more skill schools, talents, abilities & spells, and we're going to be building all of this on top of everything we've been doing for the soon-to-be released Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition. That means you'll have an enormous amount of character development choices, with hundreds of skills and spells to pick from.\nExpect a long list of new creatures and enemies, plenty of new environmental interactions, and a big, varied world full of interesting characters and surprises.\nA more grounded and serious narrative will ensure that you\u2019ll feel invested in the world, but rest assured that we won't forget to make you smile. We have a bigger narrative team now, meant to ensure that you'll have many interesting choices to make.\nWe will also include an updated version of the editor that we\u2019re using to create the game. It\u2019s becoming an incredibly powerful tool and we\u2019re very eager to see what you\u2019ll come up with.\nTwo very different user interfaces will be supported - one for mouse & keyboard and another for controllers. If you play with controllers, you'll be able to use the same split-screen feature introduced in Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition. \nTogether with 4-player support, this means two couples, each on their own screen(s), could be playing online with or against each other! \n Divinity: Original Sin 2 aims to change the way we work with narrative in RPGs. We\u2019ve invested heavily in our writing team, hiring new writers with extensive experience in everything from screenwriting and narrative design to role-playing and table-top RPGs. \nOur aim is to create a world that reacts naturally to your character, and we want your characters to be unique, alive, and important to you. Most importantly, we want you to feel the consequences of your choices. \nGenerations after the events of Divinity: Original Sin, the upstart Bishop Alexandar the Innocent has declared Source the sole preserve of the Divine Order. Sourcerers are now criminals, and those suspected of having Source powers are hunted, apprehended, and forcibly purged of their powers -- leaving only empty bodies, devoid of emotion or free will, behind.\nThe Divine Magisters are known for weaponising Purged Ones\nFour burgeoning Sourcerers from around the realm are each a victim of Alexandar\u2019s pogrom. There\u2019s a bounty on your head. Divine Order magisters are hunting you. You don\u2019t know who to trust, and the world is anything but your friend.\nTo save yourself, you'll need to take on the greatest Sourcerer the world has ever known. You'll have to negotiate betrayal and deceit, the politics of a world tearing itself apart, and deal with your own Source powers. \nTravelling through majestic cities, dangerous wastelands, lost temples, and war-torn battlefields, you will be looking for a way to defeat Alexandar, discovering that the only way lies deep within yourself.\nIt will be, without a doubt, the journey of a lifetime.\nWe are financing Divinity: Original Sin 2 ourselves, but the ideas that we have can be stretched a lot further than what our current budget allows for.\nOur hope is that your pledges will enable us to increase the freedom and depth that will be present in the final game. \nIncreasing player freedom means increasing the number of options we give you, which means extra development and thus extra budget. The same goes for adding extra depth. Adding additional layers of content means additional development which, again, requires additional budget.\nTo ensure that we can get as much feedback as possible, we're going to give all backers Alpha and Beta access via Steam, and if the same thing happens that happened with Divinity: Original Sin, we'll be spending many months integrating all of the feedback we'll receive. \nThat too means extra development, but it's development we're looking forward to, because it'll mean the game will get better and better. \nWe will invest everything we receive on Kickstarter into refining the RPG experience we'll offer you, and by backing now, you\u2019ll be adding to the fun you\u2019ll have when the game is ready.\nOf course we'll keep you posted via regular updates about what's going on on the development front, and we honestly can't wait to start discussing all the features that we are planning.\nWe can't repeat it enough: community feedback is very important to us. Even when we're not publicly talking about what we're doing, we're still checking everything that's being written and said about our games every day. \n\nTo facilitate things, we set up a uservoice forum where you can suggest and vote for ideas you'd like to see in the game. Alternatively, you can visit the Larian Studios forums and discuss with other forum members or you can just drop your thoughts here in the comment section. \n\nWe're reading it all! \n\nDivine Magisters may anticipate your every thought and action, but we need you to tell us on the forums!\nPlease note Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition add-ons are limited to one each per backer. Add-ons require a base pledge of $25.\nAll rewards above based on concept art - the actual finished goods may look different.\nWhile we have several cool physical rewards, there will be no DVD containing the actual game. The reason for this is that we want to be able to continuously update the game, just like we did with Divinity: Original Sin, without losing time by releasing patches. \n\nNo copy-protection will be placed on the game itself, but you will need to go through either GOG or Steam to access your copy, as delivery of the game will happen though GOG or Steam codes. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're already funding the game ourselves and are coming to Kickstarter with the aim of expanding the game's feature-set and seeking funds to integrate community input. The biggest risks are that we'll be late (a real possibility), or that certain features that we are planning on now might be changed (or even cut) as we move ahead with development. \n\nIf that happens, it'll be because we hit a real roadblock or because some other feature ended up taking significantly more time and resources than we expected. Those kinds of things happen, but they shouldn't affect our ability to finish and release an innovative game that'll be a whole world of fun.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Divinity: Original Sin is going analogue!", "update_content": "Are you ready for another adventure?

The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them!\nHere's a look at everything we've unlocked!\nZombicide: Black Plague is much more than just the classic Zombicide game you know and love, transported into a fantasy world. While it retains the general Zombicide mechanics, several changes and additions were made for this new iteration.\nBlack Plague's brave survivors: Clovis, Nelly, Baldric, Ann, Samson, and Silas\nBlack Plague brings a whole new breed of survivors to Zombicide, hailing from all walks of medieval life, and even including some fantasy races like dwarves and elves! Each of these heroes posses their own unique abilities to face the zombie horde, from familiar skills to all-new ones.\nA survivor's plastic dashboard, with a full inventory of cards\nEach survivor in Black Plague receives a quality plastic dashboard to keep them organized. A built-in sliding arrow tracks experience gains, and plastic pegs mark wounds and indicate new skills. Finally, multiple slots hold all your cards, making the new inventory system intuitive and structured.\nEach card's symbol indicates the slot where it's used. Weapons and magic spells must be equipped in-hand. Armor must be worn on the body. Special items like extra arrows can be stashed in your backpack. Survivors have varying equipment specializations, allowing them to equip a particular card on the body slot, and still have it instantly accessible.\nArmor introduces a new twist for Zombicide veterans. A survivor wearing armor (or carrying a shield) has a chance of blocking multiple zombie attacks with a lucky roll (although it\u2019s no help against the Abomination).\nThe Black Plague itself: Runner, Walker, Necromancer, Abomination, and Fatty\nThe zombie hordes shuffling around Zombicide: Black Plague\u2019s alleys were raised by powerful Necromancers. When these dark masters enter the board, even more zombies spawn every round. But, instead of mindlessly chasing survivors, Necromancers will try to escape and spread more dread across the land! If they\u2019re not eliminated, the avalanche of zombies only gets worse!\nThe always terrifying Abomination ignores your armor, and is practically invulnerable to your weapons. Your only hope is to lay a trap of Dragon Bile in his path. Light it up with a torch at the right moment, and you\u2019ll see there\u2019s almost no problem that can\u2019t be solved with the judicious application of Dragon Fire!\nThe highly detailed Black Plague survivor miniatures\nAnd the frighteningly detailed Black Plague zombies!\nZombicide: Black Plague comes with dozens and dozens of incredibly detailed miniatures. Survivors have detachable colored plastic bases to help identify them, matching the color of the pegs on your survivor dashboard.\nA sample of the 9 tiles included in Black Plague\nThe Black Plague tiles create a rich and intricate medieval town. Street zones don't spread across multiple tiles, creating lots of twisting alleys for you to try and evade the oncoming undead. And if you find one of the secret vaults, you may be able to cross the entire map a lot faster (and you may even find a couple of very powerful artifacts down there).\nZombicide: Black Plague comes with:\n9 double-sided game tiles \n71 miniatures \n6 survivor plastic dashboards, color bases, and ID Cards \n48 plastic trackers \n6 dice \n125 cards\n63 tokens\n1 Rulebook\nPreview Rulebook:\nhttp://cmon.co/ZF-BP-RULEBOOK-KS\nPlease be aware that this is a Preview Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nBut that's not all we've uncovered from this ancient time!\nZombicide: Wulfsburg is a blood-curdling expansion for Zombicide: Black Plague!\nWulfsburg's dauntless survivors: Theo, Ariane, Karl, and Morrigan\nWulfsburg not only introduces four new survivors to your Zombicide: Black Plague games, but each of them comes with their own plastic dashboard, colored bases and trackers. That means this expansion allows you expand your group to up to 10 survivors at the same time!\nWolfz and the terrifying Wolf-Bomination!\nYou'll need all the help you can get when fighting the Wulfsburg zombies: packs of ravenous zombie wolves (or Wolfz)! Even faster than Runners, these Wolfz can easily tear apart any careless survivor. And pray the pack leader doesn't show up. Just as relentless as the normal Wolfz, the hulking Wolf-Bomination is as resilient as any Abomination, also ignoring any armor on its attacks.\nThe powerful magic weapons from Wulfsburg\nTo help you on your quest, Wulfsburg comes with several unique magic equipment. Most of these items are so powerful that survivors are only able to wield them once they reach a specific danger level.\nThe new tiles in Wulfsburg introduce a new strategic feature into Zombicide in the form of large towers you can climb. From the ramparts, you can fire at the zombies below, but they have to go all the way around to the stairs to reach you. This high vantage point even allows you to fire over buildings, provided your attack has enough range.\nThe highly detailed Wulfsburg miniatures\n Zombicide: Wulfsburg comes with:\n2 double-sided game tiles \n22 zombie wolf miniatures \n4 survivor miniatures and ID cards \n4 plastic dashboards and color bases \n32 plastic trackers\n30 cards\n1 Rulebook\nJoin us for a little session of Zombicide: Black Plague with the CMON team and special guest Steve Avery!\nHuntsman - $100\nHuntsman Level pledges will receive: Zombicide: Black Plague (MSRP $100) + Hero Box (MSRP $25) + All Applicable Stretch Goals.\nKnight - $150\nKnight Level pledges will receive: Zombicide: Black Plague (MSRP $100) + Zombicide: Wulfsburg (MSRP $60) + Hero Box (MSRP $25) + Gowan exclusive survivor miniature and ID card + All Applicable Stretch Goals.\nThe Hero Box that all Huntsman and Knight level backers will get contains not only 5 new Survivors to add to your zombie-killing party (including their miniatures and ID cards), but also 2 more plastic dashboards, each with 8 colored plastic trackers and color base, allowing you to add two more players to your game!\nHero Box: Glynda Battlestout, Julian, Sylvia Samedi, Tucker, and Arnaud\nKnight level backers will also get the Kickstarter Exclusive survivor Gowan, including his miniature and ID card.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\n More on Grom & Thalia HERE.\n More on Jovem Nerd's box HERE.\n More on Neal Adams' box HERE.\n More on Edouard Guiton's box HERE.\nMore on Stefan Kopinski's box HERE and HERE, and HERE.\n More on Karl Kopinski's box HERE and HERE.\nMore on John Howe's box HERE, HERE and HERE.\n More on Paolo Parente's box HERE.\n More on Adrian Smith's box HERE and HERE.\n More on Gipi's box HERE.\n More on Carl Critchlow's box HERE, HERE, and HERE.\nMore on Deadeye Walkers box HERE.\nMore on NPC-2 box HERE and HERE.\n More on the Plastic Token Pack HERE.\nMore on the 3D Doors HERE.\n More on the Deck Holders Set HERE.\nMore on the Counter Bases Pack HERE.\n More on the Extra Tiles Pack HERE.\nMore on Murder of Crowz HERE. \nMore on the Abomination Pack HERE.\nPlease Take Note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship.

Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world).

For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Myth is a cooperative game for 2 to 5 players developed and published by MegaCon Games. Blackwall Warrens and the Shores of Kanis expand and update the world of Myth with Journeyman Heroes, terrifying new monsters, exciting new weapons and armor sets, and a revised rule set and cards. \nHere's a look at everything you've unlocked so far!\n                            Click the link below to learn how to play Myth.\nThe kingdom of the Okian lies at the heart of sun-scorched Kanis. It is a sand-blasted land where massive stone monuments rise to honor the dark master Anunkara, Keeper of the Dead.\nUnder the sprawling ruins of the once great trading city of Blackwall lies the Knot. The maze of tunnels house uncounted evils. In the deep dark of the warrens courage is tested and fear takes hold.\nWhat is NEW!\nThere is a lot of new. \n5 \"light\" Journeyman Hero decks (Shores of Kanis)\n5 \"dark\" Journeyman Hero decks (Blackwall Warrens)\nNew Heroes: Swashbuckler and the Outsider\nCommander class monsters\nNew Bosses, Mini-bosses, Captains, and Minions\nOrange tier weapons and gear\nGold tier armor sets\nDual wielding\nMalice pool\nMyth Module System\nNew realm tiles\nNew traps\nNew titles\nCapture and Interrogate rules\nBar Fight alternate game mode\nWhat is UPDATED.\n2nd Edition rules  \nAll base game Hero cards\nAll KS exclusive Hero and item cards (Trickster, Skald, Spriggan) \nAll base game item cards \nTrap deck\nOver the last year, we've been able to focus on the Myth base game. We've updated the rules, which you can download below. They are more streamlined and function like more traditional board game rule books. \nThe entire run of Hero and item cards has been revised for clarity and amended using keywords. These have been released for some time through the Myth patch system on our website and have already been played with and tested by hundreds of players.\nThe trap system has been completely overhauled. Traps are more straightforward and deck based, with setup images and explanation on each card. Furthermore, any trap can be used on any realm tile. \nFinally, we've made a clear distinction between story quests\u2014now expanded and renamed in the form of Myth modules\u2014and the much more robust, free-form questing, referred to as Adventuring.\nMyth Modules vs. Adventuring\nThe Myth quest system has been re-imagined. The overlapping story and free-form questing nature of the base game has been overhauled. We\u2019ve separated them completely into two modes: Modules and Adventuring.\nModules are greatly expanded, lore-filled story quests. Everything for setup has been provided and explained. Players in modules ignore realm tile legends. Setup is as easy as placing the minis and objects where the images indicate.\nFurthermore, modules have a larger story and expand the lore of Myth. They place you in the world and immerse you with the history and richness of the events taking place. Narrated sections of the module are read by a participant, yet the game remains fully cooperative.\nFree-form questing is now referred to as adventuring. While adventuring, players utilize the legends on the realm tiles and populate their quest per the quest cards. However, the adventuring system provides room for the discovery of Bosses and the earning of titles.\nThe new monster classification, Commanders, are key here. Commanders make those monsters under them exceedingly more difficult. Commanders can also be captured and interrogated by the Heroes to find a Boss\u2019 lair. Most importantly, these two modes of play are now completely separate. There is no crossover. Myth is either played by using a module or by adventuring\u2014never both.\nHeroes\nThe two new Heroes that come in the expansions are the Swashbuckler (Shores of Kanis) and the Outsider (Blackwall Warrens). Like the other Myth Heroes, they have unique play styles and offer their own set of challenges. Each new expansion Hero also has their journeyman deck upgrades included in their box.\nThe Swashbuckler is a pure dual wielder and only follows the light path. He consistently has the capacity to activate his secondary weapon and the extra Fate Dice to trigger that weapon's power. Additionally, he is much more at home in danger, surrounded by a host of monsters or facing off one-on-one with a boss. He is an absolute blast to play. \nThe Outsider utilizes the Malice system and only follows the dark path. When Heroes take advantage of the Darkness and strike out of revenge, Malice is generated. This Malice finds its way into a pool that only certain Heroes can access. The Outsider may choose to make a played card more powerful by utilizing Malice to supplement it as defined by the card. Additionally, the Outsider is very good at manipulating the Darkness meter to his own nefarious purposes.   \nBeyond the new Heroes, each expansion provides players with the means to upgrade their existing Heroes from Novice to Journeyman. Journeyman Heroes have made a choice: to follow the light or listen to the whispers of the Darkness. \nThe light Journeyman Heroes are found in the Shores of Kanis. The dark Journeyman Heroes are found in Blackwall Warrens. \nLook for updates that detail the Journeyman Heroes.\nShipping information - Please take note  \nBased on our experience with Myth, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter ends. This cost will be based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign concludes.  \nThis charge will be calculated by our shipping partner with maximum discounts applied. \nSimply put, shipping costs change considerably in the months between a KS end and the actual shipping date. Estimating future costs in the present is impossible, and not being flexible enough to recoup skyrocketing shipping costs is not economically feasible for us anymore.\nAdditionally, MegaCon Games will be responsible for shipping a backer's reward ONCE to the address on file. If the backer has not taken the responsibility to update his or her address, or does not claim the package in the time provided, then reshipping the item will be done so at additional expense to the backer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Myth and MERCS we have produced miniatures, dice, books, cards, maps, and counters.

It's like its an afterthought with the big games companies, tacked on the end of a release with some cheap tokens or flimsy card terrain.\nReal Dungeon Scenery has been forgotten for long enough!\nIf you are the kind of gamer who wants an engaging and immersive environment when you play your favorite games.

The risks to this project are very minimal. We do this kind of model design, prototyping, mouldmaking and casting, every day. And have been doing so for 5 years, as a small company. \n\nNow, things are looking like it is time to expand. I have quit my full time day-job to run Zealot. And this is our chance to grow the range and put Zealot on the miniatures map!\n\nFor this project, the digital sculpting, 3d printing of prototypes and casting, all happens in-house. There are no delays or problems caused by outsourcing every stage to another company and trying to slot into their schedule. The only exception, is the production of the plastic dungeon floor and wall tiles (stretch goal), which will be outsourced to an experienced injection moulder.\n\nRisk#1: Resin speed of manufacture. \nResin is a labor intensive material to cast with. Casting 30 units or casting 3000 units, its the same amount of time and work to produce each unit. That's why we have staggered the release dates on some pledges (\"Early Pledges\"), to accommodate for this to some degree. \nIf the project is particularly successful, then this may overstretch our current capacity. In the event of this looking likely, we will expand production with new staff and equipment. \nIn the event of a extremely successful funding period, we can outsource any stage of production to our trusted long term business contacts. \n\nThat is about all the foreseen risks to this project.

To order add-ons make a note of what you want and add the total cost to your pledge. After the Kickstarter ends we will send you our pledge manager and you can tell us which add-ons you chose. Shipping for add-ons is included.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL NEED A MINIMUM OF A DUNGEON PLEDGE TO BUY ADD-ONS. \nThe Wall Converters are used to make multi-levels by changing standard walls into sheer walls.\nWe will be using the BackerKit pledge manager to fulfill our orders. We used BackerKit for our Sci-fi terrain and were happy with the results. We will send our backers the pledge manager about two weeks after the Kickstarter ends. You then use the pledge manager to order your add-ons and to give us your shipping details.\nWe recommend storing your terrain in sturdy plastic containers. We use containers that measure L 35cm x W 21cm x H 14cm which can fit up to 52 assembled Walls. The small containers are 7cm high and are ideal for assembled room items and clips.\nContainers of this type are available in any good stationary shop for about \u00a38 (large) or \u00a34 (small). Please note that we do not provide containers.\n1. Choose your reward level and your add-ons. Add the two together.\n2. Add the shipping costs. UK postage is free and postage for add-ons is included.

As we design and make the terrain ourselves we already have a working prototype and this has been play tested as was our Sci-fi range.\n\nWe know how much it will cost, how long it will take to produce and how much delivery will cost in both time and money.\n\nWe have taken into account delays and problems in manufacturing and have given the time-scale as a worse case scenario so many customers should get their goods ahead of schedule. Issues can always arise and we are ready for them should anything go wrong.\n\nThe final product may vary slightly from our prototypes in look and quantity. As with our Sci-fi terrain we are pushing the manufacturing process to its limits and there may be some components that need adjustment and certain quantities may need to be re-assessed if there are problems at the manufacturing stage. Having said that we had no issues in either look or quantity with our last project :o)\n\nWe are ready to run and we just need your help to get this new range started. If we get stuck we will work through it to deliver you the best product possible, not a half baked compromise.

Watch this:\nThis project is not just about making Bitter Ruin's next album, it's about elevating the album to the next level. A level where our music can shine as brightly as any professional recording. A level that will open new doors to Bitter Ruin, changing us from an unsigned band into an independent entity with a buzzing nervous system and the competitive production skills that control a creative heart, allowing it to pump the blood, our music, back into the organs that keep us alive - YOU! We want Bitter Ruin to be heard on an equal platform. We want to stand up next to the mainstream chart, but with something different, something real, and we hope you'd like to see this too?\nThink Queen. Think Bowie. Think Bjork...Think Bitter Ruin?\nYou are the ones who will be able to say \"We helped.\" \"We were there.\" And we WANT your involvement. Please believe that we appreciate this involvement whether it be a pledge, donation or simply your support.\nThe plan: build a pro home studio and record our next album to a professional standard. We have always admired the production on mainstream albums; the instrumentation, the vastness, the quality of sound. BUT we feel that there's something equally special about those songs that have been recorded in a bedroom, and yet still make your heart beat faster than any overproduced no1 hit single. We know that some of the best albums we've ever heard were recorded in someone's garage, or wardrobe or special retreat. A place where the artist can choose to relax when they need or to energize when inspiration strikes. A place where the artist feels comfortable enough to try that new 'really weird song' that might just end up being the next Bohemian Rhapsody!\nSo we want to build a studio that will compete with mainstream quality, but in a place where we can take creative control. Home.\nWhere do you come in? Frustratingly, our forthcoming album has been waiting to be recorded for over a year now. We need your help to finish it. We're asking you to help us raise \u00a320,000 or more in order to finish building our studio, to record the album (actually TWO albums), then professionally manufacture and promote it.\nBut why don't we just spend the money on hiring a good studio? Believe it or not, building our own studio is going to be cheaper than hiring one and most desirably it gives us TIME. We want to spend every waking hour of every day for the next two months making this album a perfect vision in our eyes. We don't want to feel restricted by a certain studio's facilities, engineer's capabilities or producer's passion. WE NEED TO SELF-PRODUCE THIS. We want this to be OUR album, to create a true representation of who we are! If you love what we've done so far and you love our live shows WE PROMISE YOU, THIS WILL BEAT IT.\nWe have crafted some beautiful \"RUIN REWARDS\" to suit our beautiful fans \"The Ruined\". These are the type of gifts and experiences that on most occasions money cannot buy!!! But we've tried to make them affordable and appealing to you. If you're interested to learn more about each reward please take the time to look at the blogs and vlogs, facebook and twitter page. Here's a sneak peek at the luxurious \"LONDON LISTENING PARTY\" Venue:\nThe Gorgeous Listening Party Venue\nAnd a photo of a 'MEMORY DECK' prototype!\nMemory Deck Prototype\nPlease note:\nSO...\nThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us to really push the band. A studio would be an incredible asset to add to the Bitter Ruin HQ that will allow us to make music more efficiently, more professionally and more creatively. We'll be able to bring new music to you faster and cheaper. This will allow the recording of all future albums to be less expensive meaning that we'll be able to pour more funds into things like tours, music videos, session musicians, special merchandise, costumes and album art.\nWe will for the first time be able to put money into a professional and extensive PR campaign.\nBitter Ruin has been fortunate enough to receive crucial help from many volunteers, and as much as we try to pay everyone, much of our business relies on their free time. Your pledges will enable us to start paying these people fairly. \nMostly, we will be able to make the album that has been scratching away at our innards for the last year. THIS PROJECT WILL FULFIL A LIFELONG DREAM.\nFirstly we hope that you will find huge satisfaction in helping to fund this project, but you will also benefit by receiving more of our music, more of our art and some rewards that are absolutely exclusive to backers of this project. You are invited to join this community and will instantly be offered benefits and rewards that no one will ever have access to again. You will also share our benefits by seeing better concerts with more musicians, in better venues with better sound and lighting. You will hear our music come to life when recorded in better quality, and you have the chance to get up close and personal with us, like you never have before. We want to thank you!\nWe love you all, you know that right? Well, we do. We're very nervous. We hope this works.\nLots of love Ben & Georgia\nP.S. Estimated release date will be September 2013...keep reading for cost breakdown and FAQs...and here's an example of \"ART BY GEORGIA\" just in case you want to get an idea of size, style and quality.\n...and a reminder of those costumes we mention in the \"UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL BUNDLE\"...\nPlease ask us any questions you may have with regards to bundles and remember IF YOU DON'T SEE YOUR PERFECT BUNDLE, say for example you want a combination of two bundles and you can't find it?
