Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image.

The world of Thrones & Bones is the sort of place where legends are born, and I have no doubt people are going to be talking about it in the same breath as DragonLance and Greyhawk in years to come. This is the start of something very special indeed.\u201d \u2014 George Mann, former Publishing Manager, Games Workshop and bestselling author\nThis first volume of the Thrones & Bones Campaign Setting contains approximately 200 pages of lore and mechanics for your 5th edition games. Within this lavishly illustrated tome, players and game masters will find over 60 pages of lore detailing the people, places, and perils of this northern land, as well as new races, subclasses, feats, spells, and magic items. Norr\u00f8ngard features a mechanic for gaining and losing honor, an original system of rune magic, a bestiary of 29 new monsters (well, 28 monsters and a very cute seal), as well as rules for playing the ball game of Knattleiker, the insult-rhyming competition called Flyting, and the in-world popular board game, Thrones & Bones. Two complete starter adventures kick off your exploration of this fascinating setting.  \nThrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard is gorgeously illustrated throughout with original artwork from such amazing artists as Andrew Bosley, Justin Gerard, Ksenia Kozhevnikova, Randall Mackey, Will O\u2019Brien, Craig J. Spearing, and Bryan Syme. It features original cartography from Rob Lazzaretti and battle maps from Heroic Maps (available in a Digital Map Pack for VTT or Printing).   \nCreator Lou Anders is a Hugo-winning editor, a Chesley-winning art director, and a critically acclaimed author with 25 years experience working in genre entertainment in magazines, television, film, book publishing, and role playing games. In addition to his own novels, Anders has written Star Wars stories for Disney Lucasfilm and has done RPG design for Kobold Press, River Horse Games, and 3D Printed Tabletop.\nEditor Misty Bourne provides more than twelve years of publishing experience, having worked on such projects as Mythic Odysseys of Theros (Wizards of the Coast), Underworld Lairs and Tome of Beasts 2 (Kobold Press), and the Epic Legacy series, Total Party Kill series, and Tyrants & Hellions (2CGaming). She edits Hit Point Press\u2019s \u201cBig Bads\u201d (2020 silver ENNIE winner) and is the author of HPP\u2019s Animated Tarot.\nThrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard presents a world ten years in the making.  Although the Thrones & Bones trilogy is a middle grade series, Thrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard is not a children's RPG. This first volume in a planned series greatly expands on the lore of the novel, and as such, presents a rich, Norse-inspired realm that stands on its own and which promises hours of adventure for 5th edition fans of all ages. Take the first steps into a world of adventure today. \nThe Raven Guard, the Hrafnhird, are a group of 9 elite warriors who protect Norr\u00f8ngard at the king's command. A special, limited reward tier allows you to help us craft one of these 9 warriors. We'll work with you to determine their name and specific characteristics, then we will use your own likeness, or another you prefer, to create their appearance. Futhermore, your name will appear in the credits of the book. Be a part of Norr\u00f8ngard history forever! Limited to 9 backers. (Update: This tier has SOLD OUT!)  \nThe Troll King, Digr Miklimunnr, came to his position by being both the largest forest troll in all of Norr\u00f8ngard and Ymiria, and the only troll ever reported to have not one or two but three heads. A special, limited reward tier allows you to become one of the Troll King's three heads. We will use your own likeness, or another you prefer, to create the appearance of one of Miklimunnr's heads. Futhermore, your name will appear in the credits of the book. Be a part of Norr\u00f8ngard history forever! Limited to 3 backers (for obvious reasons). \nIn collaboration with Andrew Mills and Mike Sheridan at Alter3dimensya, we're proud to be able to offer the 3D printable Thrones & Bones Board Game Arena as an add-on available to all pledge tiers. This add-on will include files for 3D printing a Thrones & Bones board game with two variant sides. One side will be a faux-wood textured frame with the Thrones & Bones logo, for using the board game as intened (as a board game). The other will be stone stadium seating, for when you want to use the board game in your RPGs as a \"life-sized\" arena upon which the player characters must fight to the death. Also included are LED torches for adding lights to the corners of the board game when it is used in the arena configuration.  (Note that this add-on is for downloadable .stl files, not physical product, and that the final version may differ slightly from what is pictured here. The retail version of the Thrones & Bones Board Game Arena available after the Kickstarter is expected to cost approximately $35.) \nIn collaboration with Heroic Maps, we're proud to offer the Thrones & Bones VTT Map Pack, already included at certain pledge levels. This digital map pack will include all the maps needed to run the two adventures included with the Thrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard book, offered here at a sizable discount, as the retail version of the Map Pack available after the Kickstarter is expected to cost approximately $75.  \nIn collaboration with David Joseph Wesley, the Thrones & Bones Original RPG Soundtrack will be 30 to 45 minutes of instrumental music designed to accompany you on your adventures in Norr\u00f8ngard. For a taste of this Grammy-nominated composer's work, you can listen to his song \"Midwinter\" here. The Thrones & Bones Original RPG Soundtrack album will be delivered via Bandcamp, available as a high quality download in MP3, FLAC, and more.  \nDelivery of digital products\nAll digital products will be sent to every backer via email through DriveThruRPG.\nDelivery of physical products\nAll physcal products will be sent to every backer through DriveThruRPG.\nShipping costs are not included in any of the listed prices. Because of postal variations and yearly increases in shipping costs, the shipping for print rewards is calculated and charged in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter closes.\nPricing estimates here:\nhttps://support.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/209936893-Estimated-Shipping-Costs-For-Printed-Products\nIf you'd like a preview of the setting, you can listen right now to Part 1 and Part 2 of \"The Aptrgangr's Challenge,\" an actual play podcast of the first adventure in the book from the good folks at Table Talk. The episode is available on iTunes and Spotify and here is the direct link to their page. More episodes will be posted as they become available.\nMore information on the Thrones & Bones series, from which the campaign setting originates, can be found here. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk Kickstarter. To minimize the risk, the entire book has been written, illustrated, and designed prior to the launch. It is with a copyeditor now. In other words, THE PROJECT IS 99.9% DONE. Funding is for recouping the investment that has already been made, and stretch goals are to acquire even more artwork and to bring in other designers to add additional adventures to the setting. In other words, the book is happening. Funding and stretch goals only make it that much more amazing. \n\nAlthough it is my first Kickstarter, prior to becoming a full-time author, I worked as an editor and art director in science fiction and fantasy publishing for fifteen years, winning both a Hugo award for editing and a Chesley award for art direction during that time. Before that, I had five years experience working in science fiction and fantasy magazines. I've been a full-time writer since 2014, and I have also written RPG content for Kobold Press, River Horse, and 3D Printed Tabletop. All together, I have over 25 years of experience writing, editing, art directing, and presenting imaginative content. \n\nFinally, I believe very firmly in seeking the advice of smart people and listening to them.

The copyedits were delivered a while ago, and I am slowly updating the text to replace it with the copyedited text. Nearly done with chapter 2 (of 5) there. And I can't stop making monsters. We've got 37 of them in the bestiary now, the most recent additions being the \u00e4lva (a fairy from Scandinavian folklore), the galtifer\u00f0 (a ghostly pig of my own invention), and the hyldemoer (a creature from Scandinavian myth that is sort of a cross between an awakened tree, a dryad, and a hag). Of course, all these new monsters need artwork, and the last of that is coming in now through early July, along with a couple additional spot and half page illustrations commissioend just to fill in some gaps.

The is nearly complete with only print-testing of the arena portion remaining. And Grammy-nominated composer David Jospeh Wesley has begun work on the Although this is subject to change, the idea we are working towards is to have a \"theme song\" followed by music that matches the key settings in all eight of the adventures from the two books.

Please join us as we raise funds to continue our coverage of board games and the wonderful people who play them.\nWe are a group of gamers dedicated to growing and promoting the board game hobby and those who enjoy it. Tom Vasel, Zee Garcia, Roy Cannaday, Mike Dilisio, and many others produce weekly videos covering hundreds of different games both new and classic. Additionally, Eric Summerer, Suzanne Sheldon, Mandi Hutchinson, and Tom produce a weekly podcast all about games and the people who play them.\nBut that's not all! We also provide you with news, variety shows (such as Board Game Breakfast), a series of popular \"Top Ten\" videos, shopping guides, and more! All of this can be found at our website - www.dicetower.com.\nOur show gets a majority of its funding from our Kickstarter campaign each year. We have seven full-time employees and four part-time employees. Like so many of you, we had various plans last year which were disrupted.  We pivoted into a ton of live coverage instead.  This year our goals are to:\n Continue to produce regular live content on a set schedule \nIncrease interaction with our listeners\n Continue to increase the quality of our current YouTube shows \n Produce more top ten lists with special guests \n Upgrade our equipment \nYou might notice that these are very similar to our goals in 2020, and that's because I want to focus even more on the quality of our streaming.  The Winter Spectacular was something we worked hard on, and we believe we can bring ALL of our content up to that level.  In this campaign, we have a myriad of cool rewards but we hope that your main goal in supporting this campaign is keeping the Dice Tower on the air.\nWe are dedicated to keeping the show and our videos free for download and viewing, and we appreciate you helping us in reaching that goal.  We ask you to consider giving above and beyond the cost of the rewards to maximize what we can do this year!\nPLAY\n\nGoing beyond our goal will allow us to do more for you on the channel!  Here are some of our stretch goals!\n\nWe have a pile of wonderful rewards to send out to you as a gift for backing our campaign.  We know the value of these rewards does not come close to the amount you are donating to the show but they are simply a small \"thank you\" gift that we are sending as a token of our appreciation.  We also ask that you look at them that way - to donate money to the show is the main goal of this campaign.\nThe following promos each have their own pledge level, but also can be added to a regular pledge.  Simply add the amount to your pledge and you can choose which ones you want at the end of the campaign.  Realize that some add-ons will accrue more international shipping at the end of the campaign.\nThere will also be some add-ons that are only added on in the pledge manager.  These will include (but are not limited to) promos from last year, and more!\nWe can only fit in a limited number of these rewards, so they are unlikely to be available in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter.\nEach Thursday, we do a live show of Boardgame Breakfast!  Want to show us up in the trivia section?  Backers will show up live in one of our Thursday Breakfasts for the game show section!\nWant your own Dice person?  Tina will draw you (based on a picture you send in) in the color die of your choice.

It's taken a while and a little bit of courage but I've decided to try and release a fully-illustrated compendium of all the magic tattoos I have created over my time DMing for my parties. Magic tattoos are special in that they allow you an extra level of character customization (look that much more badass) while simultaneously granting you unique and interesting abilities (be that much more badass)! Why not give it a shot, right? There will be more than 120+ illustrated, never-before-seen, and functional magic tattoos, with much more to come depending on the stretch goals we reach!\nThe tattoos will also all be tweaked to be more in line with the ones being introduced to us in recent 5e releases. All the tats you'll find in this book will have some amazing flavor of their own, which will set them apart from the limited selection of existing magic tattoos and the large pool of magic items already out there!\nThe Elongating Tattoo presents some interesting new opportunities...\nFor one, all the magic tattoos you will find in this book are tailored to work in tandem with specific body parts! For example, tattoos like the Soaring Tattoo will grant you majestic inky wings when applied on your back (and only your back)! The Tome of Mystical Tattoos will also show you exactly how each beautiful tattoo would look on the optimal limbs alongside a detailed flat sketch for a clear view of all the designs. Beautiful full-page illustrations are also in the works showcasing the wide variety, utility, and power of the tattoos within this compendium. \nHonestly, the best way to show you the type of quality and content you can expect from this project is simply... to show you! You can click up there to download a sneak peek which includes some of the new tattoo mechanics, and at least 2 fully-illustrated and fleshed-out tattoos from each of the six sections of the Tome of Mystical Tattoos. \nHey again! I'm Karl Nicolas (he/him), a librarian, writer, and editor. I also manage the day-to-day of Natwuns as the creative director. We create beautifully illustrated maps for tabletop games along with other assets. This can range from monsters and NPC characters to magic items or comics, depending on our mood! I'm an avid D&D player and DM, and I am thoroughly in love with the imagination and creativity that this beloved game inspires. For this project, I want to produce the best possible book that I can for all of you, and I'll be working with some talented editors and artists to supplement my work in whatever way possible to deliver on that promise! \nYou can also check out our website at natwuns.com to subscribe to our newsletter, check out our social media to follow along with this project's progress, and anything else coming down the pipeline.\nTattooist's Tools... I wonder what those do...\nThis wouldn't be as much fun if we didn't fiddle around with the system a little, right? In the Tome of Mystical Tattoos, I will outline a system that explains the mechanics of things like obtaining tattoo designs, recreating found designs, and how the new artisan's tool - the Tattooist's Tools - fits into all this. I promise this will be a fun addition and something that you can forego completely anyway if you're only interested in some kickass tats! \nUnlocked Stretch Goals\n$5000 - UNLOCKED - 10 more tattoos in the \"Head\" section of the book - a total of 30 instead of 20!

Nope, that's definitely a mystical tattoo!\nSummoning is not beyond the magical tattoos in this book.\nNeither is domination for that matter...\nWould you like a full magical sleeve, perhaps?\nNo body part is off-limits! Well... maybe some.\nAfter you choose to back this project for the hardcover book reward in one of our tiers, you will be sent a link to purchase the book at cost from DriveThruRPG. DriveThruRPG Print on Demand services will print the book at-cost (this would probably be in the range of $15 to $25 US) and then shipping costs to your address will be calculated. This is honestly the most cost-effective way for you to receive the hardcover book, especially at this time. It reduces overheard and allows you to buy the book cheaper than if I opted to include the printing and shipping costs in the Kickstarter reward.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " LAST 24 HOURS! \nSkies of Sordane is live!  \nThe Skies of Sordane has now launched! After a bit of a delay (sorry about that everyone!), my team and I are now ready to present the Skies of Sordane Kickstarter!\nThis Kickstarter's goal is provide a high quality range airship and miniature STL files for your 3D printers (Both FDM and resin printers!). All miniatures will be test printed on multiple FDM and resin printers to ensure quality. After the campaign ends (if successfully funded) we will roll out miniatures after they are tested and completed!\nAll miniatures will be sculpted for 32mm/35mm scale!\nNote: This is for digital files only. Physical products will have to be purchased from our licensed sellers.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nMy name is Benny, I've been playing D&D for over 20 years now and love that I can still be inspired by others. As most of you can probably tell, I was inspired by Eberron this time! I said to myself \u201cI need some airships in my life!\u201d .. I couldn\u2019t stop writing lore and before I knew it, Sordane and its Skies were born!\nKickstarter allows us to present to you all the work we have been doing and the work we intend to complete and provide to the masses. We've take a long time, put in a great deal of effort and thought to create 5 awesome bundles each with their own unique feel while still remaining individually to one another within each bundle.\n3D printing has opened the world up for us DMs to make supremely customized sessions for our players. Since becoming a 3D printing advocate, my players and I have enjoy vibrant sessions on terrain and settings that feel exactly as they should!\nCore Bundles\nThere are 5 Core Bundles. Each bundle has 1 airship and 6 crew miniatures. All files will be printable on filament and resin printers (and will be tested on multiple printers of each type before sending out the files!). \nReward Tiers\nThere are reward tiers for 1, 2 or all of the Core Bundles. There is even a cheaper all in pledge that gives everything except the 2 larger ships (Arrodan Syndicate and Cin'dar Navy Core Bundles' ships) that will not be printable on small resin printers. The 3 other ships will be printable on small resin printers! Large resin printers and normal medium FDM printers will be able to print all 5 ships.\nMerchant Tier\nWe have a special merchant tier available to everyone who is looking to sell printed miniatures from our range of products. Our merchant licensing program is still in the works, but you can sign up for it right now! \nYou will be paying a small admin fee and 10% from all sales. Every month you will send us a report in a format provided from us.\nFirst year - $60 CAD admin fee (included in your pledge) + 10% of sales\nEvery year after - $30 license fee + 10% of sales\nThere will be no $100s paid yearly for your license fees. Stay tuned for more information on this as the campaign continues.\nPrinter Preparations\nShips will be keyed and sliced up for different sizes of printers. The 3 initial sizes are:\nAllstretch goal ships will be printable on small resin printers and The Fleet reward tier with only 3 of the ships, will include every stretch goal just like The Armada tier. The only difference is the absence of the 2 large ships!\nSmall resin printers from Photon and Mars sizes and up. \nMedium sized FDM printers like the Ender 3 and up\nLarge volume resin printers like the Transform.\nAesthetics\nThe aesthetics of Sordane and its many airships and races, are inspired by arcanapunk fantasy. The world is very much still high fantasy (dragons, swords, magic, etc), but magic makes life more interesting, deadly and ultimately more fun by introducing a high level of technology created from magic! It is entwined into every element of the existence of this world. \nNote: if you don't like the way something looks, the stretch goals will provide great amounts of additional miniatures and modular options for the core minis and ships. Please don't be afraid to make recommendations of stuff you would like to see in the stretch goals! Only the first initial stretch goals are set. More will come later!\nCin'dar Navy Corsairs from the Cin'dar Navy Core Bundle\nThe Gleaming Shard from the Artificer Guilds Core Bundle\nTesting out some homebrew rules with a couple of the ships =)\nShoal Class Trade Barge from the Merchant Guilds Core Bundle\nSize comparison of the 5 Core Bundle ships!\nCin'dar Navy\nThe Cin'dar Navy is one of the greatest fighting forces in the skies of Sordane. They are well equipped and patrol, not only their own territory, but that of neighbouring nations that pay tribute to the crown of Cin'dar for its protection of their trading and passenger routes.\nThe Ship - Roshan Class Cruiser - These massive ships are the main battle might of the Cin'dar Navy. Aside from the legendary Titan Class Battleships, they are equipped with powerful fighting forces and impressive armaments. There are almost no other ships known to the continent that exists that can go 1 on 1 with a Roshan Class Cruiser.\nThe Crew - Cin'dar Corsairs - The Cin'dar Corsairs are the grizzled backbone of the Cin'dar Navy. Ranging from eager fresh recruits to war-hardened veterans, the Cin'dar Corsairs are a righteous organisation of warriors that sail the skies of Bordair exterminating pirates and keeping the peace - Cin'dar's peace...\nCin'dar Navy Core Bundle\nMerchant Guilds\nThe world of Sordane has 9 continents and many nations on each of them. The powerful Merchant Guilds control most of the economic life blood. They travel the skies moving people, resources and riches all around the globe to seek their piece of the pie and live better lives.\nThe Ship - Shoal Class Trade Barge - The Shoal Class Trade Barge is a mainstay in the Merchant Guilds of Sordane. Heavily armoured, slow, but reliable, they populate the skies of the trade routes and above the major cities. The Trader Guilds save money and spend less on their ships. Opting for the less expensive Shard Blimps. Powered by engines with smaller crystal shards providing magical vapors. While slower and less advanced, they attract less attention from raiders and pirates.\nThe Crew - Mercenaries - The Merchant Guilds often hire mercenaries to travel the skies with them. These mercenary contracts are often short term as typically adventurers will barter for payment and free passage from one city to another parting ways on arrival in order to provide protection. Pirates need be wary for these seemingly innocuous ships can often contain a very combat capable crew of guardian adventurers.\nMerchant Guilds Core Bundle\nArrodan Syndicate\nThe Arrodan Syndicate is known as the Arrodan Guild by most. But  unlike most, they live outside the law in most of the nations where their operations can be found. Their size and influence provide their leadership with unparalleled protection from the authorities in the nations in which they operate and some even say they run several nations as a shadow organisation. No one knows their true numbers and they are entirely nomadic in nature and they are spread far and wide.\nThe Ship - Geshtar Class HQ Airship - The Geshtar HQ ships are from where the Syndicate operates out of. These flying fortresses have entire communities living aboard them. They are slow, but incredibly powerful and the focal point of any large scale battle. Few ships command the respect that even 1 of these monstrosities does.\nThe Crew - Ardragoons - The warriors of the Syndicate are known as the Ardragoons. They are a fierce and loyal fighting force of powerful wizards and fighters. Children are stolen from orphanages or taken from defeated enemies. Ardragoon training methods rely on creating new family bonds within the group. Indoctrination is how they operate and power is what they respect.\nArrodan Syndicate Core Bundle\nCarren Pirates\nThe Carren Pirates are one of many criminal organisations. While not massive, they are  well known for operating along the Chill Mountains between the nations of Cin'dar and Kaydlen. Their numbers are large enough to require frequent patrols from both nations in order to stem the acts of piracy in the region.\nThe Ship - Sintel Class Frigate\nThe Sintel Class Frigates  are a dated, still used, Cin'dar Navy mainstay. They are cheap, reliable and battle ready. After the war with the Oldathar nation, Cin'dar decommissioned older frigates and left them in storage yards. During a great heist, the pirate king Histalethen broke in with his crews and stole 20 older decommissioned Sintel Frigates.\nThe Crew - Carren Raiders\nThe Carren Raiders come from all over Bordair. Typically poor or less well off citizens of the various nations are recruited when they are young and impressionable. They are promised riches and freedom from past hardships. They often have deep connections with the well organised crime syndicates in the larger cities where the Carren Raiders need help to sell their ill-gotten gains.\nCarren Pirates Core Bundle\n\nArtificer Guilds\nThe Artificer Guilds across Sordane have a reputation for creating the most useful, powerful and dangerous items in the world. There are many guilds, but only few hold enough power to create such powerful ships as The Gleaming Shard. Crews often consist of wizards, artificers and their bodyguard creations.\nThe Ship - The Gleaming Shard\nThe Gleaming Shard is one of the most advanced ships in Sordane. While there are other comparably powerful ships, when complimented with it's powerful crew, it's nearly unstoppable. The Shard is also used by the guild to study the stars, nature of the surface and the volatile nature of Sordane.\nThe Crew - Watchers of the Shard\nThe Watchers of the Shard are a group of powerful artificers and guardians personally selected by Jexal to crew the Gleaming Shard - pride of the guild. These crew are battle hardened and employ all manner of magical aerial tactics. \nArtificer Guilds Core Bundle\nKickstarter Exclusive Monster Mini\nThe Arcane Dragon will be available to the following reward tiers for free:\nThe Fleet\nThe Armada\nMerchants of Sordane\nIt's just added value on top of everything else. I really hope that those of you who are on the lower tiers don't feel left out. Nothing is being taken away from your pledges and you're still getting the 2 Skycoaches completely free no matter what tier you are on. That's still some pretty awesome value!\nIf I know anything about Lee and his abilities, this dragon is going to be AMAZING. Head on over to his Patreon and check him out. https://www.patreon.com/minimonstermayhem/posts.\nNote: If you upgrade your pledge or late pledge to one of the included tiers up until the end of May, you will still receive the dragon file. After that, it will never be sold again.\nKickstarter Exclusive Arcane Dragon (lore to follow later)\n50 Cast n Play Bases For All Tiers!\nCast n Play have provided us with 50 of their bases for ALL TIERS. You read that right. We just added a ton of beautiful bases to our campaign for you to print out for your minis. They feature many different useful terrains!\nPlayable Interiors\nWe unlocked them at $160k and that will allow us to make interiors for every ship in the campaign. This Stretch Goal will add some initial development time to each Core Bundle, but we will still try to get the bundles out as we had planned before (one at a time and release them likely in pairs or singular 1 month apart or so).\nIf you are not interested in printing your ship with the playable interiors, you can still print the solid form pieces of each ship. This is simply an added option =)\nAll 4 levels of the Carren Pirates Sintel Class Frigate\nPrototype Work in Progress\nAs you can see from the images, we have finished the first draft of the ship, but there will be more work required as we go forward and we will be continuing to review and improve. Some things are final, some things are not. This ship will be the biggest of the medium ships (some of the stretch goal ships may be on this level as well like the brain flayers).\nThere a few things to note about the ships and their interior designs going forward:\nThe ships will have open spaces and closed rooms like you see on the lowest level of the example ship and the 3rd level with the engine room, brig and cannon battery. Lots of space, but they will have predefined areas\nOn the prototype the internal doors are solid, but we will be engineering a way for them to either be removable or able to open! Stay tuned for updates =)\nThe main deck or the \"2nd level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nThe main deck or the \"3rd level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nShip Dimensions\nThe dimensions of the Carren Pirate Ship are the largest of the 3 medium ships in the Core Bundles. It is about 70 cm long, 26 cm wide (excluding the propellers), and about 8-9 cm in height per level. It's not small =). The interior you get is expansive. I already have multiple sessions planned on this bad boy. The Merchant Shoal Class Barge and The Gleaming Shard are both around 50 cm long each and a little bit skinnier in deck space than the Sintel Frigate. They will each have 1-2 internal decks along with the top deck. The Arrodan Syndicate Geshtar and the Cin'dar Navy Roshan Cruiser will both have 4-6 decks (they are big!)\nThis specific ship will be one of the 3 medium ships (and all stretch goal ships) that will be pieced and keyed for small resin printers from the Anycubic Photon and larger. It's obviously not a quick build, but it will be with you forever and it will provide many great playing experiences. I am currently printing off the prototype right now on my Transform printers so I should have some updates for you of actual printed ship layers in a couple of days. Look for updates on the smaller sliced and keyed versions coming soon!\nNote: There will be assembly instructions with every ship for each of the different sizes of sliced versions! (small resin, medium, etc)\nThe main deck or the \"4th level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nAs promised, I have taken 4 popular Stretch Goals that were unsuccessfully voted for from the survey and moved them over to addons for people to help chip to reach more Stretch Goals!\nThese 4 Addons are just that - additional content. These would have been developed outside of the campaign eventually, but since we want to give you guys a chance for more stretch goals, we are adding them to the back end of the campaign for that extra push! (see below for How It Works)\nHow It Works\nOn each Addon, you will see a dollar amount (in Canadian dollars!) to add to your pledge for each addon. Simply change your pledge and increase the $ amount for the number of addons you want. You will be allowed to select your addons in the MyMiniFactory pledge manager at the end of the campaign\nIncreasing Your Pledge Amount\nIf you're not sure how to increase your pledge amount, it's pretty simple. Just go to the top of this campaign page and click the button that says \"Manage your pledge\" \nFrom here, you will click on \"Change your pledge\" and simply increase the $ amount by which addons you would like! For example, the Roc + the Rules Guide would be an additional CA$14. All of them would be CA$ 34 .\nDelivery\nAddons will be done after the Core Bundles are delivered. Same as the regular stretch goals! (The Rules Guide may come out earlier).\n\nBy popular request, we now have a Social Stretch Goal that we can reach! If we get 100 backers from the shared link below, we will unlock 3 unique halfling pterodactyl riders! (Please make sure you tell your friends to actually pick a tier - $1 donations will not be counted towards this goal!) - We have unlocked this stretch goal!!\nUNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal Link:  https://bit.ly/2HAT5cV\n\nMyMiniFactory Pledge Manager\nWhenever we are ready to start delivering files, currently planned for April tentatively,  your pledge will be accessible via the MyMiniFactory Pledge Manager.\nThe MyMiniFactory Pledge Manager is designed for seamless STL file fulfillment.

The base set of .STLs offer incredible value which will get greater with the more stretch goals achieved.\n A FREE .STL file is available here to test print for yourself, it also includes a Chitubox file if you happen to be printing on a resin unit. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5lxbh345cuumtq2/AAC3DwE0uusEhBaVH4zSQLv8a?dl=0\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere are the renders and original prints for each of the 25 base Dwarves. .STL files have versions with both an attached base or no base variations. \nPrinted physical models come attached to a black base as shown in the images and are printed in either Elegoo or Anycubic Grey resins. Models are on a 32mm base (apart from the Blacksmith who is on a 40mm, stretch goals might also vary).\nBackers of the digital tier will also receive the chitubox project files which contain the models hollowed and supported, the same files I used to print the models below. So if you have a resin machine such as the Elegoo Mars, Epax X1, Anycubic Photon etc... these files will just need slicing and should be ready to go :)\nDwarven Barkeep\nDwarven Barkeep Variant\nDwarven Travelling Merchant\nDwarven Brawler\nDwarven Brawler Variant\nDwarven Brawling Santa\nDwarven Santa\nDwarven Blacksmith\nDwarven Guardian\nDwarven Infantry\nDwarven Rogues\n Here are the stretch goals for this campaign. Work will start on these once the campaign has ended. Any new art will be featured here.\n\u00a32,000 - Undead Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a32,500 - Dwarven Wizard ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,000 - Dwarven Cleric ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,500 - Dwarven Ranger/Hunter ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,000 - Dwarven Barbarian ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,500 - Dwarven Paladin ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a35,000 - Dwarven Death Knight ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a36,000 - Dwarven King ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a37,000 - Female Dwarves x 3 (Artificer/Engineer, Herbalist and Sorceress) ---- UNLOCKED!!!! \n\u00a37,750 - Dwarven Gravedigger ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\u00a38,500 - Beach Holiday Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a311,000 - 3 Additional Female Dwarves (Warrior Tank, Paladin and Ranger/Hunter) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a312,000 - 3 Additional Variants, Logger (based on the Barkeep), Druid (Based on the Wizard) and Chef Warrior (Based on the Chef and Santa) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOALS :\n25/25 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Guardian Variant ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n 50/50 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Coal Miner ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n75/75 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Chef ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\n104/100 Shares/Retweets - Female Dwarven Barkeep ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\nWe utilise a combination of Pixologic Zbrush and Autodesk Maya to create our models, Marmoset Toolbag is used to bring you the model renders and Chitubox Slicer is the software for prepping our 3D printing files.\nOnce we have a 3D file ready for printing we transfer it via USB to one of our 3D Printers. Our farm consists of several Elegoo Mars' MSLA printers along with a Kelant S400 for larger/bulk prints. Prints take varying amounts of time, to maximise hardware consumable life, as well as printing time, we pack our printbeds with more models as long as it doesn't reduce quality or success rate. We have a range of spare consumables and a supply of resin upfront for incoming work.\nOnce printed we clean our models using a 2 stage isopropyl clean. Models are then given time to dry before going into an ultrasonic bath in warm water. Once done, we remove supports and then submerge them into water and cure via UV lamps to be sure all the resin is completely solid. Models are given a mild isopropyl rub after they have cured/dried, finally they're glued to a base.\nWith regards to packaging and delivery, we like to recycle as much as we can so will re-use as much packaging as possible whilst also keeping the models safe. We use a combination of boxes, sponge and padding(like bubble wrap) to ensure models are well protected.\nOnce the campaign has ended production will begin. .STL files will be sent out for the base models soon after campaign end to those that pledged for them. \nIf you have pledged to a physical tier we'll need to know which of the Dwarves you wish to get in your pledge, this can include stretch goal Dwarves that have been made at the time, although the manufacturer of these might delay your order slightly. Once the campaign is over and all the pledges tallied we'll send out a survey asking which models you would like, you can also email - EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com with any questions or queries.\nProduction on both the stretch goals and physical prints will happen simultaneously. If people would like to purchase additional physical prints of the stretch goals if reached then they will be able to at additional cost. You can add additional models by adding the value of them to your pledge (\u00a310 for 1, \u00a315 for 2, \u00a319 for 3 and \u00a322 for 4). If you do this please send us a message either via the above email or direct PM and we'll add a note to your pledge and reference it once all pledges have been processed.\nUPDATES - We'll publish updates to the Kickstarter as and when they're needed prior to the campaign ending as well as keeping people informed on progress once production has began. This campaign will have email: EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com dedicated to it, any communication should come to this email to get a fast reply. \nShipping costs added when you pledge, nothing else is added once the campaign ends. We have shipped plenty of these miniatures around the world, this is simply how much it costs and includes the packaging and postal charges. \nEstimated delivery for this project is June 2020/July 2020. There may be minor delays caused by factors that are not under our control such as postage delays or customs. We haven't currently experienced this in current store sales but there is always the risk of incidents outside of our control. We would endeavor to keep backers updated via the Kickstarter until all items are delivered.\n\"Please note the above estimate is based on a prediction we have done, if the KS becomes more successful than I thought this will cause the delivery date to shift.\" ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe base set of digital files are complete and have been printed by myself, so with regards to the digital base element of the project there is no risk at all. Additional digital stretch goals along with their test printing is also low risk as we have a track record of producing such assets in a timely manner.\n\nWe have delivered over 50 physical miniatures via online stores since enabling this feature a little over a month ago and have received brilliant feedback. We have scaled up to accommodate targets outlined in the kickstarter in terms of hardware and consumables needed for printing.\n\nIn crowdfunding projects there are always certain variables that could escape the initial plan. As a consequence there is always the possibility of a delay in delivery although delivery estimates for physical items are currently very conservative. These delays are typically caused by last minute additions to the campaign, such as new Stretch Goals, or are a delay within the shipping process itself such as problems with customs releasing the goods, there is always the potential for 3D printer hardware issues however we have spares and the means to purchase additional hardware if required.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "This pledge grants you access to all the digital .STL files for the Dwarven miniatures so you can print them at yourself.\n.STL files will be delivered via a download link and will not have shipping costs.\nINCLUDES:\n.STL Files delivered via Dropbox or My Mini Factory\nAll Models Test Printed", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["1,005 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Physical x 1", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 1 x Dwarven miniature 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n1 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (16 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Physical x 2", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 2 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (11 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a319 or more", "title": "Physical x 3", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 3 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n3 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers", "Limited (7 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a334 or more", "title": "Physical Rogues", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to the 8 x Dwarven Rogue variation miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n8 x Dwarven Rogues (1 of each variant)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (5 left of 5)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a388 or more", "title": "Physical -

The adventure includes pre-generated characters, and is playable as part of a campaign or as stand-alone play. Doom on the Warden is a new frontier for Metamorphosis Alpha, in both style and substance, and for the first time the pre-generated characters include wolfoids.\nFloating Above the Starship Warden...\nThink you know everything about the starship Warden?\nThink again!\nIt was a little-known fact that the colonization starship Warden had many discrete safeguards and catastrophe protocols in place should complications arise during its long voyage. These safeguards proved insufficient to protect the Warden when it encountered the radiation cloud. When the ship\u2019s computers analyzed the impending threat, the military A.I. enacted the Omicron Protocols, causing a portion of the ship\u2019s dorsal hull to disengage. This portion, hidden within the Warden\u2019s outer bulkhead, contains the classified military cantonment, code named \u201cLevel 0.\u201d\nUncontrollably drifting through uncharted space, mankind\u2019s first colonization starship Warden has survived for over 300 years. While floating through the interstellar dark, strange civilizations have arisen - mutant, human, and wolfoid. Battles have been fought, wars have been waged, and finally the end is near\u2026if anyone survives. The moment has come to repair the Warden and return it on its course \u2013 or to disable it forever.\nIn 1976, TSR published Metamorphosis Alpha, the very first sci-fi RPG, written by James M. Ward.\nIn 2014, Goodman Games worked with Mr. Ward to re-release Metamorphosis Alpha in a deluxe hardcover edition.\nIn 2016, Goodman Games released Epsilon City, the largest expansion to Metamorphosis Alpha since its debut.\nNow, in 2020, James M. Ward is back with an adventure to rival the deadliest crafted by the mind of Gary Gygax, Tomb of Horrors. Goodman Games brings you Doom on the Warden, the adventure that changes Metamorphosis Alpha forever!\nColor cover edition of Doom on the Warden\nAbout the Product\nSince the release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the starship Warden has continued unchanged, but that ends now. Doom on the Warden is the first-ever official Metamorphosis Alpha adventure that continues the story and answers the question\u2026What next?\nFormat: Doom on the Warden will be published as an 8.5\u201dx11\u201d hardcover, with an estimated length of 32-48 pages. (This will likely grow with stretch goals.) The hardcover is available with a color cover, or in a gold foil edition. \nAuthor: Mr. James M. Ward is the creator of Metamorphosis Alpha and a 44-year veteran of the gaming industry, with prior creative credits that include Gamma World as well as many D&D products during his time as a creator and Vice President with TSR. Mr. Ward has already completed the manuscript, expanding on materials, playtests, and notes built over a lifetime of gaming, including some that trace back even to his famed original campaign.\nContent: Doom on the Warden is packed with the answers to the starship Warden\u2019s biggest mysteries!\nThe Adventure: James M. Ward\u2019s most devious adventure ever! Part hex crawl, part deadly delve. Forty-four years after the original release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the second half of the voyage is finally being told.\nCampaign-Style Play: Drop this adventure into your ongoing campaign to turn everything on its head. Complacent denizens of the starship Warden will find themselves racing to uncover the deepest of the Warden\u2019s secrets, and to restore its course.\nConvention-Style Play: Three teams of pre-generated characters, each with their own individual reasons for undertaking this deadly quest, are ready to populate your table as the adventure was originally run.\nThe Maps: A map of the mysterious \u201cLevel 0\u201d and the military command dome found within.\nWhat is Metamorphosis Alpha?\nMetamorphosis Alpha is the original science-fiction tabletop role playing game in which the players are passengers on the interstellar colony ship Warden. Struck by radiation, the ship\u2019s occupants have mutated into unusual and deadly creatures. After several generations, civilization has been cast into ruins, and there is little knowledge of how to use the technology of the Warden. Reduced to tribal barbarians, they must struggle to survive amidst a backdrop of advanced technology, mutant monsters, and the vast spaces on an intergalactic colony ship.\nNeed a copy of the original rules? Goodman Games publishes a Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, which reprints the original 1976 first edition rules set. The collector\u2019s edition also reprints all the original Dragon magazine material for Metamorphosis Alpha, and has new content as well. It is available as both a softcover and deluxe oversized hardcover edition, as well as a foil oversized hardcover, and can be purchased as an add-on to this campaign.\nFoil cover edition of Doom on the Warden (mockup)\nWhat is Doom on the Warden?\nAt its core, Doom on the Warden is a horror story. Characters enter a strange, secluded location and are immediately confronted by incomprehensible foes who often strike without warning. Mad voices taunt them and, no matter how prepared the characters think they are, they are in truth out of their depth. Whether it is the primal dread of the shroud of darkness or the maddening uncertainty that vital equipment will work when called upon, the referee should emphasize the horrific elements of each region, seeking to unsettle not only the characters but the players themselves.\nThe adventure expands on the mysterious involvement of Earth\u2019s military aboard the starship Warden, previously mentioned in The Warden Armory and the Goodman Games Gazette. There is new information on what happened in the Warden\u2019s early days. Unraveling the mystery sends the characters through 4 distinct geographical regions, into the secret military command dome, and beyond. Along the way, they will be confronted by threats old and new across 54 possible encounter areas.\nThe Stretch Goals\nWe love Metamorphosis Alpha as much as you, so we\u2019ve outlined a series of stretch goals to elevate your experiences aboard the starship Warden. Here is the breakdown of stretch goals, which may evolve over the course of the campaign:\nStretch goal #1 ($7,000): CLEARED! First set of printable reference cards. There are 100+ creatures, weapons, and items to encounter in this adventure. We would like to create simple cards to summarize them for players and judges alike. These will be provided in PDF format and can be printed for use in game. This first stretch goal will cover creation of approximately 30 such cards, which should encompass most of the weapons in this adventure. \nStretch goal #2 ($12,000): CLEARED! Two new colored metal arm bands available as add-ons. First launched in our previous Metamorphosis Alpha projects, these metal arm bands mimic the control bands in the original game. These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. At this stretch goal, we will manufacture two kinds of new bands: the bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory). These will be add-ons available at $10 each.\nStretch goal #3 ($15,000): CLEARED! Second set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should be enough to cover most of the items encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal! ($19,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Level of the Lost! \nStretch goal #4 ($22,000): CLEARED! Printed endsheets with great art to adorn them!\nBonus stretch goal! ($24,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Android Underlords and Warden Adventures. \nBonus stretch goal! ($26,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Robots Among Us. \nStretch goal #5 ($27,000): CLEARED! Third set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should cover most of the monsters, mutants, and robots encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal ($29,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Mutation Manual.\nStretch goal #6 ($35,000):CLEARED!A sewn-in satin ribbon bookmark to hold your place when you run the adventure.\nStretch goal #7 ($45,000): Expanded page count on the printed books to include some or all of the reference cards. There are some printing parameters we'll have to verify but the goal is to get most or all of the reference cards printed and bound into the book.\nAnd beyond that...who knows?\nDoom on the Warden color arm bands (mockup)\nAdd-Ons\nThere are so many ways to support this Kickstarter!\nAdd-On Items from Previous Metamorphosis Alpha Projects: You can add any of the below print items to help support the Kickstarter and achieve stretch goals.\n Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, softcover edition, $30\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover edition, $80\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover gold foil edition, $120\n Metamorphosis Alpha deck plans illustration, 24\"x36\" poster, $20\n The Android Underlords (adventure), $10\n The Captain\u2019s Table (adventure), $10\n The Level of the Lost (adventure), $10\n Death Ziggurat in Zero-G (adventure), $10\n Warden Adventures (scenarios), $10\n What are the Prisoners of Rec-Loc-119?

These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. Backers of Doom on the Warden will be able to add on bracelets at a cost of $10 each! We will do a fresh production run to meet demand. \nThe colors available are based on the previous two Metamorphosis Alpha Kickstarters, plus the two new ones from Doom on the Warden, and include all except the rare command band. The available colors are:\nFrom the original Metamorphosis Alpha: civilian (brown), ecology (green), security (red), engineering (gray), and medical (white) bands.\nFrom Epsilon City: military (black), programmer (yellow), sciences (light blue), administration (dark blue).\nFrom Doom on the Warden: bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory).\nAdditional bands may be unlocked via stretch goals. Quantities are limited!\nPlease note: the arm bands must be shipped separately from books and will have a small incremental shipping charge applied after the Kickstarter (roughly equivalent to an extra $1-$2 per armband depending on destination.)\nTimeline for Release\nDoom on the Warden is scheduled to ship in September of 2020. Many of our previous Kickstarters have expanded significantly in scope as successive stretch goals are cleared. If this project expands significantly with new stretch goals, we will provide an update on release date.\nShipping & Handling\nShipping and handling costs are not included in the pledge levels. At the end of the Kickstarter, Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced via BackerKit. This allows us to add on stretch goals as the project expands. Expected cost of shipping/handling may change if the project evolves from a single hardcover. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run many Kickstarters and all have been successfully fulfilled.

While we ultimately expect to reach our typical fulfillment speeds, note that orders placed during this closed beta may take several months for fulfillment as we ramp up capacity. Fulfillment will be gradual, as we work through orders in the order they are received. \nThis timeline is our best estimate, but we will open submissions and start shipping orders as early as possible. Note that, in the case of high order volume, order submission for both hand-painted and 3D printed color miniatures may be made available in stages, with priority based on time of the pledge.

Our rendering and UI has re-imagined classic techniques for the digital world. Replicate the beautiful subtlety of dry brushing, ink-washing's ability to add depth, and much more. Printed designs will include subtle shading and lighting within the color texture, making details pop and adding fantastic realism to your design.\n\nBy giving you the option to hand-tune highlights, low-lights, shininess, hue shift and more, we will give you unparalleled design tools and let you see a whole new spectrum of possibilities.\nCutting Edge Manufacturing Technology\n3D printing has evolved at incredible speeds, with new technologies emerging all the time. We're happy to say that this thrilling new print technology means that highly detailed, color printed tabletop minis are finally possible! \nHigh-tech, full-color 3D printers turn pixels on the screen into atoms in your hand!\nColor is produced by mixing a range of color materials on the fly, allowing for full, vivid CMYK prints with beautiful gradients and detail. This technology employs dissolvable support materials, removing the need for support sprues and allowing for smoother, more consistent surfaces than ever before.\nThis plastic is similar in durability to our premium plastic material. Faint layer lines may be visible on the surface of the figures, especially in strong direct light.\nOne-Click Color Schemes \nNo need to have an art degree or knowledge of color theory to have fun coloring your character. You will be able to quickly paint your character in seconds, using a wide range of artist-designed color motif presets so you can \u201ctry on\u201d a wide range of color schemes or use them as a jumping-off point for your own design.\nA Multitude of Digital Paint Options\nWe'll offer a library of artist-tuned paint options for a wide range of materials. Experience the coloring-book joy of turning a character from grayscale to full, rich color quickly and easily!\n We'll also offer the ability to \"mix your own paint.\" Customize more than just the color: adjust shininess, highlight, mid-light, and low-light tones, and more. Your hand-crafted digital 'paints' will be saved with your character, allowing you to revisit and tweak them to your heart's content.\nTons of artistically tuned options for every material, all at your disposal!\nFive years ago, Kickstarter's support allowed us to launch revolutionary web-based design tools for custom miniatures.

We've continued to work tirelessly, adding content and working with the world-leading 3D printing service providers to deliver the latest and greatest technology--and the best custom miniatures on the market.\n\nSince our launch, we've expanded our tools and customization options.

And we're certainly not done yet! You'll even find several sneak-peeks at upcoming parts sprinkled throughout this very Kickstarter! We continue to develop new models for the site, prioritizing the most commonly requested additions. \nHero Forge adds new content every single week on what we call \"Treasure Tuesdays!\"\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has been an incredible tool to help us connect with tabletop and miniatures fans. This direct connection has helped us work with our most passionate supporters and offers an avenue to hear about what features and content you'd like to see added.

In particular, for their creativity and dedication, we would like to thank Glenn De Leon Garza, Ilya Bondarenko, Roman and Vadim at ZugZug Art, and Rich Carey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Will reaching your funding goal distract you from adding new content? Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The coolest game to ever hit the planet first appeared some 38 years ago, featuring an electronic tower that lit up, played music, and somehow ran an epic fantasy adventure game with its state-of-the-art technological wizardry. That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar.

So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components. Fortunately, we've enlisted Tim Burrell-Saward and Andrew Sung, both with significant experience on these types of projects, to assist us in overseeing the manufacturing process.

And we're finally ready for you all to have an early look. I tapped Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer, to do a deep dive on the app's heroic journey to date. As with all of these updates, keep in mind that we are still refining and will continue to refine until the game gets into your hands and beyond. Everything here is still \"in progress\".

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

As most of you know, the original game from 1982 was a competitive game. Players raced to defeat the brigands in the Tower. The first one to do it won the game. Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically. But we knew some folks would like to be able to play competitively like in the original. We continued to work on it even as we entered the Kickstarter and finally announced we were doing it way back in Update #11."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Let's Check Out the Box Bottom", "update_content": "As we move into this next stage of production, my plan is to post smaller, more regular updates and start showing off some stuff you all haven't seen or that has been updated since the campaign. Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

This is a very visual Kickstarter, and you will need to watch the videos to see for yourself. Each individual dice has a video below! There are 10 total dice, be sure to watch them all!\nMassive increases to production have been made; new equipment, hired help, and a more efficient process means that all dice will be shipped before September of 2020. This is still an overestimate, they may arrive sooner.\nOrders will be filled by backer number, meaning the first orders in go out first. If you haven't ordered and want your product faster, don't wait any longer!\nWhat you see in this Kickstarter is not what you get, because what you will get is even better. The funding has allowed me to make some major improvements to the dice. The improvements: higher quality colorant for the resin, higher quality acrylic for the numbers, better equipment to make molds for a more perfect dice, and improved sanding process to eliminate small imperfections.\nSome individual dice have gotten improvements, read the message under each one. You will be able to see the full improvements before finalizing any selections.\nMalfeasance \nPLAY\n\n Malfeasance will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAcropolis \nPLAY\n\n Acropolis will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAndromeda \nPLAY\n\n Andromeda will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nGrandiosity\nPLAY\n\n Grandiosity will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above and a darker purple paint for numbers.\nBotanical\nPLAY\n\n Botanical will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above and a darker green paint for its numbers.\nTempest\nPLAY\n\n Tempest will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nHellfire\nPLAY\n\n Hellfire will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nNoxious\nPLAY\n\n Noxious will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAphrodisiac\nPLAY\n\n Aphrodisiac will look a little different than it does in the video, the core and shell will be similar, but the paint for the numbers will be white.

But excellent results can also be achieved with the filament\nFree files Example stl files\nfree download:\nhttps://www.crosslances.net/2019/11/15/free-files-example-stl-files/\nInstead all the scenic pieces are ideal for filament printers, without any support necessity.\nWhen battles are raging in the world there are always those who choose to be part of the factions of evil and those of good. Paladins fight for light and peace, faithful to the sun god, these brave fighters protect their golden cities, do you want to fight in the path of light too?\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct sections: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\nWood elves don't like war but when the threat of other armies comes closer, they surely know how to defend themselves and counterattack!\nThe wood elves live in the woods and forests, they worship the goddess of nature, if you also want to defend mother earth, then you know which side to take\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct parts: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\n\n               Unlike the paladins, the chaos warriors have given their soul to evil and darkness, their hearts are dark and full of evilness, always ready to give vent to their weapons!\nThe knights of chaos worship evil and darkness: demons, devils and any evil entity.\nIf you don't have any pity on anyone in battle, then the chaos is right for you!\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct parts: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\n This miniature is our gift for you!\nYes exactly, you will just need to pledge any level, even just 1 euro and you will be able to download immediately!\nYou will find the download link in the updates as soon as you made the pledge.\nNow our regular customers know that we are not used to classic add-on methods found on many kickstarters.\nWe will not include stretch goals, but we will listen to all your suggestions during the campaign and we will try to sculpt as many pieces as possible based on your requests.\nIn the meantime, here you have some sculptures that you can receive for free in the \u20ac 22 or higher packages.\n\n\n               Crosslances studios is founded by 3 artists and their commons passion for the world of games.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Chess has been a game that was part of our lives as we grew up. As long as we can remember, our parents enjoyed playing a game of chess with friends, while having a glass and telling stories.\nMotivated by these memories, we decided to take a game that has been played for over 1500 years and create a set of uniquely crafted glass pieces that pay homage, but also add a new dimension to this iconic classic game. \nIt was a journey of over 12 months that got us to the point where we are ready to create the moulds so all we need is your support to start the production!\nThe process of developing the final chess pieces was as important to us as the result itself. From modern 3D printing, to an old school approach to glassmaking, our designs slowly progressed to a stage where we now partner with a factory that uses high precision technology to make our full set which requires no less than 72 simultaneous injection points. \nThe old school approach taken in the development of the final glass pieces\nThe result speaks for itself.\nThe Glass Knights are also a collection of the most refined shot glasses ever, that you can use to create a twist and a completely new playing experience, or simply flip the board over and you have yourself a tray of unique glass shots for your next party.\nYou asked yourself how come the drink doesn\u2019t spill everywhere, right? We took care of that. The food grade silicone is placed on the end of the piece in less than a second and it creates a seal that ensures that not a single drop of your precious liquid escapes.\n\nIn addition to the fun element, we wanted to create a chess board that wouldn\u2019t need to be hidden away when you\u2019re not playing. \nQuite the opposite. In fact, we designed the Glass Knights board and pieces down to the most minute details so that you would be proud to display it in your living room or office.\nRest assured that almost every person walking in the room will stop and pick up the pieces.\n\nWe were ruthless in the engineering of each piece to add intricate details on the glass, while ensuring they are durable so you don\u2019t have to worry about dropping them. That is why finding the right factory that could create such a quality piece of glass narrowed the search down to only a few that had the technology to manufacture the Glass Knights.\n\nAside from the visual aspect, we know just how important is the feel and the weight of each piece. The smooth surface of the glass and the intricate details, combined with just the right thickness, make from each piece an experience to play with.\n\nThe Glass Knights is created with kids in mind too! Aside from the fact that you don\u2019t have to worry about your kids dropping the glass pieces because they are made from one tough tempered glass, the pieces can be filled with sweets or dried fruit. \nThat will take their enjoyment of the game to the next level. The only downside may be that it\u2019s your responsibility to go down to the store and get the tasty rewards. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can have your free time while they play away!\nAlthough we don\u2019t recommend going around throwing your Glass Knight pieces, we did thousands of iterations and reiterations to create the ideal tempered glass that can be dropped and live to play another game. \nThe Executive Set is the add on that can raise your game to the ultimate level.\nWe introduced the handcrafted wooden board that glows in the dark in a limited edition that will be capped at only 100 pieces. Each will have a unique serial number as proof of its authenticity.\nIf you decide to upgrade to the Executive Set, simply choose the appropriate reward level. The only thing left is for you to enjoy it. You deserve it.\nEach Executive Set wooden board requires over 15 hours to handcraft.\n\nWhen designing the Glass Knights, we wanted to go beyond any expectations from a normal chess piece set and make every element have at least one function.\nThat is exactly what we did with the thermoformed containers that house each glass piece, as well as double as ice cube trays.\nNow with each full set, you will have 36 of the most unique ice cubes that are shaped as chess pieces! \nGetting the right dimension and weight is also something we looked closely at in order for you to feel the weight of each piece, while also ensuring the optimum thickness of the glass to make withstand pretty much all accidental drops from day to day scenarios.\n\nTo make things even more excited, we are introducing two free upgrades once we smash our first stretch goal.\nPart 1: Three Box Colors To Choose From\nThat\u2019s right! You will be able to choose the color of your Glass Knights box so that it best fits with your style or house and office design.\nPART 2: Water-Resistant Box \nIn addition, we know that you may want to take the Glass Knights box out to the pool or simply don\u2019t want to have to worry about spilling liquids inside. That is why the 100K Stretch Goal will also mean that we make the box water resistant!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating a Kickstarter project without a doubt can pose a lot of challenges. We acknowledged this and that is why we set out to diminish to a minimum each risk by working with a team of fellow Kickstarter creators that have successfully launched 11 crowdfunding projects.\n\nWe then started to analyse each aspect and reached the conclusion that most of the challenges arise in the pre-production preparation which defines the quality and pace of the actual production process.\n\nTo diminish this risk, we narrowed our partnership to two factories which we worked closely with for over 6 months to ensure that when we launch the Kickstarter project, the Glass Knights chess board and glass pieces are at the stage where every detail is worked out, without the need to make any further changes, before creating the final metal molds and starting the production. \n\nWe look forward to embarking on this journey with you as our backers and members that helped found the Glass Knights!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "1 x Glass Piece of Your Choice", "descp": "A unique glass King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook or Pawn to display in your office or home.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 159 or more", "title": "Glass Knights Pieces + Board |Early Bird", "descp": "Your unique opportunity to own a unique, full set of the Glass Knights that includes the glass pieces + board.

This time, he\u2019s deciding who\u2019s been naughty and who\u2019s been nice\u2026 that\u2019s right, he\u2019s not just Trolley Tom anymore, get ready for ."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "What's next on the Tracks?", "update_content": "Hello all you Trolley Hoppers!\nThis campaign has been a whirlwind, and we\u2019re thankful that you all took a chance on us and backed it! It was incredibly fun, so thank you guys for that! Now that the vast majority of games have been out for a bit, things are winding down slightly on our end. We wanted to give you guys an update on how things will be  moving forward.\nNumbers wise, the campaign is 91% completed. The other 9% represents backers who have either never responded to their PledgeManager email or backers who started it but didn\u2019t actually finish it. Of course the PledgeManager system isn\u2019t perfect, and it\u2019s possible you never got your email. I tried to help by posting several updates reminding you all to do it, just in case you didn\u2019t get your email, but I'm aware those may have also slipped through the cracks. Even though we were trying to cover all the bases, we understand that everyone has different circumstances, and things may have still been missed accidentally. I\u2019m here to let the remaining 9% of you know that there\u2019s no need to worry! You will still get your games, and, in fact, your entire original orders, unaltered! Since the PledgeManager is locked, you\u2019re not able to complete your orders on your end anymore. In order to still get your games, you can reach out to me, Maya, at  for help putting your address in and getting you on our weekly batches. Moving forward, we\u2019ll be sending out small weekly batches to get your games to you. I submit the batches to QuarterMaster every Thursday, and they get shipped out the next week. You can also shoot me an email if you\u2019re just curious about tracking or any sort of updates with your order in general. Now that things are really winding down, we won\u2019t be doing regular updates anymore. Here\u2019s a bunch of links to all of our websites and social media which will alert you of new games and new fun in general!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Trial by Trolley: Social Distancing Rules", "update_content": "Hey Trolley Fans, \nThank you all for your ongoing support! We have some great updates to share with you:\nShipping Update - Third Wave and Weekly Batches\nThe third wave is about to be shipped! We transferred the backer data over to QuarterMaster on Monday night. They let us know they got everything, and are just doing a final look over. This means the third wave will go out any day now! If you're on the third wave, you will receive tracking information to your email when your order has shipped.

I\u2019ve slipped and fallen on ice 3 times, so I\u2019m clearly doing amazingly. We\u2019re sending you this update just to fill you in on where we are right now as far as shipping. We had a really great time at PAX Unplugged! We were able to meet a bunch of you guys while at the con, and it was rad playing the game with you! You guys have some weird humor and apparently a lot of murder secrets, but I guess we all know whose fault that is. We\u2019re very excited to get you your games.\nLocking the PledgeManager "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Elaborating Production Update Info", "update_content": "Hey y'all!\nSo, a little more info about the delay. There were quite a few things that factored into us missing December as the estimated fulfillment window. It isn't actually very hard to be off on an estimate by a month. There is a lot that goes into making something on the other side of the world and then shipping it to all corners of said earth.\nWe added the Tram Sam mini pretty late in the campaign, and we had to get that mold started much later than the other molds. Typically, molds take 30-45 days to make, and there is no speeding those up. We really wanted to give you guys a great quality Tram Sam miniature, so we knew that was going to make our timeline a little tighter. As expected, it did."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 6552, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyanideandhappiness/trial-by-trolley", "project_name": "Trial By Trolley"}}, {"backer": "Impact!

This means that our fans have the power to continue or cancel the story. We crowdfund through Kickstarter because it allows us to bypass the traditional studio system, ensuring that the stories we want to tell are not constrained by what Hollywood is willing to fund. Every JourneyQuest film is produced under the Shared Cinematic License Agreement which allows you to remix, create, adapt, and distribute works set in the world of Fartherall. These are films funded by you for you. \nNote that anything marked with \"kickstarter exclusive\" is an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.  \nTake a moment to like and follow our social media and community accounts on the services you use (ZOE Facebook \u2022 JourneyQuest Facebook \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Instagram \u2022 Twitch \u2022 Discord \u2022 YouTube). Then encourage your friends and fellow JourneyQuest fans to do the same \u2013 these signups allow us to build enthusiasm for the campaign and communicate important updates.\nAdditionally, this year we are adding Quests to our campaign. We know that our fans are our best promoters and we want to celebrate this! For all backers at any level, we will add exclusive digital rewards to your pledge for every quest completed.  \n *Final Quest rewards are contingent upon Kickstarter campaign success.\nThroughout the campaign, our livestream studio will host JOURNEYQUEST\u2019S MOST VICTORIOUS CHARACTER, Fartherall\u2019s epic bracket competition. Your votes throughout the week determine which character will arise victorious from their encounter.  Every Thursday at 6pm Pacific, we will announce the winners of the current week's matchups and immediately go into live polling for the next round's winners who will be announced at the end of the livestream. In the final week of the campaign, we will live stream a 5-hour campaign countdown and finale on Friday, July 12th. \nIn addition to the game, we will host regular JourneyQuest watch parties complete with live commentary. Be sure to watch the \"Upcoming Events\" section above as well as our social media channels to make sure you don't miss a thing! \nSHIPPING\nIMPORTANT: WE CHARGE FOR SHIPPING AFTER THE CAMPAIGN IN BACKERKIT, NOT IN KICKSTARTER.\nDo NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now. \nAnything that you pledge over the cost of a reward level will not count as credit in BackerKit and will go directly to the JourneyQuest 4 production. Only give more than a pledge level if you want us to spend your additional contributions making JourneyQuest 4 even more awesome.\nFULFILLMENT\nThe JourneyQuest 4 campaign will be fulfilled by our partners at Ship Naked, who maintain shipping depots in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Australia. Barring circumstances outside our control (like tariffs or trade wars) we will fulfill physical rewards from those depots.\n What will shipping cost in BackerKit?\n International Backers: expect to pay around $7.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\n United States Backers: expect to pay around $5.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\nAll shipping estimates are subject to change but will reflect the best market rates we can find when fulfillment begins.\nJourneyQuest is created by an ever-growing team of talented and passionate actors, producers, crew, and support staff. Together, we've not only produced three seasons of JourneyQuest, but the ongoing Gamers series, Dark Dungeons, Demon Hunters, Attacking the Darkness, Strowlers, and much more. \nWhile our budgets are still a fraction of what Hollywood spends, doing it right means taking care of our cast and crew. Your support is what lets us keep telling original stories that you can't find anywhere else!\nWe are excited to shoot this season in British Columbia with talented Canadian director Joanna Gaskell, the co-creator of Standard Action.\nShowrunner and writer Matt Vancil has once again lent his talents to a hilarious season four script and will oversee production.\nProducer Tony Becerra returns to oversee production. He is joined by Mike Waverecan, a producer from M1 Films. M1 Films joins Zombie Orpheus for production of this season.\nSocial media coordinator Lee House will add his considerable talents to spreading the word about this campaign far and wide.\nOf course, it wouldn't be JourneyQuest without our phenomenal cast. This season we're thrilled to bring back Christian Doyle (Perf), Alyssa Kay (Nara), Fran Kranz (Silver Tom), Kevin Pitman (Glorion), Brian Lewis (Carrow), Emille Shimkus (Wren), Jesse Lee Keeter (Rilk), Bob Sapp (Karn), Samara Lerman (Assassin), and many more! \nZombie Orpheus Entertainment is pleased to team up with The Fantasy Network, a fan-supported, creator-distributed streaming service, to broadcast every JourneyQuest episode. In addition to works from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, The Fantasy Network distributes original programming from Arrowstorm Entertainment (Mythica), The Forge Studios (The Rangers), Recursor.tv (Nina Unlocked) as well as numerous independent producers (AFK, One Hit Die, Ren the Girl With the Mark). While many titles are available on The Fantasy Network for free, your pledge of $10 or more unlocks one month of Fantasy Network subscriber-exclusive access.\nWe will be using BackerKit for pledge management after the campaign. A BackerKit survey will be sent to all backers several months after the Kickstarter campaign has completed. You will be able to update your address, add shipping fees and shop our pre-order store for any additional items from our back catalog that you would like to add to your shipment. \nOur shipping partners at Ship Naked will be handling warehousing and shipping for our campaign from their warehouse in the US. If we have a sufficient number of international backers, we will utilize their warehouses in Canada, Germany and Australia as well.\nWorld of Fartherall is available for your storytelling and art under ZOE's new Shared Cinematic Universe License Agreement (the SCULA).\nWhat does this mean?\nIt's like the Open Gaming License and Creative Commons had little license babies: it's an agreement that gives you permission to create, adapt, and release your own derivative works within the world of Fartherall!\nCheck out the web page for the full details, but the fast and dirty summary is that as long as you abide by the terms of the agreement, you have the freedom to create non-commercial AND commercial Fartherall derivatives. Make a roleplaying game. Shoot a web series. Create your art. Sell it if you want. Or give it away. It's your choice.\nYou, the fans, have made these works possible and this new agreement helps us give back. Come and play, you're invited!\nJust remember to Share Alike, Transform (don't copy), provide accurate Attribution, and don't break the law.\nPlus, if you want your creations to become a canon part of the world, we offer a path to make them official. And a cool seal. It's pretty awesome. \nZOE and JourneyQuest are committed to cultivating healthy, inclusive communities where everyone is welcome. We extend that mission to improving representation both on screen and behind the camera. We're stronger when we work together to achieve common goals!\nWe welcome fans old and new to the community that will come together during this Kickstarter campaign and remind everyone that hate speech is not tolerated in this space. \nOur moderators are trained to help if you experience harassment in any ZOE-managed social arena. If we happen to miss it when it happens, please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know, so that we can take action to resolve the issue.\nWe are always happy to assist! If you have a question that was not answered here, please send us a message through Kickstarter or via the contact form at zombieorpheus.com.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. Sometimes we have to recast a role at the last minute. Sometimes we have to redo work in post if it doesn't meet our standards. Sometimes product gets delayed at the manufacturer. And any time international travel is involved, we have to be prepared to adapt and adjust with circumstances outside our control. But with a nine-year track record of crowdfunding success at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, our reputation should speak for itself. \n\nAdditionally, we now have excellent relationships with manufacturers, our fulfillment partners at Ship Naked, the team at BackerKit, and everyone else who's part of making sure that our campaigns are completed to your satisfaction. \n\nOur pledge to you is that we will always do our utmost to deliver on our commitment to excellence.\n\nNOTE: We have budgeted for rewards and production based on current treaties, exchange rates, and tariffs. Given political volatility in the USA and elsewhere, we want to make special note that our plans may require significant revision should domestic or global turbulence affect the production of JourneyQuest Season Four.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Tip Jar", "descp": "Receive access to backer-only updates and the post-campaign BackerKit store.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["197 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Stream it First!", "descp": "Stream JourneyQuest Season 4 when it premieres on The Fantasy Network with a one-month subscription.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Update July 24 - LAST DAY! Yet another stretch goal, announced today: a bonus story by John C. Hocking for all backers! Stretch goal bookmarks for all! And more stretch goal news, and The Legion of the Skull returns! All subscribers receive four stretch goals! First, a copy of \"Cubicles of the Magician's Skull\"! This booklet compiles the hilarious missives from the immortal sorcerer Skull who is our leader, publisher, and mascot! And secondly, a never-before-published Morlock story by James Enge, plus a new story by John C. Hocking! And a new bookmark! Additionally, backers at the Legion of the Skull level will receive a booklet of essays on sword-and-sorcery literature!\nTales From the Magician's Skull is a printed fantasy magazine dedicated to presenting all-new sword-and-sorcery fiction by the finest modern crafters in the genre. These stories are the real thing, crammed with sword-swinging action, dark sorceries, dread, and ferocious monsters -- and they hurtle forward at a headlong pace. \nLast year, we published issues #1 and #2 to great acclaim. The stories were well-received, and the fans demanded \u2013 more! MORE! We hear you, fans, and the Skull is prepared to grant your desire!\nThis Kickstarter launches issues #3 and #4, as well as subscriptions to future issues! \nPublication Schedule\nOur goal is to publish Tales From The Magician\u2019s Skull twice a year, with issues released in March and September each year. Issue #3 is complete and ready for printing, with a September release date. Issue #4 will release in March 2020, and others will follow bi-annually thereafter. Upon reaching issue #666, the Skull will travel to a higher plane and the magazine will end.\nSubscriptions\nSubscriptions are available at a 10% discount from single-issue pricing. Subscriptions are 4 issues in duration and are offered in print and PDF format. Just select the appropriate pledge level.\nPrint Format\nWith our first Kickstarter, we included a stretch goal to print the magazine on a luxurious textured, tan-colored paper stock that conjured memories of the pulp papers of years past. We love this format and will continue to print the magazine using this paper stock. It does mean a higher funding threshold, which we believe is worth it.\nInterior illustration by Samuel Dillon\nIssue #3\nIssue #3 is brimming with 80 pages and contains 7 stories, each featuring a full page black-and-white illustration. When appropriate to the tale, maps to strange lands and martial arenas are included as well. Each story has been written, edited, illustrated, and laid out in classic pulp magazine format. A bonus section translates elements from each story - creatures, magic items, and more - into Dungeon Crawl Classics game terms. \nIssue #3 features fiction by James Enge, John C. Hocking, Howard Andrew Jones, Violette Malan, Joseph A. McCullough, Sarah Newton, and William King. The magazine is edited by Howard Andrew Jones and published by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games, with layout by Lester B. Portly. An appendix by Terry Olson provides DCC RPG game statistics based on some of the stories.\nEach story is lovingly illustrated by industry stalwarts, and issue #3 features art by Samuel Dillon, Justine Jones, Doug Kovacs, Brad McDevitt, Russ Nicholson, Stefan Poag, Matthew Ray, and Chuck Whelan. The cover is by the legendary Sanjulian.\nIssue #4\nWe have already started recruiting stories for issue #4 but there is still more work to do. Our target release date is March 2020, and all will be complete by then!\nInterior illustration by Samuel Dillon\nHere are the stories in issue #3!\nThe Face That Fits His Mask, By William King\nHe could change in mid-spring, tear out the man's throat, feast on his bones, drink his blood. The beast of the change gibbered in the back of his mind, begging to be unleashed. His fingers splayed, his nails began to lengthen\u2026.\nBy That Much, By Joseph A. McCullough\n\u201cYou claim not to know me, and that is probably best for you, but do me a last service. If you can, gather what remains of my body and give it a suitable place to rest.\u201d \nTyrant\u2019s Bane, By John C. Hocking\nSomeone in the garb of a royal guardsman came out of the stairwell.  His blue armor was covered with blood and there was a fist-sized hole in his cuirass through which Benhus could see the wall behind him.  There was a sword in each hand and, as he advanced, the dead man lifted both weapons.\nFive Deaths, By James Enge\nThe heavy stone door moved easily upon its hinges; Morlock pulled it open and stepped through cautiously. Lernaion was about to follow when there was a sudden bodiless screaming and the door slammed shut.\nThe Forger\u2019s Art, By Violette Malan\nHis head wore a surprised look when it landed a few feet away. The body slumped to the ground, pumping out blood onto the grass. \n\u201cWhy do people always talk too much?\u201d Parno wiped his sword clean on the dead stranger's tunic.\nThe Second Death of Hanuvar, By Howard Andrew Jones\nHanuvar twisted, parried a blow that would have caved in his skull, and lost his balance. He saw the pit yawning, and the flame more than twenty feet below.\nThe Wizard of Rememberance, By Sarah Newton\nThe memnovore towered over him, its mouth distending into a translucent sleeve of slime. Acid burned Suven\u2019s flesh, and he screamed. In the demon\u2019s larval embrace, he prayed for oblivion.\nTable of contents page for #3\nMaps \nThis is a small detail, but we think it's important. The early issues of pulp literature occasionally included illustrated maps and diagrams to help the reader understand the fantastic places being explored by pulp heroes. \nTales From the Magician's Skull does the same. Doug Kovacs, famous for his fantastically illustrated maps in the role-playing-game space, has provided illuminated maps to explain some of the stories' locations. \nThe T-Shirt\n\"There is no greater honor than to wear my visage upon your frail husk,\" says the Skull. \"And now you can achieve this honor with a mere 25 of your monetary units. Dollars, I believe they are called.\" Simply select the T-shirt pledge level if you only want a tee. If you want a tee in addition to the magazine, select the magazine pledge level you want and add +$30 (which is $25 T-shirt cost plus $5 shipping).\nBack Issues\nWe still have copies of issues #1 and #2 available. Select the appropriate pledge level to purchase these back issues while they last!\n Shipping Costs \nPhysical copies will be shipped as they are ready. When you make your pledge, shipping charges will be applied. They are as follows: \nUSA: $5 per issue\nCanada, UK, and EU: $10 per issue\nNew Zealand and Australia: $15 per issue\nRest of world: $20 per issue \nInterior illustration by Justine Jones\n Game Statistics for DCC RPG \nGoodman Games is the publisher of this magazine, and also the publisher of the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (a.k.a. DCC RPG). Tales From the Magician's Skull will include a short appendix at the end of each issue with DCC RPG game statistics for the monsters, non-player characters, and magic items that appear in the stories.
