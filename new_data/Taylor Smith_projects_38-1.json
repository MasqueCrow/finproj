From a personal desire to make something for this somewhat incohesive, beautiful fandom, I (Louise Leung/ Potentialforart/ Izu) wanted to organize a fun project that people would be able to enjoy and provide a book that artists and others would be able to hold in their hands. It exists as a series that alternates between physical, curated books, and digital, all-inclusive books, giving the opportunity to be published to everyone and anyone who wants to be. Since our initial start, we've covered many themes: Food/Utensils, Spooky, Flora and Fungi, Superstitions, Science and Technology, and now Celestial Bodies. \nYou can see the previous books on Gumroad by clicking this image!\nThe 2021 Edition of the Object Head Zine centers around Celestial Bodies: Space and Angels. This book is a collection of illustrations and comics produced by 51 different artists put together in a 6\"x9\", 144 pages, perfect bound, soft cover with a rainbow shimmer effect. Artists for the book are paid a base page rate of $100 CAD/$80 USD per page (depending on the currency exchange). I pay this amount out of pocket and as an independent artist with a full-time job, I wish I could afford more. With this Kickstarter, I would like to give the artists of this edition the opportunity to earn more per page. \nThe following artists are featured in this edition of the Zine:\nPotentialforart \u2727 Derek Hetrick \u2727 Blacklimes \u2727 Cacoethic+Lenalis \u2727 Inktrashing \u2727 Louise Kay Uy \u2727 Juliette GMM L\u00f3pez \u2727 Autumn Haynes \u2727 Coey Kuhn \u2727 CORVIDAY \u2727 theHoleyness \u2727 Kimberly Wang \u2727 Nelnal \u2727 Chan Chau \u2727 Nicolas Ky \u2727 Hannako Lambert \u2727 CosmicSynapse \u2727 Sf\u00e9 R.

Using this service, all packages will have a tracking number given to the customer when the products are ready to be delivered and should be overall cheaper to ship out to customers both domestic and internationally.\n White Squirrel is a USA based, small company that works alongside creators to help distribute their products to their customer base. Run by Andrea and Sasha, they will be responsible for making sure all packages have the correct merchandise and sending them out on a prompt schedule.  To date, they've successfully mailed out over 32,000 packages and have worked (and are currently working with) 60+ projects and 40 creators.\nSince the main purpose of this Kickstarter is to earn more money for our artists, the stretch goals are made to reflect that:\n$12650: Artists will receive another additional $25 pay increase, totallying $75 pay increase to their page rate.\n$15000: Artists will receive another additional $50 pay increase, totaling $100 pay increase to their page rate. \nThis timeline is approximate due to many uncertainties currently going on: global pandemic, political strife, delayed postal services. If everything went smoothly and there were only a few delays, this would be the ideal timeline:\n Early-Mid November: Start the Kickstarter, I will order the books and remaining, less time-sensitive merchandise when I have a good sense of the numbers needed to fulfill the KS order. \n Late November/December: Kickstarter finishes funding, I will send out the artists' additional payment once the money is cleared with Kickstarter and the bank. I will use the remaining money for shipping products to White Squirrel. Hopefully, receive all the merchandise needed. \n  Mid December - January: Hopefully receive books, start drawing in them.\n February: Finish drawing in books. Send books and merchandise out to White Squirrel\n March: White Squirrel receives the books and merchandise and can start sorting and mailing things out. \n Possibly Late March - Mid April: Everything is completed, leftover books will be sold at the Gumroad store\nAgain, this is the ideal timeline and everything is very much subject to unpredictable delays and unforeseen circumstances. We will notify everyone through updates should any issues arise but we're hoping we can stick to this schedule, the world permitting.\n Project Lead: Potentialforart/Louise Leung\n Kickstarter Manager: Mia \"Hye\" Mardikian\n Kickstarter Video Creator: Iris Jay", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my seventh year producing the Object Head Zine and I've made tens of other zines, both physically and digitally so I am well versed in reaching deadlines and foreseeing possible delays. However, due to the global climate we live in (closed borders, pandemic, political strife), there may be possible delays in the production of materials (separate from the Kickstarter timeline), and shipping to customers. I ask that you are patient with us as we produce the best possible product for you. Nevertheless, I'll provide updates on the status of the books should there be a need to.\n\nThe production of the book and associated merchandise is not dependent on this Kickstarter. Regardless if this Kickstarter is funded, the books and merchandise will be made and put up on sale on the Object Head Zine Gumroad, should this crowdfunding be unsuccessful. \n\nWhite Squirrel is our bulk shipping handler for this Kickstarter and so, all shipping questions will be relayed to them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 20 or more", "title": "PDF Tier", "descp": "Receive the PDF for the OHZ 2021 Celestial Bodies Edition!\nINCLUDES:\nPdf book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 35 or more", "title": "Double PDF Tier", "descp": "Receive the PDF for the OHZ 2021 Celestial Bodies Edition and the OHZ 2019 Superstitions Edition!\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Pdf book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 40 or more", "title": "Physical Book Tier", "descp": "Receive the PDF and the physical book for the OHZ 2021 Celestial Bodies Edition!\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical book\nPdf book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 50 or more", "title": "Triple PDF Tier", "descp": "Receive the PDF for the OHZ 2021 Celestial Bodies Edition, the OHZ 2019 Superstitions Edition and the OHZ 2017 Spooky Edition!\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Pdf book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 70 or more", "title": "Paper Bundle Tier", "descp": "Receive the PDF and the physical book for the OHZ 2021 Celestial Bodies Edition!

They struggle to balance their everyday lives, the supernatural, secret societies, and personal conflicts within their covens.\nThe Great American Witch uses a framework similar to Powered by the Apocalypse Games, FATE, and indy storytelling games like Ten Candles. It is, however, designed for extended campaign play in the tradition of World of Darkness or other urban fantasy traditional games.   \nThe Secret World of Witches\nYes, you will play witches, but they are not necessarily the witches of popular culture. They are not the tropes of film or anime. You will play witches of legend. You will play witches with the power to destroy societies and establish entire movements. You will play avatars of ancient goddesses: feared, worshipped, or reviled for ages.\nWitches can be anyone, any background, any gender, or no gender at all. The thing that defines a witch is that they can naturally use the feminine powers of creation for their magic.\nYour witch topples governments, create miracles, and guides global leaders. Your witch protects the waking world from supernatural terrors, leads nations into glory, and saves humanity from themselves. Your witch is the divine on earth and keeper of the most powerful magic in the world.  \nThe Game Engine\nThe Great American Witch is adapted from The Great American Novel RPG, a game currently nominated for Indie Groundbreaker Game of the Year and Best Rules. The narrative-driven game system is character-focused and uses a structured but seamless narrative control sharing system so that all participants can impact the flow of the story.\nWhile the game system uses newer storytelling RPG technology, it is built to feel like a traditional RPG. The rules have \"crunch,\" but are streamlined with very little latency in game play, and instead of focusing on the success of character actions the dice are more concerned with whether or not a character resolves a conflict in the narrative. The system allows for player character choices, extended campaign play, and plenty of moments of uncertainty when the dice need to tell the story.\nBy default, the Guide (Game Master) has narrative control and will drive the overall story. Gameplay is structured by \"chapters\" which sets up a particular play experience for the story beat. For example witches are threatened in a \"Menace\" chapter and are at a disadvantage, but in a \"Mission\" chapter they are strongest and at an advantage. \nThe witches stats will change based upon their \"aspect,\" Mother, Maiden, or Crone and certain magick spells will be tuned into those aspects better than others.\nWhen a character does something in the fiction that requires a roll, they choose a conflict to confront and roll 2d6 plus their stat. 10+ resolves the conflict and awards the player narrative control, 7-10 resolves the conflict with a caveat or unintended consequence, and 6 or less does not subdue or resolve the conflict and something changes in the narrative to make the situation worse.\nPlayers also have a meta-currency called \"charm\" that they can spend to introduce truths into the narrative, to change their character's aspect, or to confront conflicts that are subdued, but not resolved. \nHappy Jacks RPG Podcast Campaign \n Happy Jacks RPG Podcast One Shot \nVirtual Horror Con \nCovens\nThe player characters are all witches in a coven who have taken a solemn oath to serve a particular purpose in protecting witches from their many threats. Witches are protected by their coven and they draw power from their coven's home, the hearth. Members of a coven can also come together to practice very powerful magick. In many ways the coven and their hearth is the foundation and center of the entire game experience. On the meta level, they also tend to define the type of game you are going to play (intrigue, action, social commentary, etc.)\nCoven of the Divine: Witches devoted to marrying the practice of the craft with a particular religion or philosophy. They are very pious in a particular religion and work to bridge the gap between religions and witchcraft.\nCoven of the Hearth: United specifically as a sanctuary for witches with no other place to go--the exiles, misfits, and rejects of witchcraft. They are extremely protective.\nCoven of the Inverted: Witches who thrive on power and do not necessarily respect the authority of the Seven. They are typically shunned by most covens and can be considered adversarial to other witches.\nCoven of the Oracle: Witches who take an oath to advise and guide the decisions of other covens, organizations, or powerful natural and supernatural people. Oracle covens are highly respected by other covens.\nCoven of the Storm: Unified to make drastic change with power and authority. Known for practicing in the open and causing major upheaval in communities.\nCoven of the Sleepers: Witches devoted to grooming and teaching young witches or people with supernatural powers.\nCoven of the Town: Unified by their desire to support and protect a particular city or community. They tend to operate in the open as supporters or protectors of their communities.\nCoven of the Veil: Witches devoted to protecting and serving as ambassadors for creatures Beyond the Veil, supernatural creatures, and paranormal creatures. They are often the first line of defense against them as well.\nCoven of the Whispers: Witches embedded in the government to help affect political and social change.\nCrafts\nEach witch practices a craft--a tradition of magick brought down from famous witches and goddesses in ages past, from which they cast curses, divinations, and blessings. It is a witch's craft that defines what they do (and why they do it) in a game--much like a character class or playbook. But specifically it defines the type of magick they are tuned to and what goddess-tradition they identify with.\nAJE: Aje is a tradition born out of ancient Yoruba magick transported to the Americas through the slave trade and is not a goddess or witch as much as it is the overall power and energy of women. Aje focuses heavily on folk magick, song, dance, and divination.\nTHE HAG: Born from the Scottish Celtic tradition of the Cailleach, the Hag has made its way through traditional western European witchcraft traditions and moved to the New World with European immigration. The magick is primarily related to the fay, but also uses folk magick, and spells.\nHEKATE: Embodying Ancient Greek and Roman traditions, Hekate remained strong in Europe long after the Fall of Rome in the mystery schools and transported to the Americas through secret societies. The magick is focused on death, transformation, and resurrection.\nLILITH: Named after the first woman, according to legend, refused Adam, the Lilith tradition has grown to embody feminine power. The tradition was carried to the modern world through Judeao-Christian roots and embraced by vampires. Lilith magick is strong, primal, and uses blood magick.\nMARY (ISIS): The Mysteries of Isis carry forward the Greco-Roman tradition of Isis as the mother of magick and spread far and wide throughout the world. The Church appropriated the mysteries into Mary worship which persisted through Catholicism. Mary magic is restorative, meditative, and intimate.\nSPIDER GRANDMOTHER: Drawn primarily from Hopi traditions, but also other southwestern tribes, the Spider Grandmother embodies the power of creation and is a protector and guide of humanity. The tradition has remained intact in the United States and their magick includes ceremony, guidance, and healing.\nTARA: The Buddhist savior-goddess of wisdom and inspiration, Tara has a long history in the old world and her tradition moved into the New World through Buddhism and Western Mysticism. Her power manifests through ritual blood magick, folk magick, and ceremony.\nFulfillment\nDriveThruRPG Fulfillment\nThe game is produced and ready to go, so we just need to recoup our costs. Our goal is to get this to market quickly and efficiently. Therefore, Gallant Knight Games will fulfill directly through DriveThru RPG.\nThere is only one pledge level. That USD $15 will buy you a digital version of the game (PDF, MOBI, and Printer-Friendly) which you will get within 30 days of funding. It will also give you the print on demand codes for DriveThru RPG where you can choose to buy the book at cost with no retail mark-up.\nThis means that you, the backer, are responsible for the printing and shipping costs of the physical versions you get. \nThe Great American Witch will be printed as a premium hardcover. With your pledge and purchase at cost you'll get it cheaper and before everyone else. \nLayout Sample\nCharacter Sheet Sample\nStretch Goals?\nYou may have noticed this is not structured like a regular Kickstarter campaign. That is because Chris and Gallant Knight have a specific goal here: to get the game into the marketplace quickly and seamlessly for the gamer and with as little waiting as possible. That means we are less interested in gaining a ton of pledges and more interested in recouping our costs and releasing the book.\nFrankly the marketplace is uncertain right now. We'd rather just get the game in your hands so you can start playing, rather then make guesses about long-term projects.\nOn a personal note, Chris went back and forth a lot on supplements. There are a bunch in the pipeline. At the end of the day, he decided that future supplements are better served with their own fundraising down the road.\nIn any case, there will be a lot of products for this setting. Chris will be designing in the space for quite sometime to come. So if funding does go better than expected, it is possible we'll introduce a supplement or two for this campaign as stretch goals.\nLet's see what happens.\nContributors\nThe Great American Witch is inspired by award-nominated author Kathleen Kaufman's fiction and she served as a story consultant on the project.\nGame Designer and Creator: Christopher Grey, creator of Indie Groundbreaker-nominated The Great American Novel, A Roleplaying Game, ENnie-nominated The Happiest Apocalypse on Earth, 10 Workers United and author of Goddamn F*cking Dragons, A Novel About Terrible Heroes, and Will Shakespeare and the Ships of Solomon.\nContent Editors: Mac Beauvais, Kate Bullock, Danielle DeLisle, Lauren Bryant-Monk\nCover Illustration: Minerva Fox\nInterior Illustration: Tithi Luadthong\nCopy Editor: Danielle DeLisle\nCreative Consultant: Kathleen Kaufman\nCultural Consultant: Adam M.

The peaceful state of the world is threatened when a mysterious poison known as The False Gold finds its way into the veins of the world's Monsters, causing terrible, maddening Wounds, which drive these incredible beings into uncontrollable rages. The once unbreakable bond of harmony and respect between Humans and Monsters is on the brink of collapse, and it's up to you and your allies to set things right.\nYou play as Monster Care Specialists, elite vets equipped with the knowledge to heal any wound, given enough time and preparation. In the game, you travel this amazing Miyazaki-esque world, going from town to town in hopes of finding Monsters infected with The False Gold, diagnosing their illnesses, crafting cures, and healing their minds and bodies of the strange, magical Wounds which drive them to destruction. To do this, you'll solve local problems, investigate the land and its mysteries, and apply the skills, abilities, and knowledge you'll build up throughout play.\nMechanically, Monster Care Squad utilizes a narrative first system influenced by games such as Rhapsody of Blood, Ryuutama, and Ironsworn. Most rolls are handled by two six-sided dice, and the game is designed to be easy to learn while providing opportunities for deep and evocative storytelling; tools to build incredible and unique characters without the limitations of playbooks, and powerful GM mechanics to plan the perfect session, or create one on the fly.\nEvery adventure in Monster Care Squad follows three phases of play - first a Diagnosis phase, where your party arrives in town, assesses the situation, asks questions, and solves minor problems around the town in exchange for information and leads. Once you've figured out what's wrong with the Monster, then begins the Synthesis phase, where brewing the cures and salves, preparing spells, and making plans is the name of the game. Finally, once everything is in place, the Symbiosis phase has the team face off against this incredible, wounded Godling, attempting to cure its wounds and restore its enraged mind.\nDo a good job, and the Monster may even grant you a portion of its power in the form of magical Monster Gifts as thanks for your aid.\nHelping you through all this are a number of mechanics that put a strong emphasis on collaboration, gentleness, hope, and mutual support - both between the party members, and the party and the GM. Aces are bits of knowledge, special equipment, and abilities you gain through play that you can spend for bonuses on your dice.  Specialties are natural talents and training that your heroes can always succeed at, and the special Mentor system allows the GM to get in on the action, support their party and go on adventures with them. You'll need all these and more to bring peace to the poisoned Monsters and restore balance to the world of Ald-Amura!\n We think that Monster Care Squad is a hell of a rad game, but you don't have to take our word for it.

And mice, who rise, will always refute.\nOur story begins, the Cycle anew. Will you be brave, but one of a few?\nGarden of the Giants is a tabletop roleplaying game that takes place in a magical and abundant garden abandoned by its original inhabitants. Animals have gained sentience and culture in their stead, and lead ordinary lives within the isolated stone walls.\nStanding tall and abandoned by the Garden's denizens is the Interior, a cursed cottage full of ancient secrets and a source of great power: The Crown.\nBut where there is power, there are those who would hold it. Those who hold the Crown corrupt the Garden with their ambitions and designs. It is up to the mice, our protagonists played by the players, to overthrow the Crown and return harmony to the Garden.\nAt least for a time.\nWelcome to the Garden\nGarden of the Giants was made to tell tales similar to those you would find in classical Children's Literature, stories of magical places and learning who you want to, while set against some villain or great catastrophe. As players you act as the mice, who seek an end to the tyranny of the Crown and whoever holds its corrupting influence.\nFeaturing 14 different scenarios (14 different Crowns) and 20 different Plots (each filled with interesting locations and compelling complications).\nThe game is designed to help facilitate play and give both players (who take the role of the protagonists) and the Gardener (who takes the role of the Garden and its Denizens) the tools they need to create stories together, even if they have never played a roleplaying game before. Perfect for younger audiences, families, and anyone who enjoys stories!\nFour locations in the Garden from left to right: Bramblemaw, Pools of Serenity, Pumpkin Town, and the Floating Pond.\nGameplay\nThe game revolves around the players exploring the Garden using their actions every \"turn,\" with each turn corresponding to a time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night). The Gardener also has an action every turn, which they use to offer complications and mystery to the Garden. Each location will have a chance to meet friends, make rivals, and learn something about your protagonists or perhaps even the secrets of the Garden itself!\nAll actions are resolved in a Challenge which may be a binary choice, a roll of a dice pool, or a Conflict which involves determining goals and using your reasons on why you should succeed to \"battle\" with your opponent's goal.\nDice rolls are composed of Pools, made from two of your Core abilities (Courage, Heart, Wits, and Charm), any relevant Specializations or Luggage, and selecting the two best results. If you meet the challenge's difficulty or your opponent's roll you succeed! Otherwise you fail and new complications to the story are introduced. Both triumphs and misfortunes are needed to grow your characters.\nA picture of a buisness rabbit's first day selling their farm's wares.\nObjects of Power\nThere are a number of optional rule-sets that allow you to change the nature of the Garden, including cosmetic changes like introducing wind-up powered vehicles or turning all the denizens into stuffed animals, and mechanical changes like removing the use of dice or the Garden having three warring Crowns. Each Object makes the Garden a wildly different place, increasing the replay-ability of the game!\nLegacy Play\nThe Garden is perpetually stuck in a Cycle of prosperity and decline, revolving around the discovery of the Crown and its corrupting influence. Each victory from the mice offers respite, but a story will always begin anew. Over time the players actions change the Garden as much as it changes them, allowing each story to build upon each other as new Cycles revolve. Over time each Garden will be unique, as will be the stories you create with it.\nInspirations\nMany of Garden of the Giant's themes come from classical children's literature stories like Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, and Chronicles of Narnia. They feature young to-be heroes learning about themselves in a magical new world, learning of the people who live there, and taking those lessons back home with them when they return.\nI've derived the game's mechanics from many other games, drawing both from my love tabletop roleplaying games and board games, to create a beautiful backdrop where players are each given a chance to shine and never left with no action to take.\nA robin delivering the mail.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPart of the funds raised by the Kickstarter are to ensure that I have time to devote to finishing the illustrations, as well as Layout of the book. In addition, some of the funds will be used to hire Ell Schulman who will be editing the book! The rest of the money will be going towards the actual production of the physical book.\n\nGoals\n$5000 - Funding Met: This is what I'm looking for to print physical copies of the game! \n$7000 - Garden Plot Cards: Both the Digital and Physical tier rewards will receive digital pngs and a print-and-play pdf of the Garden Plot locations. Perfect for both Physical and Virtual Tabletops!\n$9000 - Four New Plots: Four additional Plots (the locations within the Garden) will be added to the base game, increasing the number of scenarios available to play!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book itself is written and currently being illustrated.

Though I do have experience assisting with past successful Kickstarters, being at the head of the ship this time around may come with unexpected hickups.\n\nThe biggest challenge I currently foresee is accurately projecting when the book will go to print. All of the files are currently on track to be complete and compiled by February 2020, barring any surprises in production or life events. For example, I discovered several months ago that the old pages that I had planned on remastering needed to be rescanned and edited from scratch which pushed the schedule back at that time. The completion of the Kickstarter campaign will also be the start of the holidays and those tend to bring scheduling difficulties. I've added in what I hope will be ample buffer time and I'm very experienced in printing\u2014my day job is as a graphic designer at a monthly magazine.\n\nAdditionally I'll post regular, transparent updates along the way so all backers can see how the book is coming along. I've never missed a scheduled update for RDD for the entire five years its been posting so I feel pretty confident about also making these deadlines. I have also very carefully planned out the budget, including cushion to account for unexpected or indirect costs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Rainy Day Dreams - Digital Only", "descp": "Get Rainy Day Dreams Book 1 without taking up space in your home!\nINCLUDES:\nRainy Day Dreams, Book 1 (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Rainy Day Dreams - The Book!", "descp": "For those who love the smell and feel of paper.

Brought to you by Ascend Comics.\nLeft to Right - Art by: Chrystin Garland | Diigii Daguna | Chan Chau\nELEMENTS: Earth follows in the footsteps of Fire, where we continue to tell the publishing industry: yes, #WeNeedDiverseBooks, but #WeNeedDiverseCreators too! The past few years have only continued to fuel this need as we delve further into the numbers and facts of our lack of representation, not just on the page, but within the industry at large. ELEMENTS is more than just a showcase, it's a place where creators are free to show they're not only the heroes, but how much their amazing voices continue to grow. \nSo keep up as we race to the finish line, provide a meal for a mountain, discover the truth within our lands, and wrestle to find peace in our hearts and minds.  \nTop L: Mira Ong Chua | Top R: Undram Ankhbayar | Bottom L: Blacklimes | Bottom R: Royal Dunlap\nELEMENTS: Earth has been a year in the making!

I began this journey in 2015 by creating ELEMENTS: Fire, and along the way Shing Yin Khor joined and the book was born. By 2018, Fire became an award-winning success that took home both an Ignatz for \"Outstanding Anthology\" and the Eisner award for \"Best Anthology.\" Now in 2019 ELEMENTS: Earth will be the second book from Ascend Comics, a new comics publishing company which I co-founded with Der-shing Helmer. \nOur fire has cooled allowing new stories to grow!\nAmara Sherm \u26ab Ayme Sotuyo \u26ab Blacklimes \u26ab Chan Chau \u26ab Chrystin Garland \u26ab Diigii Daguna \u26ab Genu\u00e9 Revuelta \u26ab Hazel Ng \u26ab James F.

It's about polyamory and queer families and safe havens in a world that wants to hurt us. It's about seeing problems that others refuse to solve and taking the matters into our own hands. In this game, we will take on the role of the titular Dust Wardens, people bound together by a force called Limerence which allows us to draw upon potent magical powers.\nHow does it play?\nDust Wardens has a similar structure to powered by the apocalypse games, with the caveat that there are no playbooks, and it uses a tarot deck instead of dice.\nCharacters in Dust Wardens have four stats:\nGuts measures your forcefulness and how comfortable you are enacting your will on others.\n\nGlamour measures your dramaturgy and how comfortable you are putting yourself on display for others to see.\nGuile measures your cunning and how comfortable you are manipulating others.\n\nGive measures your tenderness and how comfortable you are acknowledging other people's struggles.\nWhen you do something that corresponds to one of the Basic Actions or would be cause for a moment of tension, you draw a number of cards equal to the stat that most closely aligns with the action being taken. The outcome of your action is determined by the value of the highest card drawn:\n2-5: You suffer a major setback and don\u2019t accomplish your goal.\n6-10: You succeed at a cost or face a difficult choice.\nFace: You succeed, gaining exactly the outcome you wanted.\nAce cards and Major Arcana cards are special cases:\nAces: You succeed, and activate a special ability based on the Ace drawn.\nMajor Arcana: When you draw a Major Arcana, something weird and magical happens. Additionally, if the card is upright, treat it as a face. If it's reversed, consider it a 2. Interpret the card as a group, and decide on its consequence together.\nAdditionally, you'll swear Vows to each other at character creation. These inform your party dynamics, and are also a crucial part of creating your Coven together. Your magic is powered by love and trust, so upsetting the balance between members of your Coven may have dire consequences! On the other hand, if you work together and hold each other in your hearts, even miracles are possible...\nSo what's the money for?\nDust Wardens is, essentially, complete. It's currently on its seventh revision, and is awaiting contractor writing, some layout work, and a cover. Primarily, the money from this Kickstarter will be for paying for that labor, as well as ordering and shipping physical copies of the game.\n$750: kickstarter fees and \"just in case\" money\n$250: self compensation\n$1500: budget for contractor writing and layout\n$1000: producing and shipping the Zine Edition through Strikethrough Press\n$2000: producing and shipping  the Book Edition\nAll money beyond that which is needed to pay for contractors and fulfilment will go to myself, because I need to pay rent.\nWhat are your rates?\nAll contractor writing and layout will be compensated at a rate of 40 cents per word.\nStretch Goals\nFor every $1,500 beyond the goal, all contractor rates increase by ten cents a word.\nWho's on the team?\nMy name is Nora Blake (she/her & zi/zin), and I'm a podcaster and game designer and one half of Happy Rebel Tapestries! I have been working on Dust Wardens for just shy of two years now, and I'm very excited to bring it to the public eye! \nHere are some examples of my work!\n Facade, a Sparked by Resistance RPG about vampires and the pressures they live under in a society that marginalizes and exoticizes them\n Seeds of Rebellion, an anti-fascist RPG of emotion and memory magic\n Delver by Happy Rebel Tapestries, a surrealist dreamscape RPG of meaning-making and dungeon crawling\nI've also contributed to a number of RPG Kickstarters in the past, including:\nThe Hunted playbook from Interstitial: Our Hearts Intertwined by Riley Hopkins\nThe Zalmoxis playset from Thirteen Demon Princes by Taylor LaBresh\nThe Fallen playbook from Exodus by Erika Shepherd\nI'm also joined by a number of fantastic contractors!!\nNatalie the Knife (she/her) is a tremendous designer with an eye for delicate and specific writing. You may know her as the other half of Happy Rebel Tapestries.

You may know them as the creator of Spindlewheel. They'll be contributing a tarot glossary to help interpret Major Arcana cards at the table and make sure your game stays weird and magical even if you don\u2019t know tarot!\nErika Shepherd (she/her) is a wonderful writer and designer whose passion and earnestness are a constant inspiration of mine.

Each session should take about 3-4 hours. Play is open-ended, and can continue as long as players find new elements to explore in their town and in themselves. While this RPG is designed for long-form play, with the Kickstarter we're releasing a convention play packet to help you create memorable one-shot play experiences. \nTurn includes interlocking character sheets to represent your human roles and beast archetypes. You will also create your town map together at the table on the template we provide. The Town Manager will have their own checklists, references, and records sheets to make facilitating the game easier. \nThis Kickstarter will fund a print run of the already-completed game as a 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover book with visual art by Rhis Harris and John W. Sheldon, and poetry by A.J. Odasso. The game is a creation of Brie Beau Sheldon, with developmental editing by John W. Sheldon and Tracy Barnett. The Kickstarter is being guided by Tracy as a consultant, combining Brie\u2019s experience with Tracy\u2019s to help guarantee success.\nA bear retrieves the Good Stuff from their stash - illustration by Rhis Harris\nTurn has completed its first editing pass with Tracy and John. The text has been available online as a beta (here) and playtested at conventions in the US and Italy, online, and face to face with Brie, John, and other GMs. The game has been in development since 2013, and we\u2019re excited to finally get it into the hands of players and GMs.\nIn Turn, players will play out slice-of-life stories. This means that while they will encounter crises and drama, it is not often life-or-death outside the normal experiences of a human or beast. The overarching plot of a season of Turn may be something like a local town election with heated debates and threats to the land where the beasts roam, or maybe a family member of one or more shifters is struggling financially or with their health and the shifter players have to try to help them through it. There can be complicated relationships in these small towns, and players will have the opportunity to explore the skeletons in the closets of even the most secretive non-player characters. They even have to deal with the problems animals do, like finding food and mates, or keeping their homes safe.\nEach session, players will encounter real-life stressors like aggravating phone calls and territorial threats while they struggle to balance their beast and human identities. They\u2019ll also find opportunities to seek community with their fellow shifters and with mundane animals and people, and to enjoy the comforts of human life or the freedom of beast life. Their towns will provide opportunity to delve into their own shifter culture while finding connections to the roots of the mundanes around them.\nTurn uses three regular six-sided dice (d6s) to determine consequences for player actions. Characters have low absolute value stats, special powers and abilities, stress tracks that represent how stressed out the character is in each of their forms, and exposure tracks that represent how well their identity is hidden. Two of the dice are the \u201cbase\u201d dice, and the third is the turn die, which can be added to most rolls when players can refer to their beast powers or human abilities to activate it. When they do this, it interacts with the stress mechanic - two stress tracks that players can mark as consequences of actions or use of the turn die. When a stress track reaches the limit, players are forced to change form by the end of the scene. They never lose control or agency beyond the changing of their form, and there are multiple methods to reduce stress and return to their other form. \nPlayers use struggles when they take action and the action they take conflicts with one of their forms. A cougar shifter in beast form might find resistance from their human identity when they try to hunt down a rabbit, but while in human form at a church social, they might struggle not to eat the entire ham! They\u2019ll succeed at it, because you always succeed in Turn - it just takes time, and has consequences. When players roll struggles, they have scaling success that allows them to choose which consequences result from their actions. They roll, and add or subtract the appropriate Nature - a beast Instinct or Human Habit. If they fail the roll, they simply accomplish their task, but the Town Manager can bring more consequences to bear. This includes exposure, Turn\u2019s relationship mechanic.\nA wolf pack investigates evidence of humans - illustration by Rhis Harris\nExposure is tracked for each player\u2019s connected non-player characters, for the town, and for any animal groups. Each instance can be positive or negative, depending on whether the player is positively perceived and whether what they do is hurtful or helpful...and sometimes, just on how the affected mundane is feeling that day! Exposure adds up, and will eventually lead to being reviled, revealed, or known - the reality of which is dependent on play. \nThroughout all of this, players pursue their goals - human goals that happen once and, once accomplished, get replaced with new goals, and beast goals that respond to nature\u2019s pressures and cycle with the seasons. Accomplishing these goals gives players new powers and abilities, and spurs narrative adventure. \n \"Turn neatly subverts the tropes of the shapeshifter genre and offers insight into community and the meaning of difference. The rules are tight and lead straight to interesting and satisfying drama. We had so much fun playing Turn!\" - Jason Morningstar, Bully Pulpit Games\n\"If you grew up in a small town, and ever felt like a bit of a weirdo or an outsider there, you know this game already. It's brings both the love and the trouble that comes with that experience.\" - Kit La Touche, Transneptune Games\n\"Few games so beautifully synthesize the conflicting desires within each individual. Brie\u2019s game creates a world filled with the multifaceted character of small town life from its tenderness to the pressures that threaten to fragment it. Turn gives you the tools to dig deeply for the hidden moments of roleplaying that give it such beauty. Playing Turn left me longing for a community that had never been.\" - Vivian Paul, Riverbed Games\n\"Turn is both introspective and pushes hard on the relationships between characters. Everyone must juggle between their human and their beast sides, making the hard choice of which part of their identity to value over the other in any given moment. I loved the simplicity of the mechanics and the detailed world-building that ties everyone together. Definitely the game to play when you want to explore tough emotional dynamics between characters and within oneself.\" - Karen Twelves, Improv for Gamers\n\"There was so much to love about the game, but I was most impressed by how well it captured the slice-of-life feel that was part of the game pitch. [...] it was so super rewarding to still take it slow without worrying about finding a plot or piece of action. Even with characters we'd never played before and a group who hadn't played together before, we immediately found our groove with some good-natured bickering and mischief.\nNot only is there some really smart physical design to the character sheets, the marriage of these two identities [human and beast] within one character provides more depth and variation than any other system I've played where characters are made from a playbook-style sheet. [...] This layered personhood also speaks so strongly to my experiences as a queer and disabled person who has played and designed games for years, and I can't wait to dive deep into it.\"- Alex McConnaughey, Behind the Masc\n\"Rules-wise it's elegant. You weave the town, place the PCs in it, entangle them in a web of secrets, obligations, expectations, loves, trust and distrust that is very compelling. I love the apparent whimsiness of the beast halves. I live in a small town, and as a queer man, I'm very familiar with what it means to have different identities in different circumstances, to be careful about my exposure, to calculate who to trust and with how much of my life. So I love that the game gives you this big strange secret, and leaves you to navigate your life around it. \nCan you keep it all together? And if not, what can you let go? The people closest to you are going to help you? In the end, there is nothing more wonderful in life than finding someone with whom you can truly be yourself, wholly yourself. Turn is about the search for that holy grail. Isn't it a grand adventure?\"- Mario Bolzoni\n\"There's a harmony between the thematic and mechanic that I absolutely adore, particularly how it models the struggle between man and beast in a way that you feel in the dice. Even the character sheet(s) are designed with that friction in mind, putting your human and your animal identities at odds.\nOf particular note is the small town where the game is set. This town will be your home, your friend, your foe -- and the set dressing you figuratively and literally chew. As much a part of character creation as the characters themselves, the town is everything I love about leaving a mark on a setting before play even begins.\" - Jeremy Kostiew, con-cryptid\nThere are eight backer levels in Turn, so here is a brief description of each.

He collaborated with the Italian editor Narrattiva as a consultant, revisor, translator, demonstrator and booth baby, helping in translating and localizing, among others, Apocalypse World, Bacchanal and Monsterhearts. He has a long held and cultivated interest for history and stories, international, national and local and would talk forever about his town history, folklore and people if you don't stop him. He can cook a mean carbonara.\nLavinia Fantini\nLavinia Fantini (they/she) is a tabletop rpg enthusiast. They worked with publishing house Narrattiva as a translator, copy editor and proofreader, contributing to the Italian editions of Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, Shahida, and Emily Care Boss\u2019 Romance Trilogy. They also helped spread the love for many other games by holding demos, offering advice on Italian forums and giving a hand with convention organizing. When it comes to game design they\u2019re not much of an \u201cidea guy\u201d, preferring instead to aid others in understanding what the heart of their design is, bouncing ideas off and refining them. It's a less glamorous work, but someone has to do it! They\u2019re very excited about getting the chance to work on this project and help make the game more accessible to an Italian audience.\nEzio and Lavinia will be developing a collection of Italian small towns, along with updating and/or creating new archetypes and roles! These will explore how Italian towns and people work, and how they can cause shifters unique stressors and risks for exposure, while providing a window into what community means in Italy. Both of the above stretch goals will include essays on the cultural experiences.\nFUNDED! $16,000 \u2013 Smeed Hill FUNDED!\nBy Meguey Baker  \nMeguey Baker\nMeguey Baker (she/her) grew up in a town of 600 people, and after living in a city of 72,000 in high school, now lives in a smallish city of 18,000 in rural New England, where she writes games, raises kids, works in museums, and feeds birds. Meg co-designed the award-winning game Apocalypse World, as well as wrote the 8-game cycle Playing Nature's Year, which is full of animals being animals and people being people. \nSmeed Hill will explore a town cut in half by closing mills, then closing schools, and now empty storefronts on Main Street and overgrown houses in the hills. There are still opportunities, but also needs that have yet to be met. Meguey has proposed adding a squirrel and a skunk to the available beast archetypes, wonderful new additions to a small town! \nLike the other stretch goals, Smeed Hill will introduce some local NPCs to help your story along, a new town type, new beast archetypes, and a new or altered human role.\nFUNDED! $18,000 \u2013 Halver, Germany FUNDED!\nBy Gerrit Reininghaus \nGerrit Reininghaus\nGerrit Reininghaus (he/him)will invite us to his home town Halver, in rural West Germany. Halver has rain, lots of rain. Surrounded by the hilly forests of the Sauerland, with an aging population, it seems like a safe place to grow up and live. Well, at least if you are \"normal\" enough to fit into one of the 100 associations, from skiing, soccer, rabbit breeding or the fire brigade. Maybe it\u2019ll be good, too, if you don\u2019t belong to the kids sent to the lowest level of the highly segregated German school system since Germany is separating the \"good\" from the \"bad\" kids already at the age of 10. \nGerrit grew up in Halver. He has since lived all around the globe and is now living with his family in Guatemala. For all this traveling, he still considers the first twenty years of his life in a small West German town as formative. \nHalver will include NPCs, a new or altered town type, new or altered beast archetypes, and a new or altered human role. \n$20, 000 \u2013 Harmouth, South Devon\nby Jaye Foster\nJaye Foster\nJaye Foster (Him/He) is an exceedingly overeducated native of East Devon. He currently works as a research engineer in Hong Kong. His previous published works include Age of Legends and Poor Amongst the Stars. He enjoys writing sad things on index cards but is better at GMing adventure RPGs. Most of his creative writing can be found at the 6d6 RPG Blog. He would like you to know that the cream goes on the scone before the jam. \nHarmouth is a town of two thousand on the South Devon coast. It's once busy harbour is shelter to now only a few fishing boats. The town instead survives as a home for office workers who commute to the city. During the summer the town is almost overwhelmed by working class tourists on holiday to the long thin beach. The locals dislike that their town's economy is dependant on the uncouth and noisy northerners. To the south is the Atlantic Ocean and from it come rain-clouds and seagulls. Upriver is the city, an ever growing conurbation that is seeping downstream, consuming the farmland homes of the badgers. \nHarmouth will include NPCs, a new or altered town type, new or altered beast archetypes, and a new or altered human role.\nThank you so much for all of the support! Keep sharing and backing to help us reach all of these AMAZING stretch goals!\nBONUS: Reaching 400 backers met one of Brie's secret stretch goals - releasing the American Opossum! Brie will post the laid out character sheet for An Opossum soon.\nLeft to right: Brie Beau Sheldon, John W. Sheldon, & Tracy Barnett\nBrie Beau Sheldon (they/he) is a queer game designer, journalist, and editor and is a genderfluid nonbinary-masculine person. They are the creator of Script Change, Let Me Take a Selfie, and a number of other small products, and have worked on larger professional projects like Firefly Smuggler\u2019s Guide to the Rim and Bubblegumshoe. They have managed the Thoughty Blog for over 5 years to include game theory, interviews, and free games released through their Patreon. They have also created Leading with Class, a leadership show teaching through games. Their passions are asking questions, selfies, and exploring identity and community through games. Brie is the designer of Turn.\nJohn W. Sheldon (he/him) is a multi-disciplinary visual designer and game designer. He's worked on Kickstarter videos for Bully Pulpit, done logo design for Purple Aether Games, and created a gallery of Creative Commons illustrations through Patreon. He's also Brie's producer and videographer for Leading with Class, and a working design professional. John is doing layout, visual art, video production, and art direction for Turn, and he helped with early stages of editing.\nTracy Barnett (they/them) is a genderqueer game designer (School Daze, Iron Edda Accelerated) and podcast producer (TheOtherCast). By working with other publishers and producing their own content, they hope to make game design and podcasting their full-time work. They are the developmental editor and consultant for Turn.\nLeft to right: Rhis V. Harris, A.J. Odasso, and Alicia Foster-Scales\nRhis Harris (they/them), otherwise known as DeerintheMoon, is a 20-year old Studio  Arts major with a passion for art rooted in animal life and mythology.\n\u201cI've basically been creating art since the moment I could hold a  pencil, and that's never really changed. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I even referred to myself as an artist and believed it. I was always \"that kid who draws\" and I was proud of that, but I never had real  confidence in myself to even consider myself an actual artist with a capital \u2018A\u2019,\u201d says Harris.\nHarris transforms ordinary creatures to holy figures with use of celestial imagery and paints imaginary beasts with such precision that they appear ready to leap off the canvas. \u201cI use my art to understand how and why things in life do what they do, and why I feel or think the things I do. It\u2019s a way for me to analyze and explore things in a way that makes most sense to me,\u2019\u201d says Harris.\nHarris\u2019 work\u2014no matter the style\u2014is steeped in magical realism, grounded equally in geometry as it is in full-blown fantasy.\nA.J. Odasso (Poetry \u201916) (they/them) is the author of two poetry collections from UK-based Flipped Eye Publishing: Lost Books (2010), which was a finalist for the 2010 London New Poetry Award and for the 2011 People\u2019s Book Prize; and The Dishonesty of Dreams (2014), which had the honor of launching at the Grolier Poetry Book Store and Porter Square Books.  A.J.\u2019s third collection, an expanded version of their BU MFA thesis, was shortlisted for the 2017 Sexton Prize under the title Things Being What They Are and will be published in Summer 2019 under a new title, The Sting of It, by Tolsun Books.  A.J. continues to serve as Senior Poetry Editor at Strange Horizons magazine, where they have been part of the editorial staff since 2012.  A.J.\u2019s recent prose publications include a short story, \u201cWe Come Back Different\u201d (in the Winter 2018 & Spring 2018 issues of Pulp Literature) and a personal essay, \u201cBeing the Dictionary\u201d (in Knowing Why: Adult-Diagnosed Autistic People on Life and Autism, an anthology from the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network launched this October). A.J. is the poet for Turn. \nAlicia Foster-Scales (she/her), also known as The Writ Witch, is a passionate feminist and a PoC - for her, the acronym stands not only for \"person of color\", but also \"Pagan of color\", placing her solidly at multiple intersections of oft-misunderstood and societally-mistreated minorities. As a student of the Reclaiming tradition of witchcraft (a modern path specifically about the importance of fighting against social injustices upon the marginalized) and practitioner of hoodoo/rootwork (ancestral African-American folk magyck practices), Alicia's omnist and pantheist perspective on spirituality and life itself is grounded in the importance of Story and Myth in understanding not only who we are and who we've been, but also who we have the potential to be.\nAn avid writer, belly dance performer, doula, and activist for comprehensive sex education and reproductive rights, Alicia strives every day to embody the importance of being unapologetically yourself in a world so often built to sell us ways to fix what isn't broken. She is the essayist for the race essay and the sensitivity reader on race issues for the game.\nThank you to Brennan Taylor for helping us get set up for our Kickstarter!\n The money will go to pay for editing ($~1,200), visual art (~$1200), poetry (~$400), layout (~$1000), consulting fees (5%), Kickstarter fees (5%) and printing (minimum ~$10/book). It will also pay Brie for game design and testing (minimum $300 plus any overages), and includes a minimum 10% buffer for emergencies and unforeseen costs. Any stretch goals will include the funds to pay any contributors and for additional printing expenses, plus a small buffer.  \nBreakdown of costs as factored for the campaign goal\nWe also plan to get an ISBN for Turn, so it can eventually go into libraries!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween the members of the team, we have a number of successful projects that fulfilled in a timely manner under our belt. Brie recently fulfilled the Behind the Masc project on their own, and Tracy has significant Kickstarter experience. Our artists and poet are all skilled and experienced with good track records. \n\nThe game is complete, just pending final edits and layout. The visual art and poems are reliant on the Kickstarter\u2019s success, but we are confident they\u2019ll be completed on schedule. The schedule does have buffer to accommodate any crises. The budget also has buffer to account for any major issues.\nShipping and printing both have their own risks with timeliness that we\u2019re trying to address by choosing a good printer and by sticking to reliable, simple shipping and currently only pursuing US shipping. Brie is disabled, so there can be delays, but they\u2019ve ensured they have a team to support them in getting this work done and meeting the goals we set. \n\nOne thing to note is that Brie prioritizes the wellbeing of the team above all else, which means if there is a health crisis, the project will come second to the people. This is a caring-focused ethics model and we hope that anyone backing a project for a game like Turn will understand and respect that. We promise to put forth our best effort, but there can\u2019t be a best effort if the people aren\u2019t in a good state.

Anywhere from 2 to 6 will do, though usually 4 - 5 is the best. During the game most players take control of a character and describe how their characters descend down into the depths of dungeons to fight monsters, overcome traps, and loot great treasures by using the rules provided in this book. \n\nOne player takes on a special role: that of the Game Master. They set the pacing of the game, and act as an arbitrator of these rules. \nThis book covers the rules of play for The Deep Dark.\nBy William McAusland\n The Deep Dark is my love letter to games PBtA and OSR. At its core, its about adventurers and dungeon delving, over coming obstacles, and working together as a team. It features heavy role-play and narrative propelled action, to interact with the world deep in the earth. \nThe Deep Dark features 'fiction first' design with heavy emphasis on player narration. I call this, 'Describe to Survive'. With this, player's narration factors heavily on their character's success in the deep. \nBy William McAusland\n Roll 1d6 + Modifiers\nIts simple. Roll 1d6 and add modifiers from your character's Attribute, Lineage, Tools, and Alignment. Its up to you as the player to position your character in the fiction in order to be able to accrue these modifiers. \nIf the result of this test is 6 or higher, you succeed. \nThe game encourages you to dig deep into it. The more you play, the more you discover through time, the better you become at positioning your Lineage, or the Tools on your back to grant you the modifiers you need. \nBut this isn't as easy as it seems as you'll have to fight against the very darkness that crawls forth from the deep crevices and ancient places of the earth.\nBy William McAusland\n The Deep Dark comes in three versions: A digital PDF, a 62 page softcover, and a 124 page hardcover. All fully illustrated by William McAusland.\nThe PDF\nThe PDF is a digital copy of the 62 page softcover version of the book.\nThe Softcover\nThe softcover is a 62 page perfect bound paperback, black and white interior, printed on 60# cream colored paper. \nIt features the entire game, and all you need to play including: rules for character creations, test resolution, exploration, camp, combat, spells, orisons, game mastery, town, the wilderland, and bestiary.\nthe softcover\nThe Hardcover\nThe Hardcover is a 124 page case wrap bound, black and white interior, printed on 50# white colored paper. \nIt features the entire game just as the softcover and also features an adventure, as well as a 'notebook' section featuring an area for GMs and players to keep notes and chart maps.  \nBy William McAusland\n This is where I come to you, the backers. I need your assistance in order to print my first small run of The Deep Dark. I will use these funds to print several copies of both the soft and hard covers, to send to you, and to supply for retail sale. \nI've already put a good share of work into this project. I've taken just over a year to write and refine these rules over multiple playtest sessions and multiple playtest groups. I've put my own funds into licensing art for the book, as well as ordering proofs of the book from the publisher. \nTogether though, we can make this game a reality. \nThank you for looking over the campaign, have a look at the rewards.

The creators include experienced game designers and illustrators as well as newer people to the game industry. The project hopes to draw attention to indie creators in tabletop games who are still marginalized people, but can fall into the ether when it comes to representation and people campaigning for their work to be seen.  \nThis game zine is a collection of game materials for a variety of systems. It will be available digitally and in print as a short-run booklet with half-letter (US) size pages. \nWhat\u2019s inside, and who is doing it?  \nBehind the Masc will include a variety of game materials, including a new Monsterhearts skin, a Twine narrative game, and some great illustrations! Illustrations will be half-page (so one page in the zine), black and white, with a brief on the concept. Game materials will fill up to three zine pages and have a brief discussing how their design expresses their concept of masculinity.\nFor culturally related topics, we\u2019ll have a sensitivity reader review the content before publication. The editor is Brie Sheldon, who is also the curator of the project and a contributor. \nCheck out our contributors and some info on what they're bringing to the project:  \nEli Eaton is a trans-masculine person residing in Ontario Canada. He currently just runs and plays games, but has been dabbling with game design here and there for the past year or so. This is his first publication. His contribution to Behind the Masc will be a character skin for a PbtA game (to be determined) modeled after benign trickster characters from mythology and folk heroes. He does not have an official website, but he does most of his gaming talk on G+ and Facebook.  \nPatrick Lickman is a writer and designer from Sheffield, UK. They work at a board games cafe, where they run various roleplaying projects in a variety of systems, aimed to be accessible to newcomers to the hobby. They are a Forever GM, only playing their first RPG three years after running one. They will contribute The Demi, a godlike skin for Monsterhearts 2.  \nRaiden Otto is eager to be working on Behind the Masc. He is a nonbinary masc that uses he/him/his pronouns. While he is new to the video game design scene, for years he has been making art available on Instagram, Tumblr, ArtStation, and his portfolio sites. For this project, he will be creating a character concept sheet for an FtM man based in the Ming Dynasty of China with the use of Paint Tool SAI.  \nAdrian Heise is a writer and generalist/narrative game designer from British Columbia, Canada. He has contributed in the past to games such as Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2, The Long Dark, and the cancelled Visceral Star Wars project. For Behind the Masc, he is producing a short interactive Twine narrative exploring the role of the \"protector\" as it applies to masculine-identifying queer people.  \nLemmo's contribution is the Harlequin, presented in illustration. Here's an ink draft of the work!\n Lemmo Pew (him/he, pan/fluid/non-binary) is an artist, illustrator and game designer from Minneapolis, MN. Lem's art spans the indie gamut from self-publishing comic books and anthologies, to illustrations for independently published games and gaming websites, stretching from '99 to the present. His most current web presence is the online streaming channel, HotSoup.TV, and can be found on Twitter at @Lemmo.   \nAlex McConnaughey (@variant_games) likes to design games that make your heart race, that make you laugh or shout or cry. They think games can be a great tool for learning and growth, but they mostly just try to engage the players around the table in an experience as quickly and deeply as possible. They have designed games for contests, including their first game, As We Know It, a Golden Cobra honorable mention, but last year they broke into formal (paid) design with The Imposters anthology. They\u2019re designing a Minotaur Skin for Monsterhearts, for the obvious maze metaphor of understanding their gender and trying to navigate masculinity, as well as the role of existing solely as a challenge for someone else to conquer.  \nLawrence Gullo (He/Him) is an Illustrator, comic writer, and playwright currently developing an exorcism dating sim. He enjoys larps that generate empathy and doing D&D homebrew. He\u2019s spoken on trans and queer topics at cons for years, including Gen Con and Flame Con. He explores the spectrum of masculine experience in the sect of male Bacchae he\u2019s designing for Behind the Masc, serving as a spiritual origin or location in an RPG setting. Find him @hismajesty on Twitter and bashback on Tumblr.\nBrie Sheldon is a queer game designer, journalist, and editor and is a genderfluid nonbinary-masculine person. They are the creator of Script Change, Let Me Take a Selfie, and a number of other small products, and have worked on larger professional projects like Firefly Smuggler\u2019s Guide to the Rim and Bubblegumshoe. They have managed the Thoughty Blog for over 5 years and do interviews, create free games released through their Patreon, and also created Leading with Class, a leadership show teaching through games. Their passions are asking questions, selfies, and exploring exciting ideas in games. For this project, Brie is creating question pages, curating materials, doing layout and design, and filling in spaces where needed.\nTracy Barnett is a genderqueer (they/them) game designer (School Daze, Iron Edda Accelerated) and podcast producer (TheOtherCast). By working with other publishers and producing their own content, they hope to make game design and podcasting their full-time work. For Behind the Masc, Tracy will be exploring masculine physical presentation and non-traditional masculine behaviors through a D&D 5e Sorcerer you can use in your home games.\nOur logo!\nWhat\u2019s the money for?  \nPaying people for their work and for printing is pretty much everything. Right now, we have budgeted to pay each contributor a base of $60 for their work. The zines themselves will be half-folded 8.5\u201dx11\u201d sheets with saddle stitch, printed at a local printer. They will be black and white, with simple covers. Our printing goal is 200 copies.  \nShipping costs limit us to US-only shipping for now. We're exploring options for international fulfillment, so stay tuned for updates!   \nWe have included an emergency buffer for things like shipping failures, minor emergency reprints, and so on. There is also payment for Brie's work curating and editing the zine. Finally, the Kickstarter & Stripe fees (10%) are included in the goal.\nStretch Goals\nWe only have one stretch goal, and that's for $3000 - we would like to pay our contributors an increased rate. Creative workers have needs too, and the better we pay them, the better quality of work we can expect - and the work we're getting is already well-deserving of fair and generous pay.

However, it\u2019s a small project with manageable risks and few moving parts. Some of our contributors are newer and that could result in some delays in meeting project goals, but Brie has experience in wrangling people so we are hoping they can manage it. In the case a contributor would need to drop out, we will work to fill the space with another great contributor!\n\nBrie is a creator with disabilities, so they have some limitations. They\u2019re aware of these risks and planned ahead for managing potential pitfalls. They'll have a support network at home to help, too.\n\nOverall, there are definitely risks to the project that we recognize.

How great were those publications of old where you could crack open a magazine or encyclopedia and see how creatures and critters' insides worked, as we scribbled down monster designs in the margins of our sketchbooks?\nAlmost Real is an ode to those who looked for art and science to go hand in hand and were inspired by childhood bestiaries, for those who wanted logic and lopsided monsters to meet and make sense, and for those who wanted see creatures so lifelike that they could be... well, Almost Real.\n  The short answer? Everything, if it all can fit together.\nThe long answer: an idea conceived by Jay Eaton and administered by Fortuna Media's Mia \"Hye\" Mardikian, Almost Real will be a 8.5x11\", 60+ page art collection/magazine with entries inspired by the imagination, but rooted in the anatomically and functionally plausible. This zine will be a coherent work as a collection of different speculative biology, as if it were an educational work that also shows off contributors\u2019 artistic and anatomical illustration capabilities with full splash and intro pages for each section of the zine.  \nDigital Mockup - final appearance subject to change\n We took inspiration from encyclopedias, biology notes, field journals, and (of all places), Zoobooks and their interior design (do we have a free tiger poster? Oh, you'll see). With pre-determined text type and text layout done by the editors themselves, illustrations and diagrams are designed in an interactive way that flows with the page/magazine layout.\nMagera Gordon (Dimespin)\n   As Almost Real's kickoff volume, this book covers a wide range of subjects and \"figures\" for you to sink your teeth into. From showing how far you need to bend human anatomy to make a feathered flying homo sapien, to a \"tree\" mysteriously made for organ donation with the ecosystem that it sustains, and a \"whale\" that glides through thin cliffs to munch at succulent-like plants, this first issue aims to give readers a wide palette and an appetizer at what to expect from future Almost Real ~*~*~themed~*~*~ issues.\nKanesha Bryant\nAs a printed collection of great artwork to last half a year to the next issue (and for as much as we loved Zoobooks, they were a tad flimsy), this zine will be printed with high-quality, durable, quarterly-oriented magazine stock and designed to as much of a tee, as well as a protection-treated cover that holds against the test of time and re-reads as you continue to pour over the artwork inside. \nWant to see more or discover more?

With newer postal rates, we also need to provide a cushion for shipping, as well as any other stretch goals we may hit and accrue (and possibly build funding for future issues of Almost Real). \n   Now with all that talk about what this'll look like, what can Almost Real get you?\n  Jay Eaton\nPrinted on best quality magazine stock with a matte treatment, the zine itself! Filled with 2-5 page entries per creature and/or setting, you'll be left reading for hours about the worlds our contributors have concocted as you begin in the fantastical, dive into the creepy, and re-emerge in a hopeful setting for the futue. \nAvailable as both a DRM-free PDF, or the physical!

Try on a \"tiger.\" It's kind of a tiger? Seems fake, but sure. Maybe it's a worm. Its researchers called it the \"Reticulated\" Tiger. One thing we do know: it's certainly lifelike enough to be Almost Real. \nLauren \"Nhyworks\" Budney\nPainted by Lauren \"Nhyworks\" Budney, this 11x17\" poster (originally) on canvas with acrylics can be included in your Almost Real issue, folded safely inside and able to hang on your wall.\nOur ultimate backer's tier gets you the 12x9\" original painting shipped directly from the artist, which has even more detail to compliment its digital counterpart! \nTake a closer look at that snout!\n  You've seen them skittering around, but would you want to take these otherworldly crustaceans with you on the go? \nA sapient alien species called the Scuds designed by Jay, Almost Real's mascots Tango (pink) and Swing (blue) appear occasionally in the zine and are now in pin form! Hard enamel and 1.75\", these little goobers will face opposite of one another for symmetry and the collar clip eccentric, or maybe entrust one to your BFF (best \"frustacean\" friend). \nWe also have the Almost Real logo- teeming with all sorts of life, why not show off your love of spec bio on this 1.65\" hard enamel pin and make it a set?\n      Stretch goal #1 AND #2: Reached! All backers at \"DEFINITELY REAL\" and above will get a free sticker sheet, and artists earn an extra bonus on their flat page rates!\nSwing and Tango will keep updating this as the Kickstarter rolls along (don't underestimate Tango's strength)! Check out what our sweet Stretch Goals are below!\n This one is the most straight-forward: Artist bonuses! Each bump will add on an extra amount to the total artist check: first is $50, then that becomes $75, then up and maybe more! Once we pass our last official stretch goal of $39k, all the incremental $3k will be extra contributor bonuses!\nMarch 19th, 2018 -- Bonus #1 REACHED! All artists will have an extra $50 added onto their flat rate!\nWant to slap a fictitious critter onto something while you're away from the zine? Never fear- we have full sized sticker sheets! \nAt 8.5x11\", this sheet will include excerpts from each entry in Almost Real, waterproof and made to last through the seasons. At our first stretch goal of $24K, these will be automatically added onto every tier \"Definitely Real\" and upwards (as well as the Early Bird backers)!  \nMarch 17, 2018 -- REACHED! All backers starting at \"DEFINITELY REAL\" and above (as well as Early Bird backers) will receive a free sticker sheet! \nDigital Mockup - final appearance AND sticker contents subject to change\n  Did you know that Scuds are biofluorescent, making them able to glow-in-the-dark under UV lighting? With these stretch goals, we can make that happen in real life- our first pin upgrade stretch goal at $30,000 will allow Tango and Swing to glow- the second goal of $36,000 will allow the logo to glow along with its Scud caretakers, too!\n    Jay Eaton has been harassing worms and pillbugs, wondering how organisms work and why, and using science to twist existing creatures into troubling new forms since childhood.

If you're new to Zodiac Empires, it's a dynamic and interactive fantasy setting created for tabletop role-playing game systems such as the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Our initial goal was to bring a collaborative and expansive world to players. Today, we're expanding and adding to that world to make your gaming experience more immersive.\nCreatures of Vathis: Volume One will contain over one hundred creatures that can be found in the world of Vathis. Though developed for our world, these creatures are versatile, and they can be used in any setting! Within this bestiary you will find four new creature types: vastborn, living eldria, kami, and the forsaken. You'll also find a variety of beasts, monsters, mounts, and companions, all itching to be a part of your game. For this book we have been lucky enough to work with the awesome Chris Stoll, who created unique art for every single creature. Two versions of this book will be printed. The first will contain stats for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and the second will contain stats for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Both will contain full lore descriptions and beautiful art for every creature and type.\nFor five 5th Edition D&D sample pages for use in your game, head over to our website.\nA Deeper Dive into our Creatures\nThe entities featured in this tome are a varied and diverse sort applicable to any tabletop game. You'll meet companions willing to become your best friend, such as the orava, a tiny fey-squirrel with the ability to teleport. You'll also find information for unique mounts that will take you from place to place. These include drakes (we've detailed a breed for every nation in Vathis!), along with an elk, ram, panther, and many others. Creatures of Vathis will also highlight everyone's favorite fantasy beast \u2013 DRAGONS! The dragons in the world of Vathis are slowly waking after being trapped in stone for countless years, and we've included some you may encounter on your perilous journeys. We are also introducing the four new creature types mentioned above: vastborn, living eldria, kami, and the forsaken.\nLiving Eldria \u2013 Living eldria creatures are beasts, monsters, and humanoids whose bodies have come into contact with eldria and adapted in response to eldria's effects. The eldria within an afflicted creature's system sustains their bodies and alters their form to that of an artificial and construct-like state.\nKami \u2013 Kami are an integral portion of the religious pantheon known as the Shenami. They are spiritual creatures that roam the nation of Washu and are believe to be a physical manifestation of both the deities of Vathis and as the eternal form of the Washun's influential ancestors.\nVastborn \u2013 Vastborn are agents of the Shattered Hand created through nefarious means. The vastborn are creatures that come in many forms ranging from the lowly vastling to a mighty Vantus. They are otherworldly fiendish entities with appearances that match the hellish landscapes from which they spawned.\nForsaken - The forsaken are the ancient arcane constructs that once served the Anuald. They are unique in their construction, and despite many attempts to recreate them, those secrets seem to have died with their masters. Forsaken are crafted from stone and metal bound together using unknown magic to give them animation and purpose.\nOur History - An Interactive Campaign Setting\nZodiac Empires was created as a dynamic and player-interactive campaign setting. From the beginning, the future of Zodiac Empires was open for development. Going forward, we will continue chasing this ideal and Vathis will not remain a static world, giving you, the player, the power to shape the universe while simultaneously interacting with other like-minded gaming groups. Within our amazing community there have already been community games formed, and many of your ideas and NPCs have been brought to life and shared with one another.\nTo that point, we are very thankful for our community and want to continue growing a positive environment full of excitement and tabletop enthusiasm. We enjoy hearing your feedback and your thoughts, and we truly value your dedication to us. If you're interested in becoming Starcalled \u2013 follow any of our social media links below, and join our Discord, where you can get involved in our community and play with others. Within our Discord we are currently running an active playtest on many of the creatures that will be featured in this book. This playtest has gone through countless reviews by veteran game masters, and we feel confident that our creatures are both balanced and interesting.\nDigital Creature Lair Maps\nWe've received the finished lair maps from MeditatingMunky, a map artist you might know from Roll20! Every pledge of $15 or more will receive these digital maps as part of their pledge, and we hope to commission more of these through stretch goals after we hit our initial goal. These maps are designed with creatures from the book in mind. The first lair is the rime dragon lair, an icy glacial cave system. The second lair is a field of natural eldria, a place where you might encounter any of our living eldria creatures. We hope you'll use these maps as a part of the dungeons you create!\n2/1: Throughout our Kickstarter we'll be accepting play testers to try out our creations. To learn more join our Discord!\n2/4: 15% of the way there! Awesome. Thank you so much!\n2/8: Over 20%! Here's an awesome art dump for you. :)\n2/14: 30%!!!! Couldn't have done it with you. As such, here are five 5e Sample Pages for you. \nWhy We Need You\nWhile we are growing and continuing to create content, we are still a very small company. We need your support to continue growing not just Starcalled Studios as a company, but the Zodiac Empires world and the Starcalled community.\nBy supporting this Kickstarter you will be helping fund the printing of Creatures of Vathis: Volume One, and supplying the cost for artwork. You will also be playing an active role in supporting a community of shared stories and adventures anyone can participate in. Everything Starcalled Studios does is with the players in mind.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter ends and will be based on actual costs incurred to ship. This is collected via Backerkit through the surveys you will complete that verifies your address and charges the appropriate shipping amount. This will allow us to calculate your exact shipping cost based on your location. The current shipping estimates for single book and multiple book pledges are listed below, but these are subject to change:\nSingle Book Pledge Levels:\nUSA: $7  \nEU: $35 \nCANADA: $25\nMulti-Book Pledge Levels:  \nUSA: $12-$15 \nEU: $70 \nCANADA: $50\nWhile we know these shipping costs may seem quite high to those overseas, we are a company without access to an EU distributor, and we have to base these prices on retail shipping from our local post office to you. We are exploring other options, but at the moment we still believe USPS priority mail is the best way to deliver our rewards to you, the backer, in a timely and secure fashion.\nAdd-ons will be available through Backerkit after the Kickstarter funding ends. We are offering both physical and digital copies of the Zodiac Empires Campaign Setting and the Zodiac Empires Player's Guide as add-ons, as well as our digital Legacy of the Anuald adventure path. If you're interested in these items, feel free to pick them up as add-ons!\n Creatures of Vathis: Volume Two will expand on Volume One by adding an additional 125 creatures to our lineup. These creatures will generally be stronger foes found in areas beyond the walls of civilization, all of them being CR 10+. If we reach this stretch goal, you will receive both Volume One AND Volume Two in whatever medium you pledged. So if you pledged for a Volume One PDF, you will also receive a Volume Two PDF, at no increased charge. For hardcover book backers, this means you would end up with two hardcover books for the single pledge of $30! We would absolutely love to print this book and we can only do so with the help of our wonderful backers\n  The team of Starcalled Studios is a group of long-time gamers dedicated to bringing you tabletop content. Click on the banner above to view our members and learn more about us!\nThe Starcalled Studios team would like to thank Chris Stoll for his fabulous art and for making our creatures come to life. We would also like to thank Moe Balinger for his impeccable style and killing it on the cover art, and Cristian Pintos for keeping our graphics fly. We cannot forget our entire Starcalled family. We truly have the best community. We appreciate you being a part of our family and for your support, ideas, and friendship. We love all of you. You continue to bring our dreams to life while making them more vivid, so thank you, a million times over.  \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have carefully priced out what it will take to complete this project.

Sign up there to receive alerts on any reprints or expansions for Forest of Fate, plus news on all our upcoming storytelling games!\nFacebook | Twitter | BGG | Email\nTop reasons to play Forest of Fate\nIf you grew up with Choose Your Own Adventure or Fighting Fantasy, Forest of Fate evokes that nostalgic feeling and lets you share it in a fun cooperative format with your friends and family - and it's (mostly) kid-friendly!\nIf you like the storytelling element of games like Tales of the Arabian Nights or Above & Below, you will love the tighter, faster, easier to learn gameplay of Forest of Fate\nIf you've been tempted by RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, but haven't been able to find a group (or the courage to join one), Forest of Fate could be your gateway into the hobby - and it's much easier to introduce to your non-gaming friends!\nIf you're in an existing RPG group, Forest of Fate could be your next warm-up game, with its short run time and flexible player count.\nRead John's full preview here.\nThe response to Forest of Fate has so far been staggering. As a result, you've unlocked every stretch goal I could throw at you. The game is now bigger and better than I could have imagined. Thank you!\nRead Bod's full review here.\nI was inspired to create Forest of Fate by the gamebooks of my childhood, the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkein and Terry Pratchett, and the amazing and varied scenery near my home on the South West coast of England.\nMy goal was to make roleplaying games more accessible by stripping back almost all the conventional elements, revealing a strong procedural storytelling experience that is:\nEasy to grasp and \"safe\" for new players\nSelf-contained, and quick to play\nEndlessly replayable\nI hope I've succeeded!\nForest of Fate uses nothing but a storybook and high-quality cards for its unique brand of survival storytelling. It's compact enough to take anywhere, and has no small parts to lose!\nCheck out some of the gorgeous character art by the brilliant Milly Hanson:\nThe Thief\nThe Bard\nThe Ranger\nThe Warrior\nHere's a simplified interaction between a Character and an Encounter, to demonstrate the anatomy of the most important cards.\nThe Story Book is the heart and soul of Forest of Fate. It contains 1,164 paragraphs to spark your imagination, describing the encounters you'll face and the actions you'll take.\nA computer rendering of the Deluxe Story Book (Hero tier and above)\nYou have three choices when it comes to using the Story Book:\nThe content and gameplay for all three versions is identical, though I recommend the digital version - it can be updated later if we spot mistakes, and more importantly helps to save the forests we love!\nI've tried to make all rewards simple and fair. Please note that this campaign will not be using a pledge manager. Once it's over, it's over. If you've got your eye on something you should grab it while you can!\nForest of Fate is the debut game from Cards of Fate. As a startup publisher without a great deal of capital to invest or a name in the industry, I view Kickstarter as an exciting opportunity to help build a small community around my games and reward those who share my vision.\nPlaytesting (all components pictured are early prototypes, not final)\nThank you for reading, and I hope I've inspired you to try Forest of Fate.\nThanks also to the fine folk at Tabletop Audio for the ambient forest sounds used in my videos.

This includes preparing the backer surveys, which I'll be sending out over the weekend. It would be fantastic if you could please complete the backer survey as soon as it arrives. Doing so will really help me to deliver your rewards as soon as possible. In the meantime please also . Again, this ensures that Kickstarter can transfer the funds to me ASAP, which means I can start paying suppliers!"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "1,074 backers pledged \u00a332,818"}]}], "comment_no": 445, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cards-of-fate/forest-of-fate-a-storytelling-survival-adventure", "project_name": "Forest of Fate: a storytelling survival adventure"}}, {"backer": "Taylor Smith", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In Consentacle, you and a partner squirm your way to a mutually satisfying Human x Alien romance... with or without the benefit of verbal communication! You'll need to divine the other's desires in order to build trust, play your cards right, and transform mutual trust into starry satisfaction. How tingly will your interplanetary liaison feel in the end? Will your encounter leave one party sweaty and exhausted, the other hungering for more? It's up to the two of you to find out... together!\nUPDATE: Check out the replay of our latest livestream of Consentacle play, featuring Frank Lantz and Eric Zimmerman. Can two \"senior statesmen\" of game design find intimacy by tangling through cards? What do they even think of this game... at the formal or narrative level?\nWe've blown past our first two stretch goals, described below... and much faster than anticipated! So we've been making plans and measuring feasibility for further goals that won't compromise the quality of gameplay just for an overstuffed box. (OK, we know some of you like overstuffed boxes and excess libidinal energy, but we tried to pack a lot into Consentacle in the first place!) Here's the deal:\nIf we reach $135,000 in pledges (it can be done!) then every backer will get a free download of a 12-page Consentacle comic book.  On top of that, every box of Consentacle will come with the first two pages as a preview in the back of the manual--that way, you'll get some nicely printed comic art as well. This comic will tell a brief story of how Kit and Dup met, and what stood in the way. Most of all, it'll be full of more great artwork by James Harvey! Here's a collage of multiple comic-book pages by James from Batgirl and We Are Robin (for DC Comics... yep, that Robin -- but also very different Robins than the shopworn ones):\n  If you'd like to see more of James's range, check out stopjamesharvey.com or heck, check out them search results! I'm likely to help some with plotting and dialogue, but I'm keen on visual storytelling first without over-prescribing. (If you're really curious, you can check out my speech-bubbly writing work in games like Egg vs Chicken and Miss Management.\nConsentacle was originally produced as a showcase prototype for the No Quarter exhibition of games, with only a few sets in existence. We're bringing it to Kickstarter to fund mass production because so many people have asked if they can have a copy. To get it out to as many people as possible, Consentacle is priced to fund a single run, not additional printings! But what about a publisher? Well, given how unusual and suggestive Consentacle is, we've heard from more than one experienced source that it's unlikely to be widely published without some significant changes that we wouldn't want to make. There's always a possibility, but this may be the only time you can purchase a copy of Consentacle, ever. We're not guaranteeing that any stock will be left over!\nIMPORTANT: if you've played Consentacle at an event, or stared closely at photos and videos, that's the prototype version! We're making some changes in order to be able to mass-produce the game, and because we've found some problems with our pretty \"made for a gallery opening, but not for long use\" prototype materials.\nFirst of all, the cards will be smaller, but easier to shuffle, deal, and hold. If we raise a little more than our base funding level, we'll be able to upgrade the quality to an even nicer ivorycore cardstock! UPDATE: Done! Ivorycore is in.\nThe tokens in the box will either be chipboard (the kind you punch out from a sheet) or\u2014if this campaign gathers enough backers for it to be feasible\u2014injection-molded acrylic (more similar to the tokens you see in photos and videos of Consentacle, although slightly different as those are laser-cut). UPDATE: Done! We're definitely going with acrylic tokens!\nWe know many of you who've played or seen Consentacle are big fans of the colorful acrylic tokens, so we're hoping we can make them available for everyone! To make the game accessible to the maximum number of potential players, we didn't want to jack up the price to include acrylic tokens unless there's enough interest to make it less expensive for everyone! (Plastic pieces get a lot more affordable once you're making thousands of copies.)\nFor manufacturing and shipping, we're working with a number of experienced partners including Panda Game Manufacturing, who've helped produce and create many Kickstarted board and card games. Check out their showcase of successfully shipped games! We're also pleased to be able to offer \"shipping included\" prices worldwide.\nOK, settle down! We have even more ways that you can enthusiastically stuff more Consentacle into your life!\nLove the artwork on Consentacle's cards? If you back at the $58 level, you'll receive a print of the artwork from Consentacle's box cover (without labels) in full color on A3 photo-quality paper. Right now that's the piece below (Lick), but if we exceed our base funding goal we'll  commission a new original piece of artwork. Prints are limited to 100 backers!\n\"Lick.\"\nWe're also offering very limited amounts for two higher reward levels where you can commission artwork by James Harvey. Want to envision yourself in the world of Consentacle, whether as a tentacled alien or a curious human? Backers at the $235 level can specify how they want to be portrayed in a limited-color portrait, while one backer at the $750 level can request details for a full-color commission of a scene that can potentially have multiple characters! Check out James Harvey's website for more examples of what he can do. Backers at these two levels will also get a copy of James' latest book, Mouth Baby, from Black Hook press, and the $750 backer will receive a copy of James' out-of-print comic Masterplasty, Image comics edition.\n  Consentacle comes with what Naomi's decided are the most essential cards for a balanced mix. If we reach the quality-improving stretch goals described above, we may consider adding some optional extra cards! Stay tuned for more.\nYou're in luck! We have some of those left from Consentacle's debut exhibition, where players were provided with rubber tentacles to wear on their fingers. If you back at the $200 level, you'll not only get a signed copy of Consentacle, but two tentacles from the exhibition set.\nFor an overview, watch the video at the top of this page! You can also download a PDF of the rules or read on for a detailed breakdown.\n1. To begin, you'll need a partner who consents to playing with you, of course! Decide who'll play the Alien and who'll play the Human; you each get a deck, tokens in your color (red for the Human, blue for the Alien) and five cards for your starting hand.\nSome cards are more useful than others at the start of the game! If you don't like your hand, you have one chance to re-draw at the start of the game (a \"mulligan.\")\nEach turn, you and your partner will choose and simultaneously reveal a card. But first, you'll need to decide what difficulty mode you're playing on!\nIn PRACTICE CONSENT mode, you're allowed to talk out loud about your cards and strategize with each other about what to play next.\nIn CONSENT CHALLENGE mode, you can't discuss your cards at all, or make suggestions; you may only communicate non-verbally about the game. (Exception: you can remind your partner to draw a card, move tokens, etc.)\nSOUL WINDOWS mode is similar, but you may only express yourself with your eyes: no sounds or gestures, just a telepathic gaze.\nAGENTS OF CONSENT involves wearing sunglasses and staring impassively at your partner's blank visage.\nPlaying cards in Consentacle lets you perform various actions with your Trust Tokens. Some cards let you earn more Trust Tokens, while others let you move some of your Trust Tokens to a central pool:\nOnce you have some Tokens of each color in the central pool, you can effectively play cards that let you create purple Satisfaction Tokens by swapping out pairs of red and blue Trust Tokens:\n Each matched pair of Trust Tokens (one red, one blue) has the possibility of becoming one Satisfaction Token.\nSatisfaction Tokens determine the outcome of the game: was it good for you? Both of you? Play a Release card to boldly claim Satisfaction for yourself:\nThe secret to a more satisfying intimate encounter lies in playing combos. If the card you play creates a combo with your partner's card, the effect of your card may be boosted, taking you to new heights of mutual trust or satisfaction:\nBut be careful: you can't just try to match your partner's card, you've also got to think about what you're doing. Some combos are just awkward; when you both try to slyly wink at each other, you'll earn a little Trust, but not as much as you would have otherwise:\nThe last turn of the game happens after you draw the final card from your deck (you won't have a chance to play every single card, time being the enemy of every dalliance). So who won? Nobody\u2014sex is only a competition if you want it to be! To find out how the encounter was, the Consentacle rules have a chart to consult for an evaluation of your intimate encounter (click the little image below to check out the chart on the last page of our rules PDF!)\n  The full game adds a number of advanced cards as well, giving you more ways to mix it up, enhance your passionate skills, coordinate complexly with each other, and boost yourself to new heights of satisfaction!\nIt depends on what you mean! Not safe for... weddings? Walmart? Wee little kids? Women's music festivals? Witch covens? Water? Work? The answer is yes, no, that's a parenting decision, probably not, yes, the cards are not waterproof, and depends. Consentacle and all the artwork in it are designed to be suggestive, not explicit; my goal was to create a game that could be played in public without undue embarrassment and furtiveness, but with due blushing and giggling. The most explicit thing in the game is probably the fact that one card is called \"PENETRATE.\" If you're looking for more nudity and overt, sexually arousing material, we hear that \"consentacle\" as a genre has become an increasingly popular search term on some websites and forums that serve up explicit artwork!\nSpecial Thanks and Credit to: Shuangshuang Huo (video shooting/editing), Melanie Bossert (prototype token fabrication), Sarah Elmaleh (video narration), Anna Anthropy, Lauren Naturale, and Zoe Harvey.  \nThanks to many playtesters and video stars including Ben Norskov, Mohini Dutta, Robert Yang, Eddie Cameron, Eric Zimmerman, Nathalie Pozzi, Josh DeBonis, Amanda DeBonis, Colleen Macklin, Renee Zalles, Scott Price, Toni Pizza, Bennett Foddy, Doug Wilson, Jesse Fuchs, merritt k, and many more players.\nExtra Special Thanks: Charles Pratt & the NYU Game Center, without whose support the original game wouldn't have been made.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nConsentacle will be Naomi's second successful Kickstarter, following Sissyfight Returns in 2013: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1805029723/sissyfight-2000-returns\nThe team on that Kickstarter started the work of porting Sissyfight to a new platform and creating new artwork as soon as the Kickstarter finished; the team finished development and delivered all rewards to backers over the course of 2014.\n\nThis time around, Consentacle is a nearly complete project already; our team is seeking Kickstarter support to fund two things only: a completed set of illustrations for cards (80% done at time of writing, 20% to go) and the manufacturing and shipping of the actual games! New rules and cards have been tested over a period of months, and we've identified and started planning with some great, experienced manufacturing and fulfillment partners.\n\nMore details about what Kickstarter funds will be used for: James Harvey will be creating over 20 new illustrations for cards, and Naomi will do layout of a new card design with those illustrations. We'll be designing the box and laying out the rules again, with the new rules for the advanced game and cards in the mix. After that, it's off to manufacturing and finally shipping to our backers: if we reach our funding goal, those last stages will account for almost 90% of the funds we raise!\n\nThings that could go wrong: James or Naomi could get sick or injured (cross your tentacles against that risk!) Delays in manufacturing, ocean freight, customs or shipping to backers could crop up -- they often do, and sometimes it's beyond a Kickstarter creator's control. To reduce that risk, we are working with a very experienced group of game manufacturing experts (Panda Game Manufacturing, pandagm.com) who've helped turn numerous successfully-funded Kickstarter campaigns into real games in backers' hands.\n\nBecause this is our team's first non-digital Kickstarter game project, we're also getting lots of advice from close friends and colleagues who've done it before, like the folks at Local No. 12 (the Metagame, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093152267/the-metagame-discuss) and Resonym (Monarch, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maryflanagan/monarch-board-game-vie-for-the-crown?ref=profile_created and Visitor in Blackwood Grove, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maryflanagan/visitor-in-blackwood-grove?ref=profile_created).\n\nFinally, we've already lined up a set of regional distributors who also have plenty of experience in shipping Kickstarter board and card games to backers, quickly and intact.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Print & Play version of Consentacle only", "descp": "Access to the downloadable print & play edition of Consentacle, which includes printable versions of cards, tokens, rules, and playmat.

We're the editors of Sparkler Monthly Magazine. Thanks to your generous pledges to the Sparkler Year 4 Kickstarter last year, we've been able to keep bringing you women-targeted stories focused on complex characters, relationships of all kinds, and FEELS. We'd love to continue running the magazine and highlighting the great artists and writers we work with, so without further ado...\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for Sparkler Monthly Year 5!\nSparkler Monthly is an independent fiction magazine publishing stories for women, men, and non-binary readers in a wide variety of genres, much of them LGBT+ (think of the shojo and josei genres in Japan). Most of our series are comics, but we also publish illustrated prose novels, audio dramas, and short stories - we've even put out a visual novel video game!\nBased off of Japanese comic magazines like Shonen Jump, our stories are published in a serialized format. Every month, we release an issue featuring new installments of five different series. When a series is complete, we then republish it as a digital ebook and/or physical paperback.\nWe also run special features like podcasts with every issue to give our readers more bang for their buck. Between our social media, site comments, reader surveys, and contests, we regularly invite our audience members to become part of the Sparkler community - sometimes literally, through our periodic open submissions where we look for new fiction for the magazine!\nGet a taste of Sparkler by downloading our free (and giant) Sparkler Starter Bundle!\nSince the start of the magazine, we've always made a point to pay our creators advances, give them veteran editors, and release their work in a number of formats, all while they still own the copyright to their stories.\nAnd although we hire all genders, the vast majority of the Sparkler family is female - from the owners to the editors to the creators to the staff - and we're proud that the female perspective is the norm here, rather the exception.\nOur stories run the gamut of genres and characters, but they all have one thing in common: FEELS. In addition to polishing stories from an editorial perspective, we also want them to make our readers laugh, cry, and/or scream!\nFor example:\nOld friends reunite to deal with a literal demon from their childhood in Yellow Hearts, the LGBT+ fantasy by Keezy Young.\n  Kelly is the new boy in town who quickly befriends Grey, the boy next door, in Moosopp's charmingly comedic LGBT+ slice of life Sunshine Boy.  \n  Eli & Viv's gorgeous romantic mystery Heart of Gold will pull you into its dramatic exploration of faith, love, and lies.\n  Readers of Eurika Yusin Gho's magical boy's love comedy Magical How? regularly (caps-lock) analyze the characters' questionable life choices.\n  In Knights-Errant, the LGBT+ war drama by Jennifer Doyle, revenge is all fun and games until someone loses a limb(s).\n  Heldrad's high school romantic comedy Orange Junk is a love letter to shojo about going from riches to rags and enemies to friends, all with lots of blushing and confused yelling.\n  In Decoy and Retrofit, Bell and Hazel's sci-fi boy's love light novel, post-apocalyptic survival gets complicated with the arrival of a childhood friend, an ice cream truck, and a whole lot of guns.\nDenise Schroeder's Before You Go is a sweet, girl-meets-girl slice of life romance, and a long-time favorite of Sparkler readers!\nIn KaiJu's Mahou Josei Chimaka, can cynical ex-magical woman Chimaka rediscover the magic in herself with the help of her best friend Pippa\u2026and maybe finally save the world?\nWhy commune with the deceased when you can commune with some coffee (or booze)? Unfortunately for Cailen, ghostly trouble finds her whether she likes it or not in the light novel series Dead Endings, written by Jessica Chavez and illustrated by Irene Flores.\nAll of these series (and much more) are free to read online at sparklermonthly.com, so check them out!\nThe vast majority of Sparkler\u2019s series are free to read on our site, with new comic pages posted on a weekly update schedule. Paying Sparkler Members don\u2019t need to wait for new pages, though - they get monthly DRM-free downloads of all new pages weeks or even months before they\u2019re released online, as well as special bonuses to download to their computers and e-readers. With a paid membership, you help support the creators of our stories and get to keep your downloads forever.\nWe have two types of memberships depending on the Sparkler experience you want:\nNormal: Get DRM-free downloads of the current issue(s) a month or more before the pages are available online, all Member Exclusives (21 and counting!), and early releases of the Sparkler Podcast. See all downloads here!\nVIP: Everything in the normal membership, plus series-specific ebooks of everything running in the magazine (so you don't miss a back chapter), plus our entire steamy Cherry Bomb line recommended for ages 17+. See all downloads here!\nWe also started a Patreon due to popular demand! You get all the same perks that you would if you bought a membership directly on the Sparkler site, but through Patreon\u2019s system, if that's more convenient for you.\nClick here to see all our Cherry Bomb products!\nOur Cherry Bomb imprint is for our older readers (we recommend ages 17+), and features sexy side stories and art for a number of Sparkler serials. We're always adding new Cherry Bomb pieces, so VIP Members have unlimited downloads to the entire line, including anything we add during their membership! \nWe have secret plans we\u2019ve been saving for this Kickstarter. As this project runs over the next month, we'll update this space with announcements of more goodies! ;D\nDay #1 announcement: For this Kickstarter, Moosopp - creator of Sunshine Boy - will make a special short comic featuring grown-up Kelly and Grey! Beach trip, anyone? The comic will be released as a Member Exclusive download in the magazine in Year 5. You can pledge to any Year 5 magazine tier to get it - but only if this Kickstarter succeeds! Read more here.\nDay #8 announcement: We've added specialty commission tiers from six wonderful creators! (See them in the right sidebar and by scrolling down to the Rewards section below.) There are limited slots to all of these, so get them while you can!\nDay #16 announcement: A free Yellow Hearts mini artbook to all magazine subscribers! Like the Sunshine Boy bonus comic, if this Kickstarter succeeds, all Year 5 magazine subscribers will get a free digital download of the delightful little artbook Onaskellis: The Loneliest Demon. You can pledge to any Year 5 magazine tier to get it! Read more here.\nDay #25 announcement: We're teaming up with Paper Star Studios again to release our second video game about angsty BL pop idols in love! Out of Sync: Crescendo will be an epilogue game in our Cherry Bomb line, which means that all Year 5 VIP members will get a free download of this brand-new, mature BL mini game! Read more here.\nFinal week announcement: We've released the first issue of Year 5 (#049) to show you the great stuff that's in store for the next YEAR if this Kickstarter succeeds! :D Read more here.\n  The goal of this Kickstarter is to release another 12 issues of the magazine, but here\u2019s the best part - Sparkler stories come in a lot of different packages, depending on how you like to read. If you don't want to follow the serialized magazine chapters, we have complete ebooks! Hate reading on a screen? We also have paperbacks! \nSome of our fantastic readers and creators are even offering special Kickstarter-exclusive bonuses, original art, and commissioned illustrations on certain reward tiers! (Stay tuned, because we'll be adding more of those over the course of this Kickstarter.)\nBut first, a few notes:\nIf you want to subscribe to our magazine without paying for a year\u2019s membership up-front, or you want to download content without waiting for this Kickstarter to end, you can just buy a monthly billed membership or shop for items on our site. Check those out for cheaper, quicker gratification that still helps fund the magazine! (But keep in mind, Year 5 of the magazine will only happen if this Kickstarter reaches its goal.)\nIf you already have a Year's Membership to Sparkler but want to pledge here for Year 5, you\u2019ll get credit for the overlapping months with a gift card to the Sparkler Shop once this Kickstarter ends. Contact us here or at editorial@chromaticpress.com with any questions.\nAnd here\u2019s a handy visual of all your options for the ebook and/or paperback tiers in this Kickstarter:\nAnd now, the rewards!\n                  If we successfully fund 12 new Sparkler issues before this Kickstarter ends, we'll be able to aim for even greater heights: like pay raises for our creators, or even running SIX series in each issue instead of five?!

It's the story of a big girl in a small town who finds romance at her local ice cream shop. \nIn this game, you take on the role of a young woman who has just started a new job at a local, family-owned ice cream shop. She's taken on a big responsibility, too: two of the employees are going away soon, leaving her to fill their shoes! With only a week remaining before their departure, the situation seems tricky for our protagonist, but she is determined to show that she's the right one for the job, all while growing closer to her co-workers along the way.\nThis demo is a proof of concept. Nothing shown is final.\n  In this game, you can romance one of four of your unique coworkers: \n       Our cast includes love interests of varying personalities, multiple genders and diverse backgrounds, so we hope that there will be someone for everyone to love! And with four routes and eight endings, there's plenty of room to explore and get to know that special person.\nEven more, Two Scoops offers players a chance to play as a protagonist who breaks the mold of traditional leading lady in a dating sim. Name your character and choose from one of three basic appearance options so that you can play the game in a way that feels true to you.\n In addition to a traditional storytelling experience, Two Scoops will include some fun and exciting bonus features, to help bring players into the world of the game and make your interactions with the cast something special.\n Access interactive in-game texting and social media to communicate with and learn about your co-workers, even when you're apart, and share your scoop on the Chirp social network to see what the others have to say.  \nIf you're a fan visual novels, ice cream, and romance, or you're just someone who wants to see some fresh new faces in your gaming experience, then Two Scoops is the game for you. With your help, we hope to put together a sweet slice-of-life visual novel that has all the charm, drama, and romance of the standard dating sim, while also offering a diverse cast and queer romance options.  \nThat's it!

She's done covers for BOOM! Studios Adventure Time series, as well as colors for Dark Horse Comics' The Legend of Korra series. \nOur story is being written by a team of talented writers, Diana Taylor (Queen At Arms, The Shadows That Run Alongside Our Car) and Katy Forsythe (Love is Strange), both of which are very experienced with the layout and tone of dating sims and visual novels.\nLain Farlight is helping with UI design and development. She's worked on a variety of games, such as Devolver Digital's Always Sometimes Monsters, and brings her visual flair to the game's multiple interfaces.\nLast but not least, the lovely Emily Fitch will be doing our music.

Using a wide range of parts and a web-based application which requires no installation or design experience, Chibify will give users the tools to design adorable characters with ease!\n\nPick your facial features, hairstyle, outfit, and more. Capture your chibi's personality, then immortalize their cuteness in a unique, custom statuette, miniature, or charm.\nYour chibi made real!\nRecreate yourself, your friends, your family. Export images for profile pictures, order a full color Chibi Statuette for your desk, a Mini Chibi for painting or use in your favorite tabletop games, or a Chibi Charm to put on your key chain, charm bracelet, or necklace.\nWith successful funding we will launch with a large library parts, and we have even more planned--you can help us bring them to you sooner by reaching our stretch goals!\nWhat can I make?\nWe are launching with three main options: full color Chibi Statuettes, Mini Chibis, and Chibi Charms.\n\n\nWant more? For special, limited-edition, Kickstarter-exclusive materials and sizes, check out our Backer Tier Section for more info! Note that backer tiers including physical products ($20 and above) also include domestic shipping ($5 value) or $5 off on international shipping.\nHow to Get Them\nBecome a backer of this project and your support tier will have a set of rewards associated with it: you will essentially be pre-ordering our Chibi Statuettes, Mini Chibis, Chibi Charms, and/or signing up for more information when we launch. Once we launch our private Kickstarter-Backer Beta, you will receive voucher codes which you can redeem on the site for your custom chibis.\nSome tiers also include special limited-edition prints in precious metals, larger scales, or even offer the chance to submit your own designs for parts and features for our artists to add to the character builder--with your name featured in the description! For these special limited edition products, our team will be in contact with you following the Kickstarter to fulfill on your limited edition reward.\nThe Chibi art style is decades old and found some of its earliest mainstream expression with popular anime series like the Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and Gundam franchises. Its unique take on anime characters became much beloved around the world for its hyper-cute charm. The popularity of the lighthearted style spread, inspiring and influencing art in Japan, America, and beyond. The cultural impact of this style is still seen today in many modern mainstream cartoons, toys, and collectibles.\nWe have always been inspired by the unique styles, motifs, and themes in anime. We love creating new, unique art in that style, and you will too!\nWe're so very excited to be offering our unique take on the chibi art style and bringing it to the third dimension first online and then into your hands. We plan to launch with over 400 part options spread across over fifteen different 'slots.' That means millions of different possible chibi designs right out of the gate, not to mention our 'slider'-based body customizer so you can hand-tweak your chibi's proportions and body type. In short, we want to provide the tools for truly deep customization so you can capture your creativity.\nChibify is more than a cute character creator\u2014it\u2019s a technological achievement! Using the latest in WebGL technology and our own special sauce, we'll let users design their chibi in full 3D right in their web browser, plug-in free! \nAnd how do we produce your custom chibis? Why, using the magic of 3D printing, of course! We've partnered with two of the biggest names in 3D printing for product fulfillment: Sandboxr, Inc. and Shapeways, Inc.\nSandboxr, Inc. will produce our color Chibi Statuettes!\n    Shapeways, Inc. will produce our Mini Chibis and Chibi Charms!\nMore About the Website\nChibify.com will use WebGL, the new standard for displaying 3D models on the web. WebGL has allowed us to develop a robust, responsive, interactive design experience which lets you create characters right in your favorite modern browser without downloading plugins or running any other programs. See beautiful, interactive models as you design, build, and pose them.\nDesign online in full 3D, right in your web browser. No plugins or programs to download!\n  We'll make your design real! Order custom prints of your figures!\nThis approach also allows us to add some fun, free features which we hope you\u2019ll enjoy: export high resolution screenshots of your characters. Create profile images for your favorite social media sites or crafting projects: the only limit is your imagination! You can also save and load your characters from your own private library and share your characters online with share links.\nExport screenshots like this, with your custom chibi and choice of background, for free!\nMore About the Statuettes, Minis, and Charms\nHow do we make the physical products? Using the latest and greatest in 3D printing! We have partnered with Shapeways Inc., and Sandboxr, Inc., two of the biggest names in 3D printing fulfillment, to turn your original designs into real-world statuettes, minis, and charms. We're thrilled to again be using some of the biggest names in 3D printing fulfillment to bring your unique vision to life. We will be launching with three products, each produced using different 3D printing methods:\nOur statuettes are made using cutting edge, full-color 3D printing technology. By solidifying and printing the models layer by layer with lasers, we can produce your unique statuettes to specifications.\nUsing the latest in cutting-edge 3D printing technology, we'll create truly unique collectibles true to your design!\nOur Mini Chibis are made using an SLA printing technology where a laser hardens paper-thin layers bit by bit out of a pool of photo-reactive acrylic liquid. Support sprues are then manually trimmed off, and the mini is complete.\nOur metal charms are made using layers of steel powder which are first lightly held together with an adhesive (this is referred to as its \u201cgreen state\u201d), then finished by infusing the model with bronze, replacing adhesive with solid metal binding, creating a 100% metal charm. The surface is then polished and finished with a plating of your choice. This provides its bright, shiny finish.\nSo, why us? Why, we love Chibi! Our team grew up reading manga and watching anime, and this shared cultural touchstone took root in our imaginations. Our team is made of up wonderful artists and programmers whose resume includes hit titles from the video game industry, television, cartoons, and feature films.\nWe\u2019re excited to use cutting edge technology in web design and 3D printing to make this project come to life. Sounds like a big undertaking, right? Luckily, we have done this before! Our past project, Hero Forge, harnessed similar technology to bring 3D printed custom tabletop miniatures to the world. After seeing how much people loved our fantasy character creator, we couldn't wait to do something new, building on the technology and adding new features and functionality. Chibify is the summation of that hard work! We plan to continue developing our Hero Forge project in tandem, but we also wanted to use that same technology and artistry for a new, super cute, super fun character builder.\nAs we said during our last Kickstarter campaign: \u201cWe believe our WebGL character builder will be a fun and useful tool. We just can't stop thinking of new uses for this technology, and we're sure you'll have some great ideas too!\u201d We hope to keep snowballing our growing tech base to add new features and creators, even rolling some new features back into existing projects. In fact, many of the recent performance and menu upgrades to Hero Forge were a byproduct of preparing for this project!\nAnd of course, Kickstarter helps us get the word out and connect with you. Your direct support and feedback also help us fund and deliver content based on the community's wants and needs, letting us produce even more parts and features for deeper customization. Kickstarter also offers the opportunity to go beyond basic funding, reaching exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of our plans earlier, and adding even more options for character customization.\nAnother way Kickstarter lets us connect with you is our limited reward tiers which offer you the opportunity to work with our artists and modelers to add content YOU want to see included. In summary, we wanted to give the community a voice in our product\u2019s creation, and Kickstarter is the perfect way to do that.\nWe want your help bringing these chibis to life. Your contributions will go towards making our chibi character builder even better.\nALL KICKSTARTER BACKERS receive the following digital rewards upon release of the final customizer:\nKickstarter Backer Base! Backers will have access to a special Kickstarter Backer Base for their chibi statuettes. This exclusive part will be permanently available to your account and will help commemorate your role in helping this project happen!\nKickstarter Backer In-App T-Shirt! Backers will have access to a backer-only Kickstarter Backer T-shirt so your chibi can proudly show off your support! (Just to be super clear: This T-shirt part is a part IN THE APP which you can add to your chibi and get printed on your statuette--not an actual t-shirt for your regularly proportioned human body!)\n\nALL KICKSTARTER BACKER TIERS ABOVE $5 receive the above AND the following additional rewards:\n\nExclusive Beta Access! Backers who pledge $5 or more will be provided exclusive access to our live, closed beta when it launches.\nDigital Art Book! Backers will also receive a twenty page digital art book with original concept art and high resolution images of our backgrounds and designs, and special commentary.\n\nALL ALPHA TEAM BACKERS receive the follow special limited-edition rewards. Note that these tiers are limited and will be given on a first-pledged-first-served basis!\n\nExclusive Alpha Access! Alpha Team will help us \"playtest\" our builder. They will receive links to early builds of the tool as we add more art and features. While we will not enable ordering until the tool is complete, you can get a head start on designing your chibi!\nExclusive Alpha Team Uniform!

You could argue that the basest human impulse is to make order from chaos - to scry meaning from the overload of aimless noise that surrounds us - and Tarot is one way millions of people do this, through the clear, resonant medium of words and pictures. Much like comics! \nWelcome to TABULA IDEM: A Queer Tarot Comic Anthology Kickstarter\u2013 relaunched, reworked, and here to offer you comics made, told, and crafted by queer creators for queer audiences and more.\nTABULA IDEM will be a 240+ page black and white comic anthology, structured around tarot\u2019s Major Arcana\u2013 22 short comics beginning with The Fool, and ending with The World. Each story, featuring unquestionably LGBTQIA+ characters (including trans, genderqueer, genderfluid, and other non-binary/unique pronoun characters with queer romantic alignments), themes, and reflections, and will culminate in a tarot card image, either as a moment from the story, or a mirror of the comic as a whole. \nPetra Nordlund || Kat Gesiriech & Jenn St-Onge\nNew to tarot? Or familiar with the cards? TABULA IDEM will also have unique information about each card in the Major Arcana, pages dedicated on how to perform spreads, and a unique introduction comic that shows how TABULA IDEM\u2019s stories can relate to any kind of reader. With stories ranging from fantasy to science fiction to slice-of-life, there\u2019s a story for any kind of tarot reader\u2019s fancy. \nNero O'Reilly || Val Wise || Haley/Ivan Kasof\nTarot can help to inspire, to spark hope, to reflect, and to assure; there is something powerful in seeing tradition translated into modern, relatable image of yourself and others you see yourself in. We and our stories are here to stay, and with this relaunch, we\u2019re focusing on putting the characters that breathe life into the cards\u2019 imagery.\ngray Dupe Folie || Ashanti Fortson\nTo follow along with how TABULA IDEM has developed and weathered until the relaunch, keep up with us at @TabulaIdemTarot or tabulaidemanthology.com for updates, Artist Features, or advanced sneak peeks.\nThe tarot deck will now be a Kickstarter-exclusive stretch goal! This is probably the most significant change, as it added to not only our production costs, but our possible shipping expense as well. Our original tiers included a deck with the book formerly, so if you want a deck, be sure to pledge so we can break our goals! Read more about our Stretch Goals down the campaign page. \nWe\u2019re also running a smaller initial print run for TABULA IDEM\u2019s book. If we receive more pledges to fund an extra excess of books, thank you all for the support! But if you for-sure want a hard copy of the book, be sure you pledge now and help fund our initial run! \nShipping price adjustment! Since both editors will both be based in the same city come book production time, this will make inter-state collaboration much easier (as well as certain product shipping charges).\nThis point isn\u2019t so much a change as it is a disclaimer: our payment for the contributors has not - and will not - change. They are the voices that fuel and made TABULA IDEM come to life as a project, and by funding TABULA IDEM\u2019s Kickstarter, you\u2019re helping these artists work by the means they want to endeavor. \nAlain Helmers || Dante L. & H. Pueyo\nWhy not use another immediate crowdfunding website, you might be thinking? Both editors have used, assisted with, and ran successful Kickstarters before, and we enjoy its form of all-or-nothing funding. as well as their general platform operation. We would rather have our entire budget available and be ready to work with rather than only receiving some funds and have a lacking amount to both pay artists and enact reward fulfillment.\nIt\u2019s hard to get your footing after an initial loss- but you get back up, rework your project, and commit to both the product you\u2019re funding, the people you\u2019re inspiring, and the artists who\u2019ve worked and continue to work hard. \nAshanti Fortson\nIf you have any more detailed or further questions about the changes to the Kickstarter or TABULA IDEM\u2019s relaunch, shoot us a message and we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have.\nAshanti Fortson  \nVal Wise  \nLaura Lee  \nCJ Walker  \nVan Weasel  \nShoona Browning  \nNero O'Reilly  \nMister Loki & Jahna Vaughan  \nPetra Nordlund & Muura  \nAndi Santagata  \nHaley/Ivan Kasof  \nGillian Pascasio  \nAlain Helmers  \ngray \"Dupe\" folie  \nLin & Capp  \nDante L. & H.

Set in modern-day Verona, the Montoyas and Capulets are warring assassin clans, serving contracts for Henrys, Hamlets and MacBeths. When Jo Capulet and Roman Montoya are thrown together after a mission gone wrong, they see in each other a chance for a new life, even if it means destroying everyone in their path.\nThe gorgeous art was a collaboration between Mollie Helms and Bryndon Everett, with colors by Kennedy Cooke Garza and Eddie Jensen.\nVERONA is the first original graphic novel under the \"Fresh Romance Presents\" banner and stands at 160-pages. VERONA is currently being shipped to us for fulfillment. \nHow will you deliver my digital comics to me?\nFRESH ROMANCE is adopting a seasonal calendar and will be releasing digital single issues in the Spring and Summer.

While dealing with the usual high school problems\u2014drama, friendships, near-omnipresent surveillance, homework\u2014Pinky uncovers an occult mystery that could bring down the school, and struggles to solve it without getting betrayed by the classmates they trust.\nThis visual novel is based on the Breakfast Cult tabletop RPG, our previous project and a Kickstarter success. Since its release Breakfast Cult has seen great reviews and over a thousand copies sold, and now we'd like to bring it to a wider audience. It was partly inspired by visual novels, so why not bring things full circle?\nWelcome to Occultar Academy!\n  By the year 209X, occult science has revolutionized the world. Much of it is thanks to the Foundation, a research institute devoted to everything from occultech to science education. Their greatest project is Occultar Academy, an island school where talented students learn sorcery under their watchful eye.\nBreakfast Cult tells the story of \"Pinky\" Pinkerton, a returning student. A long time ago, Pinky was a fearsome delinquent who was expelled from Occultar for making too much trouble. Now that they've mellowed out, the Foundation has offered a second chance.\nAs Pinky, you'll get to know your classmates, learn the occult sciences, and try not to get kicked out again. With the Foundation's penchant for surveillance and the Headmaster breathing down Pinky's neck, it won't be easy. But that's not the real problem.\nOccultar has secrets. The Foundation is up to something in the Forbidden Sections beneath the library. Outside forces are infiltrating the island. Even Pinky's classmates have skeletons they'll do anything to keep in the closet. Can Pinky unravel the mystery that links everything together and survive until graduation?\nBreakfast Cult's main story is linear, but the choices you make will affect how it plays out. Depending on who you trust, characters can reveal different clues, unlock new scenes and dialogue, or just stab you in the back. As you deal with the problems that come your way, you'll have to figure out who you can rely on, when things are getting dangerous, and when you can break the rules without getting in trouble. So regular high school, really.\nA standard school problem from our draft.\nBetween investigations, you'll get to choose how Pinky spends their free time. You can hang out with other students, pester teachers for advice, visit the Foundation offices and check how they feel about you, or just surf the web. It's a fun breather between the investigations and horror!\n    We'd like to make Breakfast Cult into a visual novel. For that, we'll need money so we can afford to dedicate time to development. Once we're funded, we'll use 2017 to develop the visual novel and launch a Steam Greenlight campaign for it. It will be released for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and backers will get a copy on the platform of their choice.\nOur funds will be used for:\nArt: Commissioning sprites, CGs, backgrounds, and GUI elements.\nWriting: Covering living expenses through the game's production.\nAudio: Sound effects and music tracks.\nEditing: Hiring someone to edit the text and make it as good as possible. (I edited some of my own work on the tabletop game and that did not work out, let me tell you.)\nBuffer: Held just in case, so we can cover any problems that arise. If there's money left over at the end, we'll put it into commissions.\nAdministrative: Kickstarter fees and Steam Greenlight fees.\n    Any additional funds will be put towards improving the Breakfast Cult game with more assets, new features, and other upgrades.\n  If you'd like to check out the original Breakfast Cult tabletop game, we've also made it into an add-on! Once you've pledged, you can increase your pledge by AU$10 (approx. US$7) to receive a DRM-free PDF when the campaign closes. (Dice and people to play with are your problem.)\n      Paul \"Ettin\" Matijevic (http://breakfastcult.com/) is the creator of Breakfast Cult and the author of the tabletop game.

Owns a copy of The Complete Book of Elves signed by Sportacus.\nMaddi Gonzalez (http://maddigzlz.weebly.com/) is a cartoonist.

She'll be bringing the characters to life with sprites and CGs.\nCaio Prugner (http://cprugner.com/) is an illustrator and RPG enthusiast.

We should be able to complete development in the time we've set, but we have lives outside Breakfast Cult and we can't predict the future. If anything happens, we'll keep everyone informed and work to complete the project as quickly as possible. Our previous Kickstarter can back us up: neither snow nor rain nor heat nor my motherboard bricking because I bent the CPU socket pins like a big doofus will stay us from getting this done.\n\nAnother risk is that this VN is also our first commercial non-tabletop project, and video game development has its own unique challenges. However, the art and narrative skills we've honed in the tabletop realms are transferable, so we're not going in blind. Adapting Breakfast Cult into a VN is something we've wanted to do for a long time now, so if there's something that needs to be learned, we're invested in doing what we have to to make this work.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Paul \"Ettin\" Matijevic\n3 created \u00b7 105 backed\nGame and narrative designer.

Alternatively, read on for a quick overview. \n  Movable Type is illustrated with some amazing examples of 18th and 19th century typography - some of them are woodcuts, and some are what you would find in metal movable type sets. All of them look brilliant!\nThese images are accompanied with the awesome woodcut style illustrations of Alisdair Wood, who has rendered ten of the most influential and memorable writers in history - Ada Lovelace, H.P. Lovecraft. Frederick Douglass, Jules Verne, Lu Xun, Mary Shelly, Oscar Wilde, Johannes Gutenberg, Alexandre Dumas and Jane Austen! These images look incredible in their high-res glory!\nAda Lovelace, Jules Verne and Johannes Gutenberg\nThe graphic design has been handled by the many-talented Tiffany Moon.\n  Movable Type has been under development for over a year now and has been fully playtested, in the Playtest Dublin designer group and as a widely downloaded print-and-play. It began its life as AlphaDraft, which was downloaded and played by thousands of people. Then after a rules and visual update, it was released as Litterateur. After a lot of testing, it was obvious that something was missing. So the scoring system was modified, the card values balanced, an advanced drafting option introduced, and most significantly, ten new objective cards created to ensure players interacted and competed throughout the entire game. Even better, these cards have allowed for us to inject some awesome and original artwork into the game!  \nAnd this is where Kickstarter comes in. We need funds to pay for the artwork and graphic design work that has gone into Movable Type, and beyond that we need funds to print the final copies!  \nWe are printing Movable Type though DriveThruCards - a company that allows for small print runs, flexible design, and most importantly, produces high quality cards with a very quick turnaround!\nIf you're handy with a printer and pair of scissors, you can download and play a demo copy of Movable Type. Find the PDF file here! Bear in mind that this is a demo version - it's fully playable, but doesn't have full artwork, nor the advanced drafting cards.

Any add-ons will arrive in a seperate delivery, shipped from Dublin, Ireland.\nFor international backers, all packages will be shipped from Dublin, Ireland. This means that EU backers will not have to pay import duties. Other countries may still face customs duties.\nWill Movable Type Arrive in Time for Christmas?\nOur last project, Sub Rosa: Spies for Hire, was delivered on time and we fully intend to keep up this track record. For manufacturing and fulfillment, we are using DriveThruCards, which has an excellent track record of producing high quality products to a tight schedule. The game is finished, only awaiting a couple of visual tweaks before being sent to the printers. Most likely, you'll have the game well ahead of Christmas. Add-ons will certainly arrive by Christmas.\nBackers outside of the US will have to wait a little longer for their games to arrive, but rewards should still be in time for the holidays. Of course, those in even more far-flung regions should expect to wait longer still. We will try our hardest to get the games in the mail as quickly as possible.\nUncanny Cardboard is game designer, Robin David, and a few close friends, dedicated to making small scale, good value, family friendly board and card games! So far we have released Sub Rosa: Spies for Hire through a successful Kickstarter campaign, a series of choose-your-own-adventure books, and a series of print and play games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoveable Type is the second Kickstarter project by Robin David/Uncanny Cardboard.

She dreams of breaking out of suburbia and her artistic rut, but she has a lot of self-discovery to do before that happens. The comic follows her funny misadventures as she learns that maybe these (sometimes) friendly felines are just what she needs to get her life on track.\nWe've been posting Finding Molly as a free webcomic since January, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. We're stunned by how much our readers love Molly and her gang of cats and artists, and we're ready to take the next step and print the entire book!\nWant to read the comic before you buy?

However it is also the first time we are offering previous titles along with the new one. If you do choose to get another game with Capitalism, USA we will ship that game first thing, while we wait on the new game to finish production. My goal for this game is to have the most successful campaign that we have ever had. I have put a lot of time and thought into the overall design and gameplay that is sure to offer a unique experience for gamers and shed some light on the history of greed in America. \nPLAY\n\n    Game Contents (individually bagged):\n53 Poker Sized Game Cards\n32 Mini Sized Workforce Cards\n42 CUSA Federal Notes \n1 Small Pro Box\nKickstarter Exclusive:\n1 Executive Action Card\nHere is a look at the play money\n  Let's take a look at the Workforce and Profit and Progress cards\n  These are the cards from the Main Deck\n  This powerful card is exclusive to the Kickstarter campaign\n  Finally a look at the Small Pro Box\n  I have set a high goal for this game of $3,000 and have always made games based off my personal life experiences. However, this new game was not created with such a happy story to go along with it. At the end of March I was told \u201cwe are continuously looking to operate in the most efficient and cost effective way in order to grow our business\u201d followed by \u201cyour position is being eliminated\u201d, This news could not have come at a worse time, just a little over a month after our second child was born. Now with two children, I find myself \u2018eliminated\u2019. Based off this news the only natural thing for me to do was to make a new game.\nPLAY\n\n       Since I started West Aries Games last year, I have worked hard on making games of various types. Most of the games I have created have been triggered by different events in my life.\nCrisis Averted was my first game, actually my only game to not get funded through Kickstarter. I created this game while doing a podcast which focuses on comic book characters, the Hero Heads Podcast. Without having the money for licensing I decided to make the game generic, maybe a little too generic.\nWhen I made the Reclaim Series, which is based off children's literature, it was just around the time that I started reading those same stories to my now three year old. It was a game that was originally set in Magical Land of Oz and through the sequel took us all the way to Peter Pan's Neverland.\nRePresidency came about during the discussions of the upcoming election and the notion that we live in a different world than from previous elections. As much as I liked doing a game involving politics, I enjoyed the history more than anything. If Capitalism, USA could be compared closely to any of my games, RePresidency is the most similar. But instead of trying to get votes, you are trying to get money!\nRelative Paradox was created because I have always been a fan of the Doctor, so delved into the realm of Time Travel. This was the game that used history to its fullest extent. Overall the world of the game was extremely broad, the earth has been around an awfully long time so the game takes place in several periods throughout world history.\nThe final game I created was Wonderluette, which happened to come about right after seeing Disney On Ice with my family and watching Alice in Wonderland the following day. My daughter noticed that the Mad Hatter was the \u201csame\u201d as the uncle from Mary Poppins--I remember turning to her and saying \u2018He\u2019s as mad as a hatter\u2026\u2019. I designed a game, created by the Mad Hatter, which played and felt like a traditional deck game, but was riddled with madness. Even though my game did not have a strong influence from Alice, it still managed to get funded thanks to the wonderful Kickstarter Community.\nDuring the fulfillment process of Wonderluette we welcomed our second child into the world, Having two kids and a full-time job has kept me busy, however I think it is finally time to launch another game. The majority of the games I have designed were meant to have expansions and sequels and as long as this campaign does well I still plan on doing expansions this year.\n            #SharetheWealth", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe started having a lot of success on Kickstarter when we started making complex tabletop games like Reclaim Oz and have continued to make games ever since. We started to get 'political' wth Represidency, which is still our biggest success and ultimately posed the biggest challenge. Due to a printing error, we had left over half of our backers with misprinted cards. We spent a lot of time and resources correcting our mistakes and still managed to get the reprints out to those who needed them before the fulfillment promise was expired. \nTo overcome such obstacles, this time around we are going with a seasoned printer, The Game Crafter.

We will be revealing all 250+ names throughout the campaign in our updates.\nConcept Artist for Frozen, Big Hero 6, Wreck-it-Ralph, Tangled, Paperman, Moana\nEisner and Harvey Award winner for Adventure Time comics, To Be or Not To Be: That is The Adventure, The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl\nCartoon Network, Steven Universe\nBlizzard, Lego\n   Eisner, Shuster, and Harvey-nominated author of Spera from Boom!

CHECK THE LIST HERE {HERE}\nThe artists of 1001 Knights are illustrators, cartoonists, designers, animators, authors, poets and more! Many of the artists are award-winning and acclaimed in their own right and have done work for such companies as Disney, BOOM!, Archer/FX, Nickelodeon, Sony, Cartoon Network, Marvel, IDW, Archaia, Hiveworks and Lucasfilm. Several 1001 Knights artists have won or been nominated for Eisners, Harveys, Ignatz, Junos and Grammys to name a few.  The anthology is bursting at the seams with a ton of extremely talented up-and-coming artists to look out for too! We hope that you will check out all of their personal links that we've gathered HERE on our website. All the artists in this anthology have put a lot of hard work into crafting not only visually stunning, but thought-provoking and diverse characters.\nThe art is complete and the book is 90% designed. We just need YOU to help us make this a reality. We want to make the coolest anthology set we can! We also want to compensate the participating artists not only monetarily, but with a special \u201cArtist's Edition\u201d of 1001 Knights, with an alternate cover design. All profit after the cost of books and rewards will go to our artists, being split evenly amongst them.\nWe will not be selling this to publishers. It\u2019s an entirely not-for profit project. Artists will be receiving \u201cArtist Edition\u201d copies of the House they created for, but there will be nowhere else to get full sets after the kickstarter closes!\nTo make a set of books of such high quality has taken a lot of hard work. Since this anthology is very deluxe to begin with, the costs of producing it are high. That said, we are confident in our artists and you that together we will make these books come to life!\nHelp us make 1001 Knights a reality! Rise a knight and fight alongside us as we challenge the traditional representation of \u201cknight\u201d and \u201cstrength\u201d and bring meaningful and truly rad new character-driven art into the world.\nOur rewards include PDFs of the book, print sets, custom art & even more special items which will be unlocked once we reach our goal!\nHere is a tier chart guide to all the rewards. More will be unlocked once the goal is reached.\nThis chart represents the cost of making & shipping the books and rewards after Kickstarter fees. Profit raised beyond the cost of producing the rewards will be going to our artists. Now that we have reached goal, all profit goes directly to an even split amongst the artists themselves.\nBreadpig helped us with the math needed in order to make 1001 Knights a reality. They helped us find printers and spec out the costs of books and rewards. The books are very deluxe to begin with (cloth-bound, foil-stamped, hardcover, & full color to boot!), so the cost of making them is quite high. Working with Breadpig has ensured that 1001 Knights will be the most amazing Anthology we can make. They have worked with some our artists's projects, including Ryan North's TO BE OR NOT TO BE and Scott Wegener's ATOMIC ROBO, as well as many other projects that we love and have supported! \nAnnie & Kevin are a pair of friends who met on Twitter and decided to collaborate on a comic anthology. Eventually, they met up and began to scheme about all the zines and anthology ideas they wanted to make. What started out as a small call for art to a zine they were putting together about lady knights, quickly grew into the full revolution that is the current 1001 Knights project. The pair has been working for over a year on this passion project. They both feel very strongly about the need for better, more diverse characters and promoting people positivity as well as supporting their fellow artists in every way they can. Both Annie & Kevin have previous experience in comic anthology self publishing (Hana Doki Kira, Fezzine) and are very excited about creating the best anthology they can with and for their fellow art peers on 1001 Knights.\nAnnie @aniistoll\nKevin @kevinjaystanton\nCampaign Support - Breadpig, Inc.\nVideo by Matt Pichette  \nMusic by DarkeSword\nPR by Lillian Noble\nThe 1001 Knights Crest", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've held off on kickstarting until we we had nearly everything in hand.

Now, it's up to them to find out more about why this happened, help other kids with monsters, and fight back against the sinister force that created the monsters and wants to recapture them- at any cost. It's a story that combines the \"kids with monster pets\" stories that I loved when I was a kid, with my own personal blend of fantasy, horror, and coming-of-age elements... \nVolume 2 is where the story really starts to get going. The kids and their monsters learn more about their powers, meet a lot of new friends as well as new enemies, and find out about dangerous new threats that loom on the horizon...\n...all while they have fun together and grow closer as friends, both with their monsters and with each other. \n Monster Pulse's quirky blend of urban fantasy, light scifi/horror, and character-based humor make it a unique and exciting read. \nIf you're interested in supporting the Kickstarter for Volume 2, read below to learn more details about the rewards!

Take a look at these additional goals:\nWhy This Book?\nI love the old adventure books. I love Robert Louis Stevenson, Henry Rider Haggard, Jules Verne, HG Wells, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, and so many more.\nMy wife and I recently had a baby girl, and I had a sad thought: Although things are changing, there are still very few adventure books with female leads. There are books with little girls who are smart, sure, but there are practically no books about little girls who are smart, and scientific, and (here's the crucial thing) risk-taking.\nAugie and the Green Knight is an attempt to give her that book. It's the story of a little girl who enjoys math and science and history, but who also gets up to trouble, speaks her mind, and is unapologetically strong.\nMy intellectual guide for this book was T.H. White. This is a book that should be read to a child, because there are parts that may be hard to understand, both intellectually and emotionally. But, I wanted a book that was written to be enjoyed when young, but which had enough richness that you could come back later in life and still learn from it. It is a book aimed at children but not blunted for them.\nOkay, but gimme specifics!\nAugie and the Green Knight is about 20,000 words long, and is a retelling of a famous medieval romance. The original story is about King Arthur's court encountering a strange giant Green Knight and the quest that follows. In this book, we get to hear the Green Knight's side of the story through the lens of a young nerdy girl named Augie.\nAugie is an expert in biology, math, and a bunch of other subjects that adults find boring. She goes off one morning for adventure, only to find herself in a strange world of fantasy. There, she has to use all of her intelligence to save a brave knight from death.\nAre There Illustrations?\nOh yes. Oh yes indeed. We are profoundly pleased to say that the great Boulet agreed to illustrate the book. There will be at least 10 gorgeous watercolor drawings of his, and hopefully more if we hit our stretch goals. They are all beautiful, but this one below is my personal favorite:\nOkay, just one more:\nWhat Will the Book Look Like:\nI believe this is the best thing I've ever written, and it's a book I want to be able to give to my grandchildren some day. So, for this project in particular, we're taking extra care to make the book itself a work of art. To that end, every single book will be hardcover with a cover image by Boulet. This book is very special to me, and I want the artifact itself to reflect my feelings.\nWe're offering two levels for the books, both of which have a foil stamp exclusive to the kickstarter. One is a very nice color cover with foil stamp. The other, at a higher level, is a cloth cover with green foil stamp. \nTier #1 (pledge $10 or more):\neBook: We will be making the book into a .mobi, .epub, and .pdf format. DRM free, because our parents taught us sharing was good.\nTier #2 (pledge $25 or more):\neBook + Kickstarter Exclusive book: You will receive a copy of Augie and the Green Knight. All copies are full-color and hardcover for maximum charmingness. The kickstarter version will have a green foil stamp that will not be available after the kickstarter.\nTier #3 (pledge $35 or more):\nPrints + Kickstarter Exclusive Book + eBook: You get the book, the eBook, and a limited edition set of 2 fine 6x9 prints of some of Boulet's illustrations.\nTier #4 (pledge $50 or more):\nSigned Bookplate + Prints + Kickstarter Exclusive Book + eBook: Everything above plus a bookplate designed by Boulet, signed by both Zach and Boulet. We will have Zach sign all of these, then ship them all the way to Paris, where Boulet will sign them and send them back to our warehouse.\nTier #5 (pledge $75 or more):\nKickstarter Exclusive Limited Cloth Cover with Green Foil Stamp + Dust Jacked + Prints + eBook: At this level, you get a special cloth cover with green foil stamp (not available for retail) AND a dust jacket made by Boulet.\nTier #6 (pledge $85 or more):\nSigned Bookplate + Kickstarter Exclusive Limited Cloth Cover with Green Foil Stamp + Dust Jacket + Prints + eBook: The above tier, plus a signed bookplate!\nTier #7 (pledge $120 or more):\nKickstarter Exclusive Book + Kickstarter Exclusive Limited Cloth Cover with Green Foil Stamp + Dust Jacket + 2 Signed Bookplates + 2 Print Sets + eBook.\nTier #8 (pledge $400 or more):\nEverything at 120 plus... a special blanket! In nature, many species mimic eyes in order to scare predators. In the book, Augie has a blanket with fake eyes to scare away predators in her bedroom. We are having 25 of these custom crafted just for the Kickstarter. This is an early adopter level. At this level, you get everything at the $120 level plus the blanket.\nWe are offering this tier at the lowest price we are comfortable with, for early adopters. Tiers 9 and 10 contain the same stuff at higher prices.\nLetters of Recommendation:\nDon't take our word for it!\n\"Augie and the Green Knight is the sort of children's book I would write if I were a good enough author to write children's literature.\" \n-Eliezer Yudkowsky, author of \"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality\"\n\"I think any kid would be over the moon to get to read this!!\"\nRosemary Mosco, creator of \"Bird and Moon\"\n\"Augie is a charming, funny story with incredibly gorgeous illustrations. I want to go back in time and give this book to my childhood self.\"\n-Ryan North, creator of \"Dinosaur Comics\" and writer of \"Adventure Time\" comics\nWhat will the book look like?\nFor the kickstarter exclusive edition, we are trying to emulate the old fairy books by Andrew Lang. The books will have green cloth covers with foil stamp of an image by Boulet.\nHere are some mockups of what the interior will look like:\nI don't know who you are. Is this book for me?\nIf you like adventure stories and science and jokes and geek stuff, you'll like it. If you want a book for a kid, and you're tired of books that treat little girls as delicate flowers, you'll like it. If you like adventure stories that are fun but also have a heart, you'll like it.

Since then, we've been professionals in the animation industry for over 6 years now, working for both studios and freelance. Our clientele is peppered with many animation powerhouses, but by far our favorite thing we've ever worked on is our pet project, Baman Piderman. \n\nOne of the challenges in creating fully animated content for the web is time, finding funding, and manpower hours. When we left our job to work on the show full time with internet animation hub Mondomedia, somehow we were managing to churn out 5 minute episodes of the series every two weeks with only two people working. At 15 hand drawn frames per second, you can get an idea of how much sleep we were getting. We're fast, dedicated to quality, and we love our medium with all our hearts. Being able to work on the show with a modest budget to hire people for the things we're not the best at (like music, and merch!) is like a dream, and we're so excited to have much more time to make the send off episodes of the show the as awesome as they can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 205, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523165009/baman-piderman-make-da-show", "project_name": "BAMAN PIDERMAN: MAKE DA SHOW!"}}, {"backer": "Taylor Smith", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 205, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frederator/bee-and-puppycat-the-series", "project_name": "Bee and PuppyCat: The Series"}}]
