so why have headlamps \u2013 a wearable we all know \u2013 stayed so dang unwearable?\nYou know what we\u2019re talking about: the doorknob sticking out of your forehead. It\u2019s bulky, it\u2019s uncomfortable, and it constantly reminds you of its presence. So many other categories (sound, footwear, eyewear) have evolved into modern, lighter, smarter designs yet headlamps have remained largely the same \u2013 so we set out to change that. \nWith 330 lumens and 4 lighting modes, the BioLite HeadLamp provides top-tier performance with a fit unlike any headlamp you\u2019ve experienced thanks to our proprietary 3D SlimFit Construction.\nBy integrating our electronics into the fabric with a custom molded housing, we pack all your lighting into an ultra-thin facing that is designed to fit as seamlessly as a contact lens: moves with you as a single unit and you soon forget it\u2019s even there. \nBy relocating the power source to the back, our fit solves the classic slippage problem. Headlamps are generally worn at a slight angle, with the light in the upper position. If you put all the weight where the light is, it\u2019s going to seek equilibrium which means a slow and constant slip downward (annoying). By keeping the front super light and minimal and moving those grams to the back of your head, BioLite HeadLamp embraces a gravity-friendly design that feels nearly weightless when you put it on.\nWe did a LOT of fabric testing. A lot. We ended up going with a high-quality moisture-wicking band that keeps your forehead comfortable and dry during activity with easy-adjust clips that take the guess work out of right-sizing your band.\nThis HeadLamp has got a lot to offer in that ultrathin front: using advanced LED electronics, HeadLamp puts out an impressive 330 lumens along with full brightness control, spot/flood, strobe, and red night vision. \nAnd, thanks to its rechargeability, you can ditch the alkalines and fill up using powerbanks, solar panels, or any other micro-USB source. \nBy looking at the wearables we turn to on a daily basis, we quickly identified that the current state of headlamps was lacking in meaningful innovation when it came to materials, manufacturing, and assembly \u2013 something that the sneakers on our feet seemed to be crushing.\nSo, using footwear as our north star, we created hundreds of prototypes that studied the interaction of fabric with technology and the processes that bring those things together. \nProgression of HeadLamp Prototypes\nUltimately, we landed on an ultra thin, fully unified head strap that integrated electronics and fabrics into a single molded unit that sits flush on your forehead and moves with you seamlessly. Paired with an efficient, compact lens and high-performance fabric that can withstand a variety of activity, the BioLite HeadLamp introduces the category to wearable tech for the first time.\n  HeadLamp Process Sketches\nOur promises of fit and functionality only mean something if they perform out in the real world \u2013 so we sent the HeadLamp out into the wild with some serious adventurers. \nOver the past several months, BioLite Beta Testers have been taking the HeadLamp all over the world \u2013 from overland adventures to epic climbs to high-mileage runs \u2013 and have documented their experiences for the BioLite community. Stay tuned for stories from the field in upcoming Campaign Updates as well as daily takeover on our Instagram feed. (Oh, and the folks in the intro video? They're beta testers, too \u2013 more to come from them).\nHere's just a few of the things our testers have had to say so far:\nNot climbing a mountain anytime soon? HeadLamp is also a clutch companion much closer to home:\nHeadLamp is slated to officially launch in Spring 2019 but we wanted to spread a little holiday cheer with our amazing Kickstarter Community with a SURPRISE limited edition production run that will ship by Holiday 2018. In addition to getting it early and by Christmas, all Kickstarter backers will receive a free Light Diffusing Stuffsack designed exclusively for the BioLite HeadLamp that can transform the unit into a hanging lantern for easy area lighting.\nLimited Holiday Quantities: In order to meet a holiday delivery schedule, we took a big risk and have already started production \u2013 this means that the total amount available and each color quantity is already locked into place; once they\u2019re claimed, the next run available will be Spring 2019. Back early to secure your favorite color and to get in on the holiday fun!\nInternational Backers: due to logistical constraints, we're unable to offer a holiday delivery but we still want to make this campaign available to our global community if you want to get involved. If you back the GLOBAL reward level, you'll be able to pick your color right after the campaign and your HeadLamp will ship February 2019 and will include the free Light Diffusing Stuffsack as a Kickstarter Backer. Thank you so much for your support and your understanding. \nFrom a single HeadLamp to your own complete off-grid setup, explore our reward levels below and find the right lighting & power solution for you. \nGet to know the BioLiters behind the HeadLamp. We asked the team \"When was the last time you used the HeadLamp?\" \nWhen you support this campaign, you also support safe and reliable lighting for off-grid families across sub-Saharan Africa. Through our unique business model of Parallel Innovation, our team headquartered in Kenya is able to focus on on delivering sustainable solutions for modern energy access. For more info on BioLite\u2019s mission, check out our 2017 Impact Report.\nIn short \u2013 because Kickstarter is where new ideas and designs have room to breathe.\nThe headlamp category is a crowded space. There\u2019s a lot of incumbents controlling the conversation with a design architecture that hasn\u2019t changed much over the last two decades. These big guys have longstanding relationships with retailers and channels, making it really difficult to break into the space and create meaningful traction. That is \u2013 unless you\u2019ve brought your own bullhorn (that\u2019s where you come in).\nOver the past four years, we\u2019ve been blown away by how the Kickstarter community can show up and create incredible momentum for a project through sheer enthusiasm and support. Your comments, your questions, your shares, they all amplify the story and prove that the little guys with good ideas can shake up an entire industry if we get the chance to get the word out there.\nAs we mentioned above, we took a chance this time around and placed a big bet, already putting units into production so this community can have early access for the holidays \u2013 we hope you like what you see and take a HeadLamp home for yourself. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge on this project is the promise of holiday delivery - so we made the call to a) start production on a pre-determined quantity and b) focus our holiday shipments on US and Canada where we can minimize risk and have better control over the logistics process. \n\nFor our US/Canada backers, this means that holiday colors and specific combinations are limited. We have learned from previous experience that challenges can arise around the holidays (port delays, bottlenecks, etc) which we have built into our existing timelines. Our team is here to answer any questions you have and, knowing how important the holidays are to everyone, we will be in close communication from the start of this campaign right through delivery so you are in the loop on shipment status and delivery schedules. We ask that you help us meet these timelines with swift survey completion at the end of this campaign.\n\nFor our International Backers, this means that we'll be fulfilling your units in the Spring along with potential retail partners as it allows us to leverage larger shipments to your country so we can keep your shipping/duty costs as low as possible (all shipping fees associated with your reward level make it DELIVERED DUTIES PAID - so NO additional charges upon delivery). Over the past two months we explored several options to offer a global holiday timeline, but the last thing we wanted to do was set a high-stakes expectation and not meet it. The risk was simply too high. We're grateful for your understanding and we hope you'll join us on this campaign (as a reminder, you still get the free Light Diffusing Stuffsack if you back us on Kickstarter, no matter where you are in the world).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital Thank You", "descp": "Thanks for believing in our design and supporting our campaign!

There are a lot of cell phone mounts for wheelchairs on the market now, as there are a lot of magnetic cell phone mounts for use in cars, but nothing that is a great blend of both! Attracmount takes out all of the negatives of the current wheelchair cell phone holders and combines the durability and convenience of magnetic holders to securely attach your cell phones and keys to your wheelchair.\nAll angles of Attracmount: Attrac-tive huh??\nProblem\nThe Problem with Current Wheelchair Cell Phone Mounts\nSome of these mounts are great if you want to keep your cell phone semi-permanently attached to your chair, but in our fast-paced life we all know that convenience and accessibility are essential. \nOur Solution\nWe are all familiar with the ease of mounting our cell phone to a magnetic mount in our car, Attracmount takes all the convenience of a magnetic car mount and custom designs it to fit on your wheelchair! \nFeatures of the Attracmount\nAttracmount: Designed with the highest quality materials\nIt is our goal to create a beautiful, durable, and functional mount that fits your wheelchair. We use the best materials we can find to manufacture our mounts and make them high quality enough to fit your active lifestyle. The best part is that the whole setup is only 2 pieces, it literally takes seconds to install onto your chair!\nList of Materials: \nMount: Made with PC-ABS plastic. PC-ABS is a high-impact engineering thermoplastic ideal for functional manufacturing. PC and ABS are combined materials that when mixed gives the Attracmount body the heat resistance of PC and the flexibility of ABS. \nStrap: The strap is made from high-grade silicone, giving the strap the flexibility and anti-wear-and-tear factor (see video) needed in a functional product. This no-slip material will contour to your wheelchair bar or arm and securely absorb the shaking from your chair so your phone and keys remain stable and safe as you move about. \nPLAY\n\nMagnet: We use 4 Grade N52 Rare Earth Magnets as the base for Attracmount. These are the strongest grade magnets available and will have such a secure connection that your phone and keys will stay firmly attached to Attracmount and your chair even on the bumpiest of surfaces. N52 magnets are so strong in fact that the exact kind and thickness of magnet that we use is strong enough to lift a watermelon! See the demonstration of strength here: \nPLAY\n\nLet's see it in action!\nThe Attracmount attaches to any bar on your wheelchair: \nMounting your Cell Phone\n Taking your Cell Phone Off\nIt is that easy!\nMounting Keys & Taking Them Off\nWhen you order: What Comes with the Attracmount? \nEach order of the Attracmount comes with:\nMount with magnet\n2 different sized straps (to fit all different sizes of wheelchairs)\n2 metal plates (1 Phone plate, 1 keychain plate) \nNot Just For Wheelchairs!\nEven though Attracmount was primarily designed to fit the bars of a wheelchair, realistically it can fit on anything with a bar! We have tested this product on: \nBike Handlebars\nGolf Carts\nStrollers\nWalkers\nETC\n We know not all our amazing backers will be wheelchair users, and that's ok! The Attracmount has many applications useful to you too!\nOur Goal\nOur goal as a company is to design a catalog of better-designed human-centric products for people with disabilities. We want Attracmount to not only improve the convenience of carting around your stuff, but also improve the lives of people with disabilities through designing products with convenience in mind!\nWe also have a goal to make products that fit every budget, that is why we work with the best manufacturers and order large amounts to get the best prices, which translates into savings for our customers! The future MSRP will be $14.99, but Kickstarter prices are specially made to help us get backing, tell your friends! \nWhat We will Use the Funding For\nWe are looking to raise at least $5000, which will pay for the engineering molds and our first production run of the Attracmount. \nTimeline\nWe have already worked with a manufacturer in China to get our molds approved and materials sourced, this should reduce the amount of time it will take post-funding to get Attracmounts into your hands! That's the good news! \nHere is what we think the timeline will look like: \nOur Story\nAttracmount is a product of Handizap, the company that brought you the Sixth Digit : A ring stylus designed for use by people with limited hand function. Handizap is a company created by Founder and CEO Josh Smith, a mechanical engineer and product designer. Josh has a unique perspective on designing products for people with disabilities because he is, himself a quadriplegic who has used his experience as someone with a disability to design human-centric products for other people with disabilities. \nSee more of Josh's story and his success designing and marketing the Sixth Digit here: \nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are not in the process of working on any other projects right now so Attracmount is our biggest priority!

These outlets make our lives a paradigm of convenience, until you try to use the one tucked behind the bed or in the darkness in the middle of the night. Touch & Plug is the world\u2019s first outlet cover that functions as a plug guide \u2014 allowing you to easily plug into even the most hidden sockets.\nTouch and Plug\u2019s patent-pending design eliminates the need for sockets to be seen to be used. Once fitted, Touch and Plug turns any socket into an easy to use one. Put simply, if you can touch it, you can plug it.\nHow it works\nThe Touch and Plug is a wall outlet cover for traditional dual sockets and it measures 5.5 inches long and 3.5 inches wide. It can easily replace traditional dual socket covers. All you need is one screw and 30 seconds.\nThe slots built into the Touch and Plug outlet cover make using a hidden socket more straightforward than ever \u2014 slide the plug across the cover into the rectangular depression then onto the slots. Just move the plug up or down to find the socket holes. It\u2019s as easy as that. \nConvenience at your fingertips\nSockets are meant to be convenient \u2014 available just at an arm\u2019s length whenever needed. But when your arm is bent awkwardly behind the TV, dresser, bed, or couch blocking your view of the socket, it\u2019s not so convenient anymore. Touch and Plug doesn\u2019t just restore convenience, it enhances it. With Touch and Plug, every socket becomes easier to use than ever before. The cover\u2019s design helps guide you \u2014 plug in hand \u2014 into the wall socket with ease.\nSimplicity\nThis isn\u2019t a complicated device \u2014 once you\u2019ve fitted Touch and Plug over your existing socket, you\u2019ll find even the hardest to see becomes easy to use. Just touch, follow the grooves, and plug in.\n Why do you need Touch and Plug?\nTo make your life easier, of course! Whether you\u2019re a mother juggling children while trying to plug in their latest toy, or a tech-head texting while you no-look plug in your tablet to charge, Touch and Plug makes using sockets a quicker and easier experience every time.\nTouch and Plug makes it easy for:\nBusy parents\nTeenagers\nGrandparents\nSeniors\nPeople with physical disabilities and visual impairments\nWhy does the world need Touch and Plug?\nThis is a product that will bring convenience to the masses by eliminating frustration and wasted energy, but for some members of our community Touch and Plug offers more than just convenience. Its potential to grant greater independence to people with visual impairments is massive\u2014 and enhancing independence for everyone is Touch and Plug\u2019s top priority.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any new project there are risks \u2014 this is uncharted territory.

This way, we are sure we will have enough resources to pursue these features without compromising our original promises.\n$100k - Release Joopic App for Mac and PC by Christmas (UNLOCKED)\n$200k - CamBuddy Pro ships in full retail packaging (UNLOCKED)\n$400k - CamBuddy Pro provides support for shutter ramping (in the update in Jan. 2017) for intervalometer shooting, and focus stack and HDR shootings (in the update in Mar. 2017) (UNLOCKED)\nPlease help us to promote this project! Or if you are already our backer, please see our Backer Referral Program below.\n      FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\nLong-range full control with live view \nThe long operating range (up to 100 feet) of CamBuddy Pro allows you to capture the wildest creatures' close-up from a safe distance. You have a real-time view of the image and can adjust the exposure time, aperture, ISO, exposure compensation, shooting delay, and other parameters any time on your smartphone. The app also allows you to auto-focus by tapping anywhere of the image or fine tune with manual-focus.\nTime-lapse photography    \nThrough CamBuddy Pro\u2019s intervalometer function you can create time-lapse photography on you smartphone easily. You can set the number of shots, interval, and delay time; Moreover, you can quickly play back the pictures by using our app and create a time-lapse video.\nPLAY\n\nHigh-speed photography with four built-in sensors\nCamBuddy Pro is equipped with four sensors - sound, lightning, laser, and radio, as well as a built-in radio transmitter. Combined, it unlocks many creative photography modes including sound/light/laser/radio activated shutter or flash, or use sound/light/laser/Joopic app to activate the built-in radio transmitter to set other cameras to go off. You can capture high-speed motion scenes and fleeting moments, creating amazing pictures with ease. \nSound-triggered shooting\nSet the trigger to go off at a desired sound level. Capture the clinking of glasses or activate the camera by hand clapping.\nSound triggered shooting\n Lightning-triggered shooting\nSet the trigger to go off when lightning strikes. You can also synchronize multiple CamBuddy Pros with a flash to shoot an object from different angles simultaneously. \nLightning triggered shooting\nLaser-triggered shooting\nSet your camera to go off when something breaking a laser beam aimed at CamBuddy Pro. Capture the transient object or wildlife in action. A CamBuddy-specific laser generator is included in the laser bundle. \nLaser triggered shooting\nRadio-triggered shooting\nSet your camera to go off by radio-waves. Radio trigger is immune to harsh environmental conditions and can be used to set off multiple CamBuddy Pros synchronously. CamBuddy Pro has a built-in radio transmitter that can be activated from the app, or by light, sound, and laser. You can also get a handheld CamBuddy-specific radio transmitter by supporting the \"radio bundle\". \nUltimate selfie from 100 feet away \nNo need to challenge your arm's strength. Take a selfie from 100 feet away with an easy smile and a simple click. @Ben Stiller could retire his world record long selfie stick of just 28 ft.\nShoot-and-push\nPhotos taken are automatically pushed to your smartphone through the Shoot-and-Push function. You can also edit, manage, and share the pictures on social media.\nOne smartphone, 128 cameras \nConnecting and controlling multiple cameras to shoot one object from different angles is a key and original innovation of CamBuddy Pro. \nSimply, you can setup the cameras connected in synchronized mode, and every camera works under the same trigger function (e.g., sound trigger, lightning trigger or radio trigger). When there is a sound, lightning, or radio signal, all cameras will capture pictures at the same time from different angles. By using Joopic app, you only need to setup one CamBuddy Pro's work mode, others will follow up. Under synchronized mode, you can even setup every camera in the array has an equidifferent delay time.\nCamBuddy Pro provides the ability to connect to up 128 cameras to capture stunning Matrix bullet-time footage,  as demonstrated in the video.\nWhen you are in a wedding ceremony, you may want to use two or more cameras to shoot bride and groom from different angels. For this situation, we can setup the cameras to work in master-slave mode. You can hold the master camera and capture the close range scene. Meanwhile, the slave cameras, which are fixed in other positions and controlled by CamBuddy Pros, can be triggered by a lightning from your external flash or a radio wave from a handheld radio transmitter.  \nThis scenario can also be used to monitor your home or office. You can set the master CamBuddy Pro to work under laser trigger mode. When someone break the laser, the CamBuddy Pro can be triggered to send a radio wave, which then trigger other cameras to take a picture or start to record a video.\nControl multiple cameras simultaneously through wifi-connection\nControl multiple cameras in master-slave mode through CamBuddy Pro build-in radio transceiver\n  SOFTWARE\nEssentially, CamBuddy Pro is an app-controlled smart device. So we spend many efforts to develop the app and the firmware.\nThe Joopic App is now free to download for iOS and Android:\niOS app link, Android app link \nThe next big update of Joopic App will be available before this Christmas Day. In this update, Joopic App will provide a completely new module for CamBuddy Pro. The following picture shows some screens of Joopic App for CamBuddy Pro:\nWe are also developing the app editions for PC and Mac. The following pictures show the design of the desktop editions of Joopic App:\n    We will release the desktop editions of Joopic App before this Christmas Day. \nTECH SPECS\nWidely Supported Cameras\nBy using CamBuddy Pro and Joopic app, you can remotely capture pictures through the shutter release port of your camera. Therefore, if your camera has a shutter release port, you can use CamBuddy Pro with it.\nFortunately, almost every DSLR camera has a shutter release port (only a few old DSLR cameras have no shutter release ports). Therefore, you can use the remote shoot, the intervalometer, the smart trigger, the multi-camera control functions of CamBuddy Pro with your DSLR camera, including those from Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax, Panasonic, Leica, Hasselblad, and Ricoh.\nEspecially, the following DSLR cameras are fully supported; CamBuddy Pro provides all features mentioned above for these cameras:\nCanon EOS:\n1D Mark IV, 1D X, 1D X Mark II, 5D Mark II, 5D Mark III, 5D Mark IV, 5DS, 5DSR, 6D, 7D, 7D Mark II, 50D, 60D, 60Da, 70D, 80D, 100D (Rebel SL1), 550D (Rebel T2i / Kiss X4), 600D (Rebel T3i / Kiss X5), 650D (Rebel T4i / Kiss X6i), 700D (Rebel T5i / Kiss X7i), 750D (Rebel T6i / Kiss X8i), 760D (Rebel T6s), 1300D (Rebel T6)\nNikon:\nDF, D3X, D3S, D4, D4S, D5, D300, D300S, D500, D600, D610, D700, D750, D800, D800E, D810, D810A, D90, D3100, D3200, D3300, D5000, D5100, D5200, D5300, D5500, D7000, D7100, D7200\nAlmost all modern non-SLR cameras, for example, mirrorless or general digital cameras from Sony, Nikon, Olympus, Samsung, Panasonic, and Fuji, are partially supported by CamBuddy Pro. You can use CamBuddy Pro to browse and transfer the pictures and the videos taken by the camera to your smartphone instantly without copying the files to your desktop computer first.\n  If you are still wonder whether your camera are supported by CamBuddy Pro, please send a message to @creator or leave a message as a comment. We will answer your question as soon as possible.\nThe diagrams below illustrate the ports and the cables used to connect a CamBuddy Pro with a camera or other devices.\nA) You can use the micro USB cable included in the product package to charge CamBuddy Pro. Note that the cable is for charging only, not a USB data cable. \nB) You can use the USB data cable shipped with your camera to connect CamBuddy Pro to your camera's USB port. If you want to use live view or remote shoot, or transfer pictures from your camera, you use this port.\nC) You can use a shutter release cable to connect to your camera's shutter release port. When you use the intervalometer or the smart trigger functions, you can choose this port to release the camera's shutter. \nD) You can use a standard 3.5mm PC flash cable to connect to an external flash. When you use the intervalometer or the smart trigger functions, you can choose the port to trigger the external flash.\nREWARDS\nWhat are the perks? \nEarly bird and Kickstarter special.

We believed innovative picture taking could be more fun, and photos could be shared more easily and instantly. With these beliefs in mind, our team spent countless nights designing, programming, and prototyping to bring CamBuddy Pro to life. Credits also go to volunteers around the world who helped us during beta testing, making CamBuddy Pro perfect. \nThe enthusiasm from the community convinced us CamBuddy Pro will be a big success. We already made the investment on all production equipment needed and your support will allow us to start now. We will not wait until the end of the campaign, but start production as soon as the campaign goal is reached. Back us with the \"Christmas Special\" perk and put CamBuddy Pro on your holiday list. \nOur Team - Engineers \nOur operation in Houston, TX is supported by an amazing engineering team based in Beijing, China. Our engineers have the strongest background and every expertise in hardware design, coding, and manufacturing. We have gone through numerous rounds of prototyping and now present to you the CamBuddy Pro that we are proud of. \nOur Team - Beta Testers\nWe are a small team supported by a big community of photographers. We knew we couldn't build the best product without listening to you. Special thanks go to @Julie Everhart who volunteered to offer us tremendous insights to make CamBuddy Pro more powerful and intuitive to use. We are honored to have her as CamBuddy's first ambassador. Check out her posts about what she can do with CamBuddy: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/julieeverhartphotography/\nhttps://twitter.com/julev69 \nhttps://www.instagram.com/julev69/ \nWe are fortunate to have many volunteers like Julie around the world to help us beta test CamBuddy Pro. They have undergone extensive testing to find bugs and help us make improvements until perfection. \nA video review from @Kerrie Meister: \nPLAY\n\n  Another review from @Chad Wildermuth: \nhttp://bit.ly/2dlw6ES\nSee more what beta testers are able to do with CamBuddy Pro at \nwww.twitter.com/urcambuddy\nwww.facebook.com/urcambuddy", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you", "descp": "Thank you for supporting CamBuddy Pro.

It\u2019s the first DSLR remote control that you won\u2019t even notice is there. It becomes one with the camera\u2019s design and won\u2019t get in the way of what you love doing: taking photos and videos.\n    We are proud to announce a cooperation between foolography and Triggertrap and making our Unleashed compatible with the Triggertrap app, and the Triggertrap app compatible with the Unleashed. You can use both our app as well as all the cool triggering features of the Triggertrap app that people might already be used to, but now wirelessly with your Unleashed!\n    Developing the Unleashed, we had one big design goal: it\u2019s tiny size. You can leave the Unleashed on the camera at all times, even when packing it into your bag. The hot shoe stays free so you can keep using your external or popup flash, LED panels or shotgun mics.\n  The Unleashed is the first wireless remote that gives you complete control over your DSLR \u2013 as if it was still in your hands. Experience a professionally designed app for Android and iOS that lets you change all the important settings: aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, exposure compensation and much more.\n  With this you can easily get the perfect shot, no matter if you\u2019re behind or in front of the camera, right next to it or further away. Change settings and trigger at the right moment\u2013 without even touching the camera.\nExperience a professionally designed app for Android and iOS\n  Startrails by Oliver\n  Everyone loves videos. So do we. The Unleashed lets you start and stop videos from a distance and easily adjust your settings for the next scene or while you film.\n    We designed the Unleashed to be ready whenever you want to use it. It doesn\u2019t need to be charged, and automatically reconnects to your smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy so you don\u2019t need to reconfigure your wifi settings each time you shoot remotely! It\u2019s Plug\u2019n\u2019Play and always ready to use.\n    One of the biggest advantages of digital photography is the possibility to instantly see results. This is too cool to miss when shooting remotely, so the Unleashed will send a thumbnail to your smartphone for quick review and checking exposure. And if needed, simply adjust the settings right from your smartphone to get that shot you wanted!\n    Wireless remote control is vital for vibration free long exposures, breathtaking startrails, as well as epic timelapses. The Unleashed allows interval shooting and even supports carefully controlled exposure ramping for smooth day to night transitions \u2013 the \u201choly grail\u201d of timelapses. In addition to setting the exposure ramp manually as depicted, we are working on a fully automatic mode with the help of Gunther Wegner, the author of LRTimelapse - the de facto standard in timelapse post production software.\n    Timelapse by our friend photohod.de\n      The Unleashed can use your smartphone\u2019s location or a Bluetooth GPS receiver for direct geotagging. The exact GPS location of where you take the photo is saved in its metadata immediately. Relive your vacation by viewing your photos on a map. Or find pictures of your favorite spots by simply zooming in on their location, without having to remember exactly when you were there. Almost every photo management software already supports geotagging.\nShow photos of your travel route on a tablet\n  There are times when you have to work with more than one camera. Either you\u2019re taking photos at a wedding or shooting a video. You could be behind the main camera, but with our app you can control up to six cameras at once. Start recording at the same time, trigger all cameras at the right moment, or synchronize settings beforehand. Don\u2019t worry about missing a moment or an angle, even if you\u2019re missing a crew.\n  We believe in reliability. To reach our expectations of quality, our Unleashed is completely Made In Germany. We make sure the Unleashed is produced locally, because in our experience, a close relationship with the manufacturers is what makes the difference. Because making high-end products means going strong right from the start.\n  We don\u2019t want any bulky devices or cables that go from one end of the camera to the other. We think camera accessories like ours need to be unobtrusive and merge with the camera so that you can leave them on the camera the whole time. With this goal, we tried to build a product that would fit on all DSLRs from both Nikon and Canon. However, during the R&D phase we soon realized that this would not be possible, at least not without compromising on key characteristics we wanted the Unleashed to have. This is why the Unleashed will be available in a few different versions that will fit perfectly to your camera model: The very same product in slightly different formats.\n  Unleashed models N3 (also with optional cable) on Nikon D7100 and C2 on Canon 6D\n    Being hobby photographers ourselves, we are very passionate about what we do. This is what drives us \u2013 it did at the start, and still does today. Our first commercial product, the Unleashed \u201909 is a Bluetooth module allowing the exact GPS location to be written in the photos\u2019 metadata the instant you press the shutter. Back in 2007, when Oliver was looking for a product that would let him geotag his photos directly with his Nikon D200, he couldn\u2019t find anything viable on the market. He made some prototypes of a Bluetooth geotagging solution for himself and some friends, but received so much interest online that he founded foolography, built and launched the Unleashed \u201909 in 2009. Until today there is no geotagging solution more convenient than the Unleashed \u201909 :-)\n  That\u2019s how it all started. Today, after more than seven years in the hardware business, two successful product lines with thousands of happy customers, a move to Berlin in 2014 and a strong leadership team of Oliver and Ken, we\u2019re finally ready to launch an idea conceived early 2013. Our next product: the Unleashed.\nfoolography office in the heart of Berlin\n  Our team outside the office\n  Working on the firmware\n  Latest iteration of app screen sketches\n  1) Reverse engineering protocols 2) Prototyping with dev boards 3) Choosing components and testing with custom PCBs\n  Latest design prototype versions\n        A huge THANK YOU for your invaluable support: Alex, Ang\u00e9lene, Basti, Ben, Christin, Christina, Daniel, Jessy, Johannes, Lennart, Maria, Marius, Sophia, and Tim.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing the Unleashed to life and getting it into your hands is our biggest goal! We want nothing more than for you to be a happy customer who loves using the Unleashed. \u2013 Maybe even on a daily basis.\n\nHaving been a hardware company for seven years, we know how hard it is to realize a physical high-tech product, with all the research and development, choosing and getting all the components, designing for manufacturing, finding reliable manufacturing partners and managing the different parties involved. The great thing is: we\u2019re not doing this for the first time, we have experience, good relationships with our manufacturers and we take this project very serious.\n\nFive different versions might seem daunting, but the differences are mainly in the type and orientation of plugs we use for the different cameras. We know what we're getting ourselves into: our current products are available in three versions, so we have experience with production, stocking and shipping multiple versions. The injection molded casings usually make up the biggest part of the fixed costs of a product like this, but we've designed them to accommodate multiple PCBs, so we're currently planning for only 3 distinct casings. Large portions of the schematic and PCB layout will remain the same for the different versions. \n\nWe will always do our best to communicate with our suppliers and manufacturers early enough to stay on track with our estimated timeline. We\u2019ve even factored in some additional time \u2013 since we already know they\u2019ll need some on top of what they promise ;-) As you can see in our timeline, we\u2019ve planned to work on our parts in parallel, so we never have idle periods while waiting on our suppliers. However, as you can imagine, we can\u2019t foresee everything, due to our dependencies on other parties, as well as changing lead times of electronic components. What we can promise though, is that we will do our very best to adhere to our timeline, motivate our partners to deliver on time and that we will have transparent communication with our backers to keep you updated as well as we can on a regular basis.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "VOTE for my unsupported Camera", "descp": "The Unleashed won't be available for your camera in this campaign?

Spooly makes on-the-go charging a breeze.\"\nWelcome to Spooly, the most portable full-length charging cable ever. Spooly has a clever design which takes up virtually no space and is durable enough to withstand the rigours of everyday life on the move. Spooly might look tiny, but definitely lives long.\nSpooly\u2019s incredibly portable design simply would not be possible using regular cable \u2013 the Mag-System uses bespoke magnetic cable which quickly and effortlessly aligns the cable to form a perfect and secure coil. Then simply pull to un-wind \u2013 it\u2019s that easy.\n  Whether you\u2019re doing some urban exploring or an off-road adventure, Spooly\u2019s form fitting case offers complete protection. The robust, yet elegant design fits comfortably in your pocket making Spooly the ultimate adventure cable.\nAlways there when you need it most. The Keymaster attaches to your key-ring to ensure you have a charging cable you on you at all times. Just grab you keys and go!\n  Plug in the right way, every time. This USB Type-A design is a user-friendly reversible connector that allows you to connect your cable to your device or wall outlet in any direction. Compatible with all standard USB slots.\nTechnical Details\nSpooly & Keymaster Connectivity Options  \nSupported by Apple, Android, Windows and Google operating systems. Whichever your device preference- Spooly's got you covered. *Options will be available via survey after campaign ends.\n 2.4 amp cable\n Fast charging and data transfer \nSpooly Dimensions\nAvailable in 1 meter or 1.3 meter length.\nSpooly 1.3 meter dimensions: 43 x 60 x 7. Protective case included with every Spooly cable.\n  Spooly's great for providing the reach and flexibility you seek at home, at work or on-the-go.\nKeymaster Dimensions\nProtective case + keyring included with every Keymaster cable.\n  25cm in length. Perfect for when using a laptop at your desk or coffee shop minimising cable clutter around your workspace.\n Spooly Evolution\nAvailable in 1 meter or 1.3 meter length.\nSupported by Windows, Google, and Mac operating systems, as well as many device manufacturers.\nUp to 10 Gbps data transfer rate\nUp to 3 amp charging output\nConnect between USB-C enabled devices (new Macbook, Chromebook Pixel, USB-C chargers) Transfer data at incredible speeds, charge other devices, and even power mobile devices.\n1.3 meter dimensions: 46 x 58 x 9. Protective case included with every Evolution cable\n  Colour Options\n  The Special Edition Kickstarter Green/Black is exclusive for Kickstarter backers. We will not offer it in retail. *Options will be available via survey after campaign ends.\n\n USB-IF Certification Program\nAll versions of Spooly will be tested using the USB-IF Compliance Program which means that this cable will be certified to meet all electrical, mechanical, and environmental standards, ensuring a safe and superior user experience.\nMag-System\nAn innovative feature that took over 6 months in development, we love Spooly\u2019s Mag-System, which is why we\u2019d love to share an insight of the process with you. We chose hardwearing and highly flexible thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) blended with powdered barium ferrite particles in sections for our bespoke cables.\nBarium ferrite is an extremely good insulator and doesn\u2019t allow any electrical current to flow through it, which makes it perfectly safe. These sections are then magnetized by rolling the cable through an electromagnetic field with a field strength of at least 20,000 oersteds, resulting in cables that are highly flexible, rollable, and resistant to wear and tear.\n  Spooly Team\nScott McCormack\nScott has over 18 years expertise in product design, electrical and mechanical engineering. Extremely passionate about innovation and engineering, he invented his first product at 17 \u2013 an electronic and biometric security lock powered by kinetic energy. He believes that simplicity and quality make the best products. Before creating Spooly, Scott worked on design projects in India, China and the UK.\nJinger Chen\nJinger was born in China. She moved to the UK when she was 21 and met Scott while studying at Oxford University. Both share a passion for design. Fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese and English, Jinger has many connections in China and uses these to source and work with manufacturers of the highest standards without language or technical barriers \u2013 a key role that helps manufacture Spooly\u2019s unique components.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are a small innovative company with huge ambition, dedication and determination. Though we\u2019re ready to battle it out with some of the biggest competitors in the industry, we can\u2019t do it alone. We need your support AND we need you to be part of the story.\nHelp us by sharing Spooly with your friends!\nPlease spread the word!

The two main comments we\u2019ve received are: When are you coming out with larger bands & when will you have more colors? We finally can say yes to those two questions with this Kickstarter project.\nNew 3/4\" Band Now Available!\nGlow-In-The-Dark & More Colors Available!\nFor those new to our handy little product, StickQuik Bands\u2122 are a Patent-Pending accessory that offers the user instant, handy access and organization for tools, utensils or implements of any kind.\nOur new StickQuik Big Bands\u2122 are made to snugly fit any ferrous or non-ferrous tool, socket or utensil handle. StickQuik Big Bands\u2122 come in .750\" (19.05 mm) diameter to accommodate larger diameter items that our original bands couldn\u2019t handle.\nGreat For Any Tool, Utensil or Implement!\nStickQuik Big Bands\u2122 are made of high grade TPR that is embedded with rare earth magnets, the strongest permanent magnets available. TPR was chosen for its durability and elasticity.\nDurable Indoors and Out!\nWe've also made an upgrade to the Rare Earth magnets we use in all of our StickQuik Band\u2122 sizes. The magnets are now coated (gold colored instead of metallic) to prevent any possible corrosion.\nNew Coated Magnets!\nWhy TPR instead of silicone like our previous versions? There were two driving factors: Making StickQuik Bands greener and making them more inexpensive. We wanted to make our StickQuik products greener than just the recyclable paper and plastic we use in its packaging. TPR is a more easily recyclable material and also has better chemical resistance to Acids and Bases than silicone. Plus TPR is lower in cost than silicone, making the product less expensive.\nPerfect for the Garage or Shop!\nThe Rare Earth magnets in our StickQuik Big Bands\u2122 are larger and stronger than our smaller sized bands. Our new Big Bands can hold heavier objects as compared to what our original sizes hold.\nBig Bands Handle Heavy Tools!\nDisk and Strip Accessories\nIf you don\u2019t have anything metal to have the bands stick to, some of the rewards will have the option to get the bands with 1\u201d  adhesive metal disks or 12\u201d metal strips that have adhesive tape, screw hole or pegged mounting styles, so you can stick them anywhere.\nExtra Discs and Strips will be available if the pledge you have doesn't have accessories. When our survey goes out add $6.00 per 6 pack of Adhesive 1\" Metal Disks or $4.75 per 12\" Metal Strip. Adhesive, Screw Hole or Pegged mounting styles available for strips.\nSee Chart below for Disk & Strip Colors and Graphics.\nAccessory StickQuik Disks & Strip\nWhy Kickstarter Again?\nWe loved the experience we had with Kickstarter! We still love seeing others who have great ideas that they want to share with everyone. We love seeing the energy Kickstarters put into their projects. We also had fun cross promoting with other projects and sharing ideas and learning from the other project creators. Like our previous project, we\u2019ve self-funded up to this point and have taken it as far as we can.\nBig Bands Work Great On BBQ Utensils!\nTo make our bands greener, we had to change manufacturers, as our last one doesn't handle TPR. Our new manufacturer has been in business for 50+ years and have the experience to deliver a great product. They handle the tooling for the mold and the injecting. There is no wasted time sending the tooling out and waiting for it to come back.\nThe $30,000 goal is to fund new tooling costs for TPR, raw materials and initial production costs, allowing us to meet our minimum order quantities.\nHow StickQuik Bands\u2122 Began\nTo learn the history of our bands, please check out our last campaign by clicking here.\nProduction Timeline\nLate April 2016\n\u2022 StickQuik Big Band\u2122 campaign for Kickstarter is launched\nJune 2016\n\u2022 Project Funds\nJune 2016\n\u2022 Funds Clear\n\u2022 Order final tooling for mold.

Most of our shoelace pictures are up-close shots portraying a unique design with parallel lines. They actually look really cool and add some character. From eye level though, it's a different story. You would never spot them on someone passing by.\nMinimal by design. The Lace Anchors are manufactured from a fiber filled resin providing amazing strength and preventing any breakage or warping. The end clips, if used, have multiple rows of teeth that clinch the laces. This allows you to pull as hard as you would like without the end clips separating from the laces. We did, however, design the end clips to be adjustable, this means you can unlock them and re-lock them if you need to make shoelace length adjustments.\nIt's about combining style, comfort and convenience. Our Xpand shoe lacing system packs a powerful punch. We want to make sure that we have our bases covered when it comes to all aspects of wearing your shoes. First we offer you 24 colors. Then we offer you a fully adjustable fit providing comfort whether you're heading out for a night on the town or running a marathon. Last but not least, you will never have to tie your shoes again! We know it's not some crazy technology product promising to teleport you to the moon, but we can guarantee it will bring a smile to your face everyday you slip your feet in.  Sometimes it's about the simple things in life.\nZero interruptions, 100% focus. When using our lacing system, your shoes will never cause any distractions like untied laces or tension loss. You will be able to focus 100% on hitting that next mile marker and making it to the finish line. You get to decide how tight or loose your shoes will fit by adjusting pre-set tension when installing the Lace Anchors.  Whether it's in your cross-fit class or on a treadmill, we guarantee there will be zero shoelace malfunctions!\nLess bulk more comfort.  Not only does our system rid your shoes of the bulky mechanical objects other systems use, we believe our laces provide more comfort.  Round elastic laces can cause pressure along the top of your feet, whereas our flat laces provide a more even spread-out pressure.\n Kids love to be as creative as you will let them be.  Not only will you love the fact that your kids shoes are magically transformed into perfect fitting slip-ons, but you're giving them the opportunity to show off their creative side!  They can start in any eyelet and finish in any eyelet, creating awesome designs that they can actually wear!\n           Reflective laces unlocked!\nThese are great for any night time activities. They will send off a reflective glow from almost any light source. These will be offered in 5 - 10 of the most popular colors! These images were shot in normal light conditions WITHOUT the camera flash and then in dark conditions WITH the camera flash.\nGlow in the dark laces unlocked!\nThese are our glow in the dark laces. Kids will love these. They are charged by placing them under bright light for 30 seconds. The glow will last approximately 5 minutes.\nRainbow laces unlocked!\nOur rainbow laces have a really smooth color transition with a different pattern on each side. The colors included on each lace are as follows: Orange, red, blue, green, yellow, purple and pink.\n   We are ready to rock and roll!  Over the past 3 years we have been designing and developing all components of the Xpand lacing system. It started with our very first Kickstarter project, Lace Anchors, which rounded up 9,565 backers and $147,000.  We have successfully tested Lace Anchors with people all around the world.  All of the hard work is done.  The molds and tooling have just been completed and what you see in this campaign are actual production parts.  Our shoelace manufacturer has successfully run hundreds of production cycles with their equipment to ensure their ability to manufacture consistent quality laces for us.  We have turned to Kickstarter to launch Xpand into the world, hoping for thousands of backers so we can place a huge initial purchase order.  Below you will find information that merely skims the surface of our Journey thus far.     \n Seattles Pillar Product Design Team.  Without the Pillar team involved in this project, Xpand would not be what it is today.  They have the creative minds and dedication to make ideas reality.  They are behind some amazing innovative ideas.  It's always a pleasure working with them! \nThe \"end clips\" were designed to give a finished look for those using the Lace Anchors on the exterior of the shoes. Great for marathon runners.\nThe interior of the end clips are specifically designed for the Xpand shoelaces. The teeth are strategically placed pinching our laces with great tension.\nSince we had a solid functioning design from our existing Lace Anchors for standard shoelaces, the changes were minimal for our Xpand laces. \"Minimal\" is the key word in our designs!\nOnce the design was finalized for the end clips, 3D prints are sent to the tool makers to complete the production molds.\nSame goes for the Lace Anchors. Once the design was finalized, 3D prints were sent to the tooling company to prepare \"molds\".\nAfter several small adjustments to the teeth size and material used, we have a flawless product! These are pictures of actual samples from the mold!\nThis is a picture of the sample Lace Anchors run from our new production molds. These are extremely durable made from a special blend of fiber filled resin.\nI really didn't have to learn much about the shoelace manufacturing process. What I did have to do was test endless elasticity rates. We wanted to make sure our product had perfect tension without losing it's strength over time.\nWhen I say we tested, I mean we tested. With so many elasticity rates and materials, we had our hands full. This is a small portion of the test cycles run with our manufacturer!\n\"Modeling shot\" of our final samples with a few of our colors and our chosen elasticity rate. We couldn't be happier and all of our hard work is paying off!\nThis is our favorite choice when it comes to packaging. We love how it looks, however, it does come with challenges. keeping it nice during shipping is a major one. We may switch to something a little more durable.\nDisclaimer: There were no endorsements by any Brands for this project. All shoes used in the pictures and videos were paid for and are my personal property. Although our product is used in all of the shoes in these pictures and/or videos, the shoes work perfect in their natural state without Xpands Shoe Lacing System. Our product simply gives the user an optional way to keep their shoes secure.\nDisclaimer: Just like any other shoelaces, it is the responsibility of the end user to make sure your Xpand Lacing System is installed correctly.  It is also the end users responsibility to make sure the pre-set tension is set tight enough to secure your shoes and give proper support under normal and high stress levels or during vigorous activities.  Always test with light activity to ensure the Xpand Lacing System is performing properly and securely before using under vigorous circumstances.  \nDisclaimer:  We do not own the music in our video but we did obtain the rights to use.

Does the Xpand Lacing System work with \"All\" Shoes?\nThere are so many shoes it's impossible to test on all of them. If you have eyelets and shoelaces, odds are they will work great. They work excellent with high tops as well!\n2. Can I run with the Xpand Lacing System?\nAbsolutely.  This system is designed with runners in mind.  You can pre-set the tension as tight as you would like.  You will also be surprised how comfortable our flat style laces are in comparison to the round elastic laces other companies use.\n3. Are the laces adjustable after I trim them?\nAbsolutely, just make sure that you don't trim them too short initially.  We suggest test fitting prior to trimming the laces.  Always set the initial adjustment on the loose side, you can always tighten them up if needed.\n4. Do they work on kids shoes?\nThey work excellently with kids shoes!  My kids love not having to worry about tying their shoes.  They are constantly coming up with creative designs as well. \n5. Can you ship international?\nYes. We will ship ANYWHERE in the world!\n6. Can I pledge for multiple rewards?\nPlease send me a private message for details.\n7.  Can I become a distributor?  \nYes.  Please send us a private message and we will get back to you.  \n8.  Do you have a patent?\nYes we do have Patents Pending.   We will monitor domestic and international trade shows as well as multiple USA/International internet and brick-and-mortar retailers and resellers. We will protect our Patents / brands / images / retailers / resellers to the fullest extent of the law.\nFor those of you that made it all the way to this point, I want to say thank you!

You play as Regeria, a female lawyer who can use her powers of logic and reason to prove her clients innocent.\nIt\u2019s not all that straightforward though. Sometimes, you may find compelling reasons for throwing a case, forsaking the very defendant you are sworn to protect. These decisions will affect the outcome of the case and will have a ripple effect on later episodes of the series.\nThe first episode has already been created, and you can download it at itch.io! Play it on Windows, Mac, Linux, or Android.\nRegeria Hope Episode 1 has won VNs NOW Best Fangame EVN for 2014! \nRegeria Hope has been featured on Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Silliconera, and Gamezbo.\n \"Regeria Hope is, as you correctly guessed, a fresh take on the Ace Attorney formula, that manages to successfully replicate its mood and gameplay and add enough new ideas to keep things interesting.\" - Konstantinos Dimopoulos.\n \"Regeria Hope Episode 2 is firmly on our radar now, and is something we feel suitable excited about after playing through this lively and entertaining introduction.\" - Spanner Spencer\nRegeria Hope is now on Greenlight! Please vote if you have the chance!\nAlthough in this far-flung future, society has progressed to the point where race, gender, and sexual orientation hardly play a factor, the legal system has regressed, becoming a twisted shadow of its former self.\nDespite Big Brother's pervasive surveillance and attempts to control the populace, crime still exists. Almost every crime is on camera, but those cameras miss important details. This has led to the police relying on whatever the state provides as evidence rather than doing any real police work. Criminals find a way around the state\u2019s security and are skilled at making it look like someone else committed their crimes. Dirty cops have become the most skilled criminals since their access to the state's systems allows them to manipulate the evidence with ease.\nAn innocent defendant\u2019s only hope is that the government appoints them a good lawyer who will do the footwork to find out what really happened and present the evidence in court. Without that, a guilty verdict is almost assured.\nIf a gangster boss came into your office and offered you an outrageous sum of money to make sure your newest client takes the fall for a crime he himself committed, would you do it?\nMaybe the offer is too good to refuse. After all, even your client is just some gangster. Everyone would be better off if he were convicted. You might decide to\u2026\nSure, you see an innocent man hang, but you have more money to spend on cases protecting defendants you think are worth fighting for. As an added bonus, the gang won\u2019t be trying to exact their revenge on you for the rest of your days.\nMaybe you can\u2019t quite stomach that outcome. Instead, you might\u2026\nYou make sure your defendant is found not guilty, and the search for truth continues. Problem is, you now have less money to spend on future cases and you will have gang members out to kill you if you bump into them. Other character\u2019s reactions to you will change based on your choice as well.\nPrepare your witness before they go up on the witness stand. Based on your choices, more or less information about the case is shared, and if you really want to, you can make your witness look like a fool in order to throw a case quicker or for whatever other reasons you might have.\nInvestigation of cases will be almost an entirely different game. You\u2019ll still be looking for clues and gathering evidence, but investigation is more than just a pixel hunt. You\u2019ll have a map filled with different areas, a number of turns before the end of the investigation phase, and a starter list of evidence you need to collect. Each turn, you can choose to move to a different area, search an area, to talk to a character in your current area.\nWhen talking to characters, you\u2019ll have a list of topics you can talk about, and characters will react to certain topics, giving you more evidence or more topics to discuss with other characters.\nAt certain times during the trial, you will have to convince the jury that the trial should continue or that your client is innocent. Since the burden of proof in Regeria Hope falls on the defendant (We said this legal system was messed up, right?), you have the opening and closing argument. Prosecuting attorney Artemis Narcissus will react to your opening argument, and you\u2019ll have the chance to rebuke her attacks in your closing argument.\nWhile you're doing this, you'll be listening to amazing music by Zack Parrish, winner of an Annual Game Music Award in 2013, and nominee in 2014. Here's a taste of the music you'll be listening to, which you can find in the first episode:\n  Regeria Hope\nRegeria is the character you will be playing as. She's just out of law school, but she is extremely capable when her confidence is up. While she is sometimes rattled by the press, she always holds hope out for her client until the very end. She has a distinct personality, but you decide her reactions and her decisions in each case.\nShe will never back down from a challenge. Her shout of \"Have at you!\" can make the most hardened prison guard jump!\nArtemis Narcissus\nThe prosecutor. As you may have guessed from her name, she is a bit\u2026 self-involved. She doesn't trust anyone, but she does trust in the justice system so a juicy piece of evidence will make her more interested in a case. Her favorite color is purple (the color of royalty, of course). You won\u2019t find her very far away from a mirror. Maybe somewhere along the line, you\u2019ll discover what made her so intent on hunting down criminals.\nHawk Shaw\nHawk is a good cop caught in a corrupt system. While he dresses and acts like a shady character, he will do what he can to ensure justice is served as long as his pay doesn't get docked. He has a strange definition of fun, but, once he thinks you're a good egg, you'll be glad you have him on your side.\nPharrell Triton\nPharrell Triton is Regeria\u2019s boss and mentor, a very charming and debonair lawyer. He's helped her through law school and was proud to see her graduate with honors. He certainly cares for Regeria, and he will respect any choice she makes, even if it's one that he does not agree with. He believes that Regeria should make her own path and won't try to influence your choices in any way. However, your choices will affect how he reacts to you.\nBrock \u2018En Hart\nBrock is a goofy kindhearted guy who Regeria doesn\u2019t really know much about. After his wife's death, he is absolutely distraught which leads him to do some incredibly stupid things in court. Depending on your actions, you\u2019ll be seeing more of him, or much, much less of him.\nRichard Bust\nThe Judge is more concerned with his own enjoyment of the trial than the accused's fate. While this is callous, he loves surprises more than anything and will allow Regeria to present any argument she wants usually because something exciting is bound to happen. As long as it doesn't get in the way of his lunch \u2014 a delicious turkey sandwich\u2026\nThe Jury\nYou thought the judge and his sandwich were bad? Wait \u2018til you get a load of these guys. They really just want to end the case as fast as possible, and don\u2019t care who lives or dies. It\u2019s going to take a whole lot of convincing just to keep a trial going for one more day!

She first played the Ace Attorney series in 2011 and it became the source of much inspiration! It's one of her all time favorites. Other games she likes include the Zero Escape series, Pokemon, Dangan Ronpa, Professor Layton, and Persona 3 and 4!\nRosendo Loste/Sendo\nRosendo is an artist with a passion for backgrounds. He was enamored by the worlds of his favorite games and anime which ultimately drove him to learn how to draw and paint his own worlds. \u201cI just love painting environments for characters to live in and explore.\u201d\n Zack Parrish\nZack was nominated for two Annual Game Music Awards for Outstanding Contribution - Independent Composer, and won it in 2013. His soundtrack for Valdis Story: Abyssal City was also nominated for best independent soundtrack for 2013. Zack also participated in the fan arrangement albums Harmony of Heroes & Harmony of Heroes: Final Smash(6 tracks by himself total).  His disdain for corn is so impressive that restaurant cooks know to keep the absurd yellow vegetable out of his sight at all times.\nRachael Messer (Regeria)\nRachael has studied voice work, voice acting, and stage work in college. She graduated with a  B.F.A in Theatre Performance.  She has voice acted in numerous animes, cartoons, video games, radio plays, and commercials. She is currently the voice of Shiara in the new animated TV series \"Prince Adventures\" and currently working on her own live action series called \"The Last Left\" while recording for more projects to come.

I'm Rocky Marks, a voice actor who loves video games, a student working hard at learning everything there is to know about this profession and a man who can't say no to steamed crab legs. I'm a big fan of Regeria Hope, which is what drew me to this amazing project. Everyone says to love your work, and as an actor and a fan, I do! My wife and I currently live in Washington State under the firm control of our cat, Marie Mustachio.\u201d\nDigglyCerides (Hawk)\nNeo-Old-West lawman Hawk is played by DigglyCerides. \u201cDiscovering and creating voices is an incredibly rewarding experience, and I hope you can hear me in many more things in the future!\u201d\nI\u2019m Nathan Low, creator and developer of Regeria Hope. My motivation to make a game came from the same place as many before me: I played a lot of games. I still remember when my father was playing The Legend of Zelda when I woke up on my 6th birthday. We ended up dying on those damn spike traps in the first dungeon every time. I\u2019ve always wanted to make a game, and, being a huge fan of the Phoenix Wright series, I thought that making a game in that style would be a good first step.\nYes, that means Regeria Hope is the first game I\u2019ve ever developed. That\u2019s an admission you won\u2019t see on many campaigns because it makes the prospect of backing a little riskier. I\u2019m able to put this out in the open, mostly because the first episode of Regeria Hope is done and available now for free! If you have any doubts I can finish the game, please go play the part of the game I have already finished, then come back and let me know what you thought!\nThe game began back in 2009 as an XNA game. There\u2019s probably an old TIGSource forum post somewhere with some embarrassing code or videos. Then, in late 2011, someone told me about Ren\u2019Py, a Python-based game engine for visual novels. When I found out how easy it was to write scripts for the game in that engine, it made me excited to get started for real. The community has been an extremely welcoming place as well, and everyone has been very helpful to each other.\nI wanted strong female leads because this is relatively rare in games. My goal is that the fact some characters are female is just an aspect of who they are. They are human characters with personalities, goals, and motivations. Their gender is not their defining characteristic. Nowadays, I\u2019m glad the game has a female protagonist since I have a little baby girl on the way, and I\u2019d love for her to play the game in the future.\nIt\u2019s been some time since I started this project. Now, I've built the framework \u2014 the characters, the tone, the stories, and the basic elements of the game \u2014 that I want to iterate on in the upcoming episodes. I\u2019ve put a ton of myself into the game, but I have even more ideas for how I can make it something truly special. That\u2019s where I need your help.\nSo far, I have spent between $2000 and $3000 on art and music to create the first episode of Regeria Hope. The episode turned out great, but I have a lot of ideas about what I\u2019d like to do in the upcoming episodes. This Kickstarter campaign will allow all of those ideas come to life in a series of all-new cases for Regeria to solve.\nOnly thanks to the funding from this campaign, we\u2019ll be able to make these ideas a reality:\nWrite and produce four entirely new episodes of Regeria Hope\nCreate new characters for the remaining episodes\nAdd the investigation and jury mechanics discussed previously\nGreatly expand the impact of the player decisions on the outcome of the story\nCommission an all-new score by award-winning game composer Zack Parrish.\nKickstarter provides a few additional benefits as well. It gives the team a good excuse to make some fun bonus material like desktop backgrounds and a digital art book. We all want to see more of Regeria in the world. Your contributions and enthusiasm can make that happen.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to gain the attention of many of the fans of this genre so we can get their feedback on what we've done so far and what we want to do going forward. With all of you, we can make Regeria Hope better than we alone ever could.\nReleasing the game in episodes is less risky for both you as a consumer, and for me as a developer. Basically, I want to make sure you get a game in your hands as fast as I can, and I can get feedback as fast as I can, without all this early access stuff. If I can release this game one episode at a time, it will give me a chance to receive feedback about the game and fix issues before they become major issues.\nSince the first episode is already finished and available, you can have confidence I'll be able to finish the upcoming episodes. My launch date estimates are conservative, so I feel confident that I will be able to make them. Delays can happen despite the best laid plans, and, if they do, backers will be the first to know about them.\nEpisode 1: Can you make it through your first actual case? 1 case, 10,177 words. Out now for free.\nEpisode 2: How far would you go to save a dear friend? 1 case, 15, 000 - > 20,000 words. Due October 31st. I'm putting this date a little bit further out because there's a baby due to be born any minute in March or April.\nEpisode 3: How hard are you willing to work in order to preserve justice? 2 cases, 15, 000 \u2192 20, 000 words. Due December 22nd.\nEpisode 4: Does money determine who lives and who dies? 1-2 cases based on choices. 8, 000 -> 20, 000 words, depending on choices. March 31st 2016.\nEpisode 5: Can you justify everything you've done? 1 case. 15, 000 to 20, 000 words.

The episodic nature of the game allows me to complete the game in smaller, more manageable chunks which will get to you much more quickly.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve brought in others to help with specific pieces of Regeria Hope, pulling it all together into a finished product still comes down to only me. I\u2019ve done my best to provide an accurate timeline for completion, but things don\u2019t always work out as we plan even if we plan with that fact in mind.\n\nMy promise to you, my backers, is that I will be transparent about my progress and any factors that may affect the game\u2019s release. I\u2019ve put a ton of myself into this project, and I appreciate your putting some of yourself in as well by backing.

I\u2019ve seen some notifications about people wondering if this was ever going to be finished, and I guess my answer is that the 2nd one will be finished for sure, but I\u2019m not currently sure when.\n\nNot for lack of trying though. I\u2019ve reached out to find coders, and found one that I paid money to who pointed out everything wrong with the code, but didn\u2019t do any coding. On the writing side, it\u2019s been very hard to find a writer that would write the characters the way I would like, and writing is the part I enjoy the most.\n\nThe part I am currently stuck on is wrapping up the final day of the case. I want it to all make sense, and feel satisfying no matter which way you finish it. Which is much, much harder than I guessed/planned it would be.\n\nLife has been tougher than usual for everyone for the last year or so, and I\u2019m no exception. Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t think about finishing this episode. Last year, I was \u2018this\u2019 close to having a publishing deal for Regeria Hope, but I didn\u2019t hit the deadlines I set for myself for the 2nd episode, and that was a tough deadline to miss. I also didn\u2019t think I could hit my deadlines realistically with a full time job and everything else that comes along with a house and family, and didn\u2019t want to miss out on precious time with my wonderful wife, and my precious son and daughter while they are growing up. Having a game released and published is still a dream of mine, and it might still happen, but I know now that I aimed too high.\n\nI want to commit to making the 2nd episode by the end of this year, with a big focus on working on it in March, April and May of this year.\n\nAfter the 2nd episode is out, I would want to look at the numbers of sales, costs, whether other members are still available, etc. to see where I stand. The amount raised was definitely enough to make at least one game and send out all the Kickstarter gifts, and I don\u2019t ever want to stop Regeria before her story is truly finished, but I don\u2019t want to keep people waiting anymore.\n\nThis year is going to be the year it gets finished.

The production versions will include a few extra details. We will provide updates as the project progresses. \nHi there! Welcome to the FLYT Solo project. Frustrated by traditional stands and messy bathroom counters, we designed Solo to clear the clutter and beautifully display our bathroom essentials. \nStill using a cup to hold your razor or toothbrush? There's a better way. Many of us just grab a cup from the kitchen to hold our toothbrushes or razors, but this results in buildup on the bottom from trapped moisture. Or we rest our razor on the counter, but this causes rust, rendering the razor unusable. And for toothbrushes...well, do you really want to put something that you put in your mouth on a germy bathroom sink? Most stands on the market have design flaws and take up too much space on our bathroom counters.\nWe at FLYT knew there was a better, simpler way. That\u2019s why we invented Solo. We stripped away the unnecessary, and kept the essential, to create a simple, elegant and functional design.\nYep, it\u2019s really that simple. Because life doesn\u2019t need to be more complicated. We\u2019re not into selling you on fancy contraptions that take up precious space. We believe in minimal designs that maximize on function.\nWhen you leave your razor or toothbrush on the sink or beside the bathtub, water accumulates and creates a fertile breeding ground for bacteria.\nOn top of that, many razor stands and toothbrush holders often have components that touch part of the head, leading to cross contamination. Storing your razor or toothbrush upright is an effective way to prevent rusted razors and kill most germs.\nElegant, compact design adds style to your bathroom and saves space\nIncreased airflow allows your razor or toothbrush to dry quickly, preventing rust and germs\nBuilt to stand the test of time. Guaranteed.\nSolo is CNC machined from the highest-grade metals to resist corrosion and gorgeously display your daily tools. Lifetime guarantee.\nQuality craftsmanship. Made in the USA.\nTo ensure the highest degree of quality, we use only the best materials and have rigorously tested and refined prototypes. All Solo stands will be manufactured right here in San Francisco, California.\nCompatible with almost any razor or toothbrush\n  After several trips to the store and one very long night, we\u2019ve tried nearly every type of razor or toothbrush we could think to stick in the Solo--and they all fit perfectly. How? Solo has an innovative step design on the inside, so it can accommodate different handle sizes with a snug fit. Check out a 360 view of the Solo.\nList of Confirmed Razors and Toothbrushes:\nRazors\nDollar Shave Club: The Humble Twin, 4X, The Executive\nGillette: Mach3 Disposable Razors, Fusion, Fusion Proglide with FlexBall Handle Technology, Fusion ProGlide Power Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology \nHarry\u2019s: The Truman, The Winston \nSchick: Quattro Titanium Razor, Quattro For Women, Xtreme3 Sensitive Refill Cartridges \nEdwin Jagger DE89bl Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor\nToothbrushes\nColgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Medium \nOral-B: Complete Toothbrush, 3D White Pro-Flex Toothbrush Medium, Full Head Preserve Toothbrush Medium\nDon't see yours listed?

We'll ask which you want when we send out our survey at the end of the project.\n45\u00ba Plug: In our pictures you'll notice a 90\u00ba power plug. We've upgraded the plug to a 45\u00ba so you can plug in two MOS Reach into adjacent power outlets.\n The MOS brand is all about creating elegant solutions to everyday problems. You\u2019ve probably seen us here on Kickstarter\u2014we brought you MOS, the Magnetic Organization System keeping cables within easy reach since 2012. We also brought you the pint-sized MOS Menos and the indomitable MOS Spring cable to help you reduce cable clutter and tidy up your life.\nWe\u2019re excited to bring you the next labor of love in the MOS family...\nWhat is Reach?\nBasically, I live in a small room and I don\u2019t have a single power outlet that isn\u2019t hidden behind furniture. I have a lot of devices that require charging including my laptop, phone, Bluetooth speaker, power bank, and camera batteries. In the case of my laptop charger and camera batteries (things I need to take with me every day) I have to crawl under my desk or slide behind my nightstand to retrieve them.\nMy daily routine of plugging and unplugging helped me realize that the traditional wall outlet model was due for a redesign. While there are plenty of USB wall adapters on the market, none of them address the problem of power outlets being obstructed by furniture. First and foremost the power simply needed to be relocated to allow for easier access.\nThis allowed for power to reach ABOVE nightstands and desks and entertainment centers, the things that were causing me so much trouble, but the redesign didn\u2019t stop there. I wanted to create a flexible power solution with multiple mounting options that could twist and bend and contort around any kind of furniture or obstruction and mount horizontally and vertically to get power EVERYWHERE.\nOf course this would all be pointless if we didn\u2019t give Reach the capacity to charge and power every kind of modern device: two USB ports with enough capacity to charge an iPad, as well as a three-prong power outlet for laptop and other tablet chargers.\nI wanted to create a power solution with tastefully understated aesthetics so Reach could blend into its surroundings: an inconspicuous rectangle in both black and white to elegantly fit into any decor.\nFinally, it wouldn\u2019t be a true MOS product without magnets. By adding two super-powered neodymium magnets into the sides of the MOS Reach we could achieve the same organizational benefits of the MOS which keeps cables tidy, accessible, up off the ground, and ready for use.\n Each Reach comes with a pair of MOS cable ties so you can keep all your cables tidy, including the ones that are light on metal.\nWith this set of features in mind, we worked diligently to produce the product we had envisioned. There were bumps in the road that required a lot of attention. We had to do a lot of wrestling with our design in order to fit two 3.1 amp USB outlets, a three-prong 110 volt outlet, and magnets large and powerful enough to do the job. Persistence paid off in the end though, and our Reach prototype is as svelte as we could have hoped for while retaining all the functionality we initially imagined.\nThe cable also posed a challenge because we knew that we needed something much more flexible and attractive than the typical PVC commonly used. We vetted cable samples until we found a soft-touch TPE jacket that met our criteria. It definitely feels nicer than the more common options, but it also has some safety benefits which will help us secure UL certification for the Reach. This process is expensive, but it\u2019s a corner we\u2019re not willing to cut.\nBecause we like to obsess over materials, we went through a similar selection process to pick the ABS/Polycarbonate combination for the head\u2014it\u2019s a polymer most commonly used in the automobile industry, but we think it\u2019s perfect for the Reach.\nNOTE: The new design will now feature a 45\u00ba power plug instead of the 90\u00ba plug featured here, so you can easily plug in 2 MOS Reach into adjacent outlets.\nOnce we had the materials all locked down, we terminated the cable with a compact 90-degree plug (now a 45\u00ba power plug!) which gives the Reach a lot of leeway even in tight quarters. A lot of these choices were difficult to make, but it was worth the trouble to see our initial vision come to life.\nFeatures:\nReach gives you easy access to power outlets that are otherwise obstructed by furniture\u2014no more crawling under desks or shimmying behind dressers to charge your devices.\nReach has been designed to be as unobtrusive as possible and its compact size ensures that it\u2019s never in the way whether you use it on your desk, your nightstand, or your wall.\nReach consolidates your power outlets and USB wall adapters into an attractive moveable all-in-one power solution.\nReach helps you cut down on cable clutter by making clever use of Neodymium magnets in conjunction with MOS cable ties to keep out-of-use cables out of the way until you need them.\nReach works well even in tight quarters thanks to its slim 45 degree angle power plug.\nReach is composed of premium materials so it looks and feels great.\nReach gives you a choice of two mounting options: AirStick microsuction tape lets you give your MOS Reach a semi-permanent home on any flat surface. Foam adhesive tape works great if you want to give your Reach a more permanent station horizontally or vertically. The Airstick\u2122 microsuction tape can be cleaned with a damp cloth if it ever loses sticking power to bring it back to full strength.\nApplications:\nOffice Desk\nHome Desk\nNightstand for overnight device charging.\nBedpost/frame for convenient phone/tablet/laptop use.\nCouch foot/frame or coffee table for convenient phone/tablet/laptop use or for game controller charging while playing.\nWorkbench/hackerspace for convenient power tool switching.\nCraft/sewing bench\nEntertainment center (Xbox One/PS4 controller charging station)\nReach is great for travel since it can convert any single outlet at your hotel or airport into a mobile charging station. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\nSpecs:\nUSB 5V 3.1A total charging power (2 ports)\n1x 80-250V/15A power port\n175 Joule Surge protection\nStandard NEMA-5 compatible plug and receptacle for North American outlets\nHead composed of a premium ABS/Polycarbonate compound\n3-foot power cable with soft-touch TPE sheath\nComes in either White or Black\nDon't Worry! We've got you covered. Included in the cost of international shipping we are including 2 region-specific power converters with each Reach. We'll get pictures of the power converters as soon as possible. We want everyone to enjoy the benefits of the Reach.\nWrap Up\nThanks for taking the time to read through our pitch. We\u2019re confident that with your help we can add Reach to our growing line-up of clever solutions to everyday problems. As a quick recap, MOS Reach lets you tastefully relocate your power outlets to places that actually make sense: whether you affix Reach to your work desk, your nightstand, or your craft bench, you\u2019ll always have easy access to a 3-prong outlet, to USB ports, and to the organizational benefit of powerful magnets.

We\u2019re sure you\u2019ll enjoy using your Reach as much as we enjoyed creating it.\n$100,000 \u2013 45\u00ba Angle Plug & Longer Cable \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nThe addition of a 45\u00ba plug allows the Reach to be used in more places. For example, with the cable exiting the plug at a 45\u00ba angle, you can use two MOS Reach in one power outlet at the same time.\nThe longer cable will be an as-yet-to-be-determined length between 4-6 feet. We received a lot of good feedback from our backers that the 3 foot cable in the original design was too short for some applications. We'll let you know as soon as we decide the length of the cable. You can voice your opinion in our survey.\nMOS Spring cables are the perfect accessory to the MOS Reach. At 3 feet long they make it easy to manage a charging station on your nighstand or desk when used with the MOS Reach. The MOS Spring cables feature anodized aluminum heads, metal spring strain relief to prevent shorts, and our Exoskeleton\u2122 hyper-durable cable jacket.\nAll MOS Spring cables are covered by our lifetime warranty. If your MOS Spring cable fails for any reason just send it back and we'll give you a new one, no questions asked.\n Find out more about our popular MOS Spring Cables.\n1.

They will accompany you in your everyday life, standing the test of time and telling the story of your journeys.\nThe two main stress points are reinforced with rivets in order to maintain a close-fitting over time.\nThe sleeves closing is simple and instinctive, no need to use magnet, zipper or any other hardware can be danger for your gears. The flap tucks into the sleeve and holds the device tightly inside.\nThe two stitching along the borders creates a thick leather spine that will cushion the edges of the device in case of shock.\nThe sleeve is made of two pieces of leather, a thick one for rigidity, and a thinner that makes the folding flap.\nThe opening remains fully accessible from the top in order to draw the device faster than anyone.\nWe use the finest full grain vegetable tanned cowhide from traditional tanneries in Crete. Vegetable tanning is the most traditional way of tanning hides.\nMost of the process is done by hand. Unlike chrome tanning, vegetable tanning can take up to 40 days to produce a piece of dyed leather. Vegetable tanning uses natural ingredients such as the bark of chestnut trees to tan the leather.\nAdvantages:\nVegetable tanning is an age old tradition, so most tanneries have very skilled craftsmen producing and dying this type of leather\nEach leather product that is dyed using vegetable tanning is completely unique\nLeather Aging\nVegetable tanned leather wears gracefully and molds to the owner's habits over time. All vegetable tanned leather darkens and develops a rich patina over time with exposure to sun, water and oil. During its lifetime, a vegetable tanned product get an unique patina that is strikingly different from how it looked had it for the first time in your hands.\nSustainability\nOur leather is an exclusive natural product, the edges are glued with a non-toxic water-based glue. We are using only vegetable tanning agents and environmental friendly substances, trying to aim the best possible ecological compatibility. Leather products that have been vegetable tanned are the only that can be recycled.\nLeather Conditioning\nThere is no need to add oil or conditioner to your new Hector Hardskin. Over time, oils from your hands will condition the sleeve naturally, and it will gradually change color and mold to its contents. Vegetable tanned leather can be lightly cleaned and conditioned by buffing briskly with your hand or a soft cloth. This friction slightly heats the leather and brings its natural oils to the surface.\nWhy we need your support ?\nUsually, leather goods with this area and thickness of leather are quite expensive. We figured out that with a simple design and the immediate availability of first quality leather material here in Greece, we are able to produce luxury leather goods with prices down to the earth.\nIn order to get the best skins at a reasonable price we need of course to buy a big amount of skins directly from the source in the oldest Cretan tanneries.\nWe will order a special batch of hides especially for you, we want to choose each skin of this batch carefully on site and take it freshly tanned, without any trace other than the ones that belong to the animal.\nThanks to :\nJeff Sarawi : Actor / Alkyoni Tsegou : Director / Kostis Fokas : Photographer, plans of the tanneries in Crete", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe started this project by doing sleeves for our devices because we were not finding products that were meeting our expectations. We cut the first skins ourselves with cardboard templates, and we even stitch the first model ourselves. It was a year and a half ago. Since then, we improved the way of doing them. We build a full chain of production, from the laser-cut template, to the press cutting of the skin and the stitching of the leather. The stitching was the most difficult part. \n\nIn the beginning we thought that we should work with craftsmen making bags, but the ones that we found were unable to make products that met our quality expectations.\n\nThe craftsmen that we will work with (in fact they found us, they heard about our project and what we were searching for and they called us), are specialized in making leather watches bracelets for Swiss luxury watches companies. Their experience and their abilities to make stitching marks looking good on both sides of the products make the difference. \n\nWe also learned a lot about the best way to treat skins and to choose them. We will go personally in Crete to choose them one by one.\n\nSo we believe that we are completely ready.

Since as long as anyone can remember, both kids and adults have loved to play shooting games. Computers and consoles brought us a different variety, one in which joysticks, a mouse or a touchpad replace toy pistols or rifles. Even if a gadget is used to represent a gun, the lack of an actual projectile makes for a very different experience. Now that touch-screens seem to have reduced the dimensionality of shooting games even further, SNIPE brings a brand-new experience to the arena. We are combining the very best of two worlds that, up until now, seemed to be mutually exclusive to each other. We have the technology ready and it can be in the palm of your hands, if you decide to back us!\nUPDATE: Watch our demo testings on a Touchscreen TV\nPLAY\n\nThe app presented in the video is a simple HTML mockup we've created just to test the Touch Darts. We also used this chance to determine once and for all who will win the World Cup - Brazil or France (in our bet France won).\nWe Are Innovators: With SNIPE\u2019s patent-pending Touch Darts and designated multi-platform game apps, you can turn your tablet into a limitless shooting playground, where your blasting skills truly count. SNIPE offers both the tactility of physical shooting games and the endless possibilities only computer and console games have to offer, making for a truly unique, one-of-a-kind experience.\nWe Are Shooters: From kids to adults, we all love to play shooting games, whether we are using a toy gun to blast our (mostly) innocent friends or playing within the exciting digital war zone generated by the latest console game. Mobile touch devices have changed the game. Suddenly, we\u2019re being inundated with one-dimensional game apps that only require one functional finger and an admittedly long series of quick swipes to become a pro.\nWe\u2019re Blending Physical Elements with a Digital Playground: SNIPE is all about the perfect blend of digital and physical elements within one revolutionary shooting game. The idea is simple: you use one of our SNIPE Blasters or another commercially available blasters to shoot SNIPE Touch Darts at your tablet while it\u2019s running one of our SNIPE apps (scroll down to learn more on SAFETY). Thanks to your tablet\u2019s touch sensors, the physical impact gets translated to exploding targets, accuracy ratings, game scores and more! \nWe\u2019ve Made SNIPE Cross-Platform: Best of all, we\u2019ll be providing a multitude of free SNIPE Apps for iOs, Android and Windows Phone, all of which are uniquely tailored for SNIPE Darts! From the get-go, you\u2019ll be able to shoot at a pyramid of cans, shatter moving bottles, challenge your friends in a duel or simply practice your sniping skills. Stretch goals include many more games, so start backing!\nWe're offering a variety of rewards from $5 to $10K! From a BIG, genuine, THANK YOU to a CRAZY one-of-a-kind BOOT CAMP Training in Israel, instructed by ex-IDF soldiers (!). Oh, and all the regular rewards you all expected:\nTo your right you would find the rewards section, where you'll see more awesome rewards for you real SNIPE Maniacs!\nInnovation is the cornerstone of our project and the next few paragraphs should please the technophiles among you! Here are some of the features that make the SNIPE Touch Darts so exceptional:\nSNIPE Touch Dart\nConductive Materials: Unlike any other foam dart, SNIPE Darts are made of a unique electro-conductive foam body, which is attached to a special touch-reactive rubberized suction cup. Together, they create the ability to interact with capacitive touchscreen devices.\n\u2018Free-Falling\u2019 Mechanism: Our innovative suction cup tip has tiny air pores that give SNIPE Darts the capability to stick to the tablet\u2019s screen for less then 2 seconds, before detaching and falling to the ground automatically. This is just enough time for the touch sensors to recognize the impact, and for you to shoot your next shot towards a clear screen.\nSpiral Body Design: A unique spiral design distinguishes a SNIPE Dart from all other foam darts, so you\u2019ll never mistake one for the other. Oh, and don\u2019t worry, the SNIPE Dart is extremely durable, with a range of up to (an astounding) 30 feet if the right blaster is used. \nPatent Pending: A patent on the SNIPE Dart\u2019s innovative technology and functionality was filed worldwide. This means you\u2019ll be buying a truly unique product so you can boast to your SNIPE-less friends and we can get in some extra cash by gleefully suing imitators!\nWhen the idea of SNIPE was born, we had one major concern \u2013 is it even safe to shoot toy darts at tablets?! Well, during our tests, we did our best to generate at least some physical damage, but we didn\u2019t even manage to destroy or hurt a single touchscreen device!\nAs our beloved physics high school teacher always told us, momentum is the result of mass and speed. When a projectile hits a static object, most of its momentum is transformed into impact force. Due to their light weight and their super-soft tips, SNIPE Darts have an impact force of no more than 0.05 Newton, which is 20 times weaker than what the weakest commercially available screen is designed to handle!\nThe EGG Test:\nAssumption: If it won\u2019t crack an eggshell, it will never harm a tablet!\nMethod: We shot 10 SNIPE darts from each of our blasters and from several commercially available blasters (Jolt\u2122, N-strike\u2122 and others).\nTarget: An egg. No animals were hurt in the process.\nDistance: 0.2 to 4 meters.\nResult: Nothing! Zilch. Zero. The eggs were left unharmed. We boiled and ate them afterwards, though.\nPLAY\n\nDo you own one of those crazy blasters with a velocity faster than 38 m/s? Use our calculator to be sure you can still shoot at your tablet without it being harmed! (Read more on the safety tests here).\nYou\u2019ve probably guessed it by now (mainly because we\u2019ve been telling you since the first paragraph): SNIPE is opening a new world in touchscreen gaming (yes, we like to repeat Important Things)! The free SNIPE apps that we supply here will be the first of many iOS and Android applications to come. Currently at Alpha testing, our first four SNIPE Apps will feature many different game modes, authentic sound effects, life-like graphics, and awesome options. Our apps and blasters are designed to give you an accurate shooting experience from 0.5 to 2.5 meters far (up to 7 foot) when playing with a 10'' or smaller screens.\nThe apps that will be available at the SNIPE kick-off are:\nSNIPE THE CAN: Yeah, you probably all know this famous shootout practice, but we\u2019re bringing it to your living room and you don\u2019t even need real cans!

However, because we are always striving for ultimate coolness, we also offer two SNIPE Mounts tailored specifically for SNIPE gaming needs:\nThe SNIPE Table Mount: A simple, adjustable stand which will hold your smart device at a perfect angle to play SNIPE on a table, floor, closet, chest, the head of a dinosaur or any other flat surface.\nThe Koala Wall Mount: This one is produced by our friends at 'Dockem' (http://www.dockem.com). It\u2019ll attach, detach and reattach to your wall without damaging it. Also great for erasing all evidence of a marathon gaming session just before your boyfriend, girlfriend or parents get home!\nSimply place your tablet \u2013 any tablet, any size \u2013 on any of our SNIPE Mounts and have a blast!\nWith every $10K we get beyond our pledge goal, we'll create another cool game for SNIPE! Of course, we'll also add crazy new hardware to the SNIPE brand, to extend SNIPE's gaming features (coming soon...)\nSNIPE is The Future...\nWe foresee a world full of touchscreen devices and as the technology of capacitive touch-screens evolves from year to year, so will the technology of SNIPE. Rumors of touchscreen surfaces, walls which will feature integrated touch monitors, high-end touchscreen TVs and related upcoming technology abound, which means that the scope of SNIPE gaming is poised to expand. We intend to continue to develop and improve SNIPE products as touchscreen devices evolve. This way, SNIPE will remain on the cutting edge, and be able to interact with the latest touchscreen technology. Also, our apps will always be compatible with various platforms.\nLaunching new gaming hardware onto the market is a complicated process. Factories require minimum order quantities \u2013 often thousands of units \u2013 and retailers need to see demand before they allocate shelf space for products they haven\u2019t seen or used before. Additionally, standardization/quality testing and liability insurance is needed, amongst other things, before actual sales can start.\nProject SNIPE Time-line: \nFrom launching day to supply of goods\nThis is where you guys come in: thanks to the buzz we\u2019ll be generating and your pre-orders, we\u2019ll be able to bring our products to life within the space of just four months!

We started it up in the hope of bringing the excitement back to shooter games. We are working hard in collaboration with top-notch engineers and experienced manufactures to ensure our well-designed products are of the highest quality and meet the highest market standards.\nPlease meet our team and join us in our passion to change the face of mobile shooting games for good!\nSean is an entrepreneur which participated in a number of start-ups before he decided to pick up the glove and establish XnTouch. \nLiran has been a passionate innovator in the field of mobile games & app-toys for the last couple of years.\nIdan is an experienced technophile, with a broad background as a team leader at growing tech industries.\nStewie is a senior business administrator and an experienced advisor in companies from the import/export industry.\nRonen is the CEO of our partner company, Quattro-D, who specialize in industrial design and mass-production of innovative tech products.\nAlon is the head of the design department of our partner company, Quattro-D, with years of experience as a Master of Fine Art.\nThank you Kickstarters for your support! \nWe really appreciate your help with this project...\nCheers,\nThe SNIPE Team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenge #1 \u2013 Taking the prototype into production:\n\nOur biggest challenge would be to take our prototype and to get it into manufacturing in reasonable costs. Quattro-D, our collaborator, is well experienced in this part of the work. We are already in contact with the right manufacturers but things can always come up on that side. This is why we tried to keep things simple, and the only thing that we manufacture our own is the Dart itself. For any other part of the work we have at least 3 different potential suppliers. The lead time we have from our suppliers is 4 weeks for the molds and another 3 weeks for production. We gave ourselves 13 weeks so we could do the process twice and still meet the obligations to our backers.\n\n\nChallenge #2 \u2013 Developing apps to a new world of user experience and interface:\n\nSNIPE apps are different, you need to play far from the screen and we don\u2019t want you to return to the device again and again to reactivate it. The second related UE and UI issue is the targets size. We want it to be challenging from the one side but possible to hit from the right distance on the other. To solve the first part of the challenge we are working in two directions. First, you could always hit certain places of the screen to do the most common actions. Second, we are checking out the possibility to merge voice or camera based control methods, those ones are already on the market and advance rapidly.\nThe second part of the challenge would be solved by testing, before developing and app level we make a simple graphic video of it and let different players to shoot it using regular darts (so we wouldn\u2019t have to wait until production is over). We are also planning on sending those things to our backers, and ask for their opinion about what is challenging and what is impossible.\n\n\nRisk #1 \u2013 A change in the touch screen technology:\n\nTouch screen technology is evolving. This is why SNIPE is developed now and not 5 years ago. Our biggest risk is that the market would change and start using devices which the SNIPE darts wouldn\u2019t work on. Right now, this risk seems unreasonable, as capacitive and optical touch devices are the major trends and both are getting even more sensitive over the years. So actually, we hope we could make smaller dart tips in the future. To stay on the safe side and not be surprised, we are in contact with two major players in this industry so if such a change would begin we could be fast enough to find a new solution for it.\n\n\nRisk #2 \u2013 Country related legal limitations:\n\nCountries tend to change their regulations on toys from time to time. Raw materials could become forbidden and you need to face new custom regulations.\nOur method of thinking in this way is to follow the big companies as they are always aware of those regulations before they apply. The dart size, speed and shape would be similar to how others makes them and the raw material is taken from the medical accessories market, and manufactured by a company based in the US. Of course, it could happen that specific country would have certain regulations. We will still try and ship it to you because usually custom services don\u2019t care about the single consumer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "XnTouch\nFirst created \u00b7 15 backed\nAbout XnTouch Ltd: Founded in January 2012, XnTouch is an Israeli toy company, who specialize in creating interactive toys that enhance...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Our new campaign - RideAir - is 120% funded at $44K, with 27 days to go!", "update_content": "Hi SNIPErs,\nAs you know, we are running a new Kickstarter campaign called RideAir - The next generation of effortless air pumps:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "New Campaign By SNIPE's Team!

It is the perfect car stereo accessory.\nThe History\nThe original MOS launched on Kickstarter last year with huge success. The original MOS is a sleek cable organizer that magnetically holds frequently used cables on top of your desk, instead of falling behind your desk.\nWith help from backers like you we were able to bring this simple product to life, and this clever solution to a common problem resonated with enough people beyond Kickstarter that the MOS is now available in Apple stores across North America.\nNow we're back to solve more problems.\nThe MOS Spring + MOS Menos, The Ultimate Car Audio Accessory.\nAfter digging around in our cars countless times trying to find the auxiliary cable to plug in our smartphones, we decided there was a better way. The MOS was an obvious solution, but it was too big to easily fit into most cars. We shrunk it down to the perfect size.\nThat left the cable. If you are like us, you've probably gone through a frustrating number of 3.5mm AUX audio cables. Due to poor design, materials, and craftsmanship they tend to short out after a surprisingly short period of time. So we decided to design our own. \nThe MOS Spring was designed from the ground up to give you the best sound and longest life as well as work seamlessly with the MOS Menos.\nThe MOS Spring\nMost 3.5mm AUX audio cables have two things in common: they don't last long and they are ugly. Most people have experienced an auxiliary cable going bad and only playing music out of one speaker or not playing at all.  This has been happening to us for years.  We finally had enough and took on the challenge of designing a superior cable that wouldn't have these issues.  \nThe name is derived from the spring on the cable that helps relieve strain on the cable when it is bent sharply.  You have probably seen springs used on high end music cables before.  We wanted to bring this technology to the masses and put it on a cable you use every day.  We ended up with the MOS Spring.\nWe used only the highest quality materials to ensure that this would be the only 3.5mm cable you will ever need. We are so sure of ourselves we are offering a lifetime warranty on every MOS Spring we sell.\nAnodized Aluminum heads not only protect the conductor, it also makes it look and feel like the high quality cable that it is.\nMetal Spring Strain Relief protects the most vulnerable part of the cable. It also ensures the cable will work great with the MOS Menos.\nHeavy Duty Braided Cable keeps your cable protected from any abuse you can throw at it.\n MOS Spring Color Choices\n The MOS Menos\nThe MOS Menos is the little brother of the original MOS cable organization system. Its small size makes it perfect to mount in your car, or take with you on any long trips.\nA super strong Neodymium magnet ensures your cables will always be right where you need them, without making it difficult to remove the cables when you need them.\nSame great smooth Satin Finish from the original plastic MOS.\nIncludes an adhesive base for permanently fixing to a vertical surface or a micro-suction base to fix to smooth horizontal surfaces which allows the MOS Menos to be moved without leaving behind sticky residue.\nThe Rewards\nThe MOS Spring + MOS Menos were built to work together and we think it's the perfect combination for your car.  We understand that many of you will just want to buy one or the other and we have rewards for you too. \nCheck them out!\nThe Production Timeline\nWe successfully delivered the original MOS on time and we are confident we can have the same success with the MOS Spring + MOS Menos with delivery of your rewards scheduled for March15th - March31st.\nAs soon as the project is successfully funded we will start producing the injection molds and other pieces of tooling necessary to complete the MOS Menose and Spring.  This step will take between 20 and 40 days.  With the toolings successfully created, we will start production.  We estimate the production runs to take another 20 days.  We will have shipped from overseas to our warehouse for fulfillment after the production has finished.  We have given ourselves a little bit of a buffer to help us overcome obstacles as they come, and still deliver the product on schedule.\nThanks for your help in bringing the MOS Spring + MOS Menos to life.

Now that's all about to change, and that change has never looked so good...\nWhat You Should Know About Eastwood Slider Belts:\nUnique Design\nAmazing Fit\nModern Style\nGreat Quality\nGreat Satisfaction\nGreat Pricing Rewards\n1. A New, Unique Belt Design: A Belt that Gives Maxim Comfort and Style.\nWhen I set out to design Eastwood Slider Belts, I wanted to create a belt that was different; one that could connect better function with a more modern style. In the spring of 2012 I set a goal to create the most comfortable, custom fitting belt on the planet, and that\u2019s what I did! \n2. An Amazing Custom Fit:\nWith its patent-pending belt buckle design, Eastwood Slider Belts, unlike other belts, have a NO LOOPHOLE, NO CLICK ADJUSTMENT SYSTEM. Instead it has a unique SLIDE-LOCK SYSTEM that allows the belt buckle to freely side up and down and lock down tight on any point of the belt strap, giving you that perfect, custom fit feeling.\nAs I\u2019ve experienced, along with many other friends, our bodies naturally change with time. That change can be as minimal as changes in ones daily activities, from a larger waist size after dinner to thinner waist after exercise. Our waists will naturally fluctuate and change in size as our bodies gain or lose weight as time goes by. So it\u2019s nice to have a belt that can change with us. Even a slight change can mean the difference for your personal 'comfortable fit point'.\nEastwood Slider Belts Vs. The Traditional Loophole or Click System Belts:\nBelts have been around for a long time, but the actual advance in belt designs have been quite minimal. Traditional loophole belts will normally give users 6 to 12 adjustment options; more recent designed click system belts will typically offer around 15-30 adjustment options. Eastwood Slider Belts offer adjustment options as unique as the individual wearing the belt. The belt offers ultimate adjustability. Since there is no set loophole or click grid, any point of the belt strap can be used, giving you endless choices and providing maximum comfort.\n3. A Modern Look and Style:\nWhen choosing colors for Eastwood Slider Belts, I wanted to choose colors that had a more modern look and feel. I didn\u2019t want the typical, plain looking silver belt buckle and black belt strap design. So I hand selected colors that I felt would give each belt a strong character and personality, just like the guys that are wearing them. I chose natural looking color tones that I knew would match many different outfit styles, from a casual night out to a more formal business wardrobe. Additionally, Eastwood Slider Belts have no visible loopholes, so it gives the belts a more modern, clean look and style.\n4. Only the Best Quality Belts:\nFrom the start, I wanted to create a new kind of belt that didn\u2019t just look good but had a quality that would last for years to come. I\u2019ve personally had a number of belts that I\u2019ve used over the years. With each passing year the leather can change, the loopholes will begin to stretch out, and the leather strap will get more and more scratched and warped. In creating the Eastwood Slider Belt line, it was one of my top priorities to select only the best full grain leathers for the belt straps and belt buckle cover. The belt buckle is made from solid metal and has a light coat of black finish. I feel pleased with the result, and I believe you will be too.\n5. Great Satisfaction:\nDuring a two month long testing period, I handed out 20 prototype belts to some of my friends and their friends to get as much feedback as possible. Here's what some of the guys had to say about Eastwood Slider Belts:\n\u201cAfter testing Don\u2019s prototype belt for a week, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to give it back. It\u2019s easy to use and fits perfectly to my waist. I\u2019ve had both friends and strangers complimenting my belt. I like its unique color and belt buckle style. \u2013 Simon Krager\n\u201cI think what I like the most about the Eastwood Slider Belts is that I can adjust them as needed during the day, whether walking to work, sitting down at a lunch meeting, or doing whatever. I noticed that my waist size tends to change throughout the day so it's great to have a belt that I can adjust for a great fit in seconds.\u201d \u2013 Mike Thompson\n6. Rewards, Pricing, and Belt Styles:\nOnce my belts reach market retailers, every Eastwood Slider Belt will retail for $64.99. By supporting this project in its early stages you can take advantage of the great pricing rewards and be one of the very first to own and wear an Eastwood Slider Belt.\nEastwood Slider Belts now come in 5 different styles:\nYour support can make a BIG difference!\nPut very honestly, I need your support.

Join the Eastwood Belt team and enjoy the journey with regular updates as this month long journey goes on to reach my funding goal.\nMy Story:\nFrom a young age I\u2019ve been interested in art and design. While in high school and university I studied graphic design. Three years ago, after graduating from university, I made the decision to go abroad and live in Southern China, near Hong Kong for a year. After visiting China, I saw a new level of men\u2019s fashion, with young men in their early twenties and thirties spending outrageous amounts of money on their clothing, cars, and other fashion symbols that they used to separate themselves from the 1.3 billion other people in the country. Some of these guys became my good friends, so I was able to keep \"a designers eye\" on how I could improve the designs of popular, name brand fashion accessories they would wear each day. One evening after talking with a few friends about designer belts, I came up with the idea to create a new kind of belt buckle that would look better than traditional belts by having no visible loopholes and be able to lock down anywhere on the belt strap. I sketched out a rough design and gave it to my designer friend, Thomas. He said it was a relatively simple design that could work. So with my ideas and his guidance I went on to create what you now see today.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019m currently working with two factories in Guangzhou, China. I have a good working relationship with both factories and have had success in ensuring they meet my standards for the sample prototype belts they have manufactured for me. That said, recognizing I personally lack adequate experience in the area of manufacturing management, I also have a Chinese friend named Daniel, who has over 10 years of experience working closely with Chinese factory managers and managing factory production, inspection and Quality Control. Both Daniel and myself will be visiting the factories regularly during the production phase to ensure that each belt manufactured will pass quality inspection. I'm a perfectionist. Every product I design, from the initial design to the time it reaches the customer or backer, must meet my standards of quality or else it will be sent back to be manufactured again. \n\nThe biggest challenge for me in this project will be the lead-in time for the factories. Once the Kickstarter project has finished (granted successful funding), I will complete my order with the factories and have an estimated lead-in time of 3-4 weeks for production. After production I will send all the belts to Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, where the belts will be repackaged and sent out to the individual backers. The total time needed for this process will be about six to eight weeks if everything goes as planned. The slowest estimated delivery date for the belts would be 8-9 weeks from the day you pledge support to the day your receive your gift at your door. But rest assured, I will make sure to keep every backer inform of the status of his or her reward in my regular Kickstarter updates.

That's 57% more space.\nThe Cargo mini has 107mm3 of interior space, which is remarkable since it's 95% of the volume contained in the older model for full-sized iPad!\nHow it works\nAttaches securely to your Apple Smart Cover but can easily be removed when needed \nGrips to the Smart Cover using 2 soft rubberized clips that won't damage your Smart Cover or your iPad screen.\nThe 2 clips slide up and down the Smart Cover to stiffen one of the folds and turn your cover into an ergonomic 45-degrees or 20-degree stand in addition to the native 12 and 65 degrees positions of the Smart Cover.\nDoubles as a grip to hold your iPad\nSmooth felt interior protects your accessories and reduces any noise while carrying the iPad.\nNo need for any non-slip pad or additional stabilizing element. The Cargo Stand is shaped to fully support the back of the iPad while in the 45-degree stand position.\nSpecifications\nMade out of ultra-light hard plastic and designed to match the aluminum back of your iPad.\nWorks with both the Apple Smart Cover and Apple Smart Case.\nShaped to fit inside the rolled-up Smart Cover.\nAvailable for both iPad Air and iPad mini.\nProduction and Fulfillment Plan\nThe factory for tooling and production has already been selected so tooling can begin as soon as the project goal is attained. Tooling should take 45 days followed by 30 days of production. When all the parts are produced, the finishing and assembly process will take another 30 days (sandblasting, paint assembly and packing). The finished products will then be shipped from the factory and received by the fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania, which will take another 3-4 weeks, at which point all rewards will be shipped by my professional fulfillment center via USPS. The whole process from beginning of tooling to shipping out to backers should therefore take 4.5 months but my experience with 3 prior projects taught me that something unexpected always delays the project, so I would expect the process to take 5 and a half months, which is why I selected June 2014 as the expected shipping date.\nFAQ\nWill the Smart Cargo work with 3rd party non-Apple covers?\nThe short answer is maybe. It all depends on whether the cover is the same thickness as the Apple Smart Cover and whether the cover has the same 3-fold geometry as the Apple model to enable the 45 degrees stand position.\nDon't the accessories get shaken and make noise inside when you carry the Smart Cargo?\nNo. They actually get tucked in quite snuggly so they tend not to move too much. In addition the felt lining inside the Smart Cargo keeps them safe and quiet when you carry your iPad.\nDoes the iPad square charger fit into the Smart Cargo?\nNo. It does not. I had to make a design decision between keeping the form factor of the Smart Cargo small and compatible with the rolled-up Smart Cover or make it bigger to accomodate larger accessories like the charger.  Personally, I almost never carry the iPad charger with me on the go because the battery life on the iPad is so good. Note that both the iPad mini and the iPad Air will charge on a USB port (slowly but they'll charge) and that a USB power cable DOES fit inside the Cargo Stand as you can see in the pictures above.\nNeed more than one?\nPledge accordingly and we'll ship a multiple of what you pledged (at the Early Bird price).\nIs there a new Cargo Stand for older iPads?\nI'm sorry to say that there is no Cargo Stand for older full-sized iPads (generation 1-4). Why? It's hard enough for a small operation like mine to make 2 products (for iPad Aid and iPad mini) so I decided to focus on making the Cargo Stand for the latest iPads. Note that the iPad mini version works on the iPad mini (first generation) as well as the iPad mini retina since they are the exact same size. But that's obviously not the case for older full-sized iPads so those won't be supported unfortunately.\nWhat are the exact dimensions of the Cargo Stand?\niPad Air model: \n9 3/8\" long x 2 1/8\" deep x 1 1/4\" tall\n196mm3 of interior space compared to 112mm3 for its predecessor. That's 57% more space.\nThe Cargo mini model:\n7 7/8\" long x 1 3/4\" deep x 1\" tall\n107mm3 of interior space, which is remarkable since it's 95% of the volume contained in the older model for full-sized iPad.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe typical risks and challenges of a product project like this one lie mainly in the manufacturing and fulfillment aspects. I know it well because I went through the process of completing three successful Kickstarter projects: The Smarter Stand for iPad, the Smarter Stand for iPhone and the Smart Cargo for iPad. All 3 projects were successfully completed and each time, I've learned new ways to make the process smoother and plan to apply this experience to future projects. In addition, I have now found manufacturing, fulfillment and customer service partners that I trust to do a great job for my backers. I am a big believer in being as transparent as possible with backers and keeping them in the loop at all times, even when faced with challenges. I wrote dozens of project updates during my last projects and I intend to be just as communicative and responsive to my backers' concerns for this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dotan Saguy\n6 created \u00b7 15 backed\nDotan Saguy is a documentary photographer based in Los Angeles, CA.

Where did the idea come from? Well, My wife, Gal and I, like most people today, are dependent on our smart phones but both are very aware of the dangers of driving while being on our phones. Gal surprised me one day and got me a phone mount for our car so that my phone would stay in place and be visible to me while I drive. However, as an industrial designer it is important to me that the gadgets I own are not only easy to use and versatile, but look good too. The phone mount she got me was bulky and difficult to set up, plus, once I got out of my car and went to where I had to go I was left with no mount for my phone.\nAfter doing some research on phone mounts that exist in today's market, I found that they were not easy to use, and lacked in design. Also, none of them gave you the option of easily taking them out of your car and traveling with you from place to place so that you will always have somewhere to mount your phone.\nSo we try to think of a solution for a phone mount that is simple and can travel with you everywhere you go.\nWe have spent the past 7 month developing, designing, and testing many different prototypes of Sticko. Testing out different materials, different sizes and different designs until we found the perfect combination so that Sticko will be simple, strong and look cool in all its uses, especially when connected to your smart phone.   \nBrain storming\nFinally, Sticko was born! A gadget that is small in size but big in its benefits:\nPLAY\n\nSticko colors\nSticko can attach to any smooth surface and is flexible due to the suction cup material its made out of. Its flexibility allows for Sticko to attach to smooth surfaces that are not necessarily flat. Sticko is made out of a special u.v protected and heatproof material so it will stay strong even in the harshest conditions like a hot car in the middle of summer. It weighs less than 5 grams and is less than 14 millimeters high.\nIt comes with a lobster clamp and earphone jack attached to it. You can attach it to your phone using the earphone jack or your key chain with the lobster clamp. Its size and flexibility allows you to slip it in your back pocket attached to your phone/or key chain.\nAttach Sticko to your keys\nUse Sticko as a phone stand\nSince we made Sticko we both are addicted to it, we have ours attached to our phones and key chains so our Sticko's are constantly in use. The more we use Sticko the more uses we find for it that go way beyond just mounting your smartphone. Every person who saw Sticko added their own twist on uses they thought fit for the little gadget. That's when we realized that people were as amazed and excited about Sticko as we were.\nUse Sticko as a Glasses Holder\nSoon enough our friends and family were asking us for a Sticko of their own. We ordered a small injection mold allowing us to test the final product, and, to give Sticko\u2019s to our friends and family and get their feedback.\nSo Where Do We Stand Now?\nThe Sticko's that came back from the injection mold came out perfect, and the feedback we received from those who got to use Sticko was overwhelmingly positive. So we wanted to make them on a larger scale so more people can enjoy Sticko. And that's what brought us to you, to Kickstarter.\nWhats Next?\nWith the funds we raise we will be able to invest in a larger production line so that we can share Sticko with you and anyone else who believes in this gadget. We have the final CAD technical drawings of Sticko that we can take to any manufacturer, but since we have already verified the quality and accuracy of the particular manufacturer who built the prototypes , we plan on having Sticko produced by them. They can accommodate small production quantity as well as very large mass production requirements. Once we finish our Kickstarter campaign, we will know exactly how many Sticko's we will need to produce. We will personally inspect each Sticko to make sure it is up to our highest standards. After they pass our quality control we will pack them securely and prepare for shipment. We already have business account with one of the most trusted shipping companies in the U.S. so we will ship Sticko to you A.S.A.P. Sticko will be FREE OF SHIPPING CHARGES anywhere within the U.S.\nWe are asking for your support so we can share the Sticko lifestyle with you and all your friends and all their friends, you get the point. Your help will allow us to build up a production line. That way we will be able to produce more Sticko's for every gadget that needs mounting.\nThanks for your support!\nOh one more thing, after you get a Sticko, send us pictures of cool and unique uses you think that we would love, so we can share them on Sticko's website and create a real Sticko community.\n Love, \n          Gal&Boaz\nCan I help in other ways? \nYes!

Its been over half a year of designing and testing Sticko but we wanted to make sure that Sticko is complete with rigorous performance and durability tests before we launch our Sticko in Kickstarter. Once we got the parts we assembled them by hand and gave it to more than 50 different users to test Sticko in different environments. The feedback we received gave us a lot of confidence that Sticko was ready. \nWe're very confident that we will deliver our products in superior quality by the projected dates.\n\nMANUFACTURING \nWe already have established a working relationship with a reliable plastic injection manufacturer and a mold maker, and an experienced contractor to mitigate the risk of delays by material suppliers and to ensure that quality control is implemented to the highest level. We have built test prototypes with our manufacturer and they fully understand our product, specifications and production timeline. While we know there can be unexpected challenges along the way. We will always be transparent and inform our backers of potential hurdles along the way.\n\nSHIP DATE \nWe have built in extra time for the manufacturing process and are confident we will ship by the projected dates. We will always keep you informed if things take longer than planned.\n\nPRODUCT \nWe have taken the following steps to ensure that we deliver the best quality product: \n- Built over many working prototypes with the established contract manufacturer. \n- Extensively tested Sticko for performance and durability. (by more than 100 different users that are using Sticko right now.)\n-We preformed an assembly and packaging test run so we know exactly how long it takes.\n-We will also refine our packaging.

Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still pre-order yours on our website.\nTouchscreens are amazing, but when you just want to turn on your flashlight, take a quick photo or send your location, simple actions can become a bit of a hassle. \nWithout Pressy, if you just want to turn your flashlight ON you need to: \nWake your screen -> Unlock it -> Exit your current running app -> Search for the app you want to use ->  Launch it  ->  And finally, perform your desired Action.  \nThis \u201csimple\u201d process requires 5-7 different Actions and takes more than 8 seconds! Additionally, you must maintain eye contact with your screen throughout the entire process.\nDon't believe us? try and beat that time yourself!\nBut what if you want to perform an action quickly and without having to deal with or look at the device?\nPressy lets you perform any Action on your smartphone by using the most intuitive input \u2013 clicking a button \u2013 Saving you time and effort! Pressy is a tiny physical button that connects to your phone through the headphone jack.\nConnecting the Pressy Button with the free Pressy app lets you easily customize and use your favorite, everyday actions. For example, if you use your flashlight on regular basis, set a Click-combination the app for turning on your flashlight and start clicking the Button!\nGetting started using Pressy couldn\u2019t be any easier. Plug the Pressy Button to the headphone jack, download the free app, and you\u2019re good to go. Click the Pressy button and see your phone\u2019s flashlight turn on. Click it again and it turns off. As simple as that. \nPressy comes with 3 pre-set Actions, but once you get the hang of things you can customize clicking behavior and trigger dozens of different actions.\nQuality assurance is very important to us. Boaz is going to accompany the production process right from the start and we are going to test each button on several devices. We designed a device that tests the button mechanically and electronically to make sure each and every product is intact. We plan to begin production as soon as we reach our goal so we can deliver as soon as possible. With your help it can be in less than 4 months!\nPressy is in the News! Check out a few of the website Pressy was featured in:\nFor Beginners\nPressy comes with three awesome, out-of-the box default actions so you can immediately start having fun with it, even if you aren't a tech-geek like us! \n\u2022 One short Click to toggle your flashlight \n\u2022 One long Click to toggle your phone in and out of silent mode \n\u2022 Double-Click to snap a photo\n Just plug in Pressy, download the free app and start clicking!\nGot the hang of it? Let\u2019s start having even more fun! \nPressy is not just a one-trick-pony. The Pressy app allows you to select your favorite Actions and set different Click-combinations for each Action. \nHere are some examples: \nPressy also allows you to customize the settings of each Action.\nFor example, you can set Pressy to take a regular photo or to take a discreet photo (with your screen off and without sound or flash). \n How to Set an Action:\nThe new app design\n\nFor us Geeks, let\u2019s go crazy!\n If you are a developer, Pressy has 3 ways to create your very own Action: \n1. Develop an app or a service and utilize the Pressy button to launch it with your desired parameters.\n2. Initiate 3rd Party apps, like a specific task in Tasker or AutomateIt.\n3. Embed Pressy in your own app to perform your specific in-app actions (using Pressy\u2019s API \u2013 free for Kickstarter Backers!). For example, use the Pressy button as a game controller, PTT button or any other usage. \nFurther tips, instructions, Q&A, and social sharing of Actions will be available on www.PressyButton.com. \nHow Does it Work ?\nOnce you launch the Pressy app, you activate a background service. The service monitors the headset-jack into which the Pressy Button is plugged. The application is then activated only when the Pressy Button is clicked, therefore, it does not drain your battery. The application recognizes the specific input and preforms the desired Action. The Pressy app works on all Android devices, versions 2.3 and up. \nWhere do We Stand  \nAt the moment we have many working models and prototypes of the Pressy Button. All prototypes were made using 3D printing and CNC, and manually assembled by us. In order to take production to the next level, we have already contacted all the suppliers and manufacturers we need. We got the best price offers in order to make Pressy affordable for everyone. Production costs per item are relatively reasonable, but the molds and minimum order quantity make it really difficult to carry out with our own funds.\nHere is where you guys can truly help. All the money we raise will help us manufacture mass quantity of Pressy buttons and bring the application to the next level. Your help will bring Pressy to life within 4 months!\nThe 3D printed parts\nPrototype Lineup\n  The Pressy Story \nAs we said in the video, smartphones are really awesome! But, if you need to spend about 10 seconds and perform 5-7 actions in order to \u201csimply\u201d do something on your phone \u2026. Well, in the words of Seth Godin, \u201cIt\u2019s broken!\u201d \nThis is exactly how the Pressy project was born. We want to give you a new, simple and intuitive way to preform everyday actions on your smartphone with a quick and simple click of a button. \nOf course the pledges are important and we could not continue without them, but we also want to hear what you guys think about our product.

We will be grateful for any feedback and will do our best to answer any message as soon as we can.\nUse Your Headset media button as Pressy!\nThe rewards\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nDuring the last 4 months, we were working around the clock designing and building the prototypes, during this time we also contacted dozens of manufacturers, got pricing offers and more importantly, production plans. After choosing some of them each manufacturer was examined carefully by us, and we started discussing specific details including the molds and tooling costs, specifying materials, manufacturing schedules, assembly and packaging options...

That's when I started to wonder if there was a product available that would solve my problem.  It seemed like such an obvious, everyday problem that I assumed someone else had already invented something to solve it.\nEarly sketch\nSo I began sketching and asking a lot of questions trying to find similar solutions online or in big box stores.  Surprisingly, I found nothing.  You could get headphones that came pre-built around a winding device but that's not what I envisioned.  Most people who use their headphones on a regular basis are very particular about the color, quality and size of their headphones.  They don't want to buy cheap headphones in order to avoid tangled cords.\nSince this was my first time creating a product like this I started asking around to see if I could find a local design firm that would help me create the product I envisioned.  I soon found out that there were a lot of people who were willing to give it the old college try, but very few could keep it simple and accomplish a workable design.\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts I was finally put in touch with someone who had a lot of experience working with contract manufacturers.  Finally I could take all my failures, package them together into a long list of what I didn't want, and start working on exactly what I wanted iCoil to become.  \nAfter several months and prototypes we arrived at a simple product design that met all the functional needs I had envisioned:\nIt allowed users to avoid a tangled mess every time they pulled headphones out of their pocket, backpack or briefcase\nIt didn't force anyone to buy a new set of headphones\nIt could stay attached to headphones whether in use or in storage\nIt was important that the design of iCoil be as small and simple as possible.  It only needed to be large enough to fit standard sized headphone cords.  Anything more and it would become clunky and too large to stay attached to headphones at all times.\nAll color options available for this Kickstarter campaign\nIf Successful...\nThe funds raised in this Kickstarter campaign will be used exclusively to purchase a production mold.  Up until this time I've purchased samples in  small quantities which has significantly increased my cost per unit.  Purchasing a production mold will allow me to finish the production design, order larger quantities, lower my cost per unit and supply enough units to meet the current demand.\nThe design of iCoil has been constantly refined over the past six months.  Several samples, sizes and shapes have been tested.  Versions of the product incorporating a spring loaded system failed over time.  The straightforward design of iCoil is durable and consists of components that aren't prone to failure after only a few months of use.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith so many great projects on Kickstarter and in the marketplace, the biggest challenge for iCoil is getting the word out and convincing Kickstarters to participate. The great thing about Kickstarter is that friends and family can't just tell you that your idea has potential, they have to take action in order to show support. \n\nI've spoken with several potential manufacturing partners. After receiving samples from each of them I ultimately settled on one and have been working with this group for the past few months. This supplier is currently producing large scale, complex products for a friend of mine. The products have continued to be high quality and delivered on time.

Raphaelle Guran, Pursuitist\n\nHello, Kickstarters! Greetings from 1.0 Innovations. We had such a great response to our last KS project for the XFLEX Tablet Stand that we decided to share our latest innovation: The SETA Smartphone Stand.\nWe believe that each new design from 1.0 Innovations must successfully answer two questions:  \nIs it truly an innovation and does it functionally perform better than everything else on the market? YES\nWill it make your life easier? YES\nDesign and Function\nMaterials- aircraft grade aluminum + NanoSuction\u2122 pads\nNanoSuction\u2122- grips the phone and grips the surface but is not sticky to the touch\nUniversal- works with all smartphones and most hard cases. Extra SETA pad is included to work with silicone or textured cases \nTotal Cord Management- the patent pending T-Channel is compatible with all OEM smartphone charging cables\nTimeless Design- works with yesterdays, todays and tomorrows smartphones and cords\nMade In The USA- developed and made in Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nWhy SETA? I have several expensive beautiful phone stands and docking stations in my desk drawer that are now obsolete as a result of smartphone evolution and design changes. Quite simply, they will not hold or charge my iPhone5 rendering them worthless. The desire to develop a timeless, affordable, and functionally superior smartphone stand is how the SETA was born. We believe it will be the last stand/dock you will ever need.\nSETA was designed to perform better than traditional phone stands or docks. It will suspend your phone at the perfect viewing angle on your desk, nightstand, counter or any other smooth surface. And it performs this function with far less effort than other stands or docking stations. Simply push your phone to attach then pull or twist to remove. Add in the fact that it also holds your charging cord in place while unplugged and you have the ultimate smartphone stand.\nSETA not only works with today's devices, but also with yesterday's and tomorrow's. Unlike other stands and docking stations on the market today, SETA is a universal and timeless design. It will hold every smartphone and will accommodate every charging cable with the patent pending T-Channel cord holder. No more picking up your cord off the floor!\nHow It Works. SETA incorporates NanoSuction\u2122 technology that synthetically emulates the adhesive qualities of gecko feet. Your phone magically clings to the NanoSuction\u2122 SETA pad while another pad on the base secures the stand to most flat, non-porous surfaces.\nCare. NanoSuction\u2122 can be rejuvenated when dirty by cleaning with clear tape or a damp paper towel and letting air dry. We have performed extensive testing on the NanoSuction\u2122 material and have yet to see any loss of suction as long as the pad is clean. When introduced at Macworld '13, our SETA display stands were used thousands of times and received an overwhelming response from attendees and industry insiders alike.\nWhat will NanoSuction\u2122 grip? It will grip every smartphone we have tested and will grip around 70% of the cases. Unfortunately, it does not work well on silicone rubber cases and some textured ones like the OtterBox and LifeProof (apply the extra SETA pad and they do work). The base of the stand will grip any smooth, non-textured surface. Since it does not work with every application each SETA comes with an extra NanoSuction\u2122 pad to peel and stick on the back of your case or on your surface, thus eliminating the need to remove your phone from its case.\nWhy do I need an extra SETA pad and what can I do with it? You may not \"need\" it but you may enjoy the endless possibilities. If your case is textured you can stick it on the back to work with the SETA. Some choose to use it on the back of their naked phone so they can stick it places when they are away from their SETA. I think you will find it an outstanding anti-skid pad for your car. \nSETA Pad for iPad. Why? Why not? Start using your iPad in ways you never thought of. Watch movies while you take a bath or view hair styling tips online with your iPad securely affixed to the mirror.  If your surface isn't compatible just peel and stick the extra pad to secure it wherever you want. \nWe need your help! Your pledge will help bring SETA to life. With your support we can upgrade to a larger CO2 Laser Cutting System and cover tooling cost for larger production runs. We have some great rewards for your pledge but if you're unable to help with funding at this time you can still support our project by \"sharing\" this page with your friends on Facebook.

In our booth we tested the stand with literally thousands of phones and cases to get feedback from attendees and industry insiders. The feedback we received far exceeded our expectations. Everyone loved it! \nFunctionally, the SETA performs the same as the prototype. We evaluated all the feedback and made a few minor changes. The corners were rounded and we modified the T-Channel so that your cord would lay flat when not plugged in. Quality control then influenced our decision to powder coat some colors and anodize others. Finally, we decided to ship every stand with a free SETA Pad so that it will work with all cases and surfaces, regardless of texture.\nSETA is Patent Pending; SETA\u2122; Apple, iPad, iPad Mini, and iPhone are trademarks of Apple Inc., no endorsement implied.

You are welcome to check it out and read our comments and positive feedback. Over 95% of our backer rewards shipped within two weeks of project completion (even before KS funding hit our account!). The remaining rewards still shipped prior the estimated delivery date.

Production delays will not be a problem since the SETA has already gone into production and we are prepared to fulfill orders. \n\nAluminum production entails many variables and as a result shipments might be delayed. We'll prepare for this supply delay by forecasting demand and staying in constant contact with our supplier. Orders will be placed early enough to ensure delivery in time to fulfill orders.\n\nQuality control is another challenge we're fully prepared to meet.

An Apple Smart Cover or an Apple Smart Case is required to use this product. Apple Smart Cover not included.\nWhy Smart Cargo for iPad?\nThe iPad is ultra-portable and sleek but it rarely travels alone. You often need to bring along a charging cable, earphones, a screen wipe, maybe a stylus, a camera adapter, etc.\nAnd the problem is, you never know which accessory you're going to need and when. So because of just a few small accessories, you now have to carry your iPad in a bag.\nNot quite the sleek or portable device Apple envisioned anymore... Not until now!\nMeet the Smart Cargo for iPad\nHolds your iPad gear on the go\nThe Smart Cargo is a sleek hard case that attaches to your Apple Smart Cover or Smart Case magnetically and holds all your iPad essentials while adding very little bulk or weight to your iPad.\nTough on the outside, soft on the inside\nThe Smart Cargo's hard shell is lined with felt on this inside to protect your fragile iPad accessories on the go.\nStays safely attached to your iPad\nThe Smart Cargo securely attaches to your iPad Smart Cover using the full magnetic power of 14 magnets of your Smart Cover.\nFits inside your rolled-up Smart Cover\nWhen using your iPad in stand position, the Smart Cargo fits perfectly inside the triangle of your rolled-up Smart Cover.\nDoubles as iPad grip and wrist support\nThe Smart Cargo makes holding the iPad easier and less tiring by providing a comfortable ergonomic grip. Your hand naturally wraps around the Smart Cargo which allows holding the iPad for long periods of time without fatigue or joint pain.\nSome people need more wrist support to avoid pain from carpal tunnel syndrome or joint pains. Just detach your Smart Cargo from the iPad to place it under your wrists for a more ergonomic typing position anywhere you go.\nWant the best deal? GET A COMBO!\nThe Smarter Stand for iPad was my first Kickstarter project: It converts your iPad Smart Cover into an ergonomic stand with 3 new positions.\nThe Smarter Stand for iPhone was my second Kickstarter project: It's a kickstand for iPhone or iPod touch that also keeps your earbuds tangle free. And it works with or without a case.\nThe Smarter Stand for iPad and the Smarter Stand for iPhone are also available for sale at Smarterflo.com (both are in stock and ship immediately) or you can get a great deal by pledging for one of the combos on this project (see COMBO rewards to the right).\nYou will find a lot more information about the Smarter Stand for iPad / iPad mini at Smarterflo.com and on the original Smarter Stand Kickstarter project page.\nThe Smarter Stand for iPad comes in 10 different colors (clear, white, black, dark grey, light grey, blue, green, pink, red and navy). If you pledge for a combo, you don't need to select your color upfront: We'll send you a survey to confirm your address and your color choice after the Kickstarter campaign ends and before we ship.\nHow the idea came about\nThe idea came last August as I was working on my first Kickstarter project, the Smarter Stand for iPad: I was carrying my iPad everywhere and testing the Smarter Stand in different travel situations. Even though the Smarter Stand was the world's most compact iPad stand, I still had to carry my iPad in a bag in order to bring other essentials along.\nThen it occurred to me that all my accessories were small and might be able to fit in some sort of on-board storage that would attach to the iPad's magnetic Smart Cover. That's when the design process started.\nI wanted the Smart Cargo to be a storage device that \"lives\" on the iPad yet doesn't get in the way of using the iPad. That's why it attaches magnetically and fits inside the folded-up Smart Cover.\nI also wanted it to look like it belonged on an iPad from an esthetic standpoint, which brought the sleek aluminum look and smooth shape.\nAnd when I was done designing it, I realized that I had exceeded my design goal: not only did the Smart Cargo not get in the way of using the iPad, it made carrying the iPad a more pleasant experience thanks to the added ergonomic grip.\nWhy I need your backing\nI have already completed many rounds of prototyping and have arrived at a final prototype that works perfectly and looks awesome on the Smart Cover as you can see on the photos and in the video.\nI've even started the tooling to make sure I can deliver on time but I have large payments to the factory very soon and that's why I need your support to get this great product to market.\nIf you back this project you'll get your own Smart Cargo as a reward. \nSo please back this project now and help spread the word!\nFAQ\nNeed more than one?\nNeed an extra Smart Cargo? Regardless of your pledge level (early bird, etc.), just add $20 to your pledge amount for each extra Smart Cargo unit you need.\nIf you also want a Smarter Stand for iPad from my first Kickstarter project, add $14 to your pledge amount for each Smarter Stand for iPad you need. It comes in 10 different colors and you'll choose the color(s) you want right before we ship.\nAnd finally, if you also want a Smarter Stand for iPhone / iPod touch from my second Kickstarter project, add $12 to your pledge amount for each Smarter Stand for iPhone you need. It comes in 2 different versions: for iPhone 5 / iPod touch 5 or for previous models. You'll choose which one you want right before we ship.\nDoes it exist for iPad mini too?\nI initially thought it could not be made for iPad mini (too small) BUT I'm happy to report that I have found a way to make the Smart Cargo for iPad mini and am currently working on designing it. It could even include a surprise feature you'll really enjoy. I will update backers on the status of this endeavor and probably launch it as a separate Kickstarter project as soon as I'm pleased with the prototype.\nWhat are the dimensions of the Smart Cargo?\nThe Smart Cargo is 9 3/8 Inches long, 1 1/2 inches wide and about 3/4 of an inch tall. The plastic shell is about 1.5mm thick so the inside dimensions are slightly smaller but not much.\nHow is the Smart Cargo attached to the Smart Cover?\nThe Smart Cargo attaches to the Smart Cover using the power of the Smart Cover's 14 strong magnets thanks to a steel plate located in its base.\nCan this magnetic attachment damage the iPad?\nAbsolutely not. The magnets are in the Smart Cover already. The Smart Cargo only has a steel plate so it uses the magnetic power of the cover but doesn't add any extra magnetic force.\nWill the Smart Cargo work with 3rd party non-Apple covers?\nThe short answer is no. You really need an Apple made Smart Cover or Smart Case to use the Smart Cargo. The reason is that all 3rd party cases I've tried have weaker magnets than the original Apple made covers and often don't provide a strong enough magnetic bond to keep the Smart Cargo strongly attached to your iPad.\nDon't the accessories get shaken and make noise inside when you carry the Smart Cargo?\nNo. They actually get tucked in quite snuggly so they tend not to move too much. In addition the felt lining inside the Smart Cargo keeps them safe and quiet when you carry your iPad.\nDoes the iPad square charger fit into the Smart Cargo?\nNo. It does not. I had to make a design decision between keeping the form factor of the Smart Cargo small and compatible with the rolled-up Smart Cover or make it bigger to accomodate larger accessories like the charger. There are lots of bags and larger storage pouches available so I decided to make the Smart Cargo a smaller, minimalist and more portable alternative. Personally, I almost never carry the iPad charger with me on the go because the battery life on the iPad is so good.\nWhat material is the Smart Cargo made out of?\nThe outside of the Smart Cargo is made out of hard plastic treated to look exactly like the back of the iPad. In fact, you can't really tell the difference between the two without touching. There is a steel plate under the base of the product so it attaches magnetically to the Smart Cover. The inside is lined with felt to attenuate the noise and protect accessories.\nWhy not make it in aluminum? I actually tried and there are 2 reasons why I chose plastic instead in the end: (1) After several prototyping attempts, the factory could not make it the shape I wanted in aluminum and (2) even if I had opted for the sub par design required to tool in aluminum, the cost would have gone up so much that I would have had to charge $30-$40 per unit which would have discouraged a lot of people from buying it.\nI'm a retailer or a distributor. How can I order the Smart Cargo wholesale?\nContact me for distribution opportunities in the US and other countries as well as the wholesale price list.\nDoes the Smart Cargo work with all Apple Covers? (Smart Cover and Smart Case)\nYes. The Smart Cargo works with both the Apple Smart Cover and the Apple Smart Case. But note that it will only stick magnetically to genuine Apple Smart Covers and Smart Cases. Fake Smart Covers are sometimes sold on Amazon or eBay at a reduced price by 3rd party sellers. These fake covers lack magnets inside their last pane, which means that the Smart Cargo could not magnetically stick to them. \nHow can you make sure you have a real Smart Cover that will work with the Smart Cargo? If you bought your Smart Cover or Smart Case at an Apple Store, you're OK. If not and especially if you got yours at a discounted price, I recommend checking with a metallic object like a screw that you know will stick to magnets (test it with a fridge magnet first) and verify that it sticks to the last pane of your Smart Cover (the one opposite the hinge).\nGot more questions not answered here?\nDon't be shy!

Perfect for when you have had an unexpected delay, or haven't been able to fully charge your phone, and you need to make a few calls, send a work email or use your GPS and maps function to find your way home.\nTiny Tiny Tiny \nSo we believe the Fuel Micro charger is the world\u2019s smallest cell phone recharging device. And it is absolutely tiny- just 1.3 by 0.9 by half an inch. It\u2019s so small that it can sit easily on your keyring, you can slip it into the 5th pocket of your jeans, or even have it hanging off your cellphone.\nThe Devotec Fuel Micro Charger is an emergency back-up solution. The Micro Charger is fully rechargeable, and is able to keep it\u2019s charge for at least 1 month before needing to be recharged (our calculations suggest closer to 3 months, so we are being conservative!)\nHow it works \nCharge up the Fuel Micro Charger from the supplied cable or any AC micro-usb wall plug. Then just put it in your pocket, on your key chain or in your car and forget about it. \nTo Use: Turn the power switch on and plug into your phone, the same as you would your charger. Your phone will start to recharge straight away.\nA more in depth look at the Fuel Micro Charger \nComponent selection\n Part of our background is in component sourcing. So we spent months searching, testing and evaluating the smallest and most efficient parts to use with the Fuel Micro Charger. The components we use are the smallest available, and we have used innovative features like flexible-PCBs to shrink component size, in order to make Fuel as small as possible, and to have as big an internal battery as we can.\nHowever, the electronics are controlled by a premium Texas Instruments platform, and we have included multiple safety redundancy features, such as a PCM on the battery and a battery management IC on the PCB to make no compromises on the safety of Fuel.\nHousing \nThe body of the product is pure die-cast aluminium. This means it is incredibly strong but still light weight. The aluminium is painted, lacquered and then baked to give a semi-gloss finish. The housing weighs around half an ounce.\nInternal\nBattery\n The majority of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by an energy dense lithium-ion rechargeable battery. This battery is a 5C battery, rated at 220 milliamp hours. This should provide around 20\u201330 minutes extra talk time, or a few hours on standby, although that is dependent on what type of phone you have and how you use it.\nBattery safety \nThe battery itself has an integrated PCM and there is a battery management IC on the PCB, so the fuel micro charger is extra safe.\nPCB\n The PCB itself is very small, using specially sourced low-profile components, to keep its volume down to an absolute minimum, allowing us more space for a bigger battery inside the Fuel Micro Charger. However, it is a fully functioning PCB, with regulated inputs and outputs by micro-usb. We also use a Flex-PCB, which is even smaller than a regular PCB to connect the micro-usb male to the main board, again to cut down on internal space, so we have more room for the biggest battery we can use.\nLEDs and Switch \nOn the outside of the case, you will see three LEDs. These help tell you if the Fuel is turned on, fully charged, or charging. Each of the Three LEDs will Light up to tell you different information about your Micro Charger:\nRed: Charging\nGreen: Fully Charged\nBlue: Power On\n\nThere is a switch to turn the Fuel Micro Charger on and off, keeping the battery from needlessly discharging when not in use. \nMicro-USB\n Micro-USB is the standard charging connector for all phones apart from iPhone. We use specially sourced low profile components, which while being the smallest on the market, are also certified to work with any existing micro-usb connector- so you can charge almost any Android, Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola, Nokia or Blackberry phone.\nCharging the Fuel \nThe Devotec Fuel Micro Charger has a rechargeable battery inside that is recharged via its female micro-usb port at the bottom of the device. Any standard micro-usb cable, or AC wall charger you have at home can recharge the Fuel Micro Charger, and the battery inside is rated for a minimum of 500 cycles.\nLet us tell you about who we are \nWe are a dedicated team of entrepreneurs and industry professionals, including Phd scientists, MIT graduates, Harvard MBAs and ex Motorola employees. We work at Devotec Industries, where our day jobs are to design Solar Powered Bluetooth speakers and Solar Chargers for cell phones.\nSo we have plenty of experience in designing charging circuits, and have shipped thousands of units over the last 7 years. The Fuel Micro Charger is an off shoot of our main work, and we are looking to launch it into the market pretty soon after our Kickstarter funding ends, if we are successful.\nWhere are we? \nAs you can see from the working sample, we have all the PCB design finished, with schematics and Gerber files ready. The CAD drawings are fully finished and we are ready to go into production. Through our other work, we have strong links with manufacturing in China, and have agreed pricing and lead times with an aluminium molder for the housing tooling who we have previously worked with.\nWe have been testing the samples for several months now, and it is based on a mature design we have been using for some time with our existing products.\nWhy do we need Funding?\n Where we need you to come in is to help us raise funds to put the Devotec Fuel Micro Charger into production. We need to buy the aluminium toolings, pay for the first production run, and pay for all the certification like CE, RoHS, and WEEE.\nAction! \nWe think this is an awesome product and we are really excited about it, but we need your help to turn it into a reality. We have lots of exciting discounts and offers available to our early backers, and we hope that we can turn this product into a something special that you are going to love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny technology project will carry certain risks, and surprises can occur at any point in a project.\nWe have done our best to mitigate and minimize the risks associated to bringing the Devotec Fuel Micro Charger to market in several ways:\n\n- We have well tested and working prototypes. We started work on the Fuel Micro Charger project in November 2011, and had our first housing in August 2012, and our first working PCBs in September 2012.\n\n- We are experienced. Many projects fail not because of lack of enthusiasm, but due to lack of knowledge by the entrepreneur outside their core-competency. Part of our team is based in China and has worked in the country with multiple factories for many years, and has developed lasting relationships over the last 7 years with many of the manufacturing partners we intend to use for the Fuel Micro Charger. We are therefore much less likely to fall prey to the \u2018teething problems\u2019 that many other American companies have when first approaching China for manufacturing.\n\n- We use high quality components. We are using a standardized and high-quality American Texas Instruments platform as the basis of our design. We chose this design over using lower cost Chinese alternatives, even though they were multiple times cheaper. Quality first.\n\n- We know how to ship product. We have sold and shipped our previous Chargers and Speakers to the US, Europe, Japan and globally for seven years. We understand issues like shipping and logistics, merchant payment terms, insurance, safety certificates and the many other issues that can delay or harm a new entrepreneur\u2019s business.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Holiday Present - Fuel is the perfect stocking stuffer!", "update_content": "Hi Guys, this is a preview of our next project.

More time has gone into the design and method to turn on the light. After discussing with manufacturers how to inject the plastic over the circuitry, we are confident we will see light at the end of the tunnel. And that light will be controlled by a push button that has also been coated in plastic. \n\nThe concept is straight forward. It's a micro USB cable with a light. The implementation is a little more tricky. Why? The connector contains 5 wires, a populated circuit board, a button, light and micro USB connector. \n\nWe have to populate the board in a way that does not short circuit the light with 1 of the 5 cable within the connector.\n\nWe have an estimated timeline how long the vendors plan to have the molds made, circuit boards assembled, and the complete cable molded and assembled. By passing these tasks off to professional manufacturers we foresee these tasks running smoothly. This is a new project never been done before, so that means we could run into over-molding issues, and might be required to redesign the circuit board, or plastics. \n\nWe did an IP search and foresee everything running smoothly. We even filed for a utility patent for this product. \n\nWe obtained a quote from a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. This means we will take the finished product and send it in for testing. These tests ensure household safety. If for some reason they have an issue with the cable, coating, circuit board, circuitry, button, or connector then we would have to go back and revise the flaw to ensure a safe product.\n\nSafety is important.

It is slim and sleek- unlike any cable you've seen before.\nSpixi features a unique, retracting 2-foot cable made from an eco-friendly thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) that is stronger and more durable than polyvinyl chloride, the commonly used material for cables. Because of TPE's superior characteristics, we can design a thinner cable without sacrificing quality and performance. \nYes, we've heard about iPhone 5 \nSpixi comes in 3 different connector flavors:\niPhone 5 -- 8-pin lightning connector WITH AUTHENTICATION CHIP\niPhone 4/4S (and previous versions)\nMicro-USB (Android, Blackberry, Windows)\nThe world's FIRST jam-free retractable USB cable for smartphones\nA high level of design and quality- is unheard of, in the retractable USB cable world. It's our pleasure to change that.\nHow big is it really?\nLet's take a look.\nProduct features\nA connector like you've never seen before\nThe connector is sideways. This helps minimize the size of the design. Because the connector is oriented on its side, the chance for damaging the connector is greatly reduced.\nUSB flips up, up, and away  \nThe USB connector folds away. This allows Spixi to maintain it's streamline design so it won't get caught with other items while you're taking it out of your bag.\nStays in shape to impress you\nSpixi is slim. So slim that it will not interfere with the other USB ports on your laptop, so you- the user will never have to compromise. It's just slightly wider than your typical USB flash drive.\nMade for on-the-go\nThe case is made of polycarbonate, similar to the macbook chargers. This gives protection to the cable when it is stowed and on-the-go. It will give users peace of mind, knowing that their cable is housed around solid construction.\nLet's talk AND charge\nDon't sacrifice freedom for portability. The popular emergency and short cables are great for certain situations, however, they put your phone in a paralytic state. Spixi's 2-foot cable is long enough to take calls or open apps comfortably, all while charging and syncing through your laptop.\nAnd here's how you can help\nWe need to raise $30,000- to make Spixi come to life. The funds raised will be used to cover the tooling costs of the production molds.\nA rigorous effort has been made to choose the right supplier for this product. And we're proud to say, that we've found a good match. We've been in communication with Spixi's supplier for the past 6 months, and can confirm that the our high level of quality can be met. They make product for some of the biggest names in technology, so we are confident. The supplier is located in China and we have a planned visit in the coming weeks- very exciting!\nIf funding is successful by November 1, we plan to ship in February 2013.\nWhy does it take so long to make?\nWe are all about transparency, so here is the breakdown: it takes 2 months to make the tooling, about 1 month to produce the units and address production quality, and an additional month for the products to arrive to our shores. So if tooling starts in November, we're looking at February to delivery Spixi to our awesome supporters!\nDesign evolution\nWe've come very far.

Machined from a solid block of aluminum and completed with a hard anodized finish this MOS will fit in perfectly with your Apple products (or any environment you put it in really).\nRemember to specifically choose the aluminum rewards when pledging your amount.  The cheaper options are for the plastic MOS kits only.  You cannot choose aluminum in the 5 and 10 pack MOS kits either...these are for plastic MOS kits only.\nWhite Plastic\nBlack Plastic\nHow the MOS was born\nWhile migrating work spaces between home and office we consistently found ourselves digging behind desks for our fallen computer cables. After a few dozen trips behind our desks to retrieve lost laptop power cables we knew there had to be a better way.\nThe MOS was born out of the need to keep control over our frequently used computer cables in an unobtrusive way.  The MOS keeps your cables right where you need them, whether its just a laptop power cable or a more complete desktop including: speakers, usb hard drives, monitors, etc.\nDesigning the MOS\nWe knew early on in the design phase of the MOS that we had a clear and simple goal: it had to hold your cables securely, and it had to look good doing it. Despite the MOS's seemingly simple function we went through months of design and prototyping to find a form that was both attractive and functional.\nThe Magnets \nWe worked through a variety of magnets to find a balance between size and pull strength. The magnets in both the MOS base and the cable ties have been optimized to strike the perfect balance between security and removability. \nThe Base \nWe had to develop a way for the MOS to stay in place as you pulled the cables off of it. We experimented with a variety of weights and rubber materials to enhance the friction between the MOS and desk surfaces. What we came up with is something we are incredibly excited about \u2013 Micro-Suction Tape. This non-sticky high friction tape uses thousands of microscopic air pockets to secure the MOS to your desk without any leftover residue. We found this to be plenty secure to keep the MOS from sliding as you add and remove cables. Better still, if it ever gets dirty and loses its suction it can be brought back to its original suction strength with a quick rinse of water. \nThe Magnetic Cable Ties \nWhile many cables are manufactured with enough metal in the heads to stick to the MOS on their own, others are not. In order to accommodate every type of cable we had to come up with a solution. What we made is a small rubber cable tie with a powerful magnet that will securely hold your cable to the MOS. The flexible rubber tie was designed to account for a wide variety of cable diameters. \nNew Wall-Mount Design!\nBecause of your suggestions we designed the MOS to be wall-mountable!  Included in every MOS kit will be a double sided adhesive foam circle that fits perfectly onto the orange circle on the underside of each MOS.  This will securely hold your MOS and all your cables vertically, so you don't have to use that precious desk space for your MOS!  \nAluminum MOS - Prototype 1\nPlease refer to Update #6 for more information on the Aluminum MOS prototype photos.\nProduction Schedule\nWe will take all possible measures to get the MOS completed as soon as possible.  We have already set up an overseas manufacturing partner to fulfill the plastic injection molding process of the MOS.  All we are looking for now is your financial support to see this project through.  If all goes according to plan we hope to follow this general timetable:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Our Kickstarter just got a whole lot BIGGER!

That's why we've decided to inject our LUNATIK design DNA into protective cases. This is the DNA that fathered the TikTok+LunaTik and the LUNATIK Touch Pen. By obsessing over all the details that others neglect like fit, finish, details, feel, display integrity, robustness and aesthetics, we are raising the bar again. From the high sensitivity display protection of our Gorilla Glass Lens to our patent pending shockproof suspension system, we have gone above and beyond to transform the iPhone into a refined and rugged everyday warrior. We want people to be excited about using protection. \nIf you are tired of the same old box with sloppy features, we've got you covered with the TAKTIK iPhone Case by LUNATIK. \nNow available: \"Shadow Ops\" Black Anodized Aluminum TAKTIK case\nTAKTIK: Transformational Design\nThe devil is in the details and the details make the product. The extra effort and cost to make a product great is worth it. It is good business\u2014great for the user and good for the planet. Great products last longer and are the first step in being responsible. And ours just might make your iPhone last longer as well. \n\nWith TAKTIK we have focused on making a case that exceeds user expectations in the rugged case market and one that balances strong iconic aesthetics with innovative performance features. There is no reason you have to settle for one or the other. With TAKTIK you get both: a case that takes a beating and can turns heads at the same time.\nTAKTIK transforms your iPhone through bold design, precision engineering and the best performance materials available.\nShockproof Suspension System\nTAKTIK's shockproof suspension features a patent-pending 9mm Impact Truss silicone perimeter compressed between two durable Ballistik polymer bezels or anodized aluminum bezels. The front bezel includes an adhered compression seal liner to protect from rain seeping into the case. Our design for the rear bezel features an open, unobstructed camera pass through that maintains brilliant photo and flash quality almost as if the case wasn't there. This sandwich construction compresses the silicone truss creating a suspension system to cradle your iPhone like the precious baby it is.\nGorilla Glass Lens UPGRADE\nGorilla Glass is the hardest, thinnest, most durable glass that the iPhone uses for its display and it has defined the future of tactile interaction with mobile devices. Our biggest complaint with any tough case is the plastic display film that makes you feel like you are using a 1996 Palm Pilot. So we are doubling down with an optional upgrade: a sealed GORILLA Glass protective lens on the front bezel including anti-glare and anti-smudge coatings. You won't even know you are using protection and there's no loss of sensitivity or performance. Maintaining the interaction quality of the iPhone, it's soul, is essential and we have spared no expense to achieve this. Our Gorilla Glass lens alone costs more than our competitor's entire cases.\nGore Acoustic Ports \nFrom spills and driving rain to the occasional toilet, the slightest bit of fluid can permeate your phone and cause the Apple Genius to say \"no iPhone for you!\" Someday soon all iPhones will be naturally water-resistant via nano coatings, but until then we are using GORE, the leader in environmental protection,to create a hydrophobic barrier for our speaker and mic porting. \nPlug those Holes\nBoth the headset port and 30-pin connector are protected with gasket plugs that won't tear off after a few uses. Our iconic port cover for the headphone jack, inspired by Panerai watches, is machined from anodized aircraft grade aluminum and provides solid visual and tactile assurance that your port is secure. The 30-pin flap features a machined aluminum port plug ensuring better sealing and durability. \nSilence Switch\nSo many durable cases neglect the importance of silence. For uninterrupted quiet when your are ready to get down to business, we\u2019ve provided easy access to the ringer switch.  We wondered why the silence switch is always buried instead of being as simple as throwing a safety mechanism on a gun. Our patent-pending Silence Switch makes it fast and painless.\nWhy trust us with your baby?\nFrom life-critical to lifestyle, we have designed dozens of performance products over the years and several products with durability, protection, and ruggedness ranging from point-of-care EMT ultrasound machines to intrinsically safe tools for hostile environments. We\u2019ve learned a ton in the process: user needs, new materials, creative construction, fabrication techniques, and also plain old common sense. Whether it's survival, shocks, scratches, spills, slopes, or kids \u2013 and it's mostly kids\u2013 we\u2019ve applied our experience in protection to TAKTIK.\nBacker Rewards\niPhone 5: Future Proof\nWe all know it's coming. Many of us will make the jump to the iPhone 5 because we can't help ourselves. And many (millions) will stick with the 4/4s as well. We want to put everyone's iPhone 5 anxieties to rest, so we are developing both cases.\nYou will also get to experience the MINIMAL behind-the-scenes pre-announcement strategy, the Apple keynote hysteria, the post-announcement design and development frenzy, and the on-the-ground factory work needed to get the iPhone 5 product to market for Winter 2012. Protection never gets old, and new things need it the most.\nTAKTIK iPhone 5 case\nPledge for the TAKTIK iPhone 5 case + UPGRADED Gorilla Glass lens (design, color, material and finish TBD) * US Shipping included. Add $20 for international shipping. **Est. delivery date for TAKTIK iPhone 5 case will be approx. 3 months after the iPhone 5 launch.\nWhile the TAKTIK 4/4S case is offered in many colors, materials, finishes and upgrades, it's difficult for us to say we will be able to offer those same choices for the TAKTIK iPhone 5 case. We promise to deliver something worthy of the TAKTIK 4/4S product- color, finish and materials to come.\nFuture Proof Pack \nThe Future Proof Pack provides immediate protection for your 4/4S and lets you come along for the entire design and development for the iPhone 5.\nPledge for the Future Proof Pack and receive one TAKTIK iPhone 4/4S case (choose from Black or White Polymer Bezels or Silver Anodized Aluminum) and one TAKTIK iPhone 5 case + UPGRADED Gorilla Glass lens(choice of plastic and metal colors TBD). The TAKTIK iPhone 5 case will ship separately from TAKTIK iPhone 4/4S cases. Estimated 3 months after iPhone 5 launch.\nMix 'n Match Pack\nPledge for the Mix 'n Match Pack and receive one set of Serialized Black Anodized Aluminum Bezels with our UPGRADED Gorilla Glass Lens, one set of White Polymer Bezels with UPGRADED Gorilla Glass Lens, four Silicone Impact Trusses in Black, LUNATIK Yellow, Hot Pink, and Glow in the Dark (yep, we're with you even in the darkest of places), four 3.5 Port Covers in Black, Silver, Red and Orange and (1) Key chain hex tool all for iPhone 4/4S case.\nRiding dirty with the TAKTIK Bike Mount\nA case this rugged deserves a nice ride. We designed the TAKTIK Bike Mount for the urban dweller, trekker and mountain down-hiller to be with you wherever and however you roam. The three-piece design \u2013 holster, clip and mount mechanism - provides freedom of movement and placement on most bikes. The perforated holster is detachable for future accessory lines and attachments. Like the TAKTIK case, the mount doesn\u2019t compromise any functionality of the device. It's an option, but we think its essential.\nAdd $50 to any pledge level to receive the TAKTIK Holster + Bike Mount. \nThis item will ship separately from TAKTIK iPhone 4/4S cases at no additional cost to Backers. Estimated shipping Sept. 2012\nAfter clicking any pledge Level, simply add an additional $50 to the pledge amount on the following screens. If you have already pledged and would like to add the Holster + Bike Mount, click the blue \"Manage Your Pledge\" button and add $50 to the amount in the box.\nA metal case the iPhone likes\nMetal cases and the iPhone historically don't play well together. No one has successfully made a metal case that works well with antennas in the US. We knew making our bezels out of metal might work in Hong Kong and China where their wireless infrastructure is far stronger than the US. To our surprise, however, the metal housings are working without issue in Chicago and we plan to test them elsewhere during the project. Essentially, it works the same as if you were using the iPhone in your bare hand without a typical case. So if you are looking for something to disrupt the conversation even more, go for TAKTIK Aluminum.\nMilitary Specifications\nWe have designed the TAKTIK with military specifications in mind, leveraging our past experience designing field medical equipment and intrinsically safe gear and tools. We are currently testing our prototypes.  The next step is to test production parts in a certified lab to quantify and validate the final rating level. This is part of the process of designing environmentally resistant products.\nKickstart us the rest of the way\nLUNATIK is a brand conceived and validated via crowd funding. We were born on Kickstarter and love the community we've built and value your input and loyalty. We\u2019re excited and extremely fortunate to be back in 2012 launching our 3rd KS project.\nOur backers - more than 17,000 of you to date - are the reason for our success. You propel us to design premium products for the mobile, connected, active, tech-savvy consumer. \nKickstarter is a great way for us to test and realize many of the ideas we think people will love. We believe in the emerging power of community and the individual to bring ideas to life and challenge convention. In the next 30 days, we will be turning our prototype parts into reality. Here are some areas where your pledge money will help to make the product a reality:\nTooling & Development\nTesting for MIL STD 810G at certified labs on the protective features in our case\nMinimum Order Quantities (Factories often require MOQs in the thousands of units per design) \nDevelopment trips over the next several months to manage and oversee development with our partners.\nDelivered and in your hands \nWith your support we are targeting to have TAKTIK iPhone 4/4S case to every backer by mid-August and iPhone 5 before the holidays.

What we need is the Tablift.\" -LazyTechGuys\n\"The tablift is a pretty cool and nifty concept and we wouldn\u2019t mind getting our hands on one\" -\u00fcbergizmo\n\"One of our favorite Kickstarter projects\" -BiteMyApple\nHere's the low down...\ntablift is a simple yet elegant solution for using your iPad hands-free in bed, on the couch, or in your favorite cushy chair. Although there are many accessories for propping up the iPad, most are made to be used on tables and desktops. However, over half of tablet use takes place on the couch or while lying in bed. Surprisingly there is very little available for the places we most often use our tablets.\niPads are great in bed and on the couch!  This is especially true when reading or watching shows - which is why they usually find their home there. But let's face it, holding the iPad after a while can get tiring, and most people resort to balancing it on their legs or a pillow.  And the few devices that are made to be used in these situations typically require resting on your lap, which can be constricting as well as not useful when lying down. \nWouldn't it be nice to sit back or even lie down and be able to watch a movie or read a book on your iPad without having to balance it or hold it in place for long periods of time?  Lacking the availability of any good solution, it was this question that drove the development of the tablift.\ntablift: From Concept to Refined Prototype\nThe tablift was designed to hold the iPad in a stable and optimal viewing position regardless of the unevenness of the wonderfully cushy surface you are resting on. It has undergone 8 months of continual prototype iteration and redesign to arrive at its current streamlined functional design.  \nIt's patent pending design uses four independently adjustable legs which allow it to stand level and stable on virtually any cushioned surface.  And it's low center of gravity means it will not tip over (assuming you don't flip your entire mattress over!)\nFeatured Viewing Angles - for how you most often use the iPad...\nQuality and Design\nYes. Finally there is a simple functioning solution for using your iPad in bed and on the couch, but that's not where the design of the tablift ends. \nFrom conception, tablift was designed to be a truly unique piece. It resembles no other tablet propping device and only high-quality components were sought in it's development. The mounting base is constructed from high-grade, high-impact ABS plastic with a beautiful matt finish. The legs are made of a double re-enforced metal spring core, with a matt polyolefin finish. This is solid construction with an artful aesthetic.\ntablift will be manufactured and assembled in the USA.  This has been one of the driving visions behind tablift. Domestic manufacturers as well as parts suppliers have all been lined out to make this happen. And when the time hopefully comes, we will be excited to be able to say \"Made in the USA!\"\ntablift also works great as a desktop stand with many configurations...\nOne more thing: tablift expands to a wide footprint for maximum stability, but it was also designed to fold down to a remarkably small size enabling you to store it or easily take it with you! \ntablift is very compact. Look at an actual scale comparison to the iPad...\nHere's where YOU come in. In order to bring the tablift from refined prototype to finished product, funds are needed for tooling of multiple injection molds, volume purchasing of component parts, as well as package design. These costs add up quickly. But once all of the tooling and the rest of the startup costs are covered, we will be able to successfully produce tablifts at quantity. Our fundraising goal of $78k represents the amount we will need to safely cover all of our startup costs for the first production run.\nRemember, Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform. If we only meet 95% of our funding goal, we get zero, zilch, nada. So we must make 100% or nothing. We are excited for the opportunity to make the tablift a reality for all iPad users. And it can happen with your help.  Simply choose your favorite pledge/reward level and not only will you help to make the tablift a reality, but you will also get your very own - imagine!  \nTarget for delivery of rewards is October 2012.\ntablift was born from a simple idea, however the execution has required solid council as well as specialized capabilities.  Thank you to Protomold for our first prototypes, Solid concepts for our later prototypes. Jordan Walbesser for helping with patent filing.  Thanks to Joel Bell for industrial design.  Dan Ashcraft for good advice.

That\u2019s where our Spike TypeSmart keyboards come in. Unlike any other keyboards available today, we wanted to create a suite of products that complemented the iPhone\u2019s impeccable quality and elegant form factor, and at the same time let you type and text easier, faster, and with fewer mistakes, under virtually all conditions \u2013 even if you\u2019re wearing gloves!\nYour Choice -  Rock or Roll\nWe have carefully engineered Spike, so in a flash, you can transition from typing to making or receiving a call, launching any of your apps, or playing Angry Birds, and then back to typing, all without missing a beat!  Because we believe you should always have a choice, our initial suite consists of two versions, Spike\u00b9 and Spike\u00b2. Both versions incorporate our proprietary TypeSmart keyboard that has been carefully integrated into handsome iPhone protective cases. Of course, we will manufacture them using only premium materials that are suitable for an Apple accessory product.\nWe call our keyboards TypeSmart, because they are the natural and smart way to type on your iPhone!  Best of all, with Spike, you have a keyboard when you need it and it disappears when you don\u2019t want it. \nPrecision Input \nWe all know that typing is not really precise by definition \u2013 precise |pri\u02c8s\u012bs| adjective, marked by exactness and accuracy of expression or detail. However, we wanted to engineer a keyboard that would offer you the easiest, fastest, and most error-free way to type on your iPhone. We have paid careful attention to even the smallest detail and through rigorous user testing. We've designed a keyboard whose layout includes individually sculptured keycaps and snap-touch keys that lets your fingers find and feel every letter you type.  Now, writing emails, texts, or your thesis couldn't be easier. Spike's keyboard simply provides the accuracy that typing on glass with fingers cannot ever achieve, that\u2019s our definition of Precision Input! \nDisruptive Technology\nIt has taken us over two years to develop our proprietary TypeSmart keyboard technology (patent pending). This technology allowed us to create a keyboard for Spike, that in contrast to any other product, doesn\u2019t require plugging in, Bluetooth, or any external power source. An additional benefit derived from this technology, is that unlike typing on the iPhone's touchscreen, if you have longer fingernails or even if wearing gloves you can still type and text like a champ using Spike's keyboard!  Importantly, it let us design a full-function keyboard that is less than \u00bc inch thick, enabling us to integrate the keyboard into a protective case, while maintaining the elegance and sleek form factor of your iPhone. \nIn the future, our TypeSmart technology will also be applicable to keyboards and input products for other touchscreen phones and tablets. \nSpike\u00b9 is a combination keyboard and protective case that can be easily and securely installed in a matter of seconds. You can effortlessly rotate the bottom section of the case with the keyboard, to the back or the front of the iPhone, for storing in either typing or full-screen mode.  We\u2019ve also hinged the keyboard, so you\u2019ll always have quick access to the full-screen even when typing.\nThis model is priced in the same range as the majority of ordinary iPhone cases. This means that even for many users that don't feel they need a keyboard, it is so affordable that it's tough to pass up. And once they try it, they\u2019ll soon realize the advantages of real tactile keys even though they feel they are proficient typing on the touchscreen.  \nSpike\u00b2is our premium version keyboard and case combination. It differs from Spike\u00b9 in user convenience features and overall appearance. Its industrial-strength case not only protects your iPhone, but incorporates a unique and specially-designed asymmetrical 360 degree hinge. This hinge enables you to quickly toggle the keyboard on and off the screen for full-screen access while you are typing.  In addition, it also allows you to fold and stow the keyboard in a flush pocket in the rear of the case when you\u2019ve finished typing and return to the full touchscreen to run all those apps that you will probably never use more than once or twice.  At a touch of your fingers, it can instantly be brought to the front to bang out a quick text message, email, or even type your first novel comfortably!  And to make sure you are always in style, it features a beautiful, brushed metal accent band around the perimeter of the case.\nOur Limited Edition Spike\u00b3is for those of you that appreciate the very best. Similar in design to Spike\u00b2, but with an all-aluminum, antenna-neutral case including the TypeSmart keyboard that is easily stowed out of the way when not needed.  We are CNC machining these right here in the USA from aerospace grade aluminum and anodizing them in at least two great colors, Neutron Gray and KickStarter Green, we anticipate a couple more anodized colors to come. To make it truly personal for you or someone special, we\u2019ll custom engrave up to 30 letters on the back of the case. \nKickstarter Manufacturing Plan & Timeline \nFor production of our Spike\u00b9 andSpike\u00b2 TypeSmart keyboards in this project, we have established a manufacturing arrangement with an international contract manufacturer with factories on six continents. We developed the technology, produced and vetted the first series of prototypes here in Seattle, but the actual pre-production prototypes shown in this project were produced in our manufacturer's factory located in Malaysia. Our chief designer has had a relationship with this manufacturer for two decades and has already made two trips this year to the factory on our behalf.  We have added to our team an on-site supervisor that lives in Malaysia that has also worked with our designer for the past twenty years. He is our boots-on-the-ground field representative and will oversee all aspects of production to help ensure that our products are manufactured to our specifications and in accordance with our timeline. \nWe will be producing the all-aluminum Limited Edition Spike\u00b3 right here in Seattle, Washington.\nWith your support we are planning for all versions of Spike to be on your iPhone during September. We are going to jump-start production for Kickstarter backers to make this happen. We plan to order limited production tooling shortly after the start of our Kickstarter program so we can start shipping in 90 days. Order early, get yours first.\nWhat About the iPhone 5?\nWhile we don\u2019t know the exact date for the introduction of the long-awaited iPhone 5 from Apple, we all know it is around the corner. We also know that lots of existing iPhone users will be standing in line to get their hands on one. From the time we have one in our hands, we estimate that it will take approximately four (4) months to tool and manufacture Spike keyboards for the iPhone 5. In order to make sure our Spike collection will be available to all backers of this project, we have a special offer.  As a backer, you will be able to purchase an equivalent iPhone 5 version of Spike\u00b9 and Spike\u00b2 for today\u2019s Kickstarter prices of $25 and $50 respectively, at the time they become available. Of course, you will be among the first to have one in your hands.\nOr choose from one of our two Future Proof reward options that give you both the iPhone 4 and 5 versions of our Spike keyboards when they are released.\nThis is where you play an important role.\nEver since the iPhone was introduced, a real physical keyboard has been at the top of the wish list of many users and prospective users! Together, with your help we can make one of the most requested iPhone accessories a reality. With your contribution, you become a Spike or Die team member, and be among the first to own whichever version of Spike you choose, before they become commercially available.\nWe are a small, dedicated team that formed SoloMatrix to create disruptive products for the iPhone, other smartphones, and tablets. We have spent over two years developing the TypeSmart technology that drives the keyboard, as well as, building and beta testing the prototypes and bringing Spike to its current pre-production level. We have already established the vital manufacturing relationships to get all models of Spike into immediate production. In fact, the units shown here and demonstrated in the video, are actual pre-production versions built to our specifications by our manufacturer. We know by experience that funding, manufacturing, and distribution is always a challenging undertaking. We also believe in the power of the community that is represented by Kickstarter and that it is a great way for a small group of people like us to be able to put a plan in place that properly addresses these challenges, and, to bring ideas such as Spike to fruition.\nIt is our sincere hope that you find Spike innovative and exciting and choose to support the project.  Please tell your friends and help spread the word.\nThanks for your interest in our project!\nSpike in the News\nOhGizmo! \u2013 \"The Spike case you see above is the best implementation of an add-on keyboard we\u2019ve ever come across\"\nThink iOS \u2013 \"So if you were counting on Apple to add a physical keyboard to iPhone, and have been disappointed from the company so far, Spike protective case seems like a good choice\"\niJailbreak \u2013 \"It\u2019s just like the iPhone keyboard, but gives you feedback as you type away...

These cases will undergo an incoming quality control inspection from our team in Malaysia, then keyboards will be assembled and installed, and then will go through outgoing QC and testing before being put on another pallet and shipped air freight to us in the US for final processing. \nSo while this is a huge step forward for us, there are still a few milestones between now and when we can provide you with solid ETAs. The wheels are turning however, and we want you to know that there are teams of people in three different countries working together to make Spike happen. The QC, assembly, testing, and pack-out should be about a 2-3 week lead time set of processes, and it takes about a week to move a pallet from one place to another via air freight (although expediting is possible, it\u2019s prohibitively expensive to ship close to a ton overnight). So while we still have several weeks ahead of us before we get that pallet back to us in Seattle, we are already moving leaps and bounds faster through this process than with our iPhone 4/4s Spikes. This shipment will be more than enough to cover all our iPhone 5/5s related Kickstarter rewards.

The purpose of the trip was to manage and supervise the beginning of full scale manufacturing for iPhone 5/5s versions of Spike. We visited five different factories between Penang and Shenzhen to get everything in line for the production start up, which has currently begun. Manufacturing of all the components that go together to create Spike is now underway, and assembly of the final product will begin in about 3 weeks. Our first run is for about 3,000 units, and unlike for our previous generation iPhone 4/4s Spikes, these will all be complete at the same time rather than trickling in. We\u2019re working on retrofitting and adapting new-generation parts to the iPhone 4/4s versions to continue to try and smooth out that process, which as you probably know has proven more difficult than we ever anticipated."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Update from Overseas", "update_content": "Hello all,\nWe\u2019re continuing to ship iPhone 4/s models at a slower pace than we would like, however, we have shipped approximately 66% of iPhone 4/4s Kickstarter rewards, virtually all in Pitch Black.

We do expect red and white within the next week or two.\nWe recognize that due the long delay in getting the iPhone 4/4s Spike into production that many of you took advantage of our offer to switch to the iPhone 5/5s Spike. As you may know from the photos we have posted in the past, this is an entirely new product, and both the case and the keyboard and have required completely new injection molding tooling. Fortunately, we learned from our mistakes: we greatly improved the overall design from an engineering and manufacturing perspective and moved the case molding and assembly to a high quality company in Shenzhen, China. The result is that preparations for full production are almost complete. Tooling has been completed and raw materials for production and assembly are being acquired and consolidated at our factories in both Shenzhen and Penang.\nAny backers at the iPhone 4/4s levels who wish to switch to the iPhone 5/5s models are more than welcome to do so \u2013 just send us a message on Kickstarter and we\u2019ll sort it out before shipping your Spike.

Patent Pending.\nWhat The Press is Saying\nWhy Smarter Stand?\nThe Smart Cover is one of the best accessories for iPad, but it's too limiting as an iPad stand: either its so reclined you can't see the screen or it's so upright that I have to back-up. What you really want is the iPad facing you directly, but the Smart Cover doesn't do that...until now!\nThe perfect iPad stand\nIf I back Smarter Stand, when will I get mine?\nAll orders of 1 or 2 Smarter Stands are scheduled to ship in early October. BUT if you order 3 Smarter Stands or more, your order will ship 2 weeks sooner. If you're curious as to why, it's explained in Update #11.\nWhy order 3 or more Smarter Stands? Imagine you're getting your Smarter Stand and it's already autumn, the leaves are turning yellow and the holidays are right around the corner\u2026 wouldn't a few extra Smarter Stands make great stocking stuffers? How about birthdays coming-up?\nWhich pledge levels qualify for free accelerated shipping?\n$39 pledge level: 3 Smarter Stands of the colors of your choice*\n$125 pledge level: 10 Smarter Stands \"\n$339 pledge level: 30 Smarter Stands \"\netc.\n* color choices will be collected in a survey sent to you after the project ends.\nHow Smarter Stand Works\nSmarter Stand is composed of 2 clips that attach to either side of the Smart Cover or the Smart Case. For the Smart Cover, a polyurethane pad that sticks to the back side of the iPad is also provided to prevent the iPad from slipping. For the Smart Case, no pad is needed since the neoprene of the back cover provides the grip necessary.\nYou can achieve different stand positions by sliding the clips so they block the folds of the Smart Cover.\n33-degree stand position - great for watching movies\nBy moving the clips to different spots and combining them in different ways, you'll discover new stand positions including a private typing position that hides your screen from someone across from you (think job interviews, business meetings, ...).\n45-degree stand position achieved by sliding the 2 clips over 2 different folds\nThe clips are designed to slide perfectly on the Smart Cover (or Smart Case) yet they're tightly attached enough to stay on as you carry your iPad around. \nJust like the Smart Cover and Smart Case products, the Smarter Stand is sleek, minimalist and easy to use. It doesn't add any weight or bulk to the iPad. \nThe clips are designed to slide smoothly on the Smart Cover yet stay firmly attached\nCan't it do even more stand positions?\nAppadvice recently reviewed Smarter Stand and commented: \n\"The instruction manual shows that the Smarter Stand adds three additional viewing angles to the Smart Cover, but I found that, with a little imagination, the clips can give your iPad at least six different angles.\"\nWe also recently discovered this variable 10 to 20 degrees PORTRAIT stand position explained in update #10:\nBonus portrait position\nWhat stand position will you discover when you get your Smarter Stand? :-)\n\nWait... can't this be done with a couple of binder clips?\nIf you want to try to do this with a couple of binder clips to save $12 (shipping included), you absolutely should... Just be aware that:\n1) You'll have to take your clunky binder clips on and off the cover and store them somewhere when you're not using them whereas Smarter Stand can stay on your Smart Cover all the time and slide into the position you need when you need it. \n2) Binder clips will eventually damage your $39 Smart Cover and might also scratch your $500+ iPad's screen. \n3) You'll need to stick some kind of non-slip pad to the back of your iPad to stabilize it. Just make sure you never need to remove this home-made pad since it will definitely leave marks unlike the one provided with Smarter Stand.\nSo as long as the above doesn't bother you and you're ok showing up at Starbucks with good old binder clips oddly attached to your iPad, you can save yourself all of $12 to buy 3 Grande Cappuccinos with! \nThere's a zillion iPad stands out there. Why this one?\nTrue. There are a lot of iPad stands out there. I know because I own about half of them :-) And believe me... none of them were as affordable as the Smarter Stand. And no, that's not why I need your backing (more on that below).\nThe reason I came up with the Smarter Stand is that I never used my other iPad stands: They're all heavy and bulky to carry around which defeats the core purpose of the iPad: being an ultra portable device.\nWith Smarter Stand I always have my iPad stand with me. No added bulk or weight. And all that for $11. You get my point.\nWhy I Need Your Backing\nAfter many rounds of prototyping, I have arrived at a final prototype that works perfectly and which I've been using successfully for many weeks. So I'm now ready to submit the 3D model to begin mass production.\nHowever, I got a few quotes from manufacturers and the initial tooling/molding along with the first production run will cost 20k+... ouch! I don't want to involve investors who will tell me how to run my business. That's why I need your support to fund this phase of the project. I also want to get a sense for the quantity of clips to make in each color to make everyone happy while keeping production costs reasonable.\nYou can back this project for as little as $11 and you'll even get your own awesome Smarter Stand as a reward. So please back this project now and spread the word! \nThanks to you, no Smart Cover/Case should ever be limited to its 2 native stand positions ever again!\nWhat's included in 1 Smarter Stand?\nPick your color\nIMPORTANT: You will actually pick your color(s) right before I ship the orders. So for now, you only have to decide whether you want white or color clips and pledge for the corresponding reward level.\nPledge $14 or more and receive your own Smarter Stand in the color of your choice to match your smart cover or create a nice color combination.\n9 colors to choose from\nMatch. Mix. Express yourself.\nYou can match the color of your Smart Cover or even create your own coordinated style by combining colors. Not sure which colors to get? Get the Family Special and order 3 different colors to keep your iPad on the cutting edge of cover fashion!\nMatch, mix, express yourself.\nGet an extra clip FREE!\nLikeus on Facebook after you back this project and we will include one extra clip for FREE to your order when it ships. You can use an extra Smart Stand clip to unlock exotic additional stand positions (by blocking more folds in the Smart Cover) or just use it as a backup in case you lose one of the other 2 clips.\nSpecial Thanks:\nThe video was masterfully directed and edited by James Mills.

Thanks for visiting our Vavo Kickstarter page.\nIf you missed out on this Vavo campaign you can follow our Vavo journey and progress by viewing the updates section, visit and like our Facebook page, check out our website at www.udsproducts.com or reach out to us at Vavo@udsproducts.com to find out how to get your own Vavo :-)\nWe have answered more FAQ about Vavo ( with video demonstrations with devices such as iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy S3 and HTC One) in update #4 and update #5 - Take a look to find out more about Vavo.\nDon't forget to check out our other projects on Kickstarter Foco and Capta. Cheers!!\nWhat is Vavo?\nVavo is an ultra portable universal smart phone and smart device accessory. It has 2 simple functions, propping your device at a variety of angles and mounting your device on flat vertical surfaces for viewing purposes. As a result you can watch movies, capture steady photos, video conference, have a visual cooking aide and much, much more. Our smart devices go everywhere with us now so can Vavo.\nVavo is for your phones, MP3 players, small cameras and much more!!!\nWhat devices work with Vavo?\nVavo will work with smart devices (smartphones, MP3 players or small cameras) that have enough of a flat surface to attach to. Most smart devices will work with Vavo when used as a stand.  If your device is curved or has humps it could limit the surface area for Vavo to make contact - The more surface area the better available for contact the better. Also if your device is very textured or is silicone or rubber based then Vavo's hold could be reduced. This can be solved by using a case that isn't textured or rubbery in nature. We have a vertical viewing position weight limit of 160-170g for optimal efficiency (most smart devices weigh between 85-145g). Here is a video example of some devices working with Vavo:\nWhy Vavo?\nOur use of smart phones has evolved over time. We wanted an accessory that could enhance the experience of using our devices any and everywhere. There are many other small stands currently available but they restrict you to only one or two angles and are usually device specific - We set out to change that by creating a truly universal accessory to enhance your smart phone experience.\nIt took several iterations and prototypes but we now have a very compact universal design we are very happy with. Vavo goes every where your smart phones goes and will fit in your pocket, purse, bag or on a key chain.\nVavo vertical mounting\nWe wanted to push the envelope for small stands/accessories and create a device that could go everywhere with you and give more functionality to your phone. So we also designed Vavo to work on \"smooth stationary vertical\" surfaces. The The time lapse video below shows Vavo mounted on a mirror with an iPhone 4 (weighs about 140g) placed on it for viewing purposes. We used an iPad 3 to take pictures every 3 minutes. We have a vertical viewing position weight limit of 160-170g for optimal efficiency (most devices weigh between 85 -145g). When in this position you can still use your device by taking it off and place it back once you are ready for viewing again. Here is the video:\nVavo as customized promotional units\nVavo's ultra portable size makes it the perfect gift for anyone who uses a smart phone, mp3 player or small camera. Its also ideal for promotional items in any industry from government, small businesses, restaurants, schools, conferences, realtors and the list is endless. More information and examples on update #3.\nHere are a few eProof examples:\nWhat is Vavo made from?\nVavo will be made from hard plastic and a specially formulated sticky pad. This pad sticks to more surfaces than a suction cup or magnet, is reusable, reliable and leaves no residue (as seen in our last two projects - Capta and Foco).\nFinal Product Rendering\nVavo will sport Kickstarter colors of black and green.    \nVavo angles\nFor video conferencing just attach Vavo to the base of your phone and the wide base will keep your phone steady and upright. For multiple angles just attach Vavo to different locations on the back of your device and use the micro extending kickstand.Due to Vavos small size you will always be able to access and use your device at will.\nWhat stage is Vavo at now?\nThe Vavo design has been finalized and we have all elements needed to advance to final product samples and then proceed with manufacturing.  We have also picked a manufacturer who is primed to begin manufacturing. Vavo will be made using injection molding. We need to have molds made for both the Vavo parts and the sticky pads. This is an expensive process and that\u2019s why we need the support of Kickstarter backers.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThanks to our Kickstarter backers we were able to successfully bring our first product, Capta to market. Our second project Foco is currently fully funded. Now we are here hoping to make Vavo an incredible option for smart phone/device users and with the help of Kickstarter backers we can make that a reality.\nWe believe that Kickstarter is an amazing avenue for a start up like UDS to showcase our products and receive feedback from backers prior to bringing them to market. In our last two projects we have involved backers in many aspects of our products and have used the feedback to fine tune and improve our products. We look forward to doing this with Vavo as well.

We know and feel your pain. Laces come undone and get filthy, you step on them and trip, and you've spent countless hours tying and untying them. Shoelaces have been around since about 3500 BC \u2013 technology has improved almost everything else and yet here we are still, with the same basic system invented by cavemen!  \nTHAT\u2019S WHY WE\u2019VE CREATED HICKIES\u00ae \u2013A ground-breaking lacing system that replaces traditional shoelaces and lets you easily slip in and out of your shoes while keeping them snug and secure. Never tie or untie your shoes again!  Get rid of the bows and customize your footwear.\nMETICULOUS DESIGN.  We have considered every detail in the product design process to make HICKIES fashion-forward, comfortable and durable.  We have scoured and tested all the materials available on the market to bring you the perfect solution for your shoes, both in terms of function and fashion.\nSIMPLICITY IS THE KEY.  Fasten your HICKIES once and never tie or untie your shoes again.\nSLIP INTO YOUR SHOES.  HICKIES turn any footwear into slip-ons, but keep them snug!  You can easily slip in and out of your shoes because of how flexible they are.\nMAKE YOUR SNEAKERS MORE COMFORTABLE.  Given their soft elasticity, HICKIES loosen and contract with your foot and adapt to the shape of your shoes.\nONE SIZE ONLY. HICKIES adjust to any shoe size, from kids to grown-ups. As long as your shoe has eyelets,  HICKIES will fit.  They are elastic so they stretch out as far as your feet need them to, and they have memory so they return to their original size.\n(*)Our current version of HICKIES is not recommended for infants under one year-old or wide \u201cskater\u2019s\u201d shoes; we are working on new versions of HICKIES for these outliers!\nLOTS OF COLORS!  HICKIES let you add more color to your shoes and create your own fashion, or bring new life to your old footwear.  We worked with one of the leading color experts in the world who helped us to choose the perfect colors and matches.\nWHY DID WE COME UP WITH HICKIES?\nWe hated tying our shoes and we never liked the shoelace bows in our kicks.  They break up the silhouette and lines of the footwear and they look funny.  Have you noticed that all sneaker advertising shows them without the bows?  Even in the stores.  It\u2019s because shoelace bows are not attractive.\nLaces are also every parent\u2019s nightmare and every athlete\u2019s hassle.\nHow many times have you found yourself trying to get your family out the door to get somewhere and your kids are fumbling with their shoelaces for so long you give up and tell them to just put on sandals?\nHow many times have you gone for a run and your laces come untied?\nWe felt that there had to be a better, more interesting solution. That is why we came up with HICKIES:  to free you from bows and knots, and to let you customize and redesign your footwear.\nWHO CAN USE HICKIES?\nAbsolutely everyone!  \nHOW DID WE COME UP WITH HICKIES?\nThey say that necessity is the mother of invention . . . Gaston came up with the idea way back in 2003.  He disliked the bow and the knot of the traditional shoelace and felt that there had to be a better way.  HICKIES appeared in his mind\u2019s eye as the solution: an elastic lacing system that connects each pair of eyelets fastening the kicks, and turning them into slip-ons without losing their grip plus it allows a constant customization of the shoe. Eureka!\nWorking on HICKIES was Gaston\u2019s passion for over seven years; the product you see here is the result of a long and meticulous process of innovation and research.  He worked with industrial designers, color experts and manufacturing engineers from all over the world, he undertook extensive materials testing and even wrote some of the patents.\nIn 2011, HICKIES co-founders Gaston and Mariquel got married and they realized that their jobs weren\u2019t their passion and were also keeping them apart from each other most of the day.  So they decided to take a leap of faith and pursue their dream by ditching their jobs and moving from Argentina to New York to launch HICKIES together.  And thus the story begins . . .\nWHY WE CALL THEM HICKIES\nWe named our company HICKIES, which is a cheeky term for a mark of affection.  We believe the world needs more \u201cmarks of affection\u201d, and we want to leave a mark of affection on your footwear.\nWHY DO WE NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE KICKSTARTER CROWD?\nWe already have a factory lined up to start production, so we need the final push.  By funding our project, you will be pre-ordering HICKIES and kickstarting our first production run of units.\nLet\u2019s launch HICKIES together, let\u2019s create a new way of loving our kicks.  All backers will be invited to provide us with real-time feedback on our company\u2019s footsteps, to help us build something inspired by you, from color picks to new product designs.  HICKIES needs you to become a reality.\nPLEDGE PICKS\nYou can choose more than one reward by adding up the total of the rewards you want and enter that as the pledge amount.

Do HICKIES work with all kinds of shoe eyelets?\nYes, HICKIES work with all sizes of traditional eyelets.  We have found that almost all shoe manufacturers make their shoes with the same distance between eyelets.\nd.    Do HICKIES have sizes?\nHICKIES are one size only.  Given their patented elasticity, they adapt to your foot and are super-comfortable.\ne.    I have skater-style sneakers.  Will HICKIES fit them?\nHICKIES will fit probably 98% of all shoe types.  HICKIES may work with your skater shoes, but they are designed to be most comfortable with traditional footwear.  We are working on a special edition for skater-style shoes.\nf.     Can I adjust the \u201cgrip\u201d of my HICKIES?\nHICKIES\u2019 elasticity is designed to provide the perfect level of \u201cgrip\u201d, keeping your footwear secure but not too tight. They loosen and contract with the movement of your foot and adapt to the shape of your shoes, so you don\u2019t need to worry about the grip.\ng.    Do I need to unfasten my HICKIES to take my sneakers off?\nNo, HICKIES turn your shoes into slip-ons, so after connecting them the first time, you will never have to unfasten them again.\nh.    Do I have to take the laces out of my sneakers to add HICKIES?\nYes!  HICKIES replace traditional laces.\ni.      What are HICKIES made of?\nHICKIES are made of a very advanced material that reflects the latest technology in engineered elastomers.\nj.     Do I have to use HICKIES in all my sneakers\u2019 eyelets?\nIt\u2019s up to you; you can use as many as you want, you can leave some eyelets free or even connect your HICKIES in an uneven arrangement.\nk.    How much do HICKIES stretch?\nHICKIES stretch up to two times their original length, and always go back.\nl.      Can I use HICKIES for sports?\nYes!  They are absolutely ideal for casual runners and marathoners who often have to do double knots to keep their laces from coming undone during a race. \nm.  Can I get my HICKIES wet?\nYes!  No problem.\nn.    Can I use HICKIES for other things?\nYes!  They can be used in a lot of fun ways.  You can also use them as bracelets (connecting two or more), as a keychain, zipper pullers, or whatever else you can think of.\no.    Do you have a patent for HICKIES?\nYes, we value the many years of thought that has gone into this product and so we have protected HICKIES (and all its variations) with worldwide patents.\np.    Do they fit in children\u2019s shoes?\nYes!  Kids love the color combinations of HICKIES.  We recommend them for one year-old or older.\nq.       Are HICKIES recyclable?\nYes!  We encourage you to recycle them.\nr.     I\u2019m an international backer.  Can you deliver to my country?\nYes!

If you have a smartphone, your headphones probably have a mic, so this is really important. Other winders that are available typically will not accommodate mics.\nIt is also important that a winder easily detaches from your cords, especially headphones, since having a winder attached to headphones while listening to your music adds significant weight and bulk, and puts that weight directly on your ears, and is likely to pull your headphones out of your ears.\nThe Recoil Winder can also be left permanently on your cords, which is best for chargers, since only rarely do you need the full length of cable to make it from the power outlet to your phone or camera. Best, if you only need a little bit of length, just pull out the length of cord that you need, and leave the rest on the winder.\nThe Recoil Winder System is made complete by The Rack, which makes it possible to snap a set of 3 winders into one small unit. This makes keeping your cords organized and accessible easier than ever, and keeps your most important cords together at your desk or while traveling.\nNo more tangled phone chargers, USB cords, camera chargers or headphones.  No more searching for the right charging cord or forgetting which cord belongs to which device. And no more tangled messes.\nOur personal electronics are supposed to make our life easier, but the cords that go along with those electronics have been tangling our lives long enough.\nTangled cords are the Problem.

We hope you enjoy TidyTilt!\nMeet TidyTilt.\nTidyTilt is an earbud cord wrap, multi-position kickstand, and mount for iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. TidyTilt takes up less space than any one of these devices - yet does all three things - without adding something extra to carry.\nTidies\nWrap your earbud cords without skipping a beat. TidyTilt is always at hand, since it lives on the back of your iPhone. When you're done using your earbuds, simply wrap them over your iPhone, snap TidyTilt closed, and pop your earbuds right off. TidyTilt keeps your cords neat and secure, whether in a bag, pocket, or attached to your iPhone.\nTiltsTidyTilt serves as a stand for iPhone, enabling landscape and portrait orientation at multiple angles - perfect for watching movies, typing, or making video calls. It even does so while simultaneously keeping your earbuds secured. Gaming with a friend? Position Tidytilt at the center of iPhone for a new seesaw-like head-to-head gaming experience.\nMountsThanks to TidyTilt's strong, strategically-placed magnets, you can tack your earbuds or whole iPhone to any magnetically-responsive surface. Pop iPhone onto your fridge for referencing cooking recipes, stick it to a dry-erase board for brainstorming, or park it on the key-holder by your front door.\n\nA Design Based Upon Ethnographic User ResearchAfter researching how and where people use and store their headphones, we discovered several common workarounds that users regularly fall back on: wrapping the headset cord around iPhone (rendering the touchscreen unusable); coiling the wire around fingers and putting it in a bag or pocket (only to dig it out later fully tangled) or surrendering to the chaos, stuffing the wad of tangled earphone cords somewhere and hoping for the best.\nThese behaviors aren\u2019t ideal, but neither is carrying an extra doodad with you to wrap headphone cords around. We think TidyTilt untangles the headphone cord predicament whilst also serving as a handy kickstand and magnetic mount for iPhone.\n\nOur Prototyping ProcessWe built and tested dozens of prototypes before settling on TidyTilt\u2018s final design. Using rapid prototyping techniques such as laser cutting, we were able to quickly make modifications and test the impact of our changes.\n\nManufacturing TidyTiltWe have a manufacturer lined up and ready to begin production. They have provided us with the prototypes you see in the video. We\u2019ve been working closely to ensure TidyTilt will be a quality product that minimizes environmental impact (through efficient packaging, fewest shipping hops, etc).\n\nA Bit More About UsWe are two human-centered design students looking for funding to make our iPhone accessory a reality. We believe that TidyTilt can make iPhone users\u2019 everyday lives just a tiny bit easier. \nWe have the design and the drive, now we just need funding to bring TidyTilt to market. If we are successfully funded, we will be able to do a first production run of TidyTilt, including investing in the up-front machining and material costs. \nIn doing so, we hope to pursue our dream of creating solutions for the modern lifestyle, and establish our young design firm in the process. \n----------\nPatent Pending.\n\u00a9 TT Design Labs LLC\nApple & iPhone are registered trademarks of Apple, Inc and are not affiliated in any way with our product.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Exciting News!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "New Product: Case+Energy", "update_content": "Hello Everyone!\nWe\u2019re very excited to announce that TT Design Labs has been acquired by Logitech.\nWe weren\u2019t actively looking to sell TT Design Labs, and Logitech wasn\u2019t the first larger company to approach us.

If you\u2019re thinking about going back to school or about the possibility of self-taught learning, read this book first! Don\u2019t Go Back to School will help you figure out if you can do it on your own\u2014and it\u2019ll show you how. It might just save you a gazillion dollars in tuition fees, and spare you the yoke of student loans for years to come.\nIn Don\u2019t Go Back to School, I\u2019ll deconstruct the basic infrastructure that school provides\u2014things like resources, expertise, evaluation, and a learning community. And I\u2019ll profile fascinating, self-taught people, showcasing the practical ways they meet those needs. I\u2019ve already talked to people like Cory Doctorow about learning to be a working writer, Dan Sinker about learning to code, Quinn Norton about learning neurology and psychology as a science writer, and a dozen others so far, with many more interviews planned.\nThe passionate learners in this book have taught themselves subjects like programming, history, writing, design, art, engineering, business, languages, philosophy, and many other skills, trades, and disciplines. They\u2019ll tell you what they know about learning and show you how they\u2019ve done it. Their stories will paint a picture of what learning without school is like, so you can figure out if it\u2019s right for you. And they\u2019ll give you the spark you need to get started and stick with it.\nI\u2019m also planning to include information on the new wave of collaborative education facilitators like Skillshare, and a set of guidelines from HR professionals about representing your self-taught skills or knowledge when trying to get a job.\nWhy I'm the best possible person to write this book\nAs a grad school dropout and a teacher at a grad program, people ask me all the time about whether or not they should head back to school. Most of them  don\u2019t really need to. What I see is that they really want to indulge a passionate curiosity to learn. To master something new, to challenge their minds, to play with new ideas, to feel driven and inspired and absorbed. Going to school isn\u2019t the only way to do those things.\nUnless you want a job that can\u2019t be had without a specialized degree (like pharmacist or public school teacher), and, unless it\u2019s free, I usually advise people not to go. But the idea of learning independently can be daunting, so I started writing down my own strategies and interviewing friends who learn on their own, asking them how they do it. In my research, I've found that people who learn stuff independently develop strategies and infrastructure to give them some of the necessary things that they\u2019d get from a school setting. I want to be able to share that learning framework so that more people can figure out how to do it on their own.\nAs I talked with folks about what I was working on, I got so much enthusiasm and excitement for the idea; it became clear this needed to be a larger, published project.\nHere's where you come in\nThe money I raise will go to supporting my work interviewing and writing, paying for transcription, book design, proofreading, printing the books, and postage to send them to backers. I\u2019ve already started the interviews and research, and completing it should take about three more months plus time to get the book printed.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with it, Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing model; if I don\u2019t reach my goal by the end of the fundraiser, your account will not be charged for your pledge.\nAll copies of the book printed for Kickstarter backers will be numbered and signed!\nAre you self-taught or a school dropout?\nI'd love to hear your story and get your feedback and suggestions on this project. Please post your thoughts in the comments or get in touch with me directly!\nThanks for checking this out.

Comprised of two twist-to-lock suction cups and one ball joint, this device's unique design allows for superior suction and durability. The Twist-to-Lock suction cups can hold devices for weeks at a time rather than simply a few hours like other competing mounts.  Additionally, the \"Patent Pending\" universal design allows for users to mount their phone without removing the case. \n                        Twist-to-Lock Suction Cups\nThe two Twist-to-Lock suction cups are what make the MobileMount unique. The suction cups squeeze out the majority of the air when they are in the locked position. This creates a very strong vacuum between the suction cup and the device being mounted.  Due to the Twist-to-Lock suction cups, the MobileMount is more reliable when compared to other double suction cup mounts.  \n                               Ball & Joint\nThe ball and joint allow for free horizontal and vertical rotation, which allows you to angle your device according to your needs. This makes the MobileMount great for driving when you're using a GPS or hands-free calling.  \n                 Kickstand & Tablet Compatible\nThe MobileMount can even be used as a kickstand with heavier devices like tablets and e-readers.

If you're in the area come by and say hi.  -Jim\nRSVP using this link: http://startedinseattle.eventbrite.com/\nAn Evening With Seattle's Hottest Kickstarter Projects "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "Look what I found at Best Buy the other day.", "update_content": "I finally had a chance this weekend to run over to BestBuy and see PadPivot on the shelf. A year ago this time PadPivot was just a prototype without any clear plan on how to fund or share with the world.  It's been an incredible journey to get here and while I smile at seeing our little friend up there on the shelf, I can't help remembering all the connections we made along the way.  The pinnacle of this journey has and will remain the support and validation you gave us here on KickStarter.  Thanks again!!

So feel free to tell your friends you want your PadPivot back and they can now get their own at http://bbyurl.us/padpivot \nYou and your friends can check out the Rocketfish video on YouTube.  Not quite as fun as our video but pretty cool to see anyway.  You all made the PadPivot a wonderful KickStarter success story.  Thanks so very much!  - Bernie & Jim"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "CableKeeps - 60% funded, 16 days left!", "update_content": "We're down to 2 weeks before your chance to grab a CableKeep\u2122 is over.  If you haven't made a pledge yet, be sure to get on over and secure yours before funding is over.

I just posted up a new project on KickStarter.  It's been my plan all along to do something entirely different after PadPivot and I think we've accomplished that.  CableKeeps are delightful and simple.  They add flair and functionality to your iPad, iPhone, or iPod charger and cable.  Made locally in Woodinville, WA and easily recycled.  \nOur plan is to continue with more products with similar goals as part of a larger brand we're launching called \"Nice\".  I hope you join me again in support of independent design and local manufacturing.  Lets get this thing Kickstarted!!

It's great to see everyone so pleased with the final result.  \nHere are a couple videos to better clarify how to get your PadPivot folded and unfolded along with a video of the strap adjustment.  \nEnjoy and thanks!  More great stuff to come."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Thanks for the praise + Instructional Videos", "update_content": "PadPivot rewards for the $25, $35, $49, $70, & $125 Backer Levels started shipping out today from Los Angeles.
