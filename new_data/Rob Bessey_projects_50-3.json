Most of the content from the regular hardcover edition is included in this alternate format \u2013 including all rules, races, and classes, and monsters \u2013 using a slightly smaller font size and fewer illustrations. Chapter 12 (plus two brief designer note appendicies) from the regular edition, which provides player and DM guidance, has been omitted to keep the page count (and thus cost) lower.

The 24-page folio includes: a deluxe character sheet with expanded areas for abilities and descriptions; sections for detailing your character\u2019s features, talents, weapons, flaws, spells, items, companions, vehicles, treasure, dice situations, background, family, goals, and personality; and journal pages on which you can record your character\u2019s profile, inner thoughts, group dynamics, secrets learned during each session, and other important game notes. The bonus free PDF version included with the print edition includes fillable text entries as well.\nYou can customise your Anime 5E Kickstarter pledge to your exact specifications by selecting the reward level that most closely matches what you want to receive, and then selecting additional add-ons from the pop-up list of options presented with your pledge level. For example, to add the $25 Anime 5E RPG Pocket Edition to your $50 Gamer Pledge, simply choose the Gamer level and then click the add button for the Pocket Edition. It's that easy! And of course, add-on funds unrelated to shipping count towards qualifying stretch goal pledges as well (so a $50 Gamer Pledge + two $25 Pocket Edition add ons counts as a $100 pledge for stretch goal qualifications). \nIf necessary, you'll later identify any additional funds added to your campaign once we send you the link to our BackerKit survey in April a couple of weeks after the Kickstarter has ended. Note that adding on extra items to your pledge may increase your shipping costs, as indicated in the section below.\nAll funds that you add on NOW during the Kickstarter will contribute towards the campaign's stretch goals \u2013 but not add-ons made after the campaign ends during the BackerKit! \u2013 so be sure you top up your pledge TODAY to create the right package of products for you instead of waiting.\nYou'll get exclusive early access to the digital PDFs in your pledge level when the physical books are sent to press in May 2021.

If you have questions about these shipping fees, please email info@dyskami.ca.\nShipping costs are included in the table below based on the provided pledge levels. Add-ons with your pledge may increase your shipping costs, as indicated in the chart. Of course, shipping cost do not count towards qualify pledge amounts for stretch goal considerations (for example, a stretch goal requiring a $100 qualifying pledge cannot include shipping costs in the amount needed to reach $100).\nPlease note that physical rewards for this Kickstarter are unavailable to ship to the following countries: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nThere are many excellent reason to make a pledge during this Kickstarter campaign, and we want to make the decision easy for you.\nEvery pledge for physical book copies also comes with FREE copies of their PDFs from DriveThruRPG as well, which are delivered promptly in May after the Kickstarter ends and you finalise your pledge \u2013 and that adds up to a huge savings!\nSince PDFs of the new releases won't be made available on DriveThruRPG until June/July \u2013 and you'll receive your files in May \u2013 you'll get a month of exclusive early access to the PDFs for your pledge!\nFor physical books, we ship to our Kickstarter backers as soon as the freight arrives in our warehouse \u2013 well before the distribution chain receives their copies.

This pledge locks in your store's access to all physical product available in the Kickstarter, including all add-ons. No further payment is due at this time. We will reach out and work you with you to complete your order in May, so your store will gain early access to the products and stretch goals before they are available through distribution.

Consequently, with our extensive planning and management protocols in place, we believe that the risks and challenges are minimal for this project. Unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic restrictions may result in some delay, though we hope that worldwide vaccination initiatives help control this unpredictable element.\n\nAs always, our goal is to ensure our Kickstarter backers are the first to receive their pledged game rewards. We will post campaign updates regularly from the end of the Kickstarter until we have fulfilled your pledges. After the campaign, we offer a no-questions-asked refund on your pledge (minus the non-refundable Kickstarter and payment processing fees that we cannot recover) until we have closed our BackerKit.

Your mercenaries will be able to pick up tickets that will see them engage in counterinsurgencies, strike operations, train resistance fighters in the wilds, police unruly populations, and take on the heaviest warfighting jobs available.\nEverything is provided in the set for you to do this, from the initial creation of the mercenary unit to the building of tickets for your Travellers to attempt, with specialised units and equipment enhance a unit's capabilities, and enough adventuring material to kickstart any new campaign.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Mercenary set will initially contain three books in a box set, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks and adventures to expand the mercenary experience, covering new tickets, equipment and rival units.\nBook 1: Mercenaries in the Far Future\nBook 2: Running a Mercenary Force\nBook 3: In the Field\nWipeable Unit Roster Card\nThe writing for the Mercenary box set is complete and you can download the first book included in the set, Mercenaries in the Far Future, right HERE.\n\nMercenaries in the Far Future: A full guide on using mercenary units in Traveller, detailing how they operate and fight across a range of environments and Tech Levels, along with rules on how to resolve missions and related incidents in the life of mercenaries. It also deals with larger-scale conflicts and how the focus can shift from a high-level picture of a theatre of war to a crisis point involving a handful of mercenaries. In short, this volume is all about what an existing mercenary unit does.\nRunning a Mercenary Force: This book shows you how a mercenary force is recruited, maintained, expanded and subdivided if necessary. Four key resources are necessary to this process: Personnel, Credits, Materiel and Influence.\nIn the Field: The tickets presented in this volume are intended for use in any Traveller campaign, and are independent of Charted Space and the Third Imperium universe. Some are standalone incidents which can be placed in any suitable location, whilst others form part of a wider conflict or confrontation. In addition to the tickets presented here these situations provide a backdrop for further mercenary operations and adventures.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe Mercenary box set brings a new style of campaign to Traveller and contains all the core rules needed to make warfighting a way of life for your group. However, there is no one set way to build a new mercenary unit and each is as unique as the group of Travellers behind it. Clearly, there is an immense amount of ground that can be covered, from new 'toys' to equip your soldiers with to specialist mercenary units and fully fleshed out tickets to kick your campaigns off. Kickstarter gives us the very best opportunity to explore these avenues while constantly getting your feedback on how to present them.\n\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels (Virtual Mercenary, Mercenary Soldier, Mercenary Officer) in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Mercenary in your hands.\nThe Field Commander's Pack\nProspective recruits will be able to purchase a special orientation pack to get them grounded in mercenary life and on their way to earning a fortune - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Mercenary Officer level!\nIn the Field Commander's Pack, you will find:\nA pad of blank Mercenary Unit Roster sheets, ready for your new unit\nSix Mercenary pencils, perfect for your Travellers\nOne Mercenary Officer's pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Enemy Vehicle Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the most dangerous vehicles you are likely to meet on the battlefield - and should be on your unit's shopping list\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Mercenary dice\nThe Premium Weapons Guide, a 16 page addition to the Field Catalogue featuring items made available only to the finest of mercenary units\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have lots planned for your Mercenary campaign and, with your kind help and support, we hope we can give you a lot more bang for your pledge!\n\n\n\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is growing quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Mercenary to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level.

Explore a fantastic world rebuilding itself after an apocalypse as it marches onward with its industrial revolution.\nThe Iron Kingdoms possess a rich history\u2014and a tumultuous future\u2014full of unique monsters, deities, heroes, and villains.\nMore than a thousand years ago, the land that is now called the Iron Kingdoms was western Immoren, a mire of warring human city-states. Then came the Orgoth, conquest-driven imperialists from beyond the sea who laid low the cities of man with forbidden magic and changed the face of western Immoren forever. The Orgoth Empire occupied the land for six hundred years before the people of Immoren banded together to defeat the invaders and drive them back across the sea from whence they came. While the rebel armies kept the peace, their leaders convened in a city called Corvis. This Council of Ten drafted the Corvis Treaties after weeks of furious debate, and the Iron Kingdoms were born.\nStrictly speaking, the term \u201cIron Kingdoms\u201d refers to the lands of humanity, those five kingdoms that signed the Corvis Treaties: Cygnar, Khador, Llael, Ord, and the Protectorate of Menoth. Other nations of western Immoren are commonly included in that description, although they took no part in the treaties. In the frigid north is the dwarven kingdom of Rhul. To the northeast lies the mysterious homeland of the elves, Ios. The last kingdom informally included when speaking of the \u201cIron Kingdoms\u201d is the hostile island nation of Cryx, ruled over by Lord Toruk, the Dragonfather. All these nations\u2014and many more\u2014share the continent of Immoren.\nThe Orgoth were driven from western Immoren more than four hundred years ago, but the decisions made during the rebellion still echo through the world. There are many strange legends from the last days of that war\u2014tales of dark, mysterious allies who helped drive off the invaders. Some say it would have been impossible to defeat the Orgoth without this help, that the rebel leaders had to make dangerous deals with infernal powers. These tales have proven true, and the Iron Kingdoms have recently been irrevocably changed by the Claiming, an attempt by these infernal creatures to take the payment they have long been owed\u2014an unfathomable number of souls.\n Full.

Iron Kingdoms: Requiem combines this fantastic setting with the newest edition of the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game.\nInside this book you\u2019ll find the history of the Iron Kingdoms and information describing the current state of the world following the Claiming. Alongside these chapters is an extensive gazetteer providing detailed information on the most notable of the world\u2019s unique and fascinating locations.\nWhen making a character, you\u2019ll be able to choose from many of the familiar countries and cultures of the setting. Whether you want to be a human, gobber, trollkin, Rhulic dwarf, ogrun, Iosan, or Nyss elf, this book provides all the rules that make these different peoples unique. When choosing a class, there are options for many you\u2019re already familiar with, from the stalwart man-at-arms fighter to the free-flowing monk of the Order of the Fist. Beyond these are brand new rules for playing the characters that make the Iron Kingdoms such a memorable setting. These new classes include, among others, gun mages, arcane mechanics, combat alchemists, and warcasters.\nAlongside these options are new feats, spells, and backgrounds to make your characters feel even more a part of the world of the Iron Kingdoms.\nFinally, within the pages of Iron Kingdoms: Requiem are extensive rules for the arcane technologies of the setting. These rules cover subjects from firearms and mechanika, like the galvanic arms and armor of the storm knight, to the mighty warjacks that accompany warcasters into battle.\n\"Before the Iron Kingdoms became a land dominated by industry and machines, it was the monsters that defined it.\"\n\u2014 Professor Viktor Pendrake, author of the Monsternomicon \nIn the Iron Kingdoms peril lurks at every turn, as fearsome and terrifying creatures both great and small look to turn unwary adventurers into their next meal or enslave them beyond death. From ferocious packs of ravenous burrow-mawgs to deadly ethereal pistol wraiths that haunt the back roads and forgotten cemeteries, and the fiendish Infernals that still stalk the shadows, the Monsternomicon is filled with creatures both mundane and supernatural to challenge even the most experienced adventuring parties.\nThis legendary tome includes over 80 monsters, new and old, steeped in over 20 years of worldbuilding, now appearing for the first time with 5th Edition rules.\nClick to go to the Update featuring these two preview pages.\nDiscover the origins of the legend that started it all...\nTwenty-one years ago, the Iron Kingdoms was introduced through an acclaimed series of adventures known as The Witchfire Trilogy. Now, the legend continues in the newest edition of the Iron Kingdoms RPG, written for 5e.\nA girl, a sword, and a secret...\nAs a child, she lost everything when her mother was wrongfully executed for witchcraft and her soul was consumed by the most ancient of all weapons, the black blade known as the Witchfire. Hellbent to spare her mother an eternity of torture, Alexia Ciannor stole the accursed sword and set out to unlock its dark secrets. With the voices of the Witchfire's imprisoned souls raging in her mind, Alexia would eventually unlock the power of the Infernal artifact and command an army of undead to vanquish the villains seeking to use the sword to once again subjugate the Iron Kingdoms.\nNearly two decades later, the veteran of countless wars, Alexia returns to Corvis, the City of Ghosts, in search of help from the malignant forces that seek the return of the coveted sword.

In fact, we have so many that we wouldn't have enough space on this page to feature them all. Instead, we're going to curate a selection of miniatures relevant to Iron Kingdoms Requiem, which we'll make available in the post-campaign pledge manager with special Backer-only pricing. Watch for a forthcoming update soon that will list all of the miniatures that we'll be featuring in the line, and let us know if we missed one that you think should be included.\n\nSHIPPING \nThe European Union, UK, U.S.A., Canada, and Australia will be \u201cShipping Friendly.\u201d Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter has completed based on actual costs to ship the rewards. We will collect your shipping information through our pledge manager once the campaign ends.\nBelow is a list of rough estimates to ship the PAPER GM PLEDGE. Depending on your reward, shipping costs may go up or down. Multiple books will cost more, a single book will cost less.\nIn an effort to keep shipping costs as low as possible, domestic U.S. rewards will be split into two shipments with the books shipping via USPS media mail and any other rewards going in a second shipment at approximately the same time.\nThese estimates are based on current shipping rates and the fulfillment fees of our regional fulfillment service partners. We will do everything in our power to keep shipping costs as low as possible, but costs could vary at the time shipping is charged.\nAs a matter of policy, we do not ship to P.O. boxes, but contact us directly if this presents a difficulty for you.\n(All shipping cost estimates below in U.S. dollars.)\nUnited States - $10+\nCanada - $15+\nAustralia - $20+\nUnited Kingdom - $17+\nEU - $22+\nAsia - $25+\nREST OF WORLD - $70+\nREFUND POLICY\nOur refund policy aims to be as simple as possible\u2014no questions asked. But there are some things you need to know.\nAny pledge can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the Kickstarter campaign has come to a close.\nFor refund requests made more than 14 days after the Kickstarter, we will only be able to refund 85% of the pledged amount. The 15% that cannot be refunded are the irrecoverable fees collected by Kickstarter, our credit card processing company, and our pledge manager for processing your order.\nDuring the course of our production of your rewards, we will make updates announcing pending shipping dates. Once we have begun packing and shipping orders, we will no longer be able to process refund requests.\nIf for any reason we are unable to deliver any part of your order, we will refund the pledged amount for this item in full, regardless of the date.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge and agree to the following:\nThe rewards being created for this project are a \u201cwork-in-progress,\u201d and the appearance, content, and materials of the rewards shipped are subject to change and may differ from what is shown or described during the Kickstarter project.\nYou are obligated to finalize your pledge and pay any shipping fees due by the closing date of the pledge manager. If you do not, then you may not receive your rewards by the expected delivery date, nor will you be entitled to a refund. We may, at our discretion and at the availability of the rewards, ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nOnce you have confirmed your pledge in the pledge manager, our obligation is to ship your order as you have entered into the pledge manager system.

Through our Kickstarter experience, we have learned a number of lessons, most important of all that allowing \u201cscope creep\u201d to occur over the course of the campaign leads to extended timelines and threatens the expected delivery dates. For Iron Kingdoms: Requiem, timely delivery of the rewards is absolutely essential for our planned release schedule, and as such, we will not waver from the goals of the project we have presented, nor can we add to what we have planned to deliver. \n\nOur very first product was a d20 OGL adventure, published 21 years ago. We've been making award-winning products ever since, with new products releasing every month for over two decades. We are experienced publishers with a history of timely delivery.\n\nWith that said, stuff happens. No one has escaped being affected by the COVID-19 and there's no way to tell yet how the coming year will unfold. But we have built in allowances for potential delays in our schedule, and we are prepared to do whatever we need to in order to deliver your rewards as close to our expected dates as possible. \n\nBeyond unexpected cosmic forces, our biggest risk is in working with outside vendors where issues beyond our control can occur. However, the vendor we are working with to produce all of Iron Kingdoms: Requiem rewards is someone we have a long history with and who has delivered top-quality products reliably for us for many years. It is always possible a ship breaks or something gets stuck in Customs, though, and this can cause delays. And we are all bracing for what lies ahead in the coming months with the coronavirus, which, of course, caused delays for countless products in production last year. But we will be in close contact with our vendor and we will always keep you updated if any delays occur, with as much notice as possible. \n\nBecause we have endured a variety of setbacks due to external events as well as internal issues, we know there is always a risk of hitting the expected deadline. But in the end, we have always delivered close to our anticipated dates, so our largest risk is simply the delivery timing. After making sure we get you the best quality product and game experience, an on-time delivery is our highest priority and is, in our minds, essential to the success of this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "RETAILER RESERVATION", "descp": "Get your customers into the world of the Iron Kingdoms with this special reservation of the retailer bundle!\nYou will receive 3 copies of all 3 books, as well as PDFs, and 3 GM screens!

These cards provide keywords to spark your imagination and example phrases for their use. Written by novelists and organized by dungeon-masters, the cards are designed for quick on-the-fly use and inherently add randomization. The list of monster parts uniquely depicted include, but are not limited to, the following:\n Horns\n   Teeth\n   Claws\n   Protrusions\n   Bodily Forms (Hides, Ears, Eyes, etc.)\n   Tails\n   Wings\n   Tentacles \nBetween great heroes and great monsters lies the pinnacle of drama \u2014 Combat. The unrelenting tension that comes with knowing blood will be spilled, and life may be lost. Monster Description Cards will guide you while you detail these moments, providing keywords and examples for horns that PIERCE, claws that SLASH, tails that BLUDGEON, and more. Hundreds of new ways to describe monster strikes in these familiar categories: \nSlashing\nPiercing\nBlunt\n\nWhat happens when a monster is cornered, heavily injured, or both? What if the creature is smart enough to be deceitful, spiteful, or vindictive in its last moments? How can you subtly share that your monster is on its last legs, but there is still a worrisome hint of malice in their eyes? These questions are all answered by the LAST STAND section of the cards. Where examples help illustrate the response of creatures facing overwhelming odds and perhaps displaying heroism, sacrifice, or wickedness of their own.\n\n\n \u201cWRITERS OF ALL LEVELS LOVE THE IMPACTFUL NARRATIVE EXPERIENCES DESCRIPTION CARDS ADD TO THEIR WORKS\u201d \nThere are common composition principles that ask writers to \"show and not tell .\" That is, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's summarization and cliches. The Monster Description Cards reinforces this principle by providing keywords to spark the imagination and elegant examples chock-full of distinctive story-building concepts.\n\"Cliche Busting Cards\"\nThere are three cliche busting writer's tools within the Monster Description Cards.\n\n 1. Above all else, the \"core descriptions\" provide brilliant creature concepts. They share unique ways to introduce or explain distinct physical features to an audience. These \"core descriptions\" allow writers to stay far away from monsters, terms, phrases, or even ideas that are now unoriginal and thoroughly overused.\n   2. The second tool in the deck is the Combat Sections. These areas focus on drawing an audience into the sheer violence of monstrous combat, exploring unsettling concepts like great height and length, great strength, even preternatural abilities. They touch on the tension that lingers with the threat of a hero's death. These cards collect these concepts and inherently randomize them for writers to literally draw inspiration.\n   3. The LAST STAND is a fresh and new idea for our card tools. Whether you write horror, sci-fi, or fantasy fiction, your creatures and oddities will need to be compelling and memorable, particularly in their last moments. The LAST STAND helps by offering depictions of your monstrosities on the verge of defeat while adding a bit of doubt in the reader's mind with one last defiant moment.\n  AS A STORYTELLER, HAVING A MEMORABLE ANTAGONIST IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO SUCCESS. SO JOIN US! WE BELIEVE YOU WILL LOVE THESE CARDS.\nFor GameMasters (In-game Play)\nThe cards will melt right into your game, and your players will think you are brilliant. They will provide idea after idea on improving monster encounters. But more importantly, they will also drive you to new, full-blown campaign ideas. The type of campaign that players will reminisce about for years to come. The Monster Description Cards archive these feats by offering up concepts over statistical modeled stat-blocks. The cards narrate one-of-a-kind characteristics that you can easily add to existing monsters, creatures, or oddities. \n\nIntroduce extraordinary creatures to your players, giving them clear signs of why they might be unique, even among their kin. \n\nImprove combat by focusing on the right adjectives associated with the body part landing the blow, such as claws, tails, or fangs. Not only are there specific narrations for specific body parts, but they are also broken down by blunt strikes, slashing strikes, and piercing strikes. With these multiple combinations, you can keep your combat fresh game after game. \n\nLastly, there are always moments in the game where a GM would like to subtly provide hope to their players by indicating the monster is nearing defeat. These epic final moments are depicted in the LAST STAND sections of the Monster Description Cards.\nWriting advice on worldbuilding typically leads towards lists of 'rules' and 'tips' which are either too general to be useful or downright wrong. The Monster Description Cards instead provide concepts and implementations of ideas capable of driving your imagination to discoveries about the world you want to create. Alongside the Magic Description Cards, the Monster Description Cards can immerse you in creative ideas and concepts that are anything but clich\u00e9.\n\nIF YOU'RE A GM, THIS IS AN EASY BUY, BUY, BUY DECISION.\n\nFamiliars and Animal Companions: Your Familiars and Animal Companions are cool as hell. Let me make them sound cool as hell. Select a few cards that match the combat style of your familiar or animal companion and hand them to the Gamemaster to describe their attacks with style. Critical hits made by your Familiars or Animal Companion should be magnificent, and these cards provide that strike description that can be so satisfying. You can even have a LAST STAND card ready for your Familiars or Animal Companion just if things come down to that. Moreover, the cards' descriptions can be the basis of the unique features that make your Familiar or Animal Companion distinctively yours. So let\u2019s build something special with these cards.\n\nShapeshifting: In tabletop RPGs, there are thousands of classes/powers/feats/spells that can shapeshift or grow body parts into lethal weapons. Thousands more transform hands to claws, teeth to fangs, arms to tentacles or growing tails, bony protrusions, even wings. Each of these wonderful transformations can benefit from the Monster Description Cards. The Cards will instantly make these transforms unique and unforgettable with clever depictions, separating your character's ability from the crowd of other characters with similar capabilities or sometimes the exact same class ability, power, feats, or spells.\n\nUsing the cards to depict transform spells: Using the Monster description cards to verbally illustrate the results of magical effects that modify a character's body is more than just a way to be unique; it's how you build a legacy. Stylize your character's abilities with these cards, so they are recognized by others, respected, or even feared.\n\nMonster Journal Entries: Commemorate the monsters you've encountered by inserting Monster Description Cards in your monster journal. Flip through cards of unique descriptions to depict the memorable battles along your character's journey. Each card is your personal trophy, a memento of your battle-scars from the most challenging encounters. You can even use these cards to log essential information about certain monsters in your campaign, making every entry a result of your character's meticulous observations during battle. Sing the song better than any bard could with these encounter-defining descriptions. \nBuild a strong visual library with the entire series of description cards from Conflict Games. The entire Description Cards line can be used as a database for ideas, concepts, events, environments, and fight scenes. Not only do these cards bring new ideas to concept art, but the combat styles and descriptions therein can help portray your creation in a way that works and sells a room on the idea.\n\nDuring the Concept art process, Game Design, and Film writing, an artist and designer often craft creative assets like anomalies, monsters, characters, and fight scenes that heavily influence the final work. Our Descriptions Cards have been used during this process for great success. If the goal is to provide realistically visualize ideas for VFX teams, animators, and modelers, then the Magic, Combat, and now Monster Description Cards can be an innovative way to help and become key part of your process.\nUnlike our previous description cards, these cards are double-sided and chock-full of goodness.\nBackers will receive: \n200+ Descriptions and introductions of various monster components\n  300+ Combat descriptions sorted by monster appendage\n  100+ \u201cLast Stand\u201d descriptions, for portraying monsters that are heavily damaged vengeful, desperate, or relentless\n  Printed on heavy card stock (350 gms)\n  Large Format Card (tarot sized cards)\n \nSize: 2.75'' x 4.75'' (70mm x 120mm)\n  Over 100 total cards, including stretch goals\nEach card is organized under the following general categories:\n Horns & Frills\u2014Horns are hard permanent outgrowths, often curved and pointed and typically found in pairs. Frills are upward-curving bony plates typically extending behind the skull.\n\n Fangs & Maws \u2014The Fangs category is considered the mouths, jaws, teeth, and maws of large, small, or odd creatures.\n   Claws & Pincers\u2014The claws category consists of pincers, paws, talons, and hooks. That is, any style of sharp, usually slender, and curved nail at the end of hands and feet.\n   Protrusions & Osteoderms\u2014This category consists of bony deposits that form knots above scales. Protrusions regularly produce sharp structures that can be used offensively, or widen scales and plates that add to the defenses of a monster.\n Bodily Forms\u2014Creature hides, eyes, noses, ears, or other physical oddities that might distinguish a creature from its nightmarish kin are the focus of this group.\n   Tails\u2014The hindmost part of a monster, such as the flexible extension of the backbone in a vertebrate. Tails can be used to whip, constrict, or trip an opponent.\n   Wings\u2014This category focuses on wings of all shapes and sizes, functional or non-functional: Elliptical wings, high-speed wings, long soaring wings, and more. For the cards combat backside, wings will batter with winds, slice with sharp edges, and stab with spiked ends for a unique description style.\n   Tentacles\u2014The tentacles cards help depict any elongated, boneless, flexible organs, limbs, antenna, or barbels of famed monsters.\nPotentially more to come with stretch goals, so please back and share this project.\n\nOne the backside of the cards are Combat Description for the associating Monster part. The cards are divided into three suits, which correspond to the three common attack types of Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing.\n \n\nWe understand that there are a multitude of genres, points-of-views, worlds, rulesets, and games that writers and tabletop gamers choose. That\u2019s why our writing philosophy dictates the following rules which will ensure our content is system-agnosit, narrative Neutral and friendly to writers at all levels of expertise:\n We don\u2019t describe the person perceiving the monster.\n   We don\u2019t give names to monsters.\n   We don\u2019t mention blood specifically, but generalizations like \u201cfluid\u201d are occasionally used .\n   We don\u2019t describe the surface the monster is on.\n   Nothing cheesy, corny, or racy will be accepted.\n   Both Heroes and Antagonists should be cool, so let\u2019s make them sound cool!\n  System Neutral: The card descriptions are not tied to any tabletop ruleset or Genre, meaning they can be used to describe monsters in any of your favorite tabletop-rpgs. If you run multiple games in multiple systems, these cards are great to use in any and all of your games.\nThe cards will help you answer question like these:\nIn a sea of zombies, what if you need one to stand out?\n  In a world of dragons what makes this dragon different? Special? Memorable?\nAnime is all about unique characters and ability, so why not use the cards to create singularity among a crowded field?\nREWARD SUMMARY\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an add-on to your Kickstarter pledge, follow these steps:\n1. Press the Manage Your Pledge Button. (If you have not pledged yet it will say Back this Project.) \n2. Increase your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.\n3. Do not change the tier you are currently pledged at, unless you also want to change it while you are on this screen. You will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you chose. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned, and customizations when applicable.\n\nVoice Overs in the App: As mentioned in this Backer Update, The app contains over 200 Voice overs performed by Classically Trained Voice Actors.  You can hear a few examples below.\nNote: Only the Monster Description Cards included \u2191\u2191\n\nAll Cards Included + Voice Overs\nVoice Over Examples:\n\n\n\nMany of the above add-ons are from Previous Kickstarters. You can use the links below to discover more information:\n Combat Description Cards Kickstarter... \n Magic Description Cards Kickstarter... \n Deckboxes Featuring Malay Folklore Kickstarter... \n\"Combat Description Cards\" Contain 120 cards\n\"Storyteller's Deck\" Contain  Contain 80 cards\n\"Magic Description Cards\" Contain  134 Cards\n\"Monster Description Cards\" will Contain 100+ cards (dictated by stretch goals)\nPlease Note for Add-ons: Shipping/handling is included for backers in the US up until a weight of 4 decks. Additional shipping cost will be required if the total weight of the package is above 4 decks.\nThese are targeted milestones for us to hit as a community. If we do hit these goals, each and every backer benefits! Here are a few, not all, of the initial stretch goals.\nUnlocked!\nA protective coating will be placed over each and every card to help guard them against spills, rough handling, and those who regularly have gooey fingers (you know who you are). Your investment will be much better protected with this card coating! We will also increase the density of the paper used in the cards from 250 to 350 gsm. What does that mean? An improvement to the density will increase the appearance of the printing and make the card stock even more substantial and harder to damage. That's right, this reward is both protective and appealing!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\n\nEmail Mark with any ideas\n\n\nWe've been especially fortunate to find some great partners with whom to collaborate. In December, we will finalize any product design changes as dedicated by stretch goals and backer feedback. Going into January, we will focus our writing and editing teams on completing the product content. The cards will be produced in China by mid-February. By the end of February, decks and accessories will go on freight to U.S. soil. We will prepare the orders, and the very first batch of deck boxes will be ready to ship to the priority shipping backers by the end of March. By the end of April, we will start to fulfill other orders with physical rewards to our domestic backers, then international backers. \nWe will share updates to the estimated schedule via the Kickstarter update page. Please stay tune in there for more information. \nPledge Manager\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to finalize their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection.  BackerKit is the world's most trusted post-crowdfunding platform and we are proud to have them aboard. \nShipping in the USA will be included. International shipping will be between $15 and $25 dollars based on the number of items in your order. If needed, additional shipping for add-ons will be charged via our pledge manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Please note these are only estimates. The final cost may increase, or decrease based on the total number of shipments and current postal prices at the time of shipping. Free Shipping in the USA is limited to one reward tier per backer. \nThis campaign will be US-Customs Friendly, CA-Customs Friendly, UK-Customs Friendly, EU-Customs Friendly, AU-Customs Friendly, and NZ-Customs Friendly. If you live in any of the regions listed and receive any additional charges for receiving your package, please send an email to support@conflictgames.com and include a copy of your customs receipt. We will then reimburse you via our Pledge manager (or PayPal).\n\nThank You For Helping Us Run An Amazing Campaign.\nWe're so happy to be here on Kickstarter, building and growing our community. This is our 5th kickstarter. We love the direct engagement with you, the backers, and the opportunity to build projects together and bring them to reality. To that end, we strictly adhere to the Kickstarter Community Guidelines. If you violate the Community Guidelines by being a jerk or spamming the campaign, we will refund in full and cancel your pledge, and you will not be eligible to receive any rewards from the campaign. We encourage open discussion, but we draw the line at abusive language and behavior. \nThank you to the vast majority of our backer community who are respectful and thank you in advance for helping us follow Kickstarter's Community Guidelines and maintain and grow a respectful community on this campaign and across Kickstarter.\nHelp us spread the word\nAfter you\u2019ve backed our campaign, help us spread the word by sharing our campaign page with your friends on Tictoc, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter!\n\nAre you a reporter, blogger, or vlogger?

Fortunately, this is our 5th Kickstarter under the Conflict Games LLC brand and we have consulted on over 20 others. The Monster Description Card Deck is a fairly straightforward product. However, the foreseen risks involved include shipping logistics and the unexpected cancellation of contracted artists, writers, editors or product manufacturers. In the case of contract cancellation, the contractor will need to be replaced. Which in turn, could delay the project's completion but shouldn\u2019t prevent its completion. \n\nIn regard to shipping, logistics could become burdensome. We are unable to control the fact that domestic and out-of-the-US shipping costs seem to be spiraling out of control. However with our target funding goal, we don't foresee this preventing the project from succeeding; although, it may impact delivery dates. \n\nThe one guarantee we can make is that we will be transparent with issues and communicate them to our backers as quickly as we can. We strongly believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the product. \n\nIf you're as excited about this card deck as we are, then help us exceed that goal - we have much more we wish to do for this card series. This is just the first step in an exciting journey so please JOIN US!\n\nPlease Note: The final design of the Monster Description Cards deck and stretch goals may vary as many of the graphics above are digitally produced. Examples of this include, rounded card corners vs squared corners and raised lettering vs flat ink on the final packaging.\n\n\nRequired Attribution Text\nThanks to:\nsolid platonic solids by Dank By Design from the Noun Project\nDeath by rayhan maulana rikzan from the Noun Project\nrating by Flatart from the Noun Project\ndigital by Eucalyp from the Noun Project\nstretch by KEN MURRAY from the Noun Project\nShipping by Gregor Cresnar from the Noun Project\nbooks by Yeong Rong Kim from the Noun Project\nD20 by Lonnie Tapscott from the Noun Project\nCards by Henry Ryder from the Noun Project\ntwo by Laura Reeny from the Noun Project\nfall by Rendra Tri Kusuma from the Noun Project\nUnicorn by Lazar Nikolic from the Noun Project\nStory by Lars Meiertoberens from the Noun Project\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you kind Sir or Madam!", "descp": "You will receive project updates & Mark M.

However, some of the best descriptions are longer than others. This may be a problem for physical cards, but not for the digital products. Therefore, we will be doing another round of selection to ensure only the cream of the crop gets printed. At the same time, we did not want to shortchange you guys on the creative efforts because of trivial physical limitations. Therefore, we have also decided that all 880 descriptions will be published on the Digital products (i.e., API, app, and writer's grid). The physical cards are my favorite, but there is an advantage to digital. With the bulk of the writing work completed, we are now moving on to the project's subsequent two phases.

We are still writing and editing the Monster Description Cards content.  This part of the process should have been completed about 30-40 days ago. However, I have been extraordinarily particular about the descriptions that make the final cut. For that reason, our writing room has created a ton of descriptions, and to guarantee high-quality creativity, we also have many rejections, edits, and rewrites. Each of these steps has gone slower than I anticipated.  I may add writers to the project, but I believe the best solution to the delay is to simply keep writing.

The sad majesty and woeful glory of a tormented goddess, the divine terror and eternal anguish of the departed, mere phantasms of their former conscience... all brought to life by a sculpture devised to match the style and the strength of neoclassical statues as never dared before.\nAs a surprise for the campaign launch, Progenitor God Izanagi has arrived! Izanami's husband and brother has manifested in all his mighty, progenitor of the new generation of gods and ordainer of the universe.\nThe aim of this kickstarter is to produce a limited collector's run called the Fukashi Sekai Run \u4e0d\u53ef\u8996\u4e16\u754c. All models forming part of the Fukashi Sekai Run will be numbered and signed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe models are designed to be incredibly detailed and we are pushing our efforts to bring every detail to the highest point of clarity that is humanly possible!\nDeath Goddess Izanami has been 3D printed by one of the best artisans in the EU in high quality resin to ensure it can be cast smoothly and in great detail.\n*Mana photo depicts a 1:10 example to show what can be done with the STL file. The resin model you can gain as reward for backing is in 54mm scale.\n\nDeath Goddess Izanami is part of the Sankokushin: Five Sacrifices project, the upcoming board game developed by Axis Mundi Games. Death Goddess Izanami campaign inaugurates the Sankokushin resin line, named Fukashi Sekai \u4e0d\u53ef\u8996\u4e16\u754c (Invisible World), that we intend to develop for years to come with more and more models.\nSankokushin: Five Sacrifices is a solo-cooperative campaign game set in a fictional version of medieval Japan planned for Kickstarter in 2021.\n Can the Death Goddess - Izanami/Progenitor God Izanagi model be used in the actual game?\n                                                 Yes.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady? Let\u2019s Go!\nClick for a PDF of this graph!\nWondering what\u2019s involved in all those delicious bullet-points on that reward tier you\u2019ve been flirting with? Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. We would be happy to add your location as well! \nPlease contact us at feedback@evilhat.com if it looks like your destination is not yet covered, and we'll add it as an option as soon as we confirm the shipping rate for that country/region.\nIf you end up ordering multiple books for international shipment, we will bill an additional $5 per additional item in BackerKit well after the campaign is done.\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or ze/zir) writes queer games about feelings, vulnerability, and caring for one another.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively.

When disaster strikes or menace looms, they don\u2019t run from the danger, they run toward it. Whether they claim supernatural abilities or just plain courage, there's a single word that describes such people:\nIn a world that could use a few heroes now more than ever, you can now join their ranks\u2014using the flexible TTRPG mechanics of the Cypher System.\nImagine, for a moment, that you find yourself imbued with powers well beyond those of mere mortals. With great might, you leap into dark and daunting dangers. You stand before the forces of injustice with confidence. You slip the grasp of gravity and soar. You Claim the Sky itself.\nBut what about on the other end of the scale, where we\u2019re all a bit more earth-bound? We can still be heroes. Saving lives amid natural disasters, man-made cataclysms, pandemics, or crises of any sort, we can take on the role of First Responders.\nThese two new Cypher System sourcebooks focus on heroes of all kinds!\nClaim the Sky continues the series of genre-focused books that includes The Stars Are Fire (science-fiction), Stay Alive! (horror), We Are All Mad Here (fairy tales), and Godforsaken (fantasy). Each of those titles dives deep, exploring different aspects and variations of its genre and offering new rules, character creation ideas, equipment, creatures, cyphers, and other elements for making the most of the topic.\nIn this case, of course, the topic is superheroes. Whether your love is comic book superheroes or the blockbuster films of recent years, Claim the Sky will give you step-by-step guidelines for recreating all your favorite characters, building your own heroes from scratch, and sending them out into fun, fast-paced RPG adventures and campaigns.\nBut there\u2019s more. Like the books that came before it, Claim the Sky presents a fully realized, ready-to-use superhero setting: Boundless. In the world of Boundless, your player characters can join the ranks of well-established heroes and face titanic foes: invading alien creatures, horrors from other dimensions, supervillains using their powers for selfish or destructive ends. This setting is like our own world, but superpowers have existed for generations, and the world has adapted accordingly (in sometimes surprising ways!). If you\u2019re looking for a setting with the feel of movies or comics, Boundless will take you there!\nFirst Responders looks at heroism from a different angle. This is a world where the heroes' powers aren't supernatural: our world, where courage, wits, experience, and grit are the tools by which our heroes overcome crises and disaster. Around the globe, the PCs respond to earthquakes and hurricanes, floods and fires, war zones and industrial disasters, plane crashes and pandemics. They're part of an international organization with a mission to save lives and to not just respond to crises, but to end them.\nIn First Responders, you create a campaign with a broad roster of heroes. In one session you might need a paramedic, a trained rescue worker, and a firefighting specialist, while the next mission requires the paramedic, a field researcher, and a pilot, and the one after that you need a rescue worker, a field researcher, and a technician. The players maintain multiple characters, but the unique system advances them all, regardless of which are involved in a given adventure, so that any can be called upon as the campaign progresses and the threats become ever more dangerous.\nFirst Responders also provides exciting rules for mega-challenges, making events like a forest fire or an earthquake into a fully-realized narrative filled with challenges as dynamic and exciting as any battle against monsters or crawl through a dungeon. These large-scale challenge rules will be easily useable in any Cypher System game, so you can incorporate them into your Numenera campaign, or adventures based on Claim the Sky, The Stars Are Fire, or any other Cypher System setting.\nOur world needs heroes. Cypher System fans love new books. We've already unlocked The Origin, a new hardcover setting book. And we're looking forward to reaching the Cypher System Bestiary later in this campaign! What else might we unlock before that title\u2014or beyond it? We have lots of great ideas, and look forward to lots of cool stretch goals!\nThe critically acclaimed, award-winning Cypher System is fast-paced, narrative-focused, flexible, and uniquely easy on the GM. Baked-in mechanics like Effort and player intrusions easily support heroic styles of play\u2014PCs can really push themselves to do amazing things. The Cypher System\u2019s Power Shift mechanic and Power Boost cyphers perfectly portray the way superpowers work. They make it easy to show how a super-strong hero can break down a door without thinking twice or how another hero might briefly try something unique with their powers to get a very specific effect. Both of these mechanics\u2014and more\u2014will be even further developed in Claim the Sky.\nCreating a great Cypher System character is as easy as coming up with a great concept. You build the character you imagine through a quick, fun process that results in a character with depth, nuance, and flexibility.\nCypher System characters are built with a three-part sentence. You might be a Rugged Warrior who Stands Like a Bastion. A Guarded Adept who Keeps a Magic Ally. Perhaps a Graceful Explorer who Moves Like the Wind. Or a Charming Speaker who Bears a Halo of Fire. Each part of your sentence says something about your character\u2014but also provides some of your abilities, skills, and stats. They even offer guidance on your connections to other characters in your party, creating bonds that can be a foundation for an ongoing campaign, or facilitate great roleplaying in one-shot adventures.\nCyphers give characters single-use abilities frequently gained and spent, adding variety to the character\u2019s capabilities and providing exciting new approaches and options. Depending on what\u2019s appropriate for the campaign, cyphers can be subtle, representing blessings, unusual turns of luck or capricious powers, or manifest, in the form of bits of unusual technology, charms, or minor magic items.\nCharacter arcs encourage and reward players for pursuing their characters\u2019 own motivations, in addition to the overall story of the campaign. Just as the heroes of movies, comics, and TV shows grow through their own subplots, Cypher System players may choose arcs to pursue, tying their characters\u2019 personalities more closely to the overall story and engaging the players even deeper into their characters and the campaign.\nNo problem! Every backer level includes a copy of the complete Cypher System Rulebook in PDF. This 448-page book is a $22 value in PDF, but it's free with every reward and delivered early, mere weeks after the campaign closes. (Already have the CSR? You can gift your free PDF to a friend!)\nWant to Check It Out Now?\nDownload the free Cypher System Rules Primer, and have a look at the system's amazing mechanics right now!\nClaim the Sky is a 224-page hardcover (upgraded to include a poster map!) that delves deeply into all aspects of the superhero genre. With a similar look and form, it's a beautiful companion to the recent Cypher System supplements The Stars Are Fire, Godforsaken, Stay Alive!, and We Are All Mad Here. Beautifully illustrated, it explores the many facets and subgenres of superhero comics, movies, and fiction, with rules and options for all of them. It includes the Boundless campaign setting, along with creatures, cyphers, artifacts, equipment, and more.\nFirst Responders is a 128-page hardcover (strike that: we've upgraded the page count through stretch goals!) that presents rules, options, gear, and more for heroes inspired by the real world to take on massive challenges and dangers.\nThe Origin is a 128-page hardcover (strike that: we've upgraded the page count through stretch goals!) setting book. This is a world where superheroes are not a fact of life. Player characters must come to grips with the fact that they can do things normal humans cannot, and then decide what to do with these abilities while facing clandestine government branches, terrorist organizations, and even more mysterious groups that want to study, recruit, or destroy them.\nEvery backer level includes a copy of the complete Cypher System Rulebook in PDF. This 448-page book is a $22 value in PDF, but it's free with every reward and delivered early, mere weeks after the campaign closes. If you already have the CSR, we'll make it easy to gift your free PDF to a friend.\nAre You a First Responder? If you're a firefighter, EMT or paramedic, emergency worker, or other front-line hero, the Real-World Heroes backer level gives you First Responders and the Cypher System Rulebook at a deep discount just for you.\nLooking to Get into the Cypher System? You'll get the Cypher System Rulebook in PDF at any reward level. Prefer it in glorious hardcover? The Brand New Hero level gives you every title funded by this campaign, plus the CSR in print (a $70 value). Or check out Any Character, Any Campaign, which includes four additional genre books at an astounding discount! If you're looking to spend a little less, you can instead choose the CSR as an add-on.\nWant to Playtest\u2014or Just See It Early? Materials for the titles funded by this campaign generally go to playtesters about four months before those titles become products and go out as backer rewards (that's a generalization, though\u2014not a specific commitment). If you'd like to be part of the action, or just have early access to the materials to check them out, or to roll the mechanics into your existing Cypher System campaign, back at any level from The Danger Room up. Backers at these levels may choose to be part of the playtest, or simply to receive the playtest material without providing feedback. It's up to you!\nLove an Incredible Deal? To get your hands on a whole stack of awesome Cypher System products, you can't do better than the Any Character, Any Campaign or THOOOM! reward levels. The savings are so spectacular they're a bargain even if you already own some of the titles. All the levels from The Danger Room and up also get you the Cypher System playmat for free, and early access and playtesting!\nAre You a Retailer? The Secret Base level is a flexible way for you to decide how many of each title is right for your store, and to avoid tying up lots of cash between now and release. Your pledge gets you three copies each of Claim the Sky and First Responders. You may, at a later time, increase the quantity of these titles, and add additional titles funded by stretch goals. You\u2019ll pay for those additional titles, at a retail-friendly discount, at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. For this retail backer level only, MCG covers domestic US shipping\u2014but you must still complete BackerKit and follow our fulfillment process (see Shipping, below).\n\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will ship rewards at several times over the course of many months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to BackerKit, our pledge management platform. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything you might have missed. Later, when a reward is ready to fulfill, you'll use the MCG Shop to manage the process. This puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming rewards at your convenience, and ensures we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward. YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS STEP TO RECEIVE YOUR REWARD.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works:\n1.  When a reward is ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email.\n2.  You log on to the MCG Shop.\n3.  You go to your Coupons page and click on the coupon for the reward, and it is automatically added to your cart. If you have multiple rewards, or want to make purchases, you can add them all to your cart before checking out.\n4. Check out! You give us your address and pay for shipping (for physical rewards) at that time.\nUPDATING YOUR ADDRESS OR GIFTING YOUR REWARD If you move, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, just enter their shipping address when you check out. If it's not convenient to receive a reward at the time of fulfillment, or to ship multiple rewards together to save on shipping costs, you may delay redemption of a reward for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date. \nSHIPPING All backers pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you can choose. As of this writing, basic domestic shipping is $7 per shipment, but we do not control future postal rates, so that cost is subject to change. International shipping is based on postal and shipping rates at the time of the order, and varies by destination and shipment weight.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. We must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Here are details that apply to your region:\n The Americas: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). Canadian backers please note that our books are printed in Canada, and thus are not subject to import duties; however, items not printed in Canada, such as decks of cards, are subject to import duties.\n The EU and UK: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. UK and EU backers will not pay import duties and taxes.\n Australia, New Zealand, the South Pacific, and Asia: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMonte Cook Games has run sixteen previous Kickstarter campaigns.

We took great care in adapting them to this new format, so the final result is as amazing as their resin counterparts, and the best part is we can make a LOT of them way faster!\nSo, if you did not get a dragon during the past Kickstarter campaign with limited print runs, or if you wanted to get more but weren\u2019t able to at the time, this is the best chance to get them. Plus, these dragon miniatures will make the final encounters of each adventure in the Great Wyrms of Drakha book truly epic.\nOf course, none of this would be possible without the support of our previous backers from Dragons of the Red Moon and we are committed to keep working hard to deliver all 5 waves. If you are a backer from Dragons of the Red Moon, you will still get your resin cast miniatures, but now you will also get the PDF book of Great Wyrms of Drakha for free.\n We are launching this campaign with 3 dragons already available in plastic version.\n* Elyse model (32mm) for scale reference only. Not included. Each dragon is approximately 200mm tall.\nOur backers will always get the best deal with bundles, experience and perks.\n           As each stretch goal is unlocked, you will receive more content in the book detailing the world of the Red Moon with more key locations and an extended menagerie of creatures to keep their players on their toes. \n  As Drakhan dragons are wont to do, this project can grow in size and content with every milestone reached, until it becomes a full-fledged primer detailing Drakha\u2019s visible face, full of incredible artwork by top talent, new beasts, monsters, regions and magic items for your PCs to discover, fight and conquer.\n           The Azhurmas have already sensed your hunger for power and they all want to oblige you in your defiance to their rule.\n           After all, life would be boring without a worthy challenge. \n Here\u2019s what some of our past backers are saying about the Great Wyrms models in previous campaigns where the STL 3D printing files or resin miniatures for Dragons of the Red Moon were available.\nResin copy of Sivax Magnifex from Dragons of the Red Moon.

Beloved, admired, envied and hated in equal measure, Aureus Fulgen\u2019s Most High Vision took form in The Golden City, the beacon of civilization in Drakha and the seat of his power. But some believe his rule is flawed and the time for change has come.\n\nThe adventurers, recently deputised as members of the Steelclaws, are summoned to a private meeting with Aureus Fulgen and given a mission by His Radiant Majesty himself. They are to follow the clues left by a long-dead sage and retrieve a relic of great power from a place in the middle of the Drakhan desert. Their harrowing and brutal journey will take them right to the heart of the nightmarish territory ruled by none other than Baastherox The Broodless, the Warrior Philosopher\u2026 The Mightiest.\n\nKuxcoatl\u2019s thirst for knowledge raised him above all others and transformed him into the grandest of them all. Still, inside the teeming, cryptic jungle known as The Arcanum Wilds, something has been stirring and it brings uninvited change with it. Is someone following Kuxcoatl\u2019s example and furthering their knowledge to rule over any and all transformations? What lies at the end of the deep, puzzled-riddled maze surrounding the \u201cWhisper of Change,\u201d an object rumoured to unlock the most arcane secrets?\nForged in the fires of a volcano and her own inventiveness, Derhilya raised herself above the weak, malformed shape she was born with and turned herself into The Forge Queen. Toiling at the Flawless Forge, she leaves her brood to tinker and create, amassing objects of mind-defying craftsmanship and intricate beauty. One of these, lying somewhere in the Forge Queen\u2019s lair, is said to have been designed as the great equalizer against a direct threat to the Scalebreakers\u2026 and a map drawn in blood by one of them, shows the way to its whereabouts.\n\nThe adventurers have come into possession of a set of instructions to craft a very  powerful magic item: \u201cThe Cloak of the Myriad Shifting Skins,\u201d but a key component lies in the Eveflux quicksilver pools somewhere in the poisonous canals running deep inside Paradis\u2019 tunnels, the domain of the splendid Sivax Magnifex. Unbeknownst to them, locked in the crystalline tunnels lies a \u201cdormant\u201d golem said to have an unparalleled beauty and rumored to lend the power to breach any wall to whomever controls it. Yet, the galleries leading to the vaults are filled with madness and terror\u2026 a combination Sivax finds most pleasing.\nThe time has come for Rawraxxa to prove to herself she still is the apex huntress, and nothing is safe from her hunger and the Brood Levy. A nomadic group of escaped Valernians has wandered into the low mountains bordering the Shrillling Sands, believing they would find refuge on the caves and long-vacant wurm tunnels\u2026 but now find themselves caught in a cataclysmic battle for survival between a small, dying brood and the unstoppable Rawraxxa who has come to them with her customary demand:\u201cprove you\u2019re fit to join my brood; else.. become prey.\u201d\nValernians are convinced dragons fear nothing... Nixis knows better. In truth, all other dragons fear Her, for she has transcended what her former kind conceive as what\u2019s farthest from them: death itself. Now, the whispers in the wind are carrying tales of a group of \u201cslayers of dragons.\u201d The adventurers, Valernian escapees and survivalists, have earned a reputation as mighty combatants and as \u201cscourge of dragonkind\u201d for themselves... and anything that can kill a dragon, is something Nixis will find some use for to further her own ends\u2026  whether they want to join her or not.\nIn Great Wyrms of Drakha, you\u2019ll find:\n Seven high-level, 4-session adventures; each one dedicated to your players actually fighting one of the Azhurmas as their final challenge\n Maps for all relevant locations used in the adventures and key regions in Drakha\n Bestiary! Statblocks and background for every single creature mentioned in the adventures, with all the detail you need to make them come alive and challenge your players\n Items of Might, Wisdom and Horror. New magic items and relics found only in Drakha, plus technology exclusive to the Valernians captive in the Red Moon.\n Amazing art showcasing Drakhan uniqueness, with its breathtaking landscapes and awe-inspiring creatures.\nExtensive, enticing, but never excessive!\n  We love doing what we do. But even more than that, sharing our work with our passionate backers who are enthusiastic about what we create, is the wind beneath Draco Studios' wings.  We\u2019d be honored if you joined us to make it a reality. However, we are well aware the times are trying and we don\u2019t want you to break the bank.\n    Thus, we\u2019ve created a series of very reasonable pledge tiers and several add-on options, plus stretch goals to enhance the contents in the book, to allow you to tailor your choices to fit your immediate needs.  \n    If you decide you can afford an extra expense at a later time, you\u2019ll be able to do so via the Pledge Manager, and once the campaign ends, you will have the chance to make late pledges via Backerkit for a limited (yet reasonable) time.\nChallenge completed!

But feel free to keep retweeting to increase exposure even more!\nClick to download the free STL file of Baastherox Bust.\n\nWe take great care and are pretty serious with the battlemaps created for you to enjoy and use with your adventures, as battlemaps embellish every gaming table around the world, and everybody loves a great looking gaming table.\n       Everyone knows one of the best things about dragons is their lairs.\n       As part of our Great Wyrms of Drakha Kickstarter campaign, we are releasing all the lair battlemaps as printable 3D STL files as an add-on for $10 USD. The 2D battlemaps are already included in the book, but for those who have access to 3D printers, why not go 3D for a truly epic final battle with the scenery befitting such a momentous occasion?\n       We have partnered with Townsmith to have the modular  lairs available in Townbuilder Unlimited. You will be able to upgrade your tier in Backerkit for $5 extra.\n        As we progress on our Community Goals throughout the campaign, the structures for the rest of 3D battlemaps will be included in the bundle, and these will not be merely the base-level grid. The Titan\u2019s skull from Baastherox\u2019s lair is already included in this initial 3D-printable bundle. By completing social challenges, the rest of the lairs will add yet another layer of greatness to your epic.\n        Are you ready to experience the breathtaking Draconic architecture on their own gaming tables?\nThese STL files are for personal-use only, although a commercial license will be available afterwards. All lairs are OpenLOCK compatible.\nFor group pledges or if you just want to add extra copies for you, as a gift or to grant us additional support to our campaign, you can manage your pledge and modify the amount to add extra copies of any product, be it the printed book or miniature(s) of your choice. You can expect saving on shipping, but it will be mandatory for you to cover shipping on the pledge manager.\n\n\nRetailers\nWe are always happy & willing to offer a good deal to all brick-and-mortar retailers / board-game caf\u00e9s, especially now with the trying times most locales are having given the new normality brought about by the pandemic. Thus, we are willing to provide as much support to the people and businesses doing their best to keep the hobbyists and players well catered for. So, we\u2019re doing this in a couple of ways:\nExcellent profit margins: \nOur retailer and corporate sales teams can provide you with a tailored plan to better tend to your business\u2019 specific needs.\n\nThematic display exhibitors: \nWith Great Wyrms of Drakha, Draco is launching its line of \u201cThematic Display Exhibitors,\u201d designed to make our books and dragons to catch your customers\u2019 eye and embellish your store\u2019s display areas. Then, you don\u2019t need to worry about the number of display units you might need, as we have already devised a system where the display\u2019s size will depend on and easily accommodate the product you order from us.\n        As retailers in Mexico City ourselves, the method we prefer is having a deposit ($5 tier) made during the Kickstarter, placing the full order in the pledge manager and pay for the games and shipping fees just before fulfillment begins.\n        We want you to get your order to you as early as possible; that is: before the products are available with your usual distributors.\n        Cartons come with multiple copies of each product. The discount will be calculated against MSRP of your total order.\n        You are welcome to host pre-orders with your customers and let us know if you would be interested to offer local pickup for any backers in your area, making this the first step in what we would love to become a long and prosperous business relationship with your store.\n\nA NOTE ON OUR STL AND COMMERCIAL LICENSING\n\n       As part of our design and business principles and because several members of our team have always been strong proponents of 3D printing, this Kickstarter campaign also contains several options for backers to obtain our STL files* as add-ons to their main pledge, but these are for personal use only.\n       However, if you run a 3D Printing shop or plan on commercializing any of our models\u2014we get it, why wouldn\u2019t you? They\u2019re great!\u2014you can apply for a commercial license directly with our LAIR division. We are honored and appreciate your willingness to make our products reach more people. We at Draco have made it priority to help your business grow, so drop us a line; let us hear from you so we answer your questions and offer you our dedicated customer support.\nOur plastic products are commissioned to PANDA GM, a prestige manufacturer based in China. After production is completed, the miniatures will be sent from China to multiple fulfillment centers in different regions of the world (USA, Canada, Mexico, UK, Europe, China & Australia) to offer all of our backers fair shipping rates and custom-cleared parcels \u2014Draco will always be an ardent proponent of friendly-shipping projects. We got your back!  \nOnce more, we will be working with Backerkit to manage your pledge orders and make sure we get everything right when sending out your rewards to you!\n\nShipping will be charged once the Kickstarter Campaign for this project ends. This way we can offer you the most competitive shipping rates possible as this allows to make more precise calculations depending on each region\u2019s specific volume of sales.\nTransparency is of paramount importance for us. We are not just creators, we are also avid backers too for other projects and as such, we understand your expectations and your doubts. \nIt is your support what has brought us this far. And we aim for the highest quality. As a group, Draco Studios is parent company of Draco Forge, LAIR 3D, and partner of other great publishers such as Detestable Games or Gnomosapiens. We have made collaborations for other projects with amazing publishers such as River Horse, Jetpack7, Arcane Minis, Townsmith, and many people in the industry that we consider now part of the Draco family.\nOur past projects have been a marvelous learning experience, and all of them are very important for us. We strive for perfection, and we consider to have delivered a ton of extra value for our backers for a fraction of the MSRP. \nCovid19 was a challenge for us in the past months too. However, we are finally in the last stretch for War for Chicken Island (arriving to fulfillment centers with a huge box and ton of miniatures), and for Eldritch Century RPG (we ended producing 2 books instead of 1 because of all the written content we developed, and delivered with amazing art. Production is about to start and digital fulfillment within this week with a Beta preview already available for backers). \nDragons of the Red Moon (70% fulfilled) was the one impacted the most by Coronavirus, but we have always been clear about our plans with Great Wyrms of Drakha; Draco Forge (our resin cast workshop) is recovering speed for the missing waves, with production impacted by this year's events. The response from Dragons of the Red Moon was so positive, that we had to plan for 5 production waves instead of 1 (already fulfilled). Draco Forge has also already fulfilled our very first project for Eldritch Century resin miniatures.\nProjects from LAIR 3D (subsidiary company of Draco Studios) have been fulfilled on time (stretch goals from Dragonbond: Battles of Valerna pending but those were promised at a later date).\nIt is important to note that we have different teams working on each project.\nHere's what the timeline for this and our other projects' fulfillment look like:\nYou can count that we will be always here, in the comments, in direct messages or over e-mail to let you know the status of your rewards and we will not rest until all our promises are fulfilled.\nSivax Magnifex, painted by Angel Giraldez\nDragons\u2026 who doesn\u2019t love or is fascinated by these colossal creatures?\nDraco Studios is a team of people who love dragons, and many of the things we do is with other people who share this love for dragons.\nDraco Studios has been developing the setting for over two years. It was GenCon 2018 when Draco Studios met Tom Babbey and we have been collaborating ever since to bring these fabulous dragons and their homeworld of Drakha to life for all to discover wonder and fear.\n Kickstarter voice video by Jonathan Luhmann.\n\nWant to know more about what we do?

We are working with talented partners to manage this project and campaign based in the universe from Draco Gaming Inc, Great Wyrms of Drakha.\n\nPOLICIES\nThis the fifth campaign for a physical product of Draco Studios. Just as always, we are committed to do everything right and connect with people from around the world who share the love for dragons, RPG, miniatures, and 3D printing.\nWe can refund you within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees and other result-based marketing fees (-25%). This policy lasts until the time when we lock orders in our pledge manager, after that point no refunds are possible. If we realise a component cannot be delivered after many months of trying, we refund that completely at the best of our effort, including fees.\n\nThis will be a transparent campaign, if any issues occur, we will let you know through project updates \u2013 which will be regularly posted after the campaign is funded. At least once per month.\nWe are so committed to publishing our products with the best quality, that we will put money from our pockets if needed in case of any undesired events.\n\nBackerKit is our preferred software to manage the pledges and to ensure a smooth process for our backers for selecting add-ons. Backers should answer their surveys before the indicated deadline to expect to receive their rewards at the promised time. Otherwise, their rewards will be sent on a second wave of deliveries or incur in extra shipping charges.\n\nManufacturing will be held with professional RPG books printers, selection of manufacturer may vary depending on scope. If your product arrives damaged after shipping or has any issues, we will send you a replacement for no extra cost. We might ask you to return the other copy and send proof of the issue with a picture (in case we need to file a claim with the postal service).\n\nAny Kickstarter Exclusives are available by us only on active Kickstarter campaigns and special events such as gaming conventions. Availability of the pledge manager is not mandatory and we reserve the right to take that decision.\n\nPlease note that shipping fees for physical rewards will be collected after the campaign ends via a pledge manager. Reward tiers say \"Ships anywhere in the world\" to indicate that backers anywhere can support the project. It does not mean free shipping.\n\nCHALLENGES\nEven though we are trying to offer you a flawless campaign, we aren\u2019t sure whether we will get enough backers to reach the funding goal. We have a large team that will work on fulfilling this project, and we would like to ask for your help to spread the word with a friend, a local store, or your social media.\n\nRISKS\nThird-party issues happening during shipping will be treated on a case-by-case basis.

Grab the PDF of the Blackstorm Sorcerer and Gravity Domain (cleric)!\nFree 17-page PDF sampler\n\n GET READY FOR ADVENTURE!\nAn infinite number of worlds await your discovery out in the vast chasm of the Blackstorm. Realms of unbelievable power, immeasurable wealth, and enigmatic secrets are waiting for you to visit and explore. Realms are continually created and lost in the turbulent Blackstorm. Meanwhile, the gods and goddesses of multiple realms wage war with an ancient group of beings determined to bring all that exists to heel. \nCustomize your character with an array of fantastic magical devices called Aparatum. Upgrade your magic with an optional advanced magic system. Explore new realms and meet many intriguing races. Get to know something new with our advanced magic system as well as new playable classes and other great features. Face unimaginable perils in the Blackstorm and help save all the realms!\nPlayers and game masters, this book is for you. Blackstorm Realms is all about YOUR worlds. And, it's about character customization options with our optional customization system called Aparatum. It is a playground without boundaries; you'll have fresh lore to invigorate your campaigns and provide new places, and a system of character customization to keep your games and characters from being the same and stale.\n Blackstorm Realms allows you to incorporate your own homebrew realms, well-known official realms, and third party realms into one seamless universe and provides you with the means to move back and forth between all of them. Are there suns and moons and stars in your realm? Then give your players an opportunity to discover what's on them, not just what's beyond the horizon, BUT also what is beyond the BEYOND!\nIn Blackstorm Realms, you are introduced to at least three new realms that exist in a galaxy known as The Celestial Tree. \nDwarven Citadel\nLet's not stop there, though. What else does Blackstorm Realms offer? You'll have new classes and archetypes, races, and spells and magic items at your fingertips. But let's go a bit further, shall we? You'll discover the existence of a hidden, galaxy-spanning enemy that works to dominate realm after realm and intimately tied to a mix of magic-and-material crafting called Aparatum. You'll discover secret societies, factions with intriguing motivations and goals, weapons that can slice through the fabric of reality, ancient celestial leviathans that move through the Blackstorm at breathtaking speed, jaw-dropping wonders between realms to explore, and so much more.\nHere's the best part, too: whatever campaign and/or world you are currently running can continue. Blackstorm Realms is simply opening the door and providing the rules and mechanics for creating a larger, shared universe and the means to explore it all.\n\nIn short:\n1. At least three new realms/worlds for you to explore.\n2. New customization options for your characters called Aparatum. Think of them as mechanisms that can enhance your character's body and mind ...but there are risks that balance out the gifted power.\n3. Complete mechanics for moving between realms, with a solid backstory and explanations that will satisfy fantasy players.\n4. A galaxy-spanning conspiracy with good guys and villains to fight, join, bribe, betray, hide from, and maybe defeat. \nCelestial Leviathan\nView the Google Doc with more information about the worlds.\nSara and I (Aaron) started our journey with Dungeons & Dragons. Not only did we fall in love with the game, but the art of Jeff Easley, Keith Parkinson, Larry Elmore, and the great Frank Frazetta inspired us. We have them to thank for what we are doing today! D&D is such a huge part of our lives that everything we have now, including a happy marriage of 14 years, comes from and is because of a beloved game.\nSince 2016, Jetpack7 has been on a mission to bring great art, creativity, and a whole lot of fun into the world. We have been fortunate to be a part of some well-known and loved titles since our start, such as Legends of Norrath, Just Cause 3, and digitally re-creating the 1980\u2019s \"painterly\" look for the 25th anniversary of G.I. Joe.\nIn 2011 Wizards of the Coast approached our art studio, Conceptopolis, to help visualize 5th edition. Surprised to know that we were competing with larger and more venerable studios who had been in the industry for longer than ourselves, we remained confident and presented our work to WotC. Despite all obstacles and the intimidating competition, we landed the job!\nIt seemed fated that we would work on the same game that made us who we are now.\nFrom 2011 to 2013, we produced over 300 pieces of art, some of which you have already seen if you have thumbed through the Monster Manual and Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide for 5th edition.\nEncouraged by this, we formed Jetpack7 in 2017 to bring our own passion for art and gaming to even more people. Having published comic books before, 5th edition presented us with the opportunity to get back into something we love to do. Our mission is to bring something fresh but familiar to a game we love so much, now that it\u2019s being introduced to so many new players. D&D is enjoying an age of revival.\n However, we recognized something lacking. Except for some notable stand-outs, many of the more popular campaign settings produced for 5e are much the same setting.\nWith so many new players joining the fun and bringing their own fresh and unique worlds to the game, we saw a solution to this \u2018sameness.\u2019 In an effort to bring back the nostalgia of the early days of gaming with a fresh outlook, some new mechanics, and our own unique creative twists on the world\u2019s greatest roleplaying game, we came up with Blackstorm Realms! It's a new way to draw all of your worlds together and create something truly unique and special!\n Ted Sikora of Nerd Immersion YouTube channel. Featured Contributor.\nIn 2014, Ted formed Nerd Immersion as a way to share his love for gaming and nerd culture with the world. With the release of 5th edition D&D, he shifted the focus of Nerd Immersion to D&D live streaming and D&D videos. Since then, the channel has streamed over 13 campaigns and released over 1000 D&D videos.\n\n Celeste Conowitch, Author, Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden. @dms_guild Adept.  https://celesteconowitch.com \nCeleste is a full-time RPG writer, podcast producer, and general content creator.

We have since made vendor corrections and the process was much smoother, now working with a printer within the USA.\n\nOther possible risks are scheduling the additional material from stretch goals that may push out the delivery schedule on those items, or that one of our primary contributors encounters a production delay. We're a small, but very experienced team with over 1000 unique projects delivered for dozens of toy and video game corporations. Such an event could possibly delay (but not prevent) publication, or delivery of product. Jetpack7 has no other Kickstarter projects outstanding.

Later his younger brother Ricky would pick up the mantel. For 175 issues it is one of the longest running OEL(Original English  Language) manga to exist and has  influenced many. So much so that fans  and readers began to submit  stories based on the NINJA HIGH SCHOOL  characters and story situations.  This lead the creator of NINJA HIGH  SCHOOL, BEN DUNN, to begin to  collect these stories into annuals or  YEARBOOKS.

During that time we\u2019ve contributed to growing and developing the RPG market in our home country, Italy, marrying our individual creative points of view with the very best production values. We also work on Cypher System supplements, like the Hydra Team's Numenera products: Buried Burdens, Unknown Wonders, and Weird lore.  \nIn addition to our internal designers, Here Be Dragons Games will collaborate with authors, designers, and illustrators from around the world. Tom Cadorette, Robert Schwalb (Schwalb Entertainment), are among the great writers and designers who will help to create, edit and develop the project.\nOur talented illustrators, who will enrich the books with beautiful artwork, include Biagio D\u2019Alessandro (covers), Katerina Ladon, Matteo Spirito, Sergio Cosmai, Melissa Spandri, Roman Kuteynikov, Fabio Gorla, and others.\nAnd, of course, we want to thank Monte Cook! Creator of Arcana Unearthed and Arcana Evolved, Monte is a veteran, hall-of-fame game designer with more than 30 years of professional design experience, much of it on products for Dungeons & Dragons\u2014and particularly as a lead designer of 3E. The setting, lore, and stories he created were an inspiration for us at Here be Dragons, and this new beginning could not come about without his support!   \nHere Be Dragons Games has contracted with Monte Cook Games, LLC, for fulfillment of the Kickstarter rewards from this project.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE \u201cSHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\u201d is Kickstarter\u2019s way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\n\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\n\n                                        A few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through Monte Cook Games\u2019s online store (the MCG Shop), which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. It also ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works:\n                                        1. When your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email it is time to redeem a reward.\n                                        2. You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop (using the email address you gave us in BackerKit).\n                                        3. You\u2019ll go to your Coupons page at the MCG Shop, where you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You simply click on the reward coupon you want to redeem, and it is automatically added to your cart. Once you have everything you want in your cart, you check out.\n                                        4. You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay the redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\n\n                                        If you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\n\n                                        All backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Please see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United Kingdom. UK backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but at this time, we cannot promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).

I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll last that long.\nA classic roleplaying game returns. The new retro-apocalypotic edition of Twilight: 2000, published in partnership with Game Designers' Workshop, goes back to the roots of the franchise with a boxed set for sandbox roleplaying in the devastation of World War III. The new edition will be the fourth in the series, the first being released by GDW in 1984. Just like the original version, the new edition is set in a year 2000 devastated by war \u2013 now in an alternate timeline where the Moscow Coup of 1991 succeeded and the Soviet Union never collapsed.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\n\"The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was an iconic game for me back in the '80s, and we are humbled and honored to work with Marc Miller and Game Designers' Workshop to bring a new edition to life. The original game was really ahead of its time. Our goal is to build on the amazing sandbox survival gameplay and develop it further, making it more accessible using the tools of modern game design,\" says lead game designer Tomas H\u00e4renstam.\n\"When I saw this proposal to revisit the Twilight universe, I signed on immediately. As I have seen the work proceed, I have not been disappointed, and I look forward to seeing this project become reality,\" says Marc Miller of Far Future Enterprises and co-founder of Game Designers' Workshop.\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nAlso part of the project are Amargosa Press (who have recently announced the new Dark Conspiracy 4th Edition RPG), Polish RPG publisher Black Monk Games (who will act as a consultant on the Poland in 2000 AD game setting as well as publish a Polish edition of the game later on), and Far Future Enterprises (who publishes the fifth edition of the Traveller science-fiction roleplaying game). \nThe Twilight: 2000 Boxed Set\nMaking RPGs in boxed sets is expensive, but we really feel it's right way to go for Twilight: 2000, bringing back the feel of the first edition of the game with that iconic Poland map.\nIf we reach our base funding goal, the boxed set will at the very least include two beautifully illustrated full color books \u2013 a Players' Manual and a Referee's Manual, each of about 100 pages detailing rules, setting, gear and scenarios \u2013 as well as several empty character sheets and a huge, full color travel map (format 864x558mm) of central Poland on one side and southern Sweden on the other.\nIf we exceed our base goal, we will add more content to the boxed set as stretch goals. These include combat maps and tokens, cards for initiative and encounters, custom dice, additional content in the books, and more. Read more under Stretch Goals, below.\nLIMITED EDITION METAL BOX: As a exclusive to this Kickstarter, you can even get your copy of Twilight: 2000 in a limited edition metal box. The inside of the box will have a plastic insert (not seen on the mockup image below) to keep all of the game components in place and make sure they are kept in pristine condition. This deluxe edition of the game will only be available via this Kickstarter and will not be produced again. To get your game in the metal box, choose the LIMITED EDITION reward. All backers of the limited edition will also get an honorable mention in the rulebook.\nMetal Box Design (Work in Progress)\nA Referee's Screen will not be included in the boxed set, but can be added to your pledge \u2013 see the Addons section below.\nReferee's Screen \u2013 Work in Progress\nSome say it didn\u2019t have to be this way. Some say history could have taken a different turn. If the Soviet Union had collapsed back in \u201891 when it was on the ropes. If the Gang of Eight military coup against Gorbachev had failed, the world would have looked very different today. Some say. I think it\u2019s bullshit. This storm was always coming, sooner or later.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore, anyway. Now, all that matters is to survive each day.\nIt\u2019s all up to us now. Our squad. Jonesy. Diaz, manning the M113. That Polish girl Kasia. The men and women around me. No one else will come to our rescue. The final words from division HQ, before they signed off for good, left little doubt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on your own now.\u201d\nJust like the original game, the new edition of Twilight: 2000 is set in Poland, but the game also offers an alternative Swedish setting, as well as advice on how to place the game anywhere in the world. In the game, players take roles of survivors in the aftermath of World War III \u2013 soldiers or civilians. Their goal, beyond surviving for another day, can be to find a way back home, to carve out their own fiefdom where they are, to find out more about the mysterious Operation Reset, and maybe, just maybe, make the world a little bit better again.\nThe core gameplay builds on the hexcrawling system established in Mutant: Year Zero and Forbidden Lands RPGs (both Silver ENnie winners for Best Rules, in 2015 and 2019), developing it further to fit the gritty world of Twilight: 2000. The characters explore the devastated lands using a large hexagon map of Poland or Sweden \u2013 or wherever in the world you wish to place your campaign.\nPoland Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nSweden Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nMap Detail \u2013 Work in Progress\nRonson carries the SAW. Diaz is like the Professor on Gilligan\u2019s Island, he can build a new carburetor out of a pair of coconuts and some dental floss. Kasia, all of 17, is the closest thing we have to a medic since we lost Doc. Jonesy is a ginger who Diaz says looks like the cat in Aliens which is how a German intel officer got a name like Jonesy. Top\u2019s been in the Marines long enough to have fought in the Tet Offensive\u2026 and me? I\u2019m just a grunt. We\u2019re all trying to get by. Top once called us \u201cthe last family.\u201d He might be right. Kasia made a gagging gesture when he did. But none of us expect to see our actual families again.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nThe core rules of the game build on the Year Zero Engine (used in award-winning RPGs such as ALIEN, Tales From the Loop, Forbidden Lands and Mutant: Year Zero), but heavily adapted to fit Twilight: 2000 and its focus on gear and gritty realism.\nTwilight: 2000 will be crunchier and have less random elements than other YZE games. Twilight: 2000 will get a solid ruleset that captures the gritty, realistic feel of the original, but in a more accessible way and that fully realizes the potential for sandbox gameplay. We aim for a system that retains depth and complexity, but that is less granular and easier to use.\nInstead of a dice pool as in other YZE games, Twilight: 2000 uses a two-dice system. You'll roll one base die for your skill and one base die for the attribute connected to that skill. Base dice range from D6s to D12s. Skills and attributes are rated from A to D, with a better score giving you a better die to roll. Attributes and skills are fairly broad, with specialties used to fine-tune your character. Combat uses battlemaps with 10-meter hexes to regulate movement and ranged attacks. Extensive systems for critical injuries as well as component damage to vehicles give crunch to the system, while keeping it fast and playable.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nTwilight: 2000 is a game with a large and proud community. We want to extend a big thank you to everyone, for your warm welcome to us and the upcoming game since the project was announce a few months back.\nBeside the comments field here on the Kickstarter, we have opened a section dedicated to Twilight: 2000 at our forums, and you're very welcome to join the discussions there. Also, of course you have the pre-existing Twilight: 2000 Facebook group which is an amazing resource and community hub, and the new Facebook group Twilight: 2000 by Free League, created specifically for the new edition.\nWe are very eager to hear your questions, thoughts and requests for the new edition. Even if we might not be able to fulfill every wish, we certainly want to listen to your advice and feedback.\nAfter the Kickstarter concludes, later in the fall, we will share a full Alpha PDF of the game to all backers, so you will be able to playtest the game and  give your feedback on it before it goes to print.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nWe love friendly local gaming stores all over the world and want to forge an even closer relationship with you. We offer a retailer pledge, including five copies of the Twilight: 2000 boxed set (including printed stretch goals), at a heavily discounted retailer price.\nBy taking part in this Kickstarter as a retailer, you make sure you get the games on time for the official release next year, and you get them at a lower cost than through normal distribution channels.

Several active and retired servicemen from the U.S. military are assigned to the project as consultants.\nTomas H\u00e4renstam has been a roleplayer since his 11th birthday way back in 1985. The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was one of the first RPGs he played and it has stayed with him ever since. In the mid '90s, Tomas spent his one-year mandatory military service as an intelligence officer in the Swedish army. Later, he pursued a career in journalism and worked for over a decade as a foreign news reporter and Middle East correspondent, reporting from places like Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.\nChris Lites first encountered Twilight: 2000 in a bookstore, prior to having ever played an RPG. A Cold War kid, he was obsessed with all things military and, in particular, WW III. Within the year, he\u2019d played D&D for the first time and soon bought Twilight: 2000 at his local game store. There started a fascination with this game that\u2019s lasted his whole life. Twilight: 2000 is, to Chris, as relevant as ever. Because any way you slice it, the world painted by GDW back in 1984 doesn\u2019t look all that different from what might lay ahead of us in a worst-case scenario. The old is new again.\nAngus Abranson spent many a school lunch hour, back in the '80s, traversing the ruins of Europe trying to make it home.  Since then he has battled dragons, flown battleships, lived, loved and died in countless realities and realms \u2013 only to land back in a wartorn Europe looking, once again, for a way home.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Hellscape pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.  \n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

If you are new to 3D printing and want to get a quickstart into the different technologies. \nWhat you need to know is that with 3D printing you will be able to get everything you need to start playing at home, you will also be able to print multiple copies if you require more for your army, or even if you just want to try a different color scheme. \nAll our sculpts were made with 3D printing in mind, you should be able to get the most out of all our models in both FDM and Resin printing. Thanks to this technology you will be playing in no time, we have also taken care to add all the necessary accessories (such as dials, counters and tokens) needed to get the full experience we hope to achieve once the mass manufactured game is launched. \nWe strive for perfection and will update files and rules to make this game better every time we update it.\n\nPLAY\n\nThis project is meant for personal use only, this means that the files cannot be sold, distributed or shared. However a commercial license will be available at an extra cost afterwards with LAIR (for which you can read more about further down on this campaign) or another platform we decide to use. \nPersonal Use\nPersonal use means you can print as many pieces as you want as long as they are for you or a gift free of charge to close people. \nYou should not distribute or sell the files. Using portions of them and publishing as new content is not allowed.\nYou can cut/resize the files to fit better your printer but you can't share those derivatives.\nYou can't make cast/molds of my models, any kind of mass production is prohibited.\nThe files cannot be used in any other project or crowdfunding platform.\nYou can, of course, take photos, make live streams and video with the models but please give credit to Dragonbond.\nAll copyright belongs to Draco Gaming Inc, no rights are assigned or transferred to the end-user.

For the tabletop miniature wargame in particular, development of a campaign mode and Companion App is considered to take place in 2021.\nThis companion app will allow you to have the Lore from Dragonbond directly on your phone, offer a smooth experience for army building, and keeping track of your games and campaigns. While this app is not a reward of this Kickstarter, we want you to know about it.

First one was Legendary Dragons 3D and while we had some set backs with deploying our pledge manager, we finished Stretch Goals earlier than expected and fulfilled in advance. Everything's on track for fulfillment of the last rewards of that campaign and most backers have received their STL files.\n\nWe can refund you within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (around 15%). This policy lasts until the time when we send surveys in our pledge manager, after that point no refunds are possible. If we realise a component cannot be delivered after many months of trying, we refund the cost for that particular item completely, including fees.\n\nThis is a transparent campaign; any and all issues are stated in our project updates \u2013 which are regularly posted after the campaign is funded\u2014 at least once per month. We are so committed to publishing our products with the best quality, that we put money from our pockets if needed in case of any undesirable events.\n\nLair intends to have its own pledge management system and we will make sure you have a smooth process for selecting add-ons and downloading your files there. Please answer your surveys before the indicated deadline to receive your rewards at the promised time. Otherwise, any rewards might be sent on a second wave of deliveries.\n\nAny Kickstarter Exclusives are available by us only on active Kickstarter campaigns and special events such as gaming conventions.

The portal, called a Crossing, takes you to a world you thought only existed in novels and films: a magical land where dragons roam the skies, orcs and hobgoblins terrorize weary travelers, and unicorns prance through the forest. It is a world where humans join other peoples such as elves, trolls, dwarves, changelings, and the dreaded creatures who steal the night. It is a world of fantasy \u2014 of imagination.\nIt is the Realm.\nIt is Legendlore.\nDrawn from The Realm and Legendlore comics, the Legendlore RPG will whisk characters from our world to a magical fantasy realm filled with dragons, orcs, unicorns, and hobgoblins. With over 60 comics published covering three volume runs, The Realm and Legendlore combined became one of Caliber Comics' most critically acclaimed series.\nIn the Legendlore RPG, players can choose to play as themselves or create a new character employing the 5th Edition Fantasy Rules System.\nTired of being stuck at home? Are you ready for a magical adventure? Here's your chance to find a Crossing and have some adventure in The Realm!\nArt by Gong Studios\nLegendlore was originally a comic called The Realm, first published by Arrow Comics in 1986 and since procured by Caliber Comics, about four people who fall through a Crossing into the Realm. The Realm is home to fantasy creatures from elves to dragons, and the characters discover they too have \u2018fantasy powers\u2019 \u2013 the jock becomes a Fighter, while the bookish one becomes a Wizard, and so on. They go on adventures and some of them eventually find their way back to Earth.\nThis is the basic premise of the Legendlore RPG. You cross into the Realm, where you become a hairfoot Bard, or maybe an elven Sorcerer. You can change any characteristics you like. For example if you have hay fever and glasses, you choose if your Legendlore self keeps or drops those. Your identity might not always match your outward physique, but your Legendlore character does. We've also updated the 1980s setting so Realmborn characters represent all ethnicities, genders, and sexualities. No one in the Realm will bat an eyelash at your agender panromantic self.\nYou are not the first from Earth to encounter the nations of the Realm. The Realm has had Visitors before, and each time these Visitors left something with the Realm: whether it be a new word, or even accidental technology. Some Visitors became stranded and formed their own communities out of an immediate need for survival. These communities can still be found in the Realm, though they tend to be pockets of isolation and have their own customs and concerns even if they are within the boundaries of other nations. Sharp-eyed Visitors may recognize aspects of their world turned into phenomena: in the depths of a forest, they may encounter a glider plane abandoned with vines anchoring it to the soil, its metal rusting, its markings faded under a strange sun its paint was never meant to withstand. These phenomena are considered Strange Things throughout the Realm.\nJust as Earth had impacts on the Realm, the Realm can change a Visitor from Earth. Legends are the destinies Visitors may have when Crossing into the Realm: it is part of their Crossing, part of their destiny.\nEach character has their own Legend, which affects the story and is built up through relatively minor actions as well as through more obviously weighty choices. Legends are things like \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d or \u201cRegent of Dragons\u201d or \u201cHeir to the Mountain\u201d: they represent the destiny of You (your character) and mechanically can resemble backgrounds. Perhaps the You you want to be in the Realm is trying to not spread any more violence than absolutely necessary for self-defense. As a Player, you might want their destiny to reflect that commitment to peaceful solutions and to avoid continuing cycles of revenge and violence: thus the \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d Legend. The seeds of that legend are there, but how does that affect You throughout Your adventures in the Realm?\nCurious to hear what a session may sound like? Click HERE to crossover to an Actual Play recording, where three roleplayers are teleported into the Realm, where they must try to find a way home. Hitching a ride thrusts them straight into a missing person\u2019s case, but all is not what it seems. \u2018Into the Realm\u2019 is an introduction to Legendlore, and used as an example of a campaign opening.\nThe Legendlore RPG setting is currently available as a \"Rough Draft\" text-only PDF file from DriveThruRPG.com. We want to take the next steps to turn this into fully-illustrated, beautifully laid out PDF sourcebook that befits the legacy of this setting.\nWe also want to take it a step further - creating an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed in four color gloss, with  more than 200 full-color pages and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nThe Legendlore RPG uses rules based on the 5th Edition of the world's most popular fantasy tabletop RPG system, and comprises three sections (Player, Setting, Game Master) including an introductory adventure!\nDuring this campaign, we will feature spotlight previews of various sections to highlight the different aspects of The Realm and the Legendlore setting. You can download the entire rough manuscript for free from DriveThruRPG.com now!\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Legendlore RPG possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that main goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Legendlore, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Game Master and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our fantasy family.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($15,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to summon a larger version of this chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only to get the finished, illustrated PDF version (Digital Traveler and First time Traveler Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Traveler to the Realm Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Purveyor of Books and Librarian of Isliadril Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Legendlore RPG campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Olardellian Trader) will get 5 copies of the Legendlore RPG rulebook (as well as the finished PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE insert which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Legendlore setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO POST-CAMPAIGN PLEDGE MANAGER \u2013 After this campaign ends, we'll begin the next phase and interaction will occur via BackerKit (see Pledge Manager, below). In the Pledge Manager, you'll be able to upgrade your pledge (should you later decide to switch to the hardcover book), as well as selecting Add On Rewards and confirming your shipping information.\nPDF VERSION - The fully-illustrated and complete digital version of the Legendlore RPG, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Those participating in our Pledge Manager will receive a redemption link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The ultimate goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"NEAR COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For the Legendlore RPG, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-on-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nFor only +$20, Add On an additional PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list.\nFor only +$10, Add On a PDF copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list. While unrelated to Legendlore, the Scarred Lands setting is another excellent 5E product from Onyx Path ready to add to your digital gaming collection.\nLegendlore started as a comic book, and now our partners at Caliber Comics have made the graphic novels available to the Legendlore RPG kickstarter backers as Add On rewards, to be fulfilled by DriveThruComics.com.\nLegendlore V1 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 1-5; 153 pages.\nLegendlore V2 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 6-7, and the Tales of the Realm mini-series that depicted Lord Darkoth\u2019s assault on the Rainbow Elf Kingdom; 180 pages.\nLegendlore V3 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 8-11; 138 pages.\n PHYSICAL REWARDS \nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books, screens) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy ofthe Legendlore RPG (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nFor only +$20, Add On a sturdy, three-panel screen featuring a collage of Legendlore art on the outer side, and a selection of charts and other reference info on the inside to make running a Legendlore game session a little bit easier.\nFor only +$45, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. U.S. Residents only.\nFor only +$65, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. Non-U.S. Residents only.\nFor only +$30, Add On a hardcover copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list. This reward will be sent at alongside your Legendlore RPG hardcover when that reward is complete and ready to go. To add this option on to your rewards list, your reward tier must include a hardcover copy (and, therefore, any additional shipping charges) of the Legendlore RPG (so, reward tiers of $50+).\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement\nACHIEVED! - At $20,000 in funding - Legendlore RPG GM Reference Screen \u2014 We\u2019ll create a Legendlore RPG Reference Screen, which can be added on to any reward tier containing a hardcover book for only +$20.\nACHIEVED! - At $23,000 in funding - Legendlore Player\u2019s Companion: Brought From Earth\u2014 Help us fund a Player\u2019s Companion for the Legendlore RPG. This PDF supplement would feature new and expanded Crossings, Legends, and Strange Things. All backers receiving the Legendlore RPG PDF will automatically have the Player\u2019s Companion PDF added to their rewards list.\nACHIEVED! - AT $25,000 in funding - Digital Wallpaper: An awesome digital wallpaper for your computer desktop featuring art from the Legendlore RPG. All backers will have this automatically added to their rewards list.\nAt $27,000 in funding - Legendlore Player\u2019s Companion: Friends and Foes \u2014 Help us expand the Player\u2019s Companion for the Legendlore RPG. The Player's Companion would grow and feature expanded information (including stat blocks) for important NPCs found in the Realm.\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Legendlore RPG hardcover rulebook), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 First time Traveler reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Olardellian Trader) for this campaign.\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nPledge to the campaign at the $25 Digital Traveler reward tier, and have access to the BackerKit Pledge Manager, where you can upgrade to the hardcover reward tier should your circumstances change.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for the LegendLore RPG is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge, with 1 or 3 comics and their related promos. Estimates for 2 comics will fall in the price range between the 1-3 estimates. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.  \nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 44th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays \n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is February 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

It builds on the tense, cinematic experience Nemesis is known for, adding even more opportunities for emergent, dramatic gameplay. Become an unlikely survivor, locked in an underground base with something terrifying. Turn up your paranoia, as you try to guess what other players are up to, or what the contingency plan is. Work to learn the weaknesses of your nemesis \u2013 or run like hell. Switch off the lights in someone\u2019s lab section. Take a dangerous trek to the outside bunker. And whatever you do, be ready for unexpected!\nThe game comes with all the components needed for a cinematic Sci-Fi horror experience and doesn't require the Nemesis Core Box.\nNemesis: Lockdown offers 1-5 player semi or full co-op experience that takes around  90-120 minutes and will be different every run! This stand-alone expansion also works with majority of the previous Nemesis content: other Alien races and most of the characters. \nDuring this campaign you can also get classic Nemesis Core Box (only in English) and all the previous expansion (in 6 different Languages)! \n\nClick for more info!\n\n\nNemesis Lockdown previews \nNemesis Core Box\nNemesis: Lockdown setting\nI should have known when they asked us to prepare the landing platform. There are only two reasons to make a night sample transfer. It\u2019s either too urgent to wait, or it\u2019s a black op. Both spell trouble.\nMy survival instinct, honed by twenty years of work in the Sample-Return Receiving Facilities, was screaming, considering the rumours that reached even our remote site.\nMaybe if I bailed right there, I wouldn\u2019t be crouching in a dark lab, sweaty palms clutching a scalpel, and this damned soft voice repeating over my head: \u201cContainment Breach, Containment Breach\u2026\u201d\nThings only got bleaker when they told us there would be human BSL-5-ET subjects coming. Extra-terrestrial samples and living people don\u2019t usually mix. They SHOULD NEVER mix. Something went really bad out there, and we got caught in it.\nWhen Martinsen and Sovich processed the first sample, I only caught a peek from behind the armored glass. There was one word on the container.\n\u201cNemesis.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t there when the actual breach happened. There were screams over the intercom. The main power went out. Soon, I saw Martinsen and one of the human subjects running to me from the isolation ward elevator, as if the devil himself chased them. I\u2019ve seen it for a split second, before they were caught. I\u2019d rather take my chances with the devil, than with the thing that took them.\nNow, it\u2019s been fifteen minutes since I last heard any shots. The pain in my mangled leg subsides. I get up and slowly make my way to one of the security stations. Am I the only one left? No, thank god! Sovich is still kicking. I have her on a live feed from the main terminal. She\u2019s\u2026\nChanging the logs! Switching her name for mine. Frigging rat! When the board learns we had a containment breach, there will be hell to pay, and she wants to make sure the bill is on my name.\nNow, she turns towards the main console. In the middle of it, under the protective glass, is the A3-5 button, a big chunk of red plastic. They told us it enables the \u201cCode Red Emergency Protocol\u201d but we had no clearance to know what the protocol actually is.\nDon\u2019t do it, Sovich. You might just nuke us. Don\u2019t\u2026\nOf course she does. She wants to play the good girl, an upstanding citizen.\nWell, there\u2019s still time to fix everything. No one will call until morning. We\u2019re on a dark side of the planet now, blocking all signals. I need to get topside, to the secondary console in the other building. Re-write the logs, access the classified procedures, and see what new trouble she got us into.\nThe only things between me and my salvation is a broken airlock, a long stretch of hellish surface, and enough gamma radiation to hard-boil an egg. I\u2019m betting these things can\u2019t walk outside.\nThat would be too frigging unfair...\nGameplay details\nThis time, you are trapped inside the laboratory hidden somewhere on Mars. This construction has several floors you will be able to travel through via elevators or stairs.\nEach section of the board will have a separate power supply that can be cut off at any second. When that happens, elevators stop working, and the corridors sink into pitch-black darkness. This offers an interesting way to slow down the alien pursuit \u2026 or to trap other players.\nMovement and space management has a very different, tenser feel in Lockdown!\nLockdown will come with an entirely new mechanic called the \u201cContingency Order.\u201d It represents one of many possible emergency plans (such as \u201cnuke the station\u201d ). The only way to discover which one is active is through investigation and elimination.\nObviously, it\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019re going to share your hard-earned knowledge with other players.\nHaving a detailed energy system for different sectors of the board allowed us to put more emphasis on the light \u2013 or the lack of it. This makes room for more interactions between players and makes controlling the flow of energy through different sections one of the important elements of the game.\nThere are also items that are a source of light, but they won't last long and will require energy. You may always decide to go through the darkness, but this will make card Events more dangerous and incurs other penalties, such as using different (less accurate) die for shooting.\nLockdown comes with a set of new, freshly designed rooms that thematically reflect a secret base on the surface of Mars. It also contains a whole new set of neutral items, character-specific items, and craftable items.\nIn our previous campaign, we loved the experience of working with the community to create a new alien race, or to determine the look and professions of the crew members. This led us down a very creative path, and brought amazing, diverse ideas into the game!\nWith Lockdown, we want to follow up on this experience. In this Kickstarter campaign, you will not only be buying a game, but you'll take part in its creation too!\nNemesis Lockdown comes with high quality, non-essential companion app. It will provide many exciting gameplay modes, a dedicated soundtrack, as well as support for an advanced solo mode.\nThanks to the app, we bring new depth to solo play that will now include the \"traitor\" tension from semi-cooperative games, as you will never know if you can trust what the app tells you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

Later his younger brother Ricky would pick up the mantel. For  175 issues it is one of the longest running OEL(Original English Language) manga to exist and has  influenced many.

As science and technology draw humanity closer than ever before, certain factions within the masses display gross negligence, undermining the union's work and endangering the world for short-sighted gains. Despite global telecommunications, new frontiers in virtually every field of study, and an understanding of the universe only dreamed of by earlier generations, humanity faces threats on all sides. \nCan you save it?\nClimate change threatens to destroy life as we know it. Religious fundamentalism breeds terror around the globe. Diseases, once eradicated from the developed world through vaccination, have returned due to anti-vaxxer movements. Totalitarian nationalist governments rise, as the masses succumb to fear of the other.\nThe world stands on the brink of destruction, and it is up to the agents and operatives of the Technocratic Union to save it or be its ultimate downfall.  \nTechnocracy Reloaded peels back the curtain and examines the role of the Technocracy in Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The various future fates presented in Mage 20 are examined, and this book introduces a few of its own.  \nWithin this book you will also find a detailed look at life within the Technocracy; expanded information on the conventions; a wealth of equipment, adjustments, and procedures; a breakdown of the various shadow conspiracies and factions within the Technocratic Union; and tips for running your own Technocracy chronicle. \nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nTechnocracy Reloaded brings the final playable faction of the Ascension War into Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The Technocratic Union has historically been presented in various ways. Its members have been shown as the villains of the Ascension War, misguided willworkers seeking to keep humanity safe through control and manipulation, shadowy masters of modern reality, and as heroes forming the only line of defense against unspeakable horrors that seek to destroy all that is. Each of these perspectives is true, from a certain point of view. \nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nTechnocracy Reloaded gives the Storyteller all the tools needed to explore these viewpoints and more while incorporating the Technocratic Union into their Mage 20 game. Technocracy Reloaded provides tools and resources to equip and portray the Technocratic Union as antagonists in a Mage 20 game, or to allow the players to step into the role of Technocrats, with the full support of the Union and its immeasurable resources at their fingertips.\nThis Technocracy Reloaded Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable us to create a deluxe hardcover edition of this supplement, designed to match the look and feel of our other 20th Anniversary Editions, and specifically the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. \nWe want to create a deluxe edition with a leatherette cover featuring the title of the book on the spine, 200+ full color interior pages, and a silk ribbon bookmark. The cover will featured an embossed image of the Technocracy symbol. Exceptional funding will allow us to further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play.\nDesign Not Final\nThe Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Technocracy Reloaded.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nTechnocracy Reloaded features all of the rules options necessary to create and play a Technocratic Union operative within the Mage 20 world. The final book will contain the following chapters:\nUnit 1: The Operative's Handbook provides a detailed overview of life in the Technocratic Union, describing the organization of the Union, the Conventions, and the roles that sympathizers, extraordinary citizens, and Enlightened Operatives play in the overall structure of the Technocracy.\nUnit 2: Targets, Assets, Tactics, and Plans provides a thorough exploration of the operational procedures and standard models used by the Technocracy around the globe and beyond in order to protect the consensus, contain and eliminate Reality Deviance, and bring the world closer to the Union's ultimate goal of Ascension.\nUnit 3: Theaters of Operation examines current Technocratic initiatives on the Front Lines. New initiatives are introduced, old procedures are expanded and clarified, and the Union's global goals are parsed out in localized segments, giving the Storyteller the tools to craft Technocratic tales anywhere in the world.\nUnit 4: Internal Matters provides a detailed view of every aspect of life among the Technocracy. Operatives at all levels of indoctrination and from every imaginable origin are discussed. From Enlightenment, to marriage and child-rearing, to interactions with one's old life, every element of a Technocrat's daily existence is granted meticulous attention. Factions within the Union are also discussed here, including secret cabals with ulterior motives, cross-convention initiatives working together to build a better world, and the Conventions themselves all receive detailed and updated write-ups in this chapter.\nUnit 5: Q Division details the devices, procedures, and hypertech used by the Technocratic Union in all operations great and small. New cutting edge equipment is introduced and old favorites are modernized for compatibility with Mage 20. The Enlightened Science behind these various gadgets and gizmos is also revealed, allowing operatives to apply similar effects in the field, if they have sufficient understanding of the principles that allow these gadgets to function.\nUnit 6: Human Resources provides a comprehensive roster of Extraordinary citizens, cyborgs, operatives, progenitor creations, and allies to populate a Technocracy Reloaded Chronicle.\nUnit 7: Mission Control is a complete guide to Storytelling for the Technocratic Union. A number of story seeds, tips and tricks are provided to ensure that the Storyteller can capture the feel of the Technocracy.\nUnit 8:The Parallax View takes a deep dive into metaplot options, discussing every significant Future Fate that affects the Technocratic Union. Options are provided for incorporating, ignoring, or subverting these metaplot options, and entire new metaplot options are introduced. The tools in this chapter permit the Storyteller and players to shape the Union to their own vision, giving you everything you need to carry your Technocracy Reloaded game into the past, present, or future.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nThe manuscript is written, awesome artists are being contracted, and layout templates are being built. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of Technocracy Reloaded for Mage 20 fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Kickstarter campaign is the creation of this limited-edition book.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Technocracy, possibly expanding into Storyteller and player tools and accessories, as well as a possible rules companion. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our own secret cabal.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target, then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick here to summon a larger version of this chart\n\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nFirst decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Extraordinary Citizen and Operative Reward Tiers), or go all in with the deluxe hardcover (Agent Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Supervisor Reward Tier, which offers 2 copies as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Technocracy Reloaded campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Manager) will get 5 copies of the Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Technocracy Reloaded setting or a possible future supplement. We also have a limited supply of deluxe hardcover copies of the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition included in our Deluxe Archivist reward tier. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Technocracy Reloaded. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nTECHNOCRACY RELOADED PDF VERSION - The digital version of Technocracy Reloaded, fulfilled by our partners at StorytellersVault.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a reception link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public.

When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your Storytellers Vault and DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nMAGE: THE ASCENSION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION PDF - Available from our partners at Storytellers Vault, The M20 rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Technocracy Reloaded. \nTECHNOCRACY RELOADED DELUXE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful deluxe edition of the game.

All physical rewards will be delivered in one shipment, when the final Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover is completed and distributed to backers.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Technocracy Reloaded, you will have the option of using StorytellersVault.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from StorytellersVault.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nNote - these PDF files are the current versions offered by DTRPG.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $35 OPERATIVE or $60 DIGITAL ARCHIVIST reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from Storytellers Vault once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 SYMPATHIZER reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (MANAGER) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Technocracy Reloaded is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Faithful pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \n*** For backers in China, please read this update.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.  If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days).

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Let\u2019s take a brief look at setup and each of the four pillars now.  \nSetup\nIf this is your first time playing, open the scenario book and follow the directions to setup your first pilot and ship. Take a player board, Modifier deck, Pilot mat, progression sheet, Ship mat, and both pilot and ship miniatures. Choose your starting equipment from you current unlocked equipment. You are now ready for your next mission!\nSpace Exploration\nThe Sparrow travels across the Draconian System in search of a home. Manage your ship\u2019s resources as you explore new regions of space and embark on missions fighting to survive through the unknown. Even if you are out of resources you can continue exploring, but you risk starting your next encounter at a disadvantage.\n  Space Combat\nYou and your squad will launch from the hangars of The Sparrow to battle against various enemies throughout your journey in Stars of Akarios. Thankfully you are equipped with the latest ships powered by modern thrusters and advanced weaponry. Assign your action dice to various attacks and maneuvers as you fight your way to victory. Space Combat is the main component of Stars of Akarios gameplay.\n  World Exploration\nDuring your adventures across the Draconian system in Stars of Akarios, you will need to leave your fighters to explore hostile worlds and ships. World Exploration is discovery-focused, putting your cunning to the test as you seek new home for your civilization. Use your pilots skills to complete the challenges you encounter in the limited time available,\n  Pilot & Ship Customization\nYour Pilot's skills will grow as you test your grit against the enemies in Stars of Akarios. Upgrade you characters unique abilities and skill trees, allowing you to customize your play experience. But what\u2019s a pilot without a ship? Equip your ship with various engine, weapons and technology components for virtually limitless combinations. Re-equip your ships before missions, choosing the best weapon and thruster upgrades for each mission.\n                  Unique End-Game Raid System\nIn each act of the game there is a high-level scenario which combines space combat and world exploration to create a unique experience. These raids require a dedicated squad equipped with the best tech. While a typical scenario would last between 30-60 minutes, raids require 1-2 hours to complete. But it is only in raids that you can find the best equipment and gear for your pilot and ship. These raids are designed to be highly-repayable and are perfect for the squads who want to dig deep in Stars of Akarios. \nEvolving storyline\nThe Story of Stars of Akarios is an evolving narrative which will be shaped by your decisions. Early on in the story you will be faced with decisions which will impact the remainder of your campaign. Each playthrough of Stars of Akarios will feel unique as your choices and squad morality will open/close potential story paths and create unique endings for your group.\nDual-Layered Goodness\nWe have taken cues from the video game world and designed intuitive user-interfaces for the players and enemies. The player boards and enemy card holders allow you to see the status of ships, combat effects and special abilities without flipping through a rulebook. Each of these boards are dual-layered to provide great functionality while guarding against those erratic table-knockers!\nEasy Setup and Teardown\nYour time is valuable and we want to honor it. We are working closely with Game Trayz to provide an optimal storage solution for quick setup and tear-down. Probably the single greatest factor to creating ease of setup is our dedication to removing unnecessary tokens. You will have noticed that we do not advertise \u201c300+ tokens\u201d with Stars of Akarios. It\u2019s not because our game does not have complexity or status effects, we have just found a way to track all of that with our dual-layered boards using universal cubes. No more digging into the bottom of your box to find that one \u201cstun\u201d token.\nDirection-Based Space Combat\nTaking cues from great games such as X-Wing, Stars of Akarios strives to create intense \u201cdog-fights\u201d in space. Enemies respond dynamically to your actions and you must always be thinking about the direction your ship faces. All movement in Stars of Akarios is direction-based and most of your attacks will be too! This means you are going to have to plan how to flank your enemies to get an advantaged attack from behind.\nLeave Your Ship and Explore New Worlds\nOne of our team\u2019s favorite parts of Stars of Akarios is the ability to step off of our ships and explore new worlds in what we call \u201cWorld Exploration\u201d (AKA away missions). The blending of dungeon-crawling esque game-play mechanics in Space Combat with exploration and discovery-focused in World Exploration is an ambitious next-step for what a board game can be. Tie this all together with the meta-experience of controlling The Sparrow in the quest for a new home and you have an epic sci-fi experience.\n                    This project is promoted by Green Inbox\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFUNDING: We need your help to make Starlight a reality! Only if we hit our funding goal by the end of the campaign will we be able to do this!\n\nSHIPPING: Shipping is charged after the campaign in our Pledgemanager. Shipping will need to be paid in full prior to the close of our Pledgemager. We will be keeping the Pledgemanager open for an extended period to assist those who may need more time to pay the shipping.\n\nDESIGN: While the core mechanics are set and the campaign planned out, there is still a lot of writing and final balancing to occur. How much is based on what all will be included in the final game.\n\nMANUFACTURE: is being handled by Longpack Games, but international shipping always has the potential for delays and complications. Unexpected delays often happen due to; Production delays, Shipping delays, or Customs delays.\n\nCOMMUNICATION: Inevitably, something will occur during the entire process that we were unable to foresee. If things run behind schedule, we think the best approach is to always be up front and communicative with backers. It's our goal to make post-campaign updates part of this experience and we plan to update bi-weekly until production has begun in order to keep backers informed of the progress. We're going to do our best to keep these updates fun for everyone, so join us to follow along!\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is August 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of refunding no questions asked minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back after 14 days). If however we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in CAD and any refunds processed will be in CAD for the exact amount received in CAD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nThis campaign occurs using Canadian currency (CAD). Any other currency values shown throughout the campaign are estimates at the time of campaigns launch. Other currency values may differ at the conclusion of the Kickstarter based on market fluctuation. Final charges will be based on each currencies exchange rate to CAD at the time of payment processing.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 12 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 12 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 12 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow Along & Retailer Pledge", "descp": "Follow along with the Starlight Campaign!

Crusaders, charge!\n\n       As you may know, we at Owlcat Games have spent countless hours playing the Pathfinder tabletop RPG. We enjoyed it so much that we decided to bring this experience to the videogame format by creating a classic isometric party-based computer RPG called Pathfinder: Kingmaker. The phenomenal love and support shown for Kingmaker have inspired us to tell another story from the Age of Lost Omens. Today we are thrilled to introduce the adventure we are so passionate and excited about \u2013 Wrath of the Righteous!\nEmbark on a journey to a realm overrun by demons and rise to power by choosing one of six available Mythic Paths. Master their abilities and change the world around you as an Angel, a Lich, a Trickster, an Aeon, a Demon, or an Azata. Each Mythic Path leads to unique skills and appearance, and greatly impacts the game\u2019s story.\nChallenge the mighty Demon Lords and close the portal to the demonic plane of existence known as the Abyss.  \n    Enjoy the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder first edition ruleset. Create any character imaginable by choosing one of ten races, picking a particular class out of the 21 available, each with five archetypes for even greater customization. Gain access to more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities, and select those that suit your playstyle. Take control of your party formation, help set up a camp, and find a way to victory by combining the strengths of your companions.\nLead the armies of the Fifth Crusade to victory in a new strategic layer of gameplay. In addition to the classic CRPG experience, step into the role of the Commander, gather troops, reinforce your stronghold, and send your armies to battle the demonic invasion across the map of the region. Send your crusaders to explore ancient ruins and recover powerful artifacts.\nExperience a non-linear story about the cost of tremendous power that adventurers often seek, with tales of corruption caused by the demonic influence and redemption for those who have stepped on the wrong path.\n  Meet a new diverse cast of characters, including ten companions to recruit to your party and featuring multiple romance options to choose from.\nTake control of five new classes (Arcanist, Bloodrager, Shaman, Oracle, and Witch) and meet a new race\u2013the half-undead dhampir\u2013in addition to the previous roster from Pathfinder: Kingmaker. The number of archetypes per class has increased to five as well.\nDive into the game even if you\u2019re not familiar with the intricacies of the Pathfinder ruleset. Use an enhanced tutorial for newcomers to help you with character creation and get up to speed with the rules of the system.\nExplore the world with updated visuals and a 360-degree rotating camera added for better playability and immersion.\n Current platforms: PC Windows (Steam, GOG)\n Current languages: English, French, German, Chinese, Russian, Spanish (funded by reaching a stretch goal)\nMore platforms and languages may be added in the future.  \nWe want our new game to give you the same feeling as good old Pathfinder: Kingmaker Enhanced Edition. If you enjoyed Kingmaker, you will definitely love Wrath of the Righteous as well. \n        While we have enough budget to bring the concept of Wrath of the Righteous to life, we want this game to provide a truly epic experience. The game is built around the idea of a rise to power via one of six different Mythic Paths, each of which will transform the player\u2019s character into a powerful being with special abilities. They will also significantly affect the story branches, change the world around the character, and impact the player\u2019s relationships with companions and NPCs. This idea can be stretched a lot further than our current budget allows.\nIn order to execute our creative vision in the way it deserves, we need your help. This additional budget will allow the team to develop more complex reactions to progressing on a certain path and expand each Mythic Path into a truly unique experience, with exclusive story branches and character abilities that influence the world around you.\nOur Goal of $300,000 will allow us to make Wrath of the Righteous a game of the scale and quality we\u2019ve been dreaming of. \n     We have also come up with some nice extra perks for hitting our Social Goals. These will be made available to all players if unlocked.

All other goals (follower and backer counters) are for the total overall number.\n         The realm of Sarkoris was destroyed when Areelu Vorlesh, a scholar and practitioner of forbidden magics, opened a rift to the abyssal planes of existence, and hordes of demons invaded Golarion. Led by the evil Demon Lords Deskari and Baphomet, the abyssal forces crushed all who stood against them, turning Sarkoris into a demon-infested land now known as the Worldwound. It fell to the neighboring nations to assemble an army capable of withstanding the demonic assault to protect the world from the flames. Thus the Crusades began.\n    The war has been raging for over a hundred years now with little hope of victory. The enemy forces are numerous and their rage is unmatched. Defeat would be certain if not for the Wardstones\u2014the obelisks of divine power placed along the borders of the Worldwound to hold back the invasion. Created under the guidance of Iomedae's herald, they form a protective barrier that prevents the demons from pushing through.\nIt is no wonder that the Wardstones were the demon armies\u2019 first target. Those villainous forces launched a surprise attack on the frontier city of Kenabres, ripping apart its defenses in mere minutes, corrupting the Wardstone housed there, and scattering the crusaders. In the utter chaos of the burning city, one of the crusaders\u2014to their own amazement\u2014discovers a source of power within themselves. While the origin of the power remains unknown, and the form it takes depends on the person, the purpose is clear: this power may be just what the people of the ravaged city need to survive the assault\u2014and to bring the fight to the enemy.\n       The game tells the story of the monumental conflict between mortals and demons, making you a part of a truly epic adventure. You will confront a variety of demonic adversaries, from lowly dretches to the dreadful Demon Lords themselves. To defeat them, your character will be able to claim mythic power and develop it by choosing mythic spells and abilities according to your tactical preferences and character alignment. The choices you make during your adventure will set you on one of six Mythic Paths, opening the ways to becoming a celestial Angel, a ravaging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, a lawful Aeon, or a rebellious Azata.\n     Mythic Paths are the main feature of Wrath of the Righteous. Mythic character progression was originally introduced by Paizo specifically for this Adventure Path, but our take on it differs from the tabletop version and is adapted to better fit the CRPG both mechanically and narratively. Each path will follow a specific theme, has a profound impact on the main story of the adventure, grants powerful unique abilities, and affects the character\u2019s appearance. You will be able to become one of the following beings:\nThe Angel is a mighty champion of good, leading the Crusade by example. They move across the battlefield on their mighty wings, smiting the demons with a sword of holy flame. Those who are fighting alongside the Angel are certain that they will be protected and healed\u2014and even resurrected in the case of their untimely demise. In times of dire need the Angel can ask Heaven for help and celestial allies will join them in battle.\nThe Lich is an immortal creature, commanding their own army of undead. Even the mightiest adversaries the Lich defeats can be raised as slaves under the Lich\u2019s command. Eventually, this master of undeath and necromancy can even replace their mortal companions with powerful undead minions they create. They master the art of magic\u2014especially necromancy\u2014and wield an armament of unique and especially powerful spells like death realm.\n The Aeon is a cosmic judge of balance\u2014Judge Dredd meets Merlin on a cosmic scale. They can sense where the balance is broken and fix it, often punishing the perpetrator in the process. The cool thing about the Aeon is that they can detect places where the balance was greatly disturbed in the past and travel back in time to fix it. In doing so, they can change their current timeline, usually for the better.\nThe Trickster is a Loki-type character. They are here to have fun and play jokes on even the mightiest creatures. One of their late-game abilities is an understanding that their fate is determined by random chance, like the roll of a die of destiny. Armed with such knowledge, the Trickster can manipulate those die rolls in their favor. Every time the system rolls a natural 1 for them, the Trickster changes it into a natural 20. And players will be able to see it happening before their eyes.\nImpulsive and irrepressible, Demons do as they please with no regard for the opinion of others. The Demon is the epitome of rage; a little push is all that is needed to break their self-control and turn them into a force to be feared\u2014by enemies and friends alike. It is up to the Demon to decide whether to allow the inner beast to take control, or to fight it, chain it, force it into obedience.\nWhen a war has been raging for over a hundred years such as the crusades have, one must be ready to make unexpected moves to achieve victory. Some may claim that Azatas act first and think later, but tell that to the demon hordes, trampled and fleeing in terror from this unstoppable force for good. The Azata trust their instincts and makes spontaneous decisions. They easily befriend those who don't fit well into even rows of the \"official\" crusade, and inspire their allies to fight rather than command them to do so. That makes Azatas the heroes these demon-ravaged lands so dearly need.\nYou also have the option to decline all celestial powers and walk the path of the Legend\u2014\u0430 human capable of great deeds. The acts of a mortal are sometimes more inspiring than those of any deity. Several gods of Golarion were humans before they ascended to godhood, including the crusade\u2019s patron deity, Iomedae. One need not be a mythic creature, an outsider, or one of the goddesses's chosen to become a hero. This path may be a hard one, full of temptation, but the mortal who treads it rightly earns their title: Mythic Legend. \n        We want you to feel the scale of the conflict in Wrath of the Righteous with the Crusade system\u2014a new strategic layer of gameplay built specifically for this adventure.\nAt a certain point in the game, you will take charge of the Fifth Crusade. As Commander, you will not only be adventuring with your party, but also building your forces, dealing with major challenges, and making critical decisions about the course of the Crusade. You will also be able to recruit an army, send your troops to fight the demonic hordes across the world map, and reclaim the conquered land. On the sites of ancient battles you will be able to discover legendary artifacts, lost in previous crusades, some of them already corrupted. In an ancient forge, they could be redeemed to become powerful items for your character and party members. \n       While building this system we worked hard to ensure that it was not only interesting and fitting for the adventure, but also accessible and understandable to any players. We\u2019ve listened closely to player feedback on the Kingdom Management system in Pathfinder: Kingmaker and acted on that to deliver a system that will be more integrated into the whole experience. We aim to make the consequences of your choices more clear and provide a wide range of tools to deal with any kind of a situation that could arise while leading the Crusade.\nYou will launch your Crusade by setting up an army camp in the Worldwound and making it a fortified headquarters that you can develop further. Each enhancement you make will be vital in the war to come. You will expand the roster of troops available for hire and improve the strength of your existing units. Another thing that will greatly influence your Crusade is your chosen Mythic Path. Depending on your actions and alignment, some allies might join or leave the Crusade, triggering various outcomes later in the game. Relationships with your companions, who are helping you by being your councilors in the Crusade, will be affected as well.\n      Since the release of Pathfinder: Kingmaker, our passion for the genre has only increased. Our team has expanded and gained more experience, and is led by the same people who brought you the previous game:\n     Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is our second game to be developed in close partnership with Paizo Inc., the creators of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It has been a pleasure working together for all these years and we are excited to bring you yet another incredible adventure. Every take on the story and each piece of artwork goes through the Paizo team, who provide us with lore-based advice on how to approach the events taking place in the Age of Lost Omens. They also work with us to preserve the feel of playing Pathfinder in a tabletop setting and to carefully translate it to a digital format. This means that anyone familiar with the first edition ruleset will have a great time with our game mechanics.\n       Support our game by choosing one of the reward tiers! Pledge more if you want to include any add-ons in your tier.

We plan to deliver the game in June 2021 and we are fairly confident about this timeline. But since we aim to significantly extend the game\u2019s features and increase the overall scale of the adventure, we might find out that certain parts of the game require more time to be polished. Our desire to provide the best experience to our backers and the results of alpha and beta testing may delay the final release. The good part is that this should also mean the game ends up being bigger and better than currently planned. Some of the features could also be changed as we move ahead with development and gain feedback from the players during the testing period.\n\nWrath of the Righteous is being developed under the supervision of Paizo Inc., the owners of the Pathfinder IP. That means that all the products presented on this Kickstarter page are subject to change in order to meet the expectations of our licensing agreement with Paizo.\nOur experience delivering rewards in the previous campaign taught us a lot.

Click any of the images for graphics-free text.)\nThe Ptolus Player's Guide  \nIn addition to the two new versions of Ptolus: Monte Cook\u2019s City by the Spire, this campaign will also fund the Ptolus Player\u2019s Guide in print and PDF. This is a 32-page book that gives new players a great overview of the setting and helps them think about the types of characters they might want to play. Like all of Ptolus, it\u2019s steeped in details that bring the setting to life, giving players not just a sense of the geography, events, factions, and important locales that shape the campaign, but also a real sense of atmosphere.  \nClick to download the free Ptolus Players Guide!\nThe Ptolus Player\u2019s Guide in PDF will be free for all players. In fact, you can download a preliminary version of it right now! You can also get it in print as part of this campaign\u2014you get five (enough for each player) if you back at HERO, COMMISSAR, or EMPEROR, and it\u2019s also available singly or in packs of five as an add-on.\nThe new Ptolus Player\u2019s Guide can be used by players of either 5e or the Cypher System. \nIn Ptolus, adventure and opportunity lie not just in the dungeons beneath your feet, but also throughout the city. And above it all looms the Spire, once (and perhaps still) home to a terrible evil. Will your party seek fortune and fame in newly discovered caverns and dank passageways, or in the palaces, temples, markets, and back alleys above ground? And will you gather sufficient strength to one day venture up the Spire itself?\nAs this Kickstarter approaches stretch goals, we'll ask you, the backers, to tell us where you'd like to adventure next. You'll have up to three options: the city streets, the dungeons beneath them, and, with enough experience, the Spire itself. The nature of the stretch goals unlocked depends on the direction you explore. Forays into the city will improve upon the premium features of the Ptolus book. Trips into the dungeon will unlock new treasures. And venturing up the Spire will lead you to entirely new content!\nPay close attention to our Kickstarter updates and the comments; they'll tell you when and how to vote for your stretch goal preference! \nHere's a look at the stretch goals we've unlocked so far:\nBook Upgrades: We are commissioning eight pages of new art. We might have some of it to show off before the Kickstarter ends! We have also expanded the number of physical handouts, game aids, and props in the extras packet that is included with the book.\nGM Screen:  A four-panel, landscape-format screen printed on nice, heavy board stock, filled with useful Ptolus-related GM info on one side, and fantastic Ptolus art on the other. It\u2019s equally useful to GMs of 5e and the Cypher System. Backers at RESIDENT and above get this reward in PDF; those at HERO and above also get it in print! (The print version is also available as an add-on.)\nGrip of the Ebon Hand: An adventure by Monte that pits the PCs against a chaos cult, introducing the players to one of the many major conflicts that make Ptolus such a dynamic, hook-laden setting. Originally run as a Gen Con adventure when Ptolus launched, this adventure presents some of the original campaign PCs as playable characters. In PDF. This reward goes to backers at RESIDENT and above.\nPtolus Character Portfolio: This 24-page, full-color booklet gives you everything you find on a character sheet, plus loads of extra room for notes, ideas, sketches, maps, and so on. Printed on heavy matte paper that takes pencil and eraser nicely. Backers at RESIDENT and above get this reward in PDF (in both print-optimized and screen-optimized, form-fillable versions); those at HERO and above also get a set of five in print! (The print version is also available as an add-on.)\nThe Doctrine of Ghul: A hefty adventure by Bruce R. Cordell. Talk of a newly-uncovered ancient manuscript scribed by the Half God himself swirls around Delver\u2019s Square. Is there any truth to these rumors, and if so, what does this mean for the city of Ptolus\u2014and the entire Empire? In PDF. This reward goes to backers at RESIDENT and above.\nNPC Deck: Scores of personalities from around the city. Each system-neutral card gives you quick access to a PC\u2019s name, appearance, personality, allies and opponents, and related information, and includes the page reference so you can look up further information and stats in the book. In PDF for backers at RESIDENT and above, and in print for HERO and above. (The print version is also available as an add-on.)\nThe Banewarrens: The PCs must act quickly to seal the Banes: a collection of the worst, most nightmarish objects, artifacts, and creatures imaginable. Binding them will involved delving into the dungeons as well as the streets of Ptolus\u2014but who can the PCs trust? A mega-adventure in both Cypher System and 5e versions, included in PDF for backers at RESIDENT and above.\nPtolus dice: Sets for both Cypher System and 5e, made by our good friends at Q-Workshop. See update #20 for a mockup and details. The two sets are both available as add-ons, and the EMPEROR level includes one set (your choice of which). \nThe Night of Dissolution: Picking up from the adventures in the Ptolus book, The Night of Dissolution pits player characters against the darkest foes the city has ever faced. Following the threads of a hidden conspiracy, the characters find themselves up against insane cultists, wild chaos magic, and horrors from the primordial days of the world. The Night of Dissolution will be converted for Cypher System and 5e, and added, in PDF, to the rewards of every backer at RESIDENT level or above. \nMonte Cook Games was founded in 2012 and our first product was Numenera, a standalone science-fantasy RPG and setting. Numenera has won just about every award a tabletop RPG can, and produced a line with dozens of supplements along with a licensed computer game, a board game, a deckbuilding game, and a short film.\nMonte Cook, creator of Ptolus, is our Creative Director and a veteran, hall-of-fame game designer with more than 30 years of professional design experience, much of it on products for Dungeons & Dragons\u2014and particularly as a lead designer of the third edition of that game. Likewise, most of the rest of the design staff at MCG, including Bruce R. Cordell and Sean K. Reynolds, possess decades of design experience with D&D.\nMCG is comprised of nine game-loving, talented, passionate people. In addition to the designers mentioned above, our team includes: Shanna Germain (MCG co-owner and Managing Editor), Charles Ryan (MCG co-owner and COO), Tammie Webb Ryan (Production and Administration Manager), Darcy Ross (Community Relations Coordinator), Jennifer Walls (Customer Support Coordinator), and Bear Weiter (Art Director).\nThe entire team at MCG is dedicated to producing extremely high quality, easy to use products. The nearly 200 products we have produced over the past eight years demonstrate this commitment. Check out some of our free sample products such as Ashes of the Sea and Escape From Jade Colossus.\nThe original Ptolus: Monte Cook\u2019s City by the Spire was published by Monte through his Malhavoc Press imprint in 2006. Although Monte Cook Games didn\u2019t exist at that time, we get frequent requests to bring this title back into existence. Many members of our staff played in the Ptolus world back when it was Monte\u2019s ongoing campaign\u2014some (Sean and Bruce) as regular members of the long-term campaign, and others (Charles, for example) as players in one-shot adventures that linked to that campaign. We all share a sense of connection to the setting. That\u2019s the simple reason we\u2019re doing this Kickstarter: so many people have asked for us to revisit a world we all love. And with Arcana of the Ancients, our first 5e compatible product releasing soon, this seemed like a great time to do it. \nYou might be wondering, \u201cHow do I select an add-on?\u201d It\u2019s easy. Select the Manage Your Pledge button on the right-hand side of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge by the amount listed for the add-on. For example, if you want Your Best Game Ever, add $50 to your pledge. It\u2019s that easy. After the campaign closes, we\u2019ll be using a service called Backerkit to collect your information, and at that time you can specify the add-on that you\u2019ve already paid for.\nWe have a lot of great rewards in this campaign, depending on what level you choose when you back us.\nHow does one get the stretch goals? If you're interested in PDFs only, the RESIDENT level includes all PDF stretch goals. All higher levels include them, too. If you want stretch goals for new books in print (and similar items, like GM screens and card decks), they start at the HERO level. It's possible that some non-book physical stretch goals might be offered only as add-ons. We'll be clear about that when those stretch goals are announced.\nVISITOR: Just want the PDF? This is your level. You'll actually get both versions (5e and Cypher System) for less than the regular price for either. It's a great Kickstarter-exclusive deal, but don't choose this level without at least considering becoming a RESIDENT.\nRESIDENT: You get all the rewards that a VISITOR gets. But you won't have to wait to start exploring Ptolus, because you also get the existing, 3e version of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire in PDF, along with over two dozen other Ptolus-related PDF titles\u2014a total of over 2100 pages, worth over $250. We'll deliver these to you via DriveThruRPG shortly after you fill out your BackerKit survey, which will open a few weeks after this campaign ends. You also get all the PDF stretch goals we unlock during this campaign. \nGUARD: All the PDFs! If you've heard great things about the Cypher System, or just want to give it a try, this level gives you everything you get as a RESIDENT, plus a PDF copy of the 416-page Cypher System Rulebook, which lets you run fast-paced, narrative, easy-on-the-GM games in any genre you can imagine. The Cypher System Rulebook PDF will be delivered to you via the MCG Shop shortly after you fill out your BackerKit survey, which will open a few weeks after this campaign ends. If you prefer print books, consider becoming a MASTER DELVER for a similar deal in print.\nDELVER: This is it! Your big, glorious copy of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire in print! You get everything included in the RESIDENT level, plus a print copy of Ptolus for either 5e or the Cypher System. (You'll tell us which version you want when you fill out your BackerKit survey a few weeks after this campaign closes.) And you get every PDF stretch goal unlocked during this campaign.\nMASTER DELVER: The Cypher System is the award-winning game engine that powers Numenera and The Strange. It's fast, flexible, easy to use, and super easy on the GM. This level gives you Ptolus for the Cypher System in print, along with the 416-page Cypher System Rulebook in both print and PDF (a total value of $90). Plus you get everything that a RESIDENT gets. Your CSR will be delivered to you via the MCG Shop shortly after you fill out your BackerKit survey, which will open a few weeks after this campaign ends. \nHERO: This level outfits your entire group\u2014you get everything you find in the DELVER level, along with five copies of the 32-page Ptolus Player's Guide, which introduces players to Ptolus and helps them make their characters. Plus you get all unlocked stretch goals in print. (But note, some physical stretch goals that are not books may not be included in this level.) \nCHAMPION: The ultimate in flexibility and collectibility. You get everything in DELVER, except you don't have to choose which version of Ptolus you get\u2014this level comes with both the 5e version and Cypher System version in print and PDF, at a very nice discount!\nCOMMISSAR: This level gets you all the campaign-readiness of the HERO level along with the flexibility of the CHAMPION. You get both versions (5e and Cypher System) of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire, along with five copies of the Ptolus Player's Guide. And all the other goodies from the RESIDENT level, plus every PDF unlocked during this campaign.\nEMPEROR: With this level you get every reward this campaign funds. (That doesn't necessarily include existing products included in lower levels, such as the Cypher System Rulebook.) Plus your print copies of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire are autographed by Monte himself. And you get every physical product we unlock via stretch goals. And to top it off you get a beautiful, oversized vinyl poster map of Ptolus\u2014fantastic on your gaming room wall, and useful in play! (See the Add-Ons graphic for details on the map; you can choose either of the two sizes. See the Backer Level graphic above for your precise rewards.)\nIMPORTANT NOTE \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" is Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. It also ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works:\n1.  When your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email it is time to redeem a reward.\n2.  You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or\u2014if this is your first MCG Kickstarter/purchase\u2014you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop (using the email address you gave us in BackerKit).\n3.  You\u2019ll go to your Coupons page at the MCG Shop, where you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You simply click on the reward coupon you want to redeem, and it is automatically added to your cart. Once you have everything you want in your cart, you check out.\n4.  You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nAll backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment.\nYou\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nPlease see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United Kingdom. UK backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but at this time, we cannot promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nEarly reward PDFs fulfilled via DriveThruRPG!\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.\nPromotion and fulfillment services provided by BackerKit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the seventeenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar. Tag yourself:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and they just keep getting bigger. So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet.

You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops.

This new co-op game from Corvus Belli involves a deeply immersive narrative component in which you are the protagonist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a widely recognized company in the world of Wargaming, and after almost 18 years of putting all our love and effort in them, we can say we make the best metal miniatures in the market. \n All of our miniatures are made at our headquarters in Spain, where we have our qualified personnel and all the required tools to make collector quality metal miniatures designed for the tabletop - as we have been doing for flagship Infinity Skirmish Game and previously, for our 15mm historic lines and Warcrow miniatures.\nInfinity Defiance will have the highest quality metal miniatures that we can offer, and we have put the greatest of care to ensure that assembly is as simple and user friendly as possible. \n Players of Infinity Defiance will enjoy a dungeon crawler based in the Infinity Universe whose turnkey miniatures are of exceptional quality unlike any other on the market.\nBased in the Infinity Universe, Infinity Defiance finds a group of heroes gathered by the human nations to stop an imminent assault by Combined Army forces - vicious aliens who have set their sites on the Human civilization. Aboard the Defiance, these heroes of the Human Sphere will fight against the alien invaders in a suicide mission with the sole objective of saving mankind.\nThey must travel through the Acheron wormhole, infiltrate into alien territory, and once there, destroy the new wormhole gate that is being built - which would give the EI the necessary jump stability to launch a full-scale attack.\n\nIn Infinity Defiance, up to four players control a commando unit of four elite soldiers in the Infinity Universe. Through several missions, the Characters will gain new skills and access to the best equipment and armament, until they reach the final mission - when the fate of the Human Sphere will be in their hands.\nEach mission is a survival challenge that\u2019s played on a modular board. \n\nPlayers must choose which Character to play, then draw their Character card and Equipment card.\nCharacter cards have tabs to place the Equipment cards. Players just need to put each similar icon together. If it does not have an icon it means it does not take up space. Additional equipment can be placed in their backpack. \nHeroes will face off against dangerous Enemies, who are controlled by an automatic Artificial Intelligence (AI) deck that is activated using alternating turns. Enemy Units have three difficulty levels, ranging from easy to hard: blue (rookie), red (veteran), and black (character).\nAt the beginning of the Round, you build the Initiative deck which will determine the order in which the enemy units will be activated. Each enemy Unit will draw a card from the AI deck and every Enemy in that Unit will attempt to perform, in order, the actions the card indicates - up to a maximum of 2 actions.\n If there are several options or situations to resolve the Instructions, the Evil AI rule must be applied.\nThe alert level, which represents the status of the Enemy\u2019s defensive systems, will change throughout the game, making the enemies more dangerous. Every time the alert level increases by one level, an immediate effect is applied and it will last until the end of the mission.\nEach time you make a roll, you will obtain a series of symbols from the dice. Equipment cards, Software cards, Specialty cards, and enemies, may spend those symbols to apply Effects via Switches.\nAs the Campaign advances, Characters may improve their combat skills through Specialty cards, which will allow you to choose the specialty best suited to your playing style or personal preferences.\n If you are a store and are interested in selling Infinity Defiance to your customers, you can find all the information you require in this link: https://www.infinitythegame.com/defiance-retail\n Freight costs are not collected in the campaign, but added at the end via the pledge manager.\nThese are some of the expenses estimated by region.

Reaching it is only part of the mission; at Terminus Point the Travellers will face a desperate battle to prevent mass extinction on a galactic scale, and literally go further than any Traveller has gone before.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Deepnight Revelation box set will initially contain four books, a card deck and a huge poster map, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks to expand the campaign, covering new adventures and regions of space that the Deepnight Revelation will travel through.\nDeepnight Legacy - a 32 page adventure that introduces the Travellers to their mammoth task.\nCampaign Guide - a 104 page book that lays out the immense scope of the campaign.\nReferee's Handbook - a 96 page book that guides the referee gently through the herculean task of running the campaign.\nTerminus Point - a 72 page adventure into the most distant and fantastical realms that forms the great finale of the Deepnight Revelation campaign!\nA giant poster map featuring deck plans of the Deepnight Endeavour, along with crew departments, while the reverse has a huge scale map depicting the expected route of the journey along the Great Rift and known points of interest.\nA deck of cards, covering Mission Briefings, Standing Orders, and Mission Roles.\nMost of the writing for the Deepnight Revelation box set is complete and you can download the first adventure included in the set (a work in progress, but fully playable), Deepnight Legacy, right HERE.\nDeepnight Legacy: The deep-rift outpost at Point XF-1402 has gone silent. Sent to investigate, the Travellers come under attack from the shambling remains of the crew. As the nature of the threat becomes apparent the Travellers face a terrible choice. They must ensure an alien entity never reaches an inhabited planet\u2026 even if it means they can never leave.\nCampaign Guide: A complete guide to the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation and her mission. The Campaign Guide details the Deepnight Entity and the ten year voyage to its hiding place at Terminus Point, the route of Deepnight Revelation and the regions of space she will pass through, along with incidents and adventures that will befall the intrepid crew.\nReferee's Handbook: The Referee\u2019s Handbook contains all the rules and information the referee needs to run an epic campaign of exploration at this magnitude. Using a resolution cycle developed specifically for this campaign, along with advanced rules for whole-crew endeavours, the Referee\u2019s Handbook makes resolving large scale tasks quick and simple. Whether the Travellers are decoding alien hieroglyphs, putting down a mutiny aboard their ship, or trying to prevent a critical system breakdown, the Referee\u2019s Handbook covers every eventuality.\nTerminus Point: At the mouth of the Great Rift lies Terminus Point. There, on the very edge of the spiral arm, the Travellers confront something that will consume all life in the galaxy. They have only the resources of their battered ship and weary crew; backup is a decade away even if the Travellers could call for help. They will fight with what they have, treading a thin line between extinction and revelation.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTraveller veterans will be familiar with the massive Pirates of Drinax campaign. When we came up with the idea for Deepnight Revelation, we knew it had vast potential that could be developed into a truly epic gaming experience with multiple side plots and new areas of space - making it perfect for a Kickstarter project.\nThe box set will contain the beginning and ends of the campaign, along with guidance for the referee to run exploration campaigns as the Travellers make their way along the Great Rift. However, Kickstarter gives us a chance to expand this greatly with specific adventures and regions of space to be encountered along the way, turning this into the greatest voyage made outside of Charted Space!\nThe 'Feels'\nWhen we embarked on this project, we knew we wanted to create something truly special. Your Travellers will be going far, far beyond Charted Space and we wanted to get across to them the true, terrible majesty of the universe. They will encounter and interact with black holes, neutron stars, and nebulae, while visiting hellworlds and planets lit dimly by a brown dwarf. This will be a trip like no other, and we wanted to make sure Travellers remembered it for the rest of their gaming lives, something that is far more than a simple episodic 'five year mission' style of game.\nTo that end, we have drawn upon many sources for inspiration, and recommend referees immerse themselves in the likes of the Cosmos TV series (both new and original), and films such as Sunshine and Interstellar. On a big 4k screen with full surround sound.\nThis is what we want your Travellers to experience during this campaign.\nYou can hear writer Martin Dougherty's thoughts on the campaign and contents of the box right here:\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Deepnight Revelation in your hands.\nThe Deepnight Revelation Commemorative Pack\nCitizens of the Third Imperium will be able to purchase a special commemorative pack to support the Deepnight Revelation mission - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Deepnight Revelation Officer level!\nIn the commemorative pack, you will find:\nThe unique Deepnight Revelation cloth mission patch\nA pad of blank Subsector Maps, ready for your exploration\nSix Deepnight Endeavour pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Deepnight Endeavour pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Deep Space Phenomena Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the mysteries of the universe\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Deepnight Endeavour dice\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (seriously, if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\nStretch Goals\nWe have a multitude of star systems and strange phenomena to explore, and we will be bringing you the deep mysteries of the galaxy via hardback books that explore specific regions of deep space and add additional adventures to the campaign.\n The Riftsedge Transit: We have added a new hardback book detailing the first leg of the mission! The Riftsedge Transit is exploration writ large, in which the Travellers will encounter new alien races and discover wonders never seen before. They will stand amid the ruins of a vanished civilisation and perhaps learn its fate, follow clues to the home of a starfaring species and launch a daring rescue to save new friends, then face a mature Deepnight Entity controlling a whole world, and learn the true power of their enemy.\nThe Near Side of Yonder: A hardback covering a region of 15 sectors directly spinward of Terra has been unlocked, in which the Travellers encounter three starfaring races which stand on the brink of war. The way forward is through their territory and helping one race will antagonise the others, perhaps triggering a devastating conflict, but the Travellers need allies and information. They could tread a careful path through local politics or turn the weapons of Deepnight Revelation upon any who oppose them.  Finally, the Travellers learn of a fleet assembling to tackle an enemy super-warship... and that they are the target. The Travellers' actions will determine if they face overwhelming odds or merely a tough fight.\nThe Crossing: A new hardback book that will see the Travellers searching for a way across the bulge where the Great Rift starts to curve rimward has been unlocked! However, the route is dangerous and a single mistake will doom the crew to a slow death in deep space. They must brave the greatest hazards of deep space; flaring stars, gravitational anomalies, and a deathtrap planet. The Travellers find evidence of those who trod this path before and learn more about the mysterious Leviathan, before reaching the distant shore. What appears to be a safe haven turns out to be even more deadly than the crossing, but there can be no turning back now.\nThe Far Side of Nowhere: The fourth expansion for the Deepnight Revelation campaign has been unlocked now we have reached the heady heights of \u00a365,000. By this time Deepnight Revelation is in poor condition and her crew weary. No sign has been seen of starfaring aliens for months, until a small outpost is discovered. The alien operators seem to find the Travellers familiar. Whilst they are puzzling over this, a trade ship arrives at the outpost. The crew are human. The Far Side of Nowhere represents a change of pace in the Deepnight Revelation campaign; a chance to return to some old-fashioned Traveller adventures. However, the stakes are higher than usual \u2013 a mis-step could terminate the expedition or force its abandonment.\nVoidshore: Voidshore has been unlocked! This book begins with a transit from the Far Side of Nowhere but focuses on exploration of the very fringe of the spiral arm. As the Travellers explore the region they become aware of another expedition in the area, leading to a tense encounter with other explorers. Whether these rivals become allies or enemies depends very much on the Travellers\u2019 attitude to them.\nThe overall theme in Voidshore returns to one of exploration and discovery, with the Travellers piecing together clues to find the route of a Droyne expedition. Finally, all preparations made, the Travellers stand on the edge of the spiral arm and plot a jump out into the unknown. Ahead lies Terminus Point and the final destination of their mission.\nExpeditions: If we reach the appropriately astronomical heights of \u00a3100,000, we will add Expeditions, the sixth Deepnight Endeavour hardback expansion. Expeditions (a working title!) is a set of adventures designed to be slotted into any portion of the mission, where the crew of the Deepnight Endeavour meet new civilisations, explore fascinating stellar phenomenon and, maybe, gain a few things that will aid them in their epic voyage.\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Deepnight Revelation to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!

Each stop along the way unlocks more fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\n!! VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !! \n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates.\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model.\n4) The bulk of our Kickstarter will be made in China. A tariff in excess of 50% or a ban on Chinese imports would seriously delay delivery and/or, in a worse case, shutdown this project entirely. If such an event occurs early on in this project, refunds (less charges and expense payments made) might be possible. If it occurs later in this project (after almost all expenses have been paid) there would be little and possibly no refunds. \n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment against loss or damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that helps us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays that are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and dock yard labor strikes are examples of delays out of our control. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to back it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nAlso we reserve the right to modify any model or piece of a model shown to meet cost and production requirements. Modifications may include the removal or addition of new parts to a model. \n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by August 31, 2020 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after August 31, 2020.\n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after April 30, 2021) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit.\n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges.\n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer.\n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wave 2 - United Kingdom (NOT Europe)", "descp": "2019 Bones 5 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 5 Kickstarter.

Resin miniatures are easy to put together, and take paint really well. However, they do sometimes need heating and bending to glue together perfectly, and sometimes have small holes to fill using modelling putty.\nWe always recommend washing the miniatures before assembly, using warm soapy water. If you need to bend any parts (the wings look great if they're bent out in an imposing way), heating them with hot water or a hair dryer will do it!\nYou can glue the miniatures together with superglue.\nYou can paint your miniatures however you like! We always advise undercoating the miniature with a spray coat of paint (either with a can or an airbrush) and then painting them with water-based acrylic paints.\nThe Clear Orange Ether Drake doesn't necessarily need painting though! It looks great as is, although the clear resin also takes paint with no problems, which means you could have translucent wings, a glowing inside, and regular outsides!\nThe 2-Up Ether Drake is a big one! These massive kits will take a little more work to prepare, but make an amazing display piece!\nFin, our in-house painter has put this one together and added some hefty magnets under the wings - that way it's easy to transport if you want to take it somewhere to show off!\nShown with an Infinity Authorised Bounty Hunter, a Games Workshop Primaris Space Marine and one of our own Dropfleet Commander UCM Battleships.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStellaris\u2122 is owned by Paradox Interactive, and the miniatures in this Kickstarter are produced by TTCombat.

In a nutshell, it\u2019s an epic 1-4 player massive campaign game of adventures, exploration, base building and fierce tactical battles with giant monsters. It\u2019s a fully co-operative, choice-driven boardgame played over multiple sessions, with over 200 hours worth of unique game content (1500+ cards!), a novel\u2019s worth of narrative and a slew of awesome miniatures (some almost 6 inches tall!).\nIt\u2019s a unique experience, merging ideas inspired by video games like XCOM, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter and the jrpg genre with modern tabletop boardgames, like KDM or 7th Continent.\n\nClick on a SG to learn more! \nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-ons, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Aeon Trespass: Odyssey Kickstarter page and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t need to choose specific add-ons at this stage, you will choose which ones you want after the end of the campaign, in our Pledge Manager.\nSounds simple? It is. If you have any further questions please refer to our FAQ, ask a question in the comment or message us at contact@aeontrespass.com.\nMAP TILES SET\nComes with a luxury version of the  tiles from the Prelude and all 3 Core Game campaigns. This is an optional material add-on. \nAeon Trespass is set in an alternate Antiquity, where a reality-shattering cataclysm killed the Olympian Gods and unleashed the scourge of the otherworldly Primordials. Players become Argonauts, warriors and scholars with the unique ability to control 30-foot tall Titans, the only creatures that stand a chance against these monsters!\nTake control of the greatest ship of the Great Sea  and its crew. Train your Argonauts, explore their veiled past and send them on adventures into the dangerous and mysterious lands of Ancient Greece (and beyond...). Learn the world's secrets and create new technologies that will give you an edge both in combat and outside of it. Manage your resources and develop your base of operations - the floating metropolis of Argo. Build new Facilities, craft new Weapons and equipment. Gather allies and forge political alliances with the world\u2019s factions. And, most important of all, tame the Titans, arm them, evolve them and ride them to battle with the fearsome Primordials.\nThis is a science fantasy setting, where the Ancient World mixes with wondrous technology and mysterious magic. These are mature stories with philosophical underpinnings, touching upon the themes of nihilism, totalitarianism, the cult of man, responsibility for your actions, hope and redemption. What does it mean to live in a world without gods? Do you stand for freedom or order? Do you believe in greater and lesser evils? What are you willing to do to see your vision of the world realized?\nAeon Trespass: Odyssey encompasses three different gameplays: the Strategic , the Narrative and the Tactical.\nThe Strategic\nOn the Strategic scale, you move the Argo on an explorable tile-based Map, gathering resources, finding clues, crafting Weapons, researching Technology, breeding Titans and so much more. Each campaign has its own hand-crafted map (with several interchangeable tiles that can change the layout from playthrough to playthrough or through your decisions) and follows a metroidvania-like style of exploration. On your journey, you\u2019ll visit the labyrinthine Crete, war-torn Sparta and time-locked Delphi and unearth their deepest secrets.\nThe Narrative \nWhenever you stumble upon an adventure hub - or reach a story point by some other means - you embark on an adventure. These are choose your own adventure-style encounters that will shape your characters, your crew and ship and the overall story. Aeon Trespass: Odyssey utilizes dynamic probabilities, a choice chain system and tracks your various decisions with a choice matrix. These are not your typical decisions either, as the game forces you to choose between empathy and strategy, resource management and compassion, the greater good at the cost of personal loss.\nEach adventure ties into the grand narrative of the campaign and the personal stories of your characters. With the Mnemos card narrative experience system you will learn about your Argonauts and develop them in surprising ways through Breakthrough story events.\nBest of all are the dynamic probabilities: as in life, a lot of your choices don\u2019t have a fixed outcome, they only influence it. This means that different combinations of choices lead to different outcomes. Even the same choice in a subsequent playthrough may have new and unforeseen consequences...\nThe Tactical\nFinally, when the monsters come knocking. You will suit up into a flesh-machine hybrid Titan and go to Battle. During these Battles, 1 to 4 players must cooperate to defeat a giant Primordial boss-type monster controlled by a sophisticated AI system.\nNot sold yet? Let\u2019s talk about the unique innovative mechanics and components.\nIn Aeon Trespass: Odyssey, Battles don\u2019t wind down, they heat up. Bruises and wounds don\u2019t make the Titans weaker, they make them soar! Primordials don\u2019t just get beaten, they power up!\nUnlike most games, the Battles in Aeon Trespass: Odyssey have a distinct heroic flow that\u2019s always on the uptake. You are playing heroes facing unimaginable evil. You will not back down and you will not be stopped. Each time you fall, you will stand up stronger. Each time you\u2019re knocked back, you\u2019ll punch harder. Death may be inevitable, but against all odds, you will take the punishing blows of the Primordial and roll with them! Remember how true heroes never stay down? How a beaten Goku finds some inner strength to unleash a locked away power and defeat his opponent? This is it.\nIn Aeon Trespass: Odyssey, there\u2019s no defeat snowball effect, no negative modifiers that keep stacking up, hindering your options and making you a glorified spectator. There is always a chance at a comeback. The closer you are to death, the more powerful you become. This is the heart of the Triskelion system.\n\nFen's First Impressions\n https://www.patreon.com/posts/29800471 \n\n\nFor more information, visit our FB page here and our BGG page here: there\u2019s a lot more art, photos, stories and illustrations there and we update almost daily!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are confident that we are very well-prepared.

We did everything we could to minimize it, but some things, like testing via home office, isn\u2019t as effective as normal. There\u2019s also \u2018morale losses\u2019, as people just aren\u2019t that productive with a pandemic looming over their heads and it\u2019s true even for the people that usually work remotely, like our artists. We\u2019ve been gathering info from all our partners throughout May, we\u2019ve also been looking at our internal output. The bad news is that it looks like we\u2019re going to have a delay of at least several weeks, which would put the fulfilment date around the end of Q1 2021. The good news is that it\u2019s mostly internal. The game is 99% asset ready \u2014 all the miniatures are sculpted, all the illustrations drawn. We\u2019re finishing up the additional pictograms and the updated UI (see below for new details), and the maps are being drawn as we speak (also see below). Barring a second pandemic outbreak, production will not be affected. We just want to take more time testing, writing and editing, as these are the areas of development that were affected the most. We could push for the original deadline, but I don\u2019t want to compromise the game. I also hope we can catch up with the Timeline, as we\u2019ve developed some useful tools to speed up testing."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 15759, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1492106834/aeon-trespass-odyssey", "project_name": "Aeon Trespass: Odyssey"}}, {"backer": "Rob Bessey", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THE UNTAMED: Still a Fool #1 Canyon Cover by Hyoung.

It proved there was a market for direct-to-video anime films, and paved the way for anime to become not just a niche genre, but a world-wide phenomenon.\nThe team that created Megazone 23 includes a Who's Who of anime legends, including (just to name a few) ISHIGURO Noboru (Macross, Yamato), ITANO Ichir\u014d (creator of the \u201cMacross Missile Massacre\u201d), MIYAO Gaku (Devil Hunter Y\u014dko), MIKIMOTO Haruhiko (Macross, Gunbuster), ANNO Hideaki (Evangelion), YATAGAI Kenichi (Bubblegum Crisis), ARAMAKI Shinji (Appleseed), HOSHIYAMA Hiroyuki (Dirty Pair), ARII Emu (Bubblegum Crash), SAGISU Shir\u014d (Evangelion), MORIMOTO Koji (The Animatrix), Y\u016aKI Nobuteru (Vision of Escaflowne), KAKINOUCHI Narumi and HIRANO Toshiki (Vampire Princess Miyu), UMETSU Yasuomi (Kite), and KITAZUME Hiroyuki (Gundam).\nWith your support, it will be our honor and pleasure to help create the definitive release of the series: the Megazone 23 Omega Edition.\nSynopsis\nYAHAGI Sh\u014dgo is a young man living in Tokyo in the mid-80s, enjoying life during a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity.\nOr so he thinks...\nIn reality he, and everyone he knows, are living in a carefully maintained illusion. Almost all are blissfully unaware that they are aboard a massive spaceship, Megazone 23. Only a few of the inhabitants of Megazone 23 know the truth -- that not only is the city a ship, but that it is controlled by Bahamut, an AI, and is in danger of attack from the mysterious Dezalg.\nWhen Sh\u014dgo stumbles upon the secret of Megazone 23, the military decides that he and his friends need to be silenced before they can interfere with their plans to hack Bahamut. Sh\u014dgo only has two things going for him \u2013 a motorcycle that is much more than it seems, and an acquaintance who is much less so!\nFeatured Artists\nTwo members of the original production team have agreed to provide new materials for this release.\nMIYAO Gaku is a manga artist, character designer, and animator, best known outside of Japan as the creator of Devil Hunter Y\u014dko. He worked on the mecha designs for Megazone 23, and is currently working on the charming manga series Cycle Shop Aoba (which has been running for 20 years and shows no signs of wearing out) and Second Life Animator, a time-travel story set in the anime industry.\nMIKIMOTO Haruhiko is an illustrator, character designer and manga artist, and in the past has also worked as an animator and animation director. He is renowned for his work on influential series such as Macross, Orguss, Gunbuster, Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, and, of course, for the design of Eve, the sentient computer program that runs Megazone 23. Current works include the original character designs for Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, and the manga Super Dimension Fortress MACROSS THE FIRST and Mobile Suit Gundam \u00c9cole du Ciel.\nContents of the Set\nThe Omega edition will be a significant superset (with a few minor possible exceptions; see below) of the Japanese Megazone 23 Blu-ray release. The core content (assuming no stretch goals are reached) will include:\nThe complete Megazone 23 saga (Parts I, II and III, using the new Japanese HD transfer) with the original uncompressed Japanese 2.0 and the ADV Films English 5.1 DTS audio tracks. Total runtime: 4h 4m (each is about 80m long).\nThe Megazone 23 Part II International Edition English dub (94m).\nAn assortment of Megazone 23 trailers.\nThe original ADV Films English commentary featuring Matt Greenfield, David Williams and Janice Williams.\nMulticolored non-SDH and SDH subtitle tracks and SDH captions for the Japanese program, SDH captions for the english program, and multicolored SDH subtitles for the commentary tracks.\nAll backers will be listed on the disc in a special feature and in a 9-panel poster insert in the Amaray case.\nExpanded Production Artbook containing significantly more content than the Japanese artbook (Premium set only). The Japanese book was about 64 pages, ours will probably end up over 100 pages long.\nSample settei pages from the Japanese Blu-ray Artbook (our version will be translated into English, of course!)\nIn addition, we are planning to include additional content if certain stretch goals are reached. These include:\nJapanese commentary featuring MIYAO Gaku and our returning champion, SATO Hiroki.\nUse of MIKIMOTO Haruhiko's outstanding new Eve painting.\nNew artwork created by Mr. Mikimoto for this edition.\n8-page Megazone 23 manga created and illustrated by Mr. Miyao.\nFinally, there are several items that we hope to include, but which require additional work to ensure that we have the appropriate rights to use them and usable materials.\nThey include:\nA series of music videos featuring MIYASATO Kumi that were included in the Japanese release.\nThe Streamline Pictures English dub of Megazone 23 Part I.\nThe Manga Entertainment English dub of Megazone 23 Part III.\nOther materials being unearthed by our crack team of combat anime archaeologists.\nWe cannot guarantee that including any these will be possible, so you should consider them to be \"icing on the cake\".\nThe Basic set will consist of 2 BD50 Blu-rays and the poster in a dual-disc Amaray case with reversible cover insert. The discs will not be region locked. The Premium set adds the production artbook and a chipboard case. As with our previous releases, the Omega Edition is a limited-edition and there will be only one pressing.\nThe Basic Set from our Riding Bean project, showing the Amaray case and some of the inserts.\nA Premium Set from our Otaku no Video project - includes the Blu-ray in Amaray case and an artbook in a chipboard collector's case\nReward Levels\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials) - $5\nOnline access to all the art and other production documentation, plus you will be listed on the disc and Amaray poster insert.\nBasic - $60 + shipping\nThe basic set, 2 BD50 Blu-rays + poster insert. Includes all the digital rewards.\nPremium - $90 + shipping\nThe basic set plus the Production Artbook, together in a sturdy chipboard box.\nPatron - $200 + shipping\nIncludes everything in Premium, plus you will be listed as a Patron when the disc loads in addition to your listing in the regular disc feature.\nProminent Patron - $300 + shipping - Limited Reward: 20 Available\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will be listed on the first page of the list of Patrons in a larger, more important font.\nPerfectionist Patron - $500 + shipping - Limited Reward: 5 Available\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will receive a set of the production check discs. Note that any bugs in the final discs will be your fault! :)\nPortrait Patron - $600 + shipping\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will receive a Magnificent Meter of Mikimoto, a 40x30\" (100x75cm) limited edition gicl\u00e9e canvas print of art by Mr. Mikimoto, personally signed by the artist. For backers in the USA, this print comes framed and ready to hang. Due to postal size limitations, international backers will receive the print in rolled form and will have to get it stretched locally.\nIf a stretch goal results in Mr. Mikimoto creating new art for this release, backers will have their choice of that art or the image he created for the Japanese Blu-ray release.\nA smaller (24x18\") digitally-signed version of this reward will also be available as an add-on goodie; see below for more details.\nSmaller 24x18\" test print (Project manager who thinks he's on YouTube included for scale)\nPearlescent Patron - Current Price: $2250 - Limited Reward: 10 Total\nIncludes everything in Prominent Patron, plus Mr. Mikimoto will create a colorful shikishi based on your request and inscribe it to you personally. It must be related to Megazone 23, and it must be personally inscribed; these are not intended for resale.\nThe price of this reward may drop occasionally until it sells out or reaches a reserve price. All backers who select this reward will get the same price as the final backer. \nDue to the way Kickstarter works (we can't change the price of a reward after someone selects it), all backers will be initially be charged whatever the price was when the first person selected this reward ($2500), but we will issue partial refunds shortly after the campaign concludes.\nHere are some samples Mr. Mikimoto has provided us to give you an idea of what he will deliver.\nPurrfect Patron - Current Price: $2250 - Limited Reward: 10 Total\nIncludes everything in Prominent Patron, plus Mr. Miyao will create a colorful shikishi based on your request and inscribe it to you. It must be related to Megazone 23 or one of Mr. Miyao's manga, and it must be personally inscribed; these are not intended for resale.\nThe price of this reward may drop occasionally until it sells out or reaches a reserve price. All backers who select this reward will get the same price as the final backer.\nDue to the way Kickstarter works (we can't change the price of a reward after someone selects it), all backers will be initially be charged whatever the price was when the first person selected this reward ($2500), but we will issue partial refunds shortly after the campaign concludes (currently $250).\nHere are some samples Mr. Miyao has provided us to give you an idea of what he will deliver.\n(You will also receive a personal apology from Robert for inflicting the Purrfect pun on you)\nImportant Shikishi Restrictions\nOnly one character per shikishi. You may make suggestions about situation, pose, clothing, etc., but these are suggestions only; they are not binding on the artist.\nShadowy Junta Leader - Current Price: $6000 - Limit: 1\nAll the rewards of Prominent Patron, 5 copies of the Premium set, one of each of the variants of the signed Mikimoto gicl\u00e9e prints (if we produce multiple options because Mr. Mikimoto creates additional art, you'll get one of each), and 5 of each goodie (except for the 24x18\" gicl\u00e9e prints, since they'd be redundant). Most importantly, you will be listed as the Shadowy Junta Leader on the packaging!\nThe price of this reward will reduce by $100 per day until it is chosen.\nStretch Goals\n$125,000 - Japanese commentary featuring MIYAO Gaku and our returning champion, SATO Hiroki. UNLOCKED on 08/27!\n$150,000 - Use of Mr. Mikimoto's Eve illustration created for the Japanese Blu-ray release, with additional tweaks by Mr. Mikimoto (a notorious perfectionist). This is the illustration we used as a test for the gicl\u00e9e canvas prints.\n$175,000 - New 8-page Megazone 23 manga created by Mr. Miyao. Will unlock 8 special Portrayed Patron rewards ($900), which result in you being depicted as a background character in the manga!\n$200,000 - A new \u201ccell-art\u201d Eve illustration by Mr. Mikimoto. In addition to being used in the packaging, it will be available as a gicl\u00e9e canvas print.\n$225,000 - New Secret History of Megazone 23 featurette by the team at Did You Know Anime?\n$250,000 - Mr. Mikimoto's new art will be upgraded to a painting similar in complexity to what he created for the Japanese release.\n$300,000, $400,000, $500,000: We have no idea! But you have great ideas, so with your help we'll come up with something really cool if need be! \nDetail on 24x18\" canvas gicl\u00e9e test print\nSocial Goals\nUse the hashtag #megazone23 on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook during the campaign period to unlock some extra bonus goodies, as follows:\n 1000 legit mentions: We'll add a Megazone 23 sticker to the set.\n 5000 legit mentions: We'll add an additional 9-panel poster insert to the set.\n 10000 legit mentions: We'll upgrade the sticker to a multiple-sticker sheet.\n 50000 legit mentions: We'll worry about this unlock when we have to! :)\nBy \"legit mentions\" we mean real posts by real people that aren't obviously intended just to inflate the count.\nTo help you out, here's a gallery of images you can use in your postings!\nClick to visit gallery\n\nRegional Availability - Currently USA Only\nCurrently, we only have rights to release Megazone 23 in the United States. We are working with the licensor to expand this to Canada and most of Europe, and may be able to do this during the campaign period. If so, we'll open up ordering outside of the USA.\nShipping Fees\nBasic Sets:\nUS: $7.\nElsewhere: $20. (if we obtain a license expansion)\nPremium Sets / Patrons:\nUS: $9.\nElsewhere: $30. (if we obtain a license expansion)\nShipping is flat-rate. If you subsequently add-on additional sets or goodies, there is no additional shipping charge. If we are able to ship internationally, we will use fulfillment warehouses in Canada / UK / EU to minimize customs fees for backers in those territories.\nGoodies!\nIn our Gunsmith Cats kickstarter, we created a variety of little extra goodies that were available as addons. We are doing the same on the Omega edition, but to keep the Kickstarter part as simple as possible, we'll be handling them as post-campaign add-ons.\nMost of our goodies have their origins in backer suggestions, so if you have a good idea, please let us know.\nCurrently planned Megazone 23 goodies include:\nEmbroidered Patch - $5.00\nChallenge Coin / Keychain - $8.00\nPin - $5.00\n24x18\" canvas gicl\u00e9e print (stretched if shipped to US destinations, rolled if shipped internationally) - $110.00 USA, $130.00 International.\n4\" Embroidered Patch created for Gunsmith Cats\nWith the exception of the gicl\u00e9e print, which is shipped separately, there is no additional shipping fee for goodies since we can include them with the main shipment.\nAll goodies are limited editions, and are only sold to owners of the Omega Edition.\nMultiple Rewards?\nJust like with the goodies, you will be able to addon extra rewards post-campaign using a form on our website. The one tricky issue is if you want multiple rewards that are limited in quantity. In this instance, we recommend that you pick the reward you want the most, and message to tell us about the other reward(s) you want. If they are available at the end of the campaign, you will have the opportunity to snag them at the differential cost. So for example, if you selected Portrait Patron and also wanted Prominent Patron, since both provide the basic Patron rewards, you'd only pay the difference ($100) between Patron and Prominent Patron.\nAddons from other limited-editions\nWe will also give backers the ability to addon items from our previous limited-edition sets (while supplies last) via a form on our website. This option is mostly useful as a convenience to minimize shipping cost, and currently it is largely a moot point since that mostly helps non-US backers (and currently we can't ship to them anyway)!\nWe still have copies available of all our limited-editions except Bubblegum Crisis (which was re-released in single-disc form after the limited-edition went out of print).\nMore information about our previous limited-editions can be found here.\nShout-Outs\nWe would like to thank Janice Williams, John Ledford, Jorden Callaghan, and Brady Hartel for their help providing additional materials for this release. You're the best!\nCopyrights\nMegazone 23 Parts I & II \u00a9 AIC, Inc. Megazone 23 Part III \u00a9 Flying Dog, Inc. Eve art \u00a9 MIKIMOTO Haruhiko.

In particular, one side-effect of the excellent feedback we get from backers is that we expect a certain amount of \"feature creep\" as people come up with great ideas that \"simply must be done\", and these tend to stretch the schedule a bit.\n\nOur policy is that when a critical-path item causes a delay, we use that extra time to try and improve other aspects of the project. All of our previous projects have ended up shipping a few months late (each time for new and \"interesting\" reasons), but what we ended up shipping was better than what it would have been if we'd hit our schedule.\n\nThe bottom line is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- we typically post updates every couple of weeks.\n\nSome people tell us that the stories we recount about things going wrong are one of their favorite parts of our projects, but we promise we don't do it deliberately. We don't have to fake incompetence, it just comes naturally.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Bahamut Backup", "descp": "Digital download of high-resolution artwork and production materials.\nINCLUDES:\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["108 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Basic", "descp": "International availability not yet confirmed.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x 1080p HD BD50 Blu-rays in Amaray Case\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["409 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Premium", "descp": "International availability not yet confirmed.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x 1080p HD BD50 Blu-rays in Amaray Case\nChipboard Collector Case with Production Artbook\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["849 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Patron", "descp": "You will be listed as a Patron when the disc loads.

For a very limited time, the datasphere is revealing secrets. Backers only: check out this update to access the vertice and see what secrets the datasphere is revealing!\n\n\nExplore a vast new realm. Uncover never-before-revealed secrets of how the ancients shaped the Ninth World. Face the legacy of those secrets\u2014and, possibly, the utter destruction of the Ninth World.\nThe Numenera: Liminal Shores Kickstarter seeks to fund three thematically linked, hardcover sourcebooks containing all new material for the award-winning phenomenon of the Numenera tabletop RPG. \nOver a billion years into the Earth's future, great civilizations have risen and fallen, each attaining wonders beyond our wildest dreams and furthest imaginings. The remnants of these civilizations shaped the Ninth World into a beautiful but weird place of both wonder and danger. \nYou have explored ruins of the ancient past and found the magic there called the numenera. You have wandered the Steadfast and the Beyond, to discover cities and peoples you never knew existed. You have dived the ocean deeps and found that there, too, lie wonders of the past. Perhaps you have even followed in the footsteps of the prior worlds and voyaged to the stars, or beyond. \nBut the Ninth World still has more unexplored places. One of them is all around us, even now. It\u2019s a network of ancient information, sustained by machines far above our heads circling the world far overhead. And it\u2019s much more than that. It is knowledge and secrets, but it\u2019s also a sort of place. A conceptual space. The datasphere.\nUp until now, people have only caught glimmers of the datasphere. But recently access points, called vertices, have been discovered. Those who find these access points can use them to explore a metaphysical space and plumb the depths of its mysteries. Further, they can use them to learn of new discoveries in the real world. Whole new lands to explore. And even to uncover the mysteries of the prior worlds, and the grand actions that took place aeons ago, affecting the Earth, the Sun, and the other planets. Actions that have an impact\u2014perhaps a massive impact\u2014on our world today.\nNumenera is a game about exploration and discovery. The three new hardcover books offered in this Kickstarter campaign give you all-new methods of exploration and incredible discoveries to be made. They will take your campaign to new heights while embracing the game\u2019s core focus. \nThis Kickstarter will help us launch three new hardcover sourcebooks for Numenera:\nVoices of the Datasphere\nNo other aspect of the Ninth World evokes as much wonder\u2014and generates as many questions from Numenera players\u2014as the datasphere. This hardcover sourcebook delves into the datasphere, making its mysteries yours to command!\nVoices of the Datasphere opens up a whole new aspect of game play, where characters interface with and explore the reaches of the datasphere. This strange new metaspace is not just an ancient alien data network, but in fact multiple such networks\u2014some damaged, incomplete, or aged or evolved past their original purpose\u2014created by myriad civilizations and interacting in unexpected ways. The datasphere offers knowledge to be learned, treasures to be discovered, and wholly new challenges to be overcome. \nLiminal Shore\nThis hardcover Numenera sourcebook offers a new land in the Ninth World, discovered only through clues found in the datasphere. What new people live there? What wonders do they command? Do they know more about the mysterious prior worlds than you do? Do they have cyphers and artifacts never before seen by anyone from the Steadfast or the Beyond? Liminal Shore will offer answers to all these questions, plus new creatures, new NPCs, and new adventures for your Numenera campaign. Be the first to explore a whole new land!\nEdge of the Sun\nThe sun\u2019s luminosity is increasing: a billion years from now, it should have all but swallowed the Earth. So how does the Ninth World even exist? And what happened to the planet Mercury? How, and why, was our world engineered to survive this long?\nThe beings of the prior worlds clearly did . . . something. And now, thanks to discoveries made in the datasphere, the PCs can find out what happened unimaginably long ago, and how those discoveries are vitally important to events transpiring even now.\nEdge of the Sun offers a jaw-dropping, entirely new adventuring locale out in the infinite void, and thrilling, epic, adventures that potentially affect the entirety of the Ninth World itself. Although it can be a part of any Numenera campaign, if you were ever looking for an incredible finale, this would fit the bill!\nAnd perhaps, with stretch goals, we will unlock even more books and additions to the game . . . \n\nWe have a lot of great rewards in this campaign, depending on what level you choose when you back us.\nNEW TO THE NINTH WORLD: This is a great level to take if you're just discovering Numenera and want to give it a try. The Numenera Starter Set has everything you need to start playing, and because it's an existing product, we'll ship your copy within weeks of the close of this campaign. But note: This backer level doesn't include the titles we're funding through this Kickstarter. To get those, you'll need to add them on (see Add-Ons, below). Or for the best deal, choose a different level and then add on the Numenera Starter Set.\nALL THREE PDFS: This is the level to choose if you just want the PDFs of the key titles being funded by this campaign.\nINTO THE DATASPHERE: Choose this level if you want PDFs of the three key titles from this campaign, plus PDFs of the follow-up titles that we hope to unlock through stretch goals. (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know we usually unlock a number of additional titles.) For the best deal, though, ONTO LIMINAL SHORES gives you all the same titles in print and PDF.\nALL THREE BOOKS: This is the level to choose if you want the hardcovers of the key titles\u2014plus you also get the PDFs.\nONTO LIMINAL SHORES: Choose this level if you want both the PDF and print versions of three key titles from this campaign, as well as all of the follow-up titles we hope to unlock through stretch goals. Who knows how far the campaign will go and what will get added by the end? (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know this will become a great deal.)\nAUTOGRAPHS: The same great deal as ONTO LIMINAL SHORES, but you get a hand-signed autographed bookplate with each book.\nPLAYTEST AND EARLY ACCESS: Just like with the ONTO LIMINAL SHORES level, you get everything this campaign unlocks, but you also get early access to the material and autographed bookplates for each title. Basically, you\u2019ll get the material when the playtesters do, and if you want you can provide feedback from your playtests like they do. You\u2019re not obligated to do so, though\u2014you can also just select this level and gain access to the manuscripts early. \nRetailers: The LIMINAL RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many Numenera products are right for your store, and to avoid tying up lots of cash between now and release. Your pledge gets you two copies each of the three titles funded by this campaign (Voices of the Datasphere, Liminal Shore, and Edge of the Sun). You may, at a later time, increase the quantity of these titles, and add additional titles funded by stretch goals. You\u2019ll pay for those additional titles, at a retail-friendly discount, at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Numenera point-of-purchase promo kit. For this retail backer level only, MCG covers domestic US shipping. \n\nAdd-ons are additional items you add to your reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-on items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nIMPORTANT NOTE \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" is Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward. It also lets you, the backer, redeem them at your convenience. \nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email. You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or (if this is your first MCG Kickstarter/purchase) you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop using the email address you gave us in BackerKit. Once you\u2019ve logged on to your MCG Shop account, you\u2019ll go to your Coupons page, and you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nAll backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. \nYou\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nPlease see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the UK. United Kingdom backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but due to Brexit uncertainty we cannot at this time promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the fifteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

We call this totally different BG experience a Dream Crawler \u2013 you will dive into surreal and artistically crafted world and follow one of a kind co-op / solo campaign adventure for 1-4 players. Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience. The constant state of discovery and the unknown keeps you glued to the table. The game mechanisms are well integrated and just pull you deeper and deeper into this dream world. A dream world I don\u2019t want to leave!\u201d \n- Rolling solo\n\"Etherfields is a magical combination of mechanics, card driven story, and an experience that just draws you in and does not want to let go. \"\n- theMCGuiRE review  \n\"Creative use of components and fantastic art really delivers on the idea of adventures in the dream world; creating an immersive and evocative experience.\"\n - Ready Steady Play \n\u201eAll in all, Etherfields is really, really unique and very, very cool game. Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

When Brooklynn and I first funded, we were in awe at the reception. We put ourselves out there and we were able to raise nearly $350,000 from an idea that we had no idea anyone even wanted.\n\nWhen you\u2019re just a couple of lowly artists and you see that amount of cash hit your bank account, you think you have all of the money in the world. And we spent it as such.\n\nWe immediately hired on two full-time employees, Brenna and Clayton. Without these two, we could not have made Middara the way that it is today. In retrospect though, we really didn\u2019t have a plan laid out to any degree. Brooklynn and I were poor managers. We threw ourselves into the position of an employer with no previous experience doing so. Full-time employees are expensive and when a project goes 3 years past it\u2019s deadline, calling it expensive is an understatement.\n\nA couple years after the campaign funded, the real gravity of the situation began to hit us. We received an invoice from Panda and our heart\u2019s sank. (And this was before we even saw the shipping quote!) There was no way we could make this happen without help. Many companies would have probably given up at this point, broken the news to their backers, or ghosted them completely. We\u2019ve seen it before. \n\nThe thing is, we knew we had something special. We playtested two times weekly, paying our friends in pizza, coffee, and beer. Everyone raved about the game. We\u2019d take Middara to conventions and people loved it. We\u2019d have regulars year after year, hanging out at our booth wanting to know more. I would sometimes find myself daydreaming about how I\u2019d build my character (I always play Zeke).\n\nPanda believed in Middara as well. It was a showpiece for them. Their employees were proud of the game. So we were able to negotiate a deal with them where they allowed us the our pre-production (PPC) without upfront payment. This was huge for us.\n\nThe game looked incredible, even in its unfinished form.\n\nWe showed this PPC off and the reception was spectacular. Our backers were very impressed!\n\nSo, we finally had something to show off. I started Google searching ideas for where I could raise some capital to finish what we started. There were some local start-up incubators in Salt Lake City that I was able to get in contact with and I applied online to pitch my idea to them. They initially laughed when I told them that I had a board game to bring in, but after they saw Middara, they changed their tune pretty quick. When people think of a board game, they think of Monopoly. This was not Monopoly. \n\nWe would meticulously plan out or pitches but we\u2019d have so much interest from the crowd that the pitch would quickly devolve into a 20 minute Q&A session. We didn\u2019t mind. It was exciting to see the interest.\n\nNot to bore anyone with the details (if you\u2019re interested go ahead and email me at alex@succubuspublishing.com) but we hit the pavement hard. We pitched to EVERYONE. Angel networks, friends and family, VC firms, other board game companies, banks, online creditors\u2026 you name it. Giving up was never an option for us. We probably ended up pitching to over 100 different potential investors / funders.\n\nAfter all this practice, we started getting good at it. We became even more confident in Middara. And when you\u2019re meeting constantly with these types of people, you learn about the real inner workings of a healthy business.\n\nBrooklynn and I joke that we\u2019ve earned our business degrees in the last year and a half from all the things we\u2019ve gone through. All the while, we remained positive and calm with our backers.\n \nWe knew we\u2019d make it happen.\n\nWe built up the confidence to pitch Middara to anyone. We ended up presenting in front of some very high net worth groups in Park City, Utah. Something that would\u2019ve terrified us a year prior.\n\nSo, long story short. We put everything on the line. We were able to recruit an amazing combination of partners on board with us. We were able to raise the capital we needed to fund the manufacturing and fulfillment of Middara and give us a runway to the reprint campaign that you\u2019re seeing today.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you this so that you feel bad for us. I\u2019m telling you this because I want you to feel confident in becoming a backer of Succubus Publishing knowing that we will never give up on you.\n\nWe now have a team behind us that can make a campaign like this one a reality.\n\nTo our returning backers, we love you guys with all of our hearts. You made our dreams come true. Brooklynn and I have struggled but it\u2019s been the best time of our lives.\n\nAnd to our new backers, we hope you\u2019ll join the ride with us.

This allows us to charge actual shipping costs just before we're ready to ship out rewards. For this reason...\nShipping costs are not included in your pledges for this campaign. You will be charged for shipping later, once rewards are ready to ship.\nThe above amounts INCLUDE S&H + VAT.\nFor example: If you live in Toronto and back at the Grimmerspace Core Tier, it should cost you $40.00 for your pledge + $12.17 for fulfillment = $52.17 (total cost).\nWe will ship all pledges from warehouses in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United States.\nUnfortunately, there is no easy way for us to collect or pay VAT for pledges made outside the countries / regions in the above list. If you do not live in one of those locations, you will be responsible for those fees when the product gets to you \u2013 most likely, having to pay them at the post office, if at all.\nRewards bound for these countries will not incur extra customs charges!\nStarfinder and associated marks and logos are trademarks of Paizo Inc., and are used under license.

As ENnie Award-winning freelancers and podcasters, we've written, authored, or edited over 2 million words for the roleplaying game industry and bring over 30 years combined industry experience to the table. Not to mention that separately, both Rone and I have launched and run successful businesses outside our gaming careers. And we've also consulted on or outright rescued struggling projects through Kickstarter; for example, forming business partnerships and then rolling up our sleeves to make sure the ENnie Award-winning Razor Coast and its related books finally got to Backers. \n\nWhile there is always risk starting a new company, we think the risks are minimal given our extensive business experience both in and outside the tabletop industry. However no one is an island, so Iron GM Games has signed agreements with Modiphius Entertainment and Gamerati, two companies with proven track records planning, executing, and delivering TTRPG Kickstarters. We believe their extensive, hands-on expertise, plus our other industry relationships, further mitigate these risks.\n\nWhile much of the design and development on Grimmerspace is complete and nearly half the art already purchased, it proved impossible to finish before the Kickstarter. Mostly because, until the Kickstarter completes, we won\u2019t know all the locations you want in the Grimmerspace books. And because every location in Grimmerspace gets an adventure, that means we just won't have a full list of adventures to write until after this Kickstarter. \n\nNonetheless, to ensure the highest quality work and swiftest delivery, we\u2019ve invited only top industry professionals with a history of meeting or exceeding deadlines to join our writing team. Of course, it is always possible for life to prevent a given designer from meeting obligations. Should that happen, we will tap our network and swiftly select a different writer to take over. With over nine top designers signed to the project and nearly a dozen equally proven people \u201con the bench,\" we are confident that our schedule is reasonable, achievable, and that we can minimize any delays that may arise.\n\nLast but not least: In recent months political factors, such as Brexit in the UK and a growing trade war with China, introduced increasing uncertainty into the publishing and tabletop games industries. To mitigate the cost and production risks posed by volatile markets we have already sourced additional solutions with printers and manufacturers in the United States, Lithuania, and Korea.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Space", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPDF copies of all Grimmerspace books\nAll Digital Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["1,024 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "The Endless Mall", "descp": "RETAILERS ONLY: Your rewards will be shipped before any product is offered to distributors.

Most evident is our new, easier-to-use format. The original Traveller, many years ago, was three Little Black Books (LBBs) - 48-page black-covered booklets with the titles Characters and Combat, Starships, and Worlds and Adventures. We're formatting this edition as three Big Black Books (BBBs) with the same titles, but 280 pages (Book 1) or more (304 pages for Book 2 and Book 3), and all in a slip case.  \nThe T5 Core Rules Set\nWe have been working on this project constantly since 2015. Oh, there were breaks along the way. After the last printing, I was inspired to write the Traveller novel: Agent of the Imperium; somewhere in there, I had a quadruple bypass (I'm recovered, thank you). But we've been playing Traveller5 and working through its rules and concepts.\nThe Three Core Rules Books\nNow is the time for a reprint. \nAdventuring In The Traveller5 Universe. The Traveller5 Core Rules are a foundation, and  they support all sorts of adventuring within the rich Traveller universe. To help get everyone started, we have created a set of five Traveller EPIC Adventures: \"The Voyages of the Free Trader Insert-Name-Here.\" This 32-page PDF follows the exploits of any Free Trader as it wanders through Regina subsector in the Spinward Marches. We'll release it at the same time the physical books ship (that is, in August). \nAdventuring In Regina Subsector: our introductory EPIC adventures\nCards. If you have ordered anything from us in the past few years, you have probably gotten a few cards stuck in your order. We find these are great pieces to use in adventuring. So we have created the Traveller5 Benefits Deck - 54 Poker Cards in a box (subject to some last minute changes): \n12 ships (Beowulf, Scout, Yacht, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, as encounters, or as goals for adventure.\n12 worlds (Regina, Capital, Rhylanor, and more) for use as homeworlds, interesting places, or as destinations.\n12 weapons (StapleGun, Magnum, Advanced Combat Rifle, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or available in the local weapons shop.\n 6 arcane tasks (Drive Tuning, Knack for Astrogation, and more) for acquisition in the course of adventures.\n 6 medals (Starburst for Extreme Heroism, Exemplary Service, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or as adventure hooks.\n 6 random items for use in adventures. \nJust a sampling; subject to change.\nThe Captain's Supplement (with the Ship captain Level) provides still more items.\nAdd-Ons.We also have three add-ons (they are included at the Owner-Aboard level) that enhance the Traveller system: Deck Plans, the Traveller Novel, and the Traveller Audiobook.\nThe Deck Plans were originally issued with the Big Black Book. This edition describes them in detail based on the Ship Design System, and we find they are a great resource for adventures. \nAdd the Deck Plans to your Pledge for $20.\nThe Traveller Novel - Agent of the Imperiumgives insights into the history of the Imperium. If you missed it, this is your chance to get reading copy, and the Audiobook (on two CDs; about 10 hours of audio). By the way, the Audiobook disks include the novel eBook, AND a footnoted PDF: 300 footnotes explaining and detailing what's going on in the story. \nAdd the Paperback to your pledge for $14.\nAdd the Audiobook to your pledge for $14.\nOr, add both to your pledge for $22.\nAdd Ons\nFinally, each level has one or more Crew ID Cards: Traders' Guild Member Cards with a pre-generated, named character corresponding to the Backer Level (and all the lower level cards as well). At the First Officer (and above) Level, we'll edit the name of the character to a name you specify (within reason).\nAside. This is intended to make you support at a higher level: to bump your pledge up so you'll get more of the cards. But I just can't do it. So everyone backing at a physical shipment level will get a set of at least five Crew ID cards taken from my pre-generated set of 40 or so ship crews. We'll do customizing at the First Officer (and above) level.\nExample Crew Cards (from Free Trader Aesir)\nUSB Flash Drive Option. For some of you, the CDROM format does not work. When you choose this option, we put the files on a USB Flash Drive instead of the CDROM. Add $5 for this option. \nAnd By The Way. Some of you may ask about the fabled Traveller5 Player's Manual. As we worked on this edition, we (that is, I, Marc, the designer) felt that we wanted to work out the bugs and details of the Core Rules before we then abridge them into a Player's Manual. It's still coming, and the PDF will go out to everyone who supported the original T5 and/or who supports this T5.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks, but we are well on the way to completion.

For those interested in seeing more of my work do check out my MyMiniFactory page here and follow my Facebook group here.\nI am a tabletop gamer at heart, and every single model I design is test printed, and often painted, by me before I release it for customer use, making tweaks/changes/fixes during the process as needed.  You will never get a model from me that I haven't printed on my own 3D FDM or resin printers (CR-10 and Asiga Pico Pro). Every one of my designs takes ease of printing and painting into consideration and I consciously make every effort to make these models as print friendly as possible while still making them works of art to look at. \nClick for more of my works on MyMiniFactory\nWhat's Next?\nYeah, that's right I'm already thinking to my next Kickstarter. \"Hath No Fury\" is now going to be my signature for my collections where I explore as much as I can in a theme with a mix of re-imagined and original content. So, what do you want to see next?\nHeaven hath no fury\nDwarves hath no fury\nThe Fey hath no fury\nThe undead hath no fury\nEldritch horrors hath no fury\nAccountability, Delivery Timeline, and More...\nEverybody hates waiting and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous Kickstarters.  In an effort to provide the best Kickstarter possible, I didn't consider launching this project until the core models were COMPLETELY DESIGNED AND TEST PRINTED! Everything offered in the core pledge is ready for delivery once the funds clear. I will be finalizing and releasing the stretch goal items as fast as humanly possible, with a time of 60 working days after this Kickstarter ends for delivery. All parts will be repaired, tested and ready for you to drop right into your slicer.\nDisclaimer & Printing Requirements\nTo get the most out of the printable parts from this Kickstarter, you will need to have a well-tuned 3D printer. For terrain/scatter and FDM printer capable of printing at a minimum .2mm layer height (ideally  .12mm) is ideal (such as an Ender 3). In the few cases where supports are needed, you can generate them with your slicer and they should work  great. For minis, a resin printer is ideal and all mini models are sized to fit on standard sized smaller resin print beds (such as an Anycubic Photon). Minis will print on FDM but are more challenging as supports will be required, but many people get great results printing FDM minis (or if you ever want a resin printer in the future, it's a great chance to snag these models for your collection at a steep discount now).\nEvery part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer. However, I am a hobbyist designer who has spent months working on this project in my spare time. In the event that any issues with the files get past my own QA testing and process and my other test printers, I will make  every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation. My number one goal is to make some awesome, unique designs you can have a ton of fun with on your tabletop!\nCredits\nTotal Table Top - Maker of the unique hellscape and ruins scenery in the photos.

My name is Mark and I am the owner and CEO of Mark James Creative. I started this business four years ago with an idea...and that idea led to our first product. Now present day we have over 25 products that we carry. I am now looking to add to that number with this new product.\nWe have found that the people that love beef jerky as much as we do love the BBQ flavor the most. But some people say \"you should get some heat on that\". So I listened and decided to run this combination. We are combining our Competition BBQ Beef Jerky with the heat that we use on our Sweet N Sassy Beef Jerky to create this new flavor.\nI have found that the heat on the Sassy Jerky was too much for a lot of people...including me. So we are working on the right combination with the bbq flavor to keep that bbq taste and add in heat so that neither one over powers the other. Delicate balancing act to say the least!!\n We have been working on this project for only a couple of weeks. So testing and sampling will still take some time. By the time this campaign ends we should be ready for production. The team we work with at Geiss Meats is fabulous.\nThey take these guys...\n They turn them into this...\n Then add in some of this...\n Then combine with some of this...\n What you get is a master piece of meat!!\nOur campaign is to raise enough funds to complete every aspect of this new flavor venture. That covers recipe submission, testing, sampling, packaging, labels and finally order filling.\nSo find the pledge that works best for you and help us out. You can also spread the word about this campaign with your family and friends. You can also go here:\n   You can also find us here:\n   Campaign Stretch Goal:\nNo campaign is complete unless you can offer a stretch goal. So here is mine.

Technology puts the tools to defeat death, emancipate from need, and reshape bodies and minds in the hands of everyone, but it also provides the means for oppression and mass destruction. After losing Earth in a war with AIs, transhumanity disperses throughout the solar system and beyond, struggling to survive. In a typical Eclipse Phase game, characters belong to Firewall, a secret, cross-faction organization that protects transhumanity from extinction threats. Alternate campaigns involve traversing the mysterious Pandora gates to explore extrasolar worlds or navigating the treacherous terrain of high-tech criminal cartels.\nThe first edition of Eclipse Phase won numerous awards (2010 Origins Award for Best RPG, 2010 ENnie Gold for Best Writing, and 2010 ENnie Silvers for Best Cover Art and Product of the Year) and was critically acclaimed for the innovation and depth of its setting. The Eclipse Phase line is recognized for its creativity, world-building, amazing artwork, and high production standards.\nAbout Eclipse Phase, Second Edition\nEclipse Phase, Second Edition (EP2), is a full-color, hardcover tabletop RPG book. It contains the full rules for making and playing Eclipse Phase characters, four sample teams of four characters each, and detailed setting information\u2014a complete roleplaying game in one book!\nEP2 will be in gaming stores after the Kickstarter ships, and will be a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licensed release!\nEclipse Phase, Second Edition Cover\nWhat\u2019s New in EP2?\nWe\u2019re focusing on improving and simplifying the existing Eclipse Phase system, not re-inventing the wheel. Changes include:\nFaster Character Creation \u2014 A package-buy character creation system lets people build characters quickly without missing essentials.\nStreamlined Resleeving \u2014 An aptitude-linked pool system means that skills don\u2019t need to be recalculated when a character resleeves (switches bodies).\nUpdated Gameplay \u2014 We've reduced the number of skills and made them easier to acquire. Gear costs are replaced with a system that works the same whether you are buying gear, acquiring it with rep favors, or nano-fabbing. Combat, hacking, and other systems are also updated.\nFour Sample Teams \u2014 Pre-fabbed teams can be dropped right into a game and serve as examples of balanced parties.\nRedesigned Book \u2014 A spread-based organization keeps material close-at-hand with less page-flipping.\nMost first-edition source material is compatible with EP2.\nOpen Playtest\nOur Open Playtest of the EP2 system has started, and will continue into June 2017. You can download the playtest packet for free on DriveThruRPG.\nStretch Goals\nThe Eclipse Phase, Second Edition campaign unlocked the following stretch goals:\nFreelancer Bonus and Freelance Bonus 2\nNPC File Volume 2 (Digital Stretch Goal)\nYour Whispering Muse Series 1 (Digital Stretch Goal)\nEclipse Phase, Second Edition Player's Guide (Digital Stretch Goal)\nAmbient Album from Scott Fox (Digital Stretch Goal)\nXenovore gatecrashing adventure for Eclipse Phase, Second Edition & Transhumanity's Fate (Digital Stretch Goal)\nOfficial Eclipse Phase, Second Edition Wiki\nIntroductory Adventure from Jack Graham (Digital Stretch Goal)\nThe Digital Stretch Goals will be made available to backers first, and then released for sale to the public!\nDelivery Dates\nOur electronic release date for Eclipse Phase, Second Edition is in August. The print version is projected to ship in October, with electronic stretch goals to follow into 2018.\nWe will be using BackerKit to manage add-ons and handle shipping.

Authors include Simon Berman, Rob Boyle, Katherine Cross, Nathaniel Dean, Jack Graham, Travas Gunnell, Sarah Hood, Marc Huete, Jason Mical, Ross Payton, and Evie Smith.

We are game-industry veterans with over four decades of combined experience. We first published Eclipse Phase in 2009; originally through two different publishing partners, but on our own since 2011. We sell our traditionally printed books through game distributors to your friendly local game store, we offer print-on-demand for other books, and we sell in open electronic formats. All of our releases are Creative Commons licensed, which gives you the freedom to share them with your gaming group, make changes to the game as you like, and distribute those changes.\nVideo Credits\nVideo by Davidson Cole: davidsoncole.com\nAnimations by Justin Grizzoffi: speedwagonmovie.com\nThanks For Your Support!\nAs a small publisher, navigating the waters of RPG publishing is always difficult.

The production process for the book is well underway. The artwork for the book has been assigned and many pieces are already completed. The bulk of the writing is complete, and we'll be running an Open Playtest during the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nPosthuman Studios is a small company. As an owner-operated company, the health and happiness of our owners and the freelancers we hire is a high priority to us, and that means we sometimes run into unforeseen delays. That said, this is far from our first space rodeo.\n\nWe are likely printing Eclipse Phase, Second Edition, with a printer we have worked with in the past. We have a great relationship with them and have never had a major problem. The books will be shipped to an established game distributor and shipped to backers from there. We are only creating one other physical item for this Kickstarter campaign: a USB key with all our books on it. Keeping the number of physical items down keeps logistics simpler, for faster and more accurate deliveries.\n\nIn 2013, we ran a Kickstarter to fund Transhuman, a first-edition Eclipse Phase supplement. We delivered Transhuman before the end of 2013. We still have a few small electronic-only stretch goals left over from that project, and Transhuman backers have been recently appraised of their status.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "I'm buying at my local game store!", "descp": "Supporting the cause -- thank you!

Once she was Hope, a teenaged girl who is deceived by demons in an effort to save her mother\u2019s soul in Hell. She renounces her mortality for eternal life in Hell. To ensure her survival, she turns to the darkness within herself and begins a transformation into Lady Death. \nWHAT IS THE NEW STORY, LADY DEATH: MERCILESS ONSLAUGHT #1?\nHerr Reich, a rogue Nazi scientist has kidnapped Jake the last innocent in Hell because he suspects he is the key to enacting his master plan and conquering Hell.  But Lady Death ain\u2019t having it. Aided by Haxan and Hellrider, the diva of death plans to rescue Jake and dismantle everything Reich holds dear! Featuring the sadistic Frau Helga and introducing Eldritch princess Caprice and her sidekick Char, Thanatos, demon lord of Hell, Wargoth of the Everkind and newcomers Steelheart and Mr. Atticus Marrow.\nTHE DETAILS\nLady Death: Merciless Onslaught #1 is a 48-page, square-bound all new graphic novel that builds on the mythology we created in Chaos Rules #1, Damnation Game #1, Extinction Express #1, Oblivion Kiss #1.

Our iconic treks have sent vast numbers of players down to face dark adversaries beyond the reach of the sun. Fighting,dying and fighting again they have faced the blackest pits of a Demon's abyss.  \nWell, where else can we find new challenges?  \nMay we suggest the first step is looking up?  \nThe Starfinder Roleplaying Game  \nPaizo, the powers behind the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, are completing the final system check on the highly anticipated release of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. Based on the robust, yet familiar The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, The Starfinder Roleplaying Game will be taking fans of The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game forward in time and to the edge of space where familiar races, powers and creatures have been unleashed.  \nNow beyond the bounds of their home world they traverse and expand into the dark reaches. Where cryptic cultures, xenomorphic horrors, and merciless enemies are scattered across alien worlds. New technologies, arcana and untapped alien arcana can be discovered in the vastness of space.   \nWhich is where we come in...  \nScience Fantasy Frog God Style  \nFrog God Games is pleased to present to you its Starfinder Roleplaying Game Compatible Line, which, with your help, will release alongside Paizo's highly anticipated Starfinder Roleplaying Game: Core Rulebook \u2122 (expected August 2017).  We have seen the rules and are very excited to be supporting Paizo's foray into Science Fantasy. \nThe Starfinder Roleplaying Game compatible releases from Frog God Games consists of two full-color, 8.5 x 11 Hardcover Books: The Planetarium and the Tome of Aliens and a folio of six poster maps all available in both print and PDF format.\nPlanetarium  \nWhere to land?\nPresented in full-color, Frog God's Planetarium contains over a dozen new worlds filled with creatures, cultures and civilizations. Apex lifeforms, post-apocalyptic undead, and extraplanar dragons are found within these pages. All for your use as settings with built-in adventure seeds ready for the Starfinder Roleplaying Game campaigns you will be enjoying soon. \nNeed an ocean world? A high-tech planet? How about unexpected destinations like comets or gas giants? Detailed write ups of those and more are included in the Planetarium. Full color art and cartography for each planet (when appropriate) are provided by the talents of Alyssa Faden, Terry Pavlet, and Colin Chan.\nTome of Aliens  \nSpace may be cold but no player is going to feel lonely. Not with the Aliens coming from Frog God. This full-color book contains over 120 creatures for the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. With a copy of the Tome of Aliens your extra-terrestrial needs will be satisfied. Each one is designed threaten your party using a similar creature creation philosophy to all of our popular fantasy products (basically, when in doubt lean toward scarier and hungrier). \nThe full color art was commissioned from outstanding artists gauranteeing the production values will be worthy of the quality beasts, sentients and, others dreamed up by our authors.\nThe Tome of Aliens will be out of this world. With your help it can get even better.\nStarship Deck Plans\n Alyssa Faden has designed and detailed six spacecraft- each with different purpose and style. Inside a protective folio are our Starship Deckplans posters- six poster maps with your game in mind. They will be released in both PDF and printed format. The interior of each ship is mapped and labeled for use at your gaming table. Each is in vivid color designed to look great whether used with virtual  or old-fashioned tabletops. Oh, and the hyperdrives aren't disabled!\nSamples by Starship Design Specialist Alyssa Faden.\n  Concept ships that might be your ride!\nThe PDF files are printable and we give owner's permission to print them at ANY size for personal use. The folio's poster maps were planned for your table's 28mm needs. \nThe dimensions are-\nThree maps using 6 panels (each panels being 8.5 x 11, so 17\"x33\")\nThree maps using 4 panels (3 maps of 17\"x 22\")  \nBe prepared for engaging encounters! Whether your party is planning on chasing space pirates or being space pirates nothing makes their adventures more fantastic than a starship. Give your group what they crave, select our Starship Deckplans as part of your pledge reward or as an add-on.\nStretch goals  \nAfter funding the value of your pledge grows with additional content and extras. Some of these will be rolled into the existing rewards (like more aliens in the Tome of Aliens). Others will unlock add-on options including alien decks, alien tokens and expanded PDF content.  \nPLUS!  This time higher project funding isn't just better for backers- it is better for the authors as well.

Every time we do laundry, our clothes shed tiny microfibers (including plastic), which go down the drains of our washing machines, through wastewater treatment facilities and into our waterways.\nEveryone who wears and washes clothes is part of this pollution. Everyone who eats or breathes could suffer the consequences. Learn more about the problem of microfiber pollution here. \nThis is a 120x magnified image of clothing microfibers filtered from washing machine effluent. One study found that a single fleece jacket could shed as many as 250,000 individual fibers per wash.\nOur team learned about the microfiber problem while working on marine debris along the US East Coast. It became clear very quickly that this could be the biggest pollution problem facing our ocean. We knew we needed a solution, and the ocean itself helped us come up with one.\nDesign Inspired by Nature\nMost washing machines do not have filters. The ones that do are only good to keep keys and coins from clogging your pipes. A standard filter cannot do what needs to be done: catch fibers too small for the human eye to see AND allow water flow.\nSo, we turned to nature. Coral does exactly what we need; it catches tiny things from flowing water.\nYou just drop, or throw it into your washing machine (any washing machine - front or top loaders, with and without center spindles) and do your wash as usual. It is easy to use and easy to clean.\nCora swooshes around in the laundry and just like coral, allows water to flow, while picking up those little pieces of microfiber and catching them in her stalks.\nWhen you take it out of the washer or dryer, have a look. When you see clumps of fuzz, just pull them out and put them in the trash bin along with your dryer lint. \nThis is the fuzz recovered from one load of doggie towels and blankets.\nThe Cora Ball was designed as an equal opportunity fiber catcher, helping you protect our public waterways from a host of potentially harmful materials and chemicals. In the US, our clothes are 60% plastic. The rest may be made from natural materials, but they are often covered in dyes, heavy metals and other chemicals. So, it makes sense to catch all of this manmade material before it ends up throughout the marine ecosystem, in the bellies of fish, and ultimately, on our plates.\nWe are working hard to find opportunities to upcycle or recycle the fuzz from your Cora Ball, the primary obstacle being the mixed-material nature of laundry lint (polyesters, nylons, polypropylene, cotton, wool, etc.). For now the trash is much better than the nearest river, lake or bay.\nThe Cora Ball will be made from 100% recycled plastic, both post-consumer and from manufacturing (would have gone to landfill). It is 100% recyclable and made in the USA (Vermont). Since we are using 100% recycled material, we have to go with whatever is out there. Most of it will be black, but every now and then, we will find a source for a color. So, the color of your Cora Ball will be a surprise of mostly black with either a clump of color or stripes.\nOur design is getting the attention of industry experts, featured at innovation events and in a variety of media:\nProtecting the Ocean with Each Laundry Load\nThis is about small collective actions having the power to achieve big results. If 10% of US households use a Cora Ball, we can keep the plastic equivalent of over 30 million water bottles from washing into our public waterways every year. That is enough water bottles to reach from New York City to London.\nYour use of a Cora Ball protects both air and water. The Cora ball's design collects microfibers until you remove them and put them in the trash. That means they will not re-attach to clothing and fly off into the air - only to become run-off and end up in our public waterways anyway.\n Cora Ball Backer Rewards\nAs a backer, you will be first to receive your Cora Ball(s) making you an early adopter of this solution to microfiber pollution. And, you\u2019ll get to share with friends, family and neighbors! \nBeyond the Cora, we have some additional rewards exclusive to the Kickstarter Community:\nInvitation to join our Innovation Team: we want this to be the best microfiber catching device it can be, innovation team members will receive insider communications and opportunities to do specific tests and provide feedback to help us strengthen and improve our design. \nJoin us on American Promise: Our work on Rozalia Project's oceanographic research vessel, American Promise, played a vital role in learning about the problem of microfiber pollution and developing a solution. She is a very special boat; a world-record holder and the greenest sailing research vessel in the world. Our top reward levels offer opportunities for a personalized tour, lunch or dinner with the captain, crew and at least one member of the Cora Ball inventor team and, at the $5,000 level, a full weekend as part of the crew working to protect the ocean on the Gulf of Maine. Read more about this extraordinary boat here and watch videos from various expeditions here.\nThe team behind the Cora Ball is all about ocean protection. We\u2019ve been on the case for 7 years and it was during this work that the Cora Ball was born. \nBrooke Winslow, our Technical Designer, at work.\nNot only have we developed a consumer solution to microfiber pollution, but we are working hard to better understand the problem as well. We conducted the first mountains to the sea microfiber study, sampling the entire Hudson River from the Adirondack Mountains to New York Harbor where the river meets the sea (video below) because we know that the better we understand a problem, the stronger our solution.\nPLAY\n\nThis is a true social enterprise: the success of the Cora Ball first and foremost means a cleaner ocean; secondly, proceeds support Rozalia Project\u2019s work cleaning and protecting the ocean and developing and implementing more solutions to the problem of marine debris. Learn more about Rozalia Project.\n The Technology Behind the Cora Ball\nMaterial: Made from 100% recycled and 100% recyclable plastic in the USA.\nRange of use: Useable in your washer and dryer. We've researched the high and low temperature settings in washers and dryers and selected a material that maintains its integrity within these ranges.\nEffectiveness: Catches up to 35% of the microfibers per load, per Cora Ball. The effectiveness depends on several factors including what items are in the load, wash settings and wash frequency. For maximum effectiveness, we recommend using 2-3 Cora Balls. We are constantly testing to learn how it works best and will always share our results.\nLimitations: The Cora Ball was designed to maximize both effectiveness and ease of use. Also, we wanted it to catch fibers from all of your clothes and textiles without having to separate. That said, we recommend that you do separate delicate items especially those with lace, tassels, crocheted sections or frayed threads, and do not wash them with your Cora Ball, as there is a chance they get caught in Cora's stalks.\nMagnified (125x) image of mixed fibers on a Cora Ball after a test load. Without the Cora Ball, these would have washed out the drain, through septic systems or wastewater treatment facilities and into our public waterways.\nYou will make this happen: This Kickstarter Campaign is the last piece of the puzzle, rather than the first. The molds are ordered, the patents filed.\nThis campaign is about production: As a backer, you will support the production of Cora Balls and help us get them to market faster. Getting them to market faster means we start protecting the ocean, its creatures and ultimately all of us, faster. \nWhat surpassing our initial goal means to this project\nThanks to a community of amazing backers and people who will make a small effort for big collective impact, we have far surpassed our initial funding goal. We want to share what that means for the Cora Ball, the ocean and Rozalia Project, and how hitting this campaign way out of the park makes a difference.\n1. It means a bigger impact protecting our ocean, lakes and rivers; the more people who have a Cora Ball, the sooner we start keeping microfiber out of our public waterways. And Kickstarter backers will get their Cora Balls first.\n2. A large community of backers demonstrates support that will allow us to develop stronger relationships with distribution partners who will get the Cora Ball to a broad market.\n3. Our initial $10,000 goal was the minimum it would take to go into production - this was the barest of minimums to make Cora Ball a reality - we would have been assembling them at the kitchen table. Exceeding that goal means a bigger first production run and correspondingly, a more efficient manufacturing and assembly process.\nWe are not going to mess around with stretch goals. We will keep spreading the word about this campaign and encourage participation. We will continue to work on streamlining our packaging and shipping plans. And we will keep in touch with you with updates as we bring the Cora Ball into the world and, together, make a difference.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we foresee has to do with the timing of getting Cora Balls out the door, rather than with making them in the first place. We\u2019ve tried to share a reasonable and achievable timeline for you to expect your rewards. We built in some extra time, but that could change due to unforeseen issues with manufacturing. We will keep in contact with you and share milestones as they happen. if there is a hold-up, we will explain why; if not, come July, we hope to be happily shipping Coras all over the world to get to work protecting our waterways.\n\nAs a team of scientists, educators, ship captains and ocean-lovers, we know that we don\u2019t know everything about bringing a product to market. But, we do know about attention to detail and that not everything happens to plan (especially as sailors and field-scientists dealing with changes in the weather). So, we have added people who do know about manufacturing and products to the team, we\u2019ve paid attention and worked hard to control the control-ables just like we would on our research vessel. And, just like when we are at sea, we will address whatever challenges we face by gathering all available information, assessing the options and making decisions, in this case, with the success of the Cora Ball, our team and our backers in mind.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Support a clean ocean!", "descp": "Thank you for taking action and supporting our work cleaning, educating, innovating and researching for a clean ocean.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["56 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Cora Ball x 1", "descp": "Make an impact at home with one Cora Ball.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5,350 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Cora Ball x 3", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends with a Cora Ball 3 pack.\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 3 Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,848 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "Innovation Team Pack: Cora Ball x 5", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends & a few neighbors, with a Cora Ball 5 pack plus limited edition t-shirt (100% organic cotton with nontoxic dyes) and invitation to be part of the Innovation Team.\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 5 Pack\nLimited edition t-shirt\nInnovation team invitation", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 450 or more", "title": "AmPro Tour Pack: Cora Ball x 10", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends plus a bunch of your neighbors with a Cora Ball 10 pack, a limited edition t-shirt (100% organic cotton with nontoxic dyes), an invitation to be part of the innovation team and a personalized tour of American Promise (with homemade cookies).\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 10 Pack\nLimited edition t-shirt\nInnovation team invitation\nPrivate tour of American Promise (+homemade cookies)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "Whole Block+ Pack: Cora Ball x 15", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends, and all of your neighbors with a Cora Ball 15 pack, a limited edition t-shirt (100% organic cotton with nontoxic dyes), an invitation to be part of the innovation team and lunch or dinner with the crew on American Promise.\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 15 Pack\nLimited edition t-shirt\nInnovation team invitation\nLunch or dinner on American Promise with the captain and crew", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5,000 or more", "title": "Join the team!", "descp": "Join our team on the American Promise.

As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. \nHere's a look at everything included in a base pledge:\nAnd all the Optional Buys you can get:\nClick to learn more about Dynasty Invasion, Playmat Board, Art Book, and Metal Coins.\nCreated by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage, with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey.\nChoose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle.\nEach of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies.\nKoi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable.\nKoi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nDragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next.\nDragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nBonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally.\nBonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nLotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray.\nLotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nTurtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces.\nTurtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nPlayed over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided.\nThe Political Mandates.\nDuring the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side.\nWhen players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits.\nKomainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite.\nOni of Skulls and Oni of Souls.\nOni of Hate and Oni of Blood.\nRiver Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure).\nThe miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic.\nAlliances are formed. Alliances are broken.\nAt the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances.\nDo not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale.\nThe Kami await the worshippers.\nWhen players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play.\nEach Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins. Sometimes losing a battle may win you the war.\nWhen Winter comes, all politics and fighting are over. Players gain extra points for winning battles in as many different provinces as possible, and also for certain upgrades they may have gathered. As the snow falls, the new Emperor will ascend! \nGame Components:\n58 Highly Detailed Miniatures, including 10 warriors for each clan and 8 huge monsters.\n40 Counter Bases\n137 Tokens\n5 Clan Screens\n5 Political Sheets\n53 Cards\n6-fold Gameboard\n1 Rulebook\nYou can take a look at the Work In Progress Rulebook HERE.\nFor $100 the Daimyo Pledge gets you a Rising Sun core game as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Phoenix monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock!\nThe Phoenix comes with its amazing miniature and Season card. \nThe Phoenix has otherworldly powers of resurrection.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Daimyo Pledge", "descp": "*Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nRising Sun Core Box\nPhoenix Exclusive Monster\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29,207 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Rising Sun on CMON Comics - Vol. 1!", "update_content": "Konnichiwa, honorable backers.\nWe hope you're safe and healthy.\nIt has been years since the Rising Sun campaign launched, and we knew right away that this was something especial.

Because of that, we asked fans of The Strange to let us know how much they'd like to see this. They responded enthusiastically. Since we love The Strange and its fans at Monte Cook Games, we decided to give them the most spectacular experience with The Strange that we can create with a deluxe boxed edition.\nAs you can probably imagine, we want to make it absolutely beautiful and crammed full of all the coolest extra content we can come up with: character sheets, XP cards with a brand new design, and maybe even a gorgeous cloth version of the Ardeyn poster map, if we hit some stretch goals. We did it once before, and with your help, we\u2019re going to make that dream a reality again, this time to create a deluxe boxed edition of The Strange! \n(Already own The Strange? Don't worry\u2014we've got some things that will interest you as well as those new to the game.)\n       Our \"sharefest\" goal was to get 100 shares of this Facebook post and 100 retweets of this Twitter post so Bruce would record a 10-minute video of himself reading an excerpt from Myth of the Maker, the novel that inspired the creation of The Strange RPG. We hit that goal, and you can now watch that reading video on our YouTube channel! Thank you very much for helping spread the word about this Kickstarter campaign! \nThe Strange RPG is where stories, movies, myths, novels, and even comics and games come alive in limited alternate dimensions called recursions. Player characters explore these recursions, accumulate treasures and wonders, and defend the Earth from entities they discover who are jealous of\u2014or want to consume\u2014the real world. Recursions float in a medium that scientists call dark energy, but that PCs call the Strange. Sometimes, fictional characters and creatures in a recursion wake to the realization that they\u2019re not real. Then they seek to break out of their limited dimensions and reach Earth. As do far more vast and completely alien creatures called planetovores that have been swimming in the Strange for who knows how many millions or billions of years.\nCritically acclaimed, The Strange was nominated for the Origins Award for Best New Roleplaying Game and received 3 ENnie awards, including awards for Best Setting, Best Game, and Best Art. A novel of The Strange is about to hit store shelves, called Myth Of The Maker. \nFor more about The Strange, please visit TheStrangeRPG.com.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\n  The standard edition of The Strange RPG is a stunningly beautiful 416-page hardcover. It\u2019s currently in print (and will remain so) and is available from the Monte Cook Games store, your local game store, and online sellers such as Amazon. So why a boxed edition?\nA few years ago we created a boxed edition of Numenera that proved incredibly popular. The Reliquary box we ended up with by the time the campaign was finished was nothing short of stunning. It even ended up winning a Golden ENnie award! And as we mentioned, fans of the Cypher System have been wondering when we\u2019d give The Strange the same treatment. That time has come at last.\nThe Strange Boxed Edition Is Exclusive to This Kickstarter This is your only chance to get this edition directly. Except through a select few retailers who might support this Kickstarter, the boxed set will not be available in stores.\nA Deluxe Box\nOne of the cool things about not selling this box through retail stores is that it doesn't have to be marked like a retail product. We can leave off the bar codes and sales text and that sort of stuff. That means the entire outside of the box can just reflect the amazing esthetic of The Strange. So we\u2019re going to make it look awesome\u2014front, back, and sides! The box itself will be of sturdy design, with a deluxe linen finish. It\u2019ll be a great way to carry The Strange around, and it\u2019ll look absolutely wonderful on your game shelf. \nThis boxed set is not a new edition for The Strange. The box (see THE STRANGE BOX backer level) will contain the same content you find in the existing hardcover rulebook, but in easy-to-use, smaller books. This way, the GM can be paging through the setting guide, and a player can be looking up a new ability at the same time.\nThe books in the box will all be softcovers. With the exceptions noted in the table above, their content is not different than the existing hardcover rulebook, so if you already have that, it's not new material. And, conversely, if you don\u2019t own The Strange yet, this box gives you all the game content you\u2019d find in the hardcover. It\u2019s the same game either way. The difference is in the format.\nWe think an ultimate boxed set edition could be so much more than just that, though. What we want to do is create a boxed set so deluxe that its mere existence will seed an entirely new recursion. As stretch goals are reached, the content described as already being in THE STRANGE BOX will be improved by additional components! \nThe LIBRARY OF IMPOSSIBLE THINGS\nThe LIBRARY level includes everything provided in THE STRANGE BOX, as described under the rewards to the right. Since it grows as we unlock stretch goals, the main page is the best place to see where we are at any given time.\nBut in addition to that, backers ALSO get a PDF copy of ALL the previously published books from the original game line. All told, that\u2019s a collection of 27 titles exceeding $150 in value.  \nThe ESTATE VAULT has all the contents of THE STRANGE BOX, which means that you get all the in-box and box-upgrade content added to the campaign thanks to stretch goals, which could significantly improve the size and contents of the box. (It also has all the additional titles of the LIBRARY level.) However, the ESTATE VAULT will be even more special and deluxe, as it will be handcrafted from wood! In addition, we will add a physical Estate Badge, a book safe for storing your dice or other secrets, and a deluxe dossier to keep track of your current cases. Finally, you will get every item added by stretch goals, even goals that are not in-box upgrades to content.\n    But I Already Have The Strange!\nDon\u2019t want all the content, but really want a deluxe box to keep your stuff for The Strange in? Back at JUST THE BOX backer level and get what it says: just the box. Your existing The Strange corebook will fit nicely within it, and there\u2019ll be space for two or three additional books, plus dice, pencils, an XP or Cypher deck or whatever, and so on. If you want more than one box, choose Empty Box as an Add-On.\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator to help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire.\nWant some helpful aid for calculating your total pledge amount if you want some add-ons? Go to the pledge calculator by clicking here. Once you know the total amount, return to the Kickstarter page and click Manage Your Pledge, then Change Your Pledge, then just add the new total into the Pledge Amount. You'll be able to specify the rewards you want after the campaign using BackerKit.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\nShipping and Reward Fulfillment\nSoon after the Kickstarter campaign for A Strange Box ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. \nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll send you an email with a coupon code to redeem them. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below. \n\nIf you change address between reward shipments, you won't need to tell us, since you'll enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient's shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward. \nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you. Plus, those of you in the UK and EU will not pay customs/importing fees.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMonte Cook Games has previously released a boxed edition of a similar-sized game (that being Numenera) to such great success that we\u2019re doing it again with The Strange. All our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards, and most campaigns are completely fulfilled, while those that are not continue to deliver their rewards on schedule. That means we\u2019ve delivered over 200,000 rewards. These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Strange, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, boxed sets, more than a dozen hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them. Especially considering that we\u2019ve created a deluxe boxed set edition for a different title not long ago.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record. Of course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, Ebola pandemics, or catastrophic solar flares. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once.

With this project, Plate Mail Games will bring professional audio backgrounds to several locations throughout the Ninth World. \n  Our goal is to create a 120-track audio collection containing locations from the following Numenera books:\nNumenera Core Book\nNumenera Guide Book\nInto the Deep\nInto the Night\nTorment, Tides of Numenera The Explorer's Guide Book \nInto the Outside \nThe Tracks from the Torment, Tides of Numenera The Explorer's Guide Book are not location sound that's part of the Torment video game.\nThe main collection will have 80 tracks, with 40 tracks of stretch goals available to unlock. The first four books on the list above will have 20   locations per book, giving GMs a wide variety of audio to use in their games. \nTorment, Tides of Numenera The Explorer's Guide Book has our first set of 20 stretch goals. Then we start unlocking Into the Outside, the newest book from Monte Cook Games, and it, too, will have 20 locations for stretch goals. The tracks will be delivered via DrivethruRPG in the form of a 320 kbps MP3 and a FLAC file.\n Click here for a complete track list.\nHow the tracks work.\nEach track is 10 minute long background location that loops. When you are preparing your adventure, you can create a playlist on your favorite audio software that plays MP3s, such as iTunes. When the group reaches the location in the game, you start the track on repeat and play out the scene there. The tracks add depth to the story without distracting form it. Then, when the players mover on, you move to the next location track. There are 80 base tracks at the $60 level, time wise that comes out to 13 hours of audio. If we unlock all the stretch goals, it comes out to 20 hours of audio. \nNumenera Sample Tracks\nHere are some samples I am currently working on. They may change slightly with their final version. \nThe Beanstalk \n Le Temple De Frogue\n Verber\n  My name is Wes Otis, and my wife Michelle and I are Plate Mail Games. I am a professional sound designer with 16 years of post production audio experience working for studios such as Disney and Warner Bros. I am also a gamer with a lifetime of gaming know how. I've been nominated for four Golden Reels and an Emmy for my work. Michelle is a composer with a Master of Music degree. She is a gamer as well who has a great understanding of what works best in gaming audio. She has been writing music for Plate Mail Games from the beginning. We have been designing sound for tabletop games for the past four years, creating hundreds of tracks for all genres. \nPlate Mail Games, like many small gaming companies, uses Kickstarter to help fund larger projects that otherwise would be impossible to us bankroll ourselves. It also gives us a sense of interest in a product line. This is our 8th Kickstarter, so we know the ins and outs of making sure you get the most for backing our project. \nWhere is the money going? 43% of the money raised goes to taxes, Kickstarter, bank fees, licensing, and Backerkit. The rest goes to covering the time it takes to make the tracks. If we unlock all the stretch goals, we will have raised enough money to upgrade some of my studio as well. Upgrades include new audio libraries, recording studio time, software, and gear. But, this is only if we do super well and the cost can be covered. I have a fully functional deathst... I mean studio. \n As mentioned, this is our 8th Kickstarter and we have created several hundred tracks over the past four years. Below, you will find add-ons that you can get through this Kickstarter.  Simply add the price of the bundle you would like to your base pledge, and you're all set. Older tracks will be sent out mid-June, after the Backerkit is locked down.

It took me 2 years and a lot of luck to compile these books into this set of 4 volumes.\nWith a total of 16 issues this was the 2nd longest running Vamperotica publication aside from the original comic series.\nEach book has a gorgeous Full Color Painted cover with Black & White Interiors.\nThank you for taking the time view this campaign.

There have been so many great designs in the past that I couldn\u2019t really think about anything original. Then, I had the most obvious idea and designed this Redundant Clock. I made one clock as a sample for the class, photographed it and put it on my website as a portfolio piece. \nOver the years, many people have been emailing me asking where they can buy it. Blogs and sites talked about it too. Unfortunately, as a graphic designer who didn't know much about product design, I couldn't figure out how make this into a product. More recently, I found out that someone liked the clock so much, he made one and posted it on Reddit. The post was so popular, it became the number one post. That was the turning point for me. I thought; there are so many people who seem to like the clock, I HAVE to figure out a way to make it into a product people can buy. After some research I found a perfect clock manufacturer. \nAfter months of design adjustments and rounds of prototypes, the Redundant Clock is finally ready to be manufactured. Now, it needs your support to make this happen. \nFor those who have difficulties reading the Redundant Clock, it comes with an easy and redundant instructions.\nThank you for your support!\nSpecifications: Diameter: 12 inch / 30.5cm \u2022 Depth: 1.5 inch / 4cm \u2022 Continuous sweep second hand movement \u2022 Plastic casing \u2022 Glass front \u2022 Made in China \u2022 Double A battery not included.\nRedundant Clock\nSide view\nDetail\nBack view (battery not included).\nDesign iterations\nPrototype and design iterations.\nRedundant Clock looks great in homes.\nIt also looks great in offices.\nHere's the final prototype in my home.

It's been working great with always accurate time, and it gets a lot of complements from the visitors : )\nRedundant instructions on how to read the Redundant Clock is also included.\nSomeone liked the Redundant Clock so much, he made his own prototype and posted on Reddit.

We are a small company and we rely on social media and word of mouth to let other people know about our game. That's where you come in!\nBy sharing this video on Facebook and this video on Twitter, we can reach hundreds of other families who have never heard about No Thank You, Evil!. If even just some of those families back this Kickstarter, that\u2019ll really help us hit stretch goals and give us more reasons to create other expansions for No Thank You, Evil! in the future.\nUPDATE Nov 7: YOU DID IT! You got 50 shares of the Facebook video and 50 shares of the Twitter video, so Shanna posted a video of herself reading Lucy Lawful and the Awful Waffle! (If you\u2019re not familiar with Lucy Lawful, it\u2019s a super-fun book that\u2019s available as part of the deluxe version of No Thank You, Evil. You can grab it in the I WANT TO BE EVEN MORE AWESOME! level.)\n  No Thank You, Evil! is an award-winning tabletop game of creative make-believe, adventure, and storytelling. In No Thank You, Evil!, each player creates a character based on a couple of cool, descriptive, imagination-firing traits. The Guide (a special role often played by a parent or older sibling) presents a dilemma, and the players set off on an adventure of the imagination. Along the way they use their character\u2019s special skills, companions, and equipment to overcome obstacles\u2014perhaps fighting a slime monster, winning over the suspicious mayor, or beating a rabbit at a race. Whereas conventional board games constrain players\u2019 actions, No Thank You, Evil! sets kids\u2019 imaginations free: Their options are limited only by what they can think up. Together, the players create a story as they work together to make their way through the adventure. For more detailed info on the setting, game rules, and characters, visit the No Thank You, Evil! web site.\nThe Standard Edition of No Thank You, Evil! contains everything you need to play, all in a beautiful, sturdy box designed to be easy for children to use. It includes:\n\u2022 No Thank You, Evil! rulebook\n\u2022 Let's Go On An Adventure! adventure book\n\u2022 Five dice\n\u2022 Character sheets\n\u2022 Cards for characters, creatures, and cyphers\n\u2022 Game tokens\n\nNo Thank You, Evil! was released in March, and is available at specialty tabletop game stores and from the Monte Cook Games website. This Kickstarter campaign is funding two expansions for the game.\nThis Kickstarter offers two new expansions to No Thank You, Evil!\nSTORY, PLEASE! An Adventure-Building Deck For No Thank You, Evil!\nStory, Please! is a 100-card deck stuffed full of evocative art and creative ideas, letting you quickly build hundreds of unique adventures for No Thank You, Evil!\nIt's easy: just combine an engaging STORY card with one or more cool PLACE and PERSON cards to outline your quest. Then give your adventure a surprising TWIST, and some cool STUFF. Map and handout cards complete the adventure.

An Adventure Expansion for No Thank You, Evil! \nUh-Oh, Monsters! is an adventure expansion that includes everything you need to run new adventures for No Thank You, Evil!\nClaws and Paws: The Monsters You'll Meet!

We anticipate you'll receive your product before it becomes available through conventional distribution channels, and you are welcome to offer it for sale ahead of the official street date. (NOTE: We anticipate that you will have Story, Please! as much as three months ahead of street date. We intend for that to be before Christmas, but we can\u2019t guarantee it.)\n      We've hit five stretch goals so far, and with your help, we can achieve even more! \n\nHere's how the Random Wheel of Stretch Goals Works: every time we hit a stretch goal, we're going to roll a d6 and see which stretch goal we achieve! \n\nOur next goal is set at $60,000. If we hit that, we will make Flying Colors: A Story Coloring Book!\n      REWARD FULFILLMENT  Soon after the No Thank You, Evil! The Adventures Continue Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\n\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll send you an email with a coupon code to redeem them. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\n\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE* Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you, since you will not be charged importing/customs fees.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42.

This is the 8th game-related Kickstarter that we've launched. All our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards, and we\u2019ve delivered nearly 200,000 rewards on schedule.\n\nBut every publishing project carries risks. We have a small staff, so if one of our team gets eaten by an argle-blargle, it would have a bigger impact on our work than a larger company might see. And we rely on outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks there we can\u2019t foresee or control. But we deal with those concerns all the time, and continue to put out high-quality work on schedule.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the danger of ninja attacks, zombie flash mobs, or aliens landing.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

Luxura\u2019s kingdom spreads out across the four corners of the Earth. Her monarchy is overseen from her vast, underground labyrinthine estate below the city of Manhattan in New York. \nHer complex is made up of caverns, tunnels and underground castles. She has several trophy rooms. She also has an extensive system of tunnels that lead to many above ground locations. Some of the above ground locations are buildings and business establishments owned by Luxura. \nAs a Judicious Kith(Vampire), Luxura fights to maintain the Vampire community\u2019s three Edicts of Survival: \n1. Sustain the Blood Source (mortals)  \n2. Regulate the Kith(vampires)\n3. Maintain Discretion.\nLuxura is an extensive collector, she collects items of sentimental value to her. Some of these items are suits of armor, skulls, swords, clothing and jewelry. She collects keepsakes from old lovers and enemies, or individuals that she found fascinating. She does not kill everyone that she collects blood or items from. \nHer most beloved of all her possessions is her collection of blood! In her subterranean manor, Luxura has an enormous Bloodvault which resembles a wine cellar. The vault houses thousands upon thousands of bottles. Stored within these bottles is the blood of humans, Kith and super natural creatures. Luxura has been collecting this blood for over 1000 years. \nEach bottle has a picture of whose blood is inside. Some of the older bottles have hand drawn pictures while some of the newer bottles have photographs. In this blood collection is every conceivable historical figure that you can think of, from Julius Ceaser to John F. Kennedy. She did not personally collect all of this Blood, some of it she purchased or received as gifts. \nOther Vampires also collect blood but Luxura\u2019s collection is the greatest of all. Her collection is preserved by a magic spell and talisman that she acquired from an ancient sorcerer, keeping the blood fresh, like the day it was first bled. Many in the Kith leadership have often wondered why she has been so obsessed with the collection and storage of blood. \nLuxura also has an extensive library and loves to read. She enjoys blood from humans that is filled with passion, desire, and lust. \nYou can find out even more about Luxura and read some of her stories at www.VampressLuxura.com or www.Vamperotica.com\nFans who are familiar with Luxura can now get all of her stories in one collection and those of you who have heard of or seen images of Luxura, can now read all of her stories.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThese items are completed and ready to ship.

And they wouldn't believe the price you pay.\nThree exciting, 192-page campaign settings from the creative minds at Monte Cook Games!\nThe Cypher System is an incredible tabletop roleplaying game engine that delivers all the narrative power and ease of play of Numenera to any campaign you want to run. The content in this Kickstarter will provide at least two full years of awesome Cypher System campaigns\u2014plus the tools and content to build your own incredible games\u2014all straight from the minds of the legendary Monte Cook Games creative team. We\u2019re brewing some awesome books, and if this campaign does well, we\u2019d add more cool stuff, like expanded rules and maybe even some fiction. \nWe're Monte Cook Games. Our team of eight dedicated gamers works hard to create tabletop roleplaying games that set new standards for creativity, production values, ease of play, and fun. Monte, Shanna, Bruce, and Dennis\u2014our core creative team\u2014have some awesome ideas for the Cypher System, and we want to bring them to your gaming table. Let us tell you a bit about them.\nThe Cypher System is the critically acclaimed, award-winning RPG ruleset that powers Numenera and The Strange. Character generation in the Cypher System is smooth and concept driven: Your character is literally defined by a sentence\u2014I\u2019m a [_____] [_____] who [_____s]. \nI'm a Driven Explorer who Hunts with Great Skill. \nI'm an Honorable Warrior who Stands Like a Bastion. \nI'm a Tongue-Tied Adept who Exists in Two Places at Once. \nYour stats, skills, abilities, and even your connections to the other characters are defined by those choices. Character creation is really easy, and puts concept first. At the GM\u2019s end of the table, the Cypher System is a dream to run. The game system frees you from onerous mechanical details and lets you focus on building awesome, imaginative campaigns, encounters, and stories. \n(Want to check it out? You can learn more here or download a free preview of it here.)  \nBut don\u2019t take our word for it. Here\u2019s what just a few of the reviews have said: \n\u201cThe basics of the Cypher System are as equally brilliant as they are simple.\u201d\n\u201cA real joy, taking the emergent gameplay of mechanically complex RPGs and blending them with the narrative flow of new-school games.\u201d \n\u201cThe Cypher System Rulebook is a master-class product that manages to become one of the most accessible generic rules I\u2019ve had a chance to see.\u201d \n\u201cMakes life really easy for the GM!\u201d \n\u201cEasy to learn, quick to play\u2026designed and custom tailored for\u2014anything you want to do!\u201d \nThe Cypher System Rulebook came out last summer, and now we want to take it to the next level. (Don\u2019t have the Cypher System Rulebook yet? It's available now, or you can get it through this Kickstarter campaign as an add-on or through the NEW TO THE CYPHER SYSTEM backer level.) We\u2019re creating a suite of support titles\u2014including three complete campaign settings\u2014that will give you at least two years\u2019 worth of awesome Cypher System gaming! \nHere\u2019s a little bit about why we\u2019re Kickstarting. If this isn\u2019t interesting to you, skip down to the next section and I\u2019ll talk a bit about what we want to make for you! \nA couple of years ago, after the amazingly successful launch of Numenera, we were working on The Strange, our next RPG. It was based on the same game engine\u2014the Cypher System. As Monte and Bruce worked on The Strange, they found that converting Numenera\u2019s rules to a new game\u2014even a game with an infinite number of micro-settings in almost every imaginable genre\u2014worked really well. Which got us thinking: Why not make those rules available for you to run your own campaigns, in any setting of your choice?\nThis was the genesis of the Cypher System Rulebook. At that time, though, we were still thinking this would be a minor release\u2014probably just a 160-page rulebook with little more than the existing core rules. But as Monte worked on the CSR, he kept finding more and more ways to make it better. The book\u2019s specs kept growing: A 224-page hardcover. A 320-pager. \nThe more Monte worked on it\u2014and the more we ran our own Cypher System adventures and campaigns\u2014the more we realized how awesome this book could be. By this time last year we\u2019d grown it into a full-sized, 416-page hardcover corebook. \nFor well over a year now, we\u2019ve been running our own Cypher System games. Horror. Superheroes. Space opera and hard science-fiction. Even dungeon crawls. And some of us have started building and running more unique standalone settings. Just as it took us a few months and some hands-on work realizing the Cypher System deserved full-fledged corebook treatment, we\u2019ve also come to realize that the CSR deserves full-fledged game line support. \nIf we\u2019d been thinking this way from the beginning, we would have Kickstarted the CSR. Why? \nA Kickstarter campaign lets us do things we can\u2019t do for a product\u2014or a line\u2014that goes to market in the conventional manner. We can reach for stretch goals that improve the product. We can add new titles. We learn from your feedback about what you like most in the product, and can tailor it accordingly. And we can take risks on things we think are really cool\u2014but that we couldn\u2019t gamble on in the old-fashioned publishing methods. Because we sort of evolved our way into it, we didn\u2019t do that for the Cypher System Rulebook. \nBut there\u2019s no time like the present!\nWe want to help you run great Cypher System campaigns. The place to start is, of course, the Cypher System Rulebook if you don't already have that. But we also want to give you new tools for making those games awesome and taking them into even more realms of play. We want to bring our vision for some cool settings to life, to fire your imagination for roleplaying games that go beyond what you\u2019ve seen before. We have a ton of ideas, and if this campaign goes like some of our previous campaigns, we think we\u2019ll be able to offer even more than our starting point. \nThe old gods are dead. Burning and crumbling, the divine realm dropped from the sky and smashed into the world like a vengeful star. The earth was plunged into darkness. Hope shriveled. Life has become cheap, brutal, and short. But from the ashes of this catastrophe, you can awaken your own divine spark. Claim a dominion; declare yourself the god of War, of the Hunt, of Winter, of Fire, or of the realm of your choice. And if you can complete your divine labors, fulfill prophecy, and throw down the despots that rose in place of the fallen gods, you might redeem a world fallen into evil. You might truly become\u2014a god! \nThis 192-page hardcover is epic fantasy of the highest order, but with the creative twists you expect from Monte Cook Games. Gods of the Fall is already written and in editing, and will ship in June. It does not rely on the success of this Kickstarter to be released\u2014although we do hope this campaign will allow some cool upgrades to the book through stretch goals. \nAn asteroid will soon wipe out all life on earth. You know this\u2014and you know when\u2014because it\u2019s in the history books your grandparents brought back to the Cretaceous period with them. Now your small society is trapped in prehistory, desperate to find a way back to your time. But at least you're not alone. You have tech, weapons, vehicles, and science from the future\u2014you even have the ability to bioengineer the dinosaurs around you. Can you use these tools to survive a dangerous world on the brink of extinction? \nIs that the sound of thunder you hear? \nPredation will be a 192-page hardcover. Like the other campaign settings funded by this campaign, it\u2019ll have setting info, new character options, creatures, cyphers, and everything you need to run a complete campaign.\nWhen they locked you up, you made the mask. When you wear it, you can do the impossible. Just like the comic books.\nBut the mask has always done more: It shows a world beyond the everyday grey skein of cities and people. Something golden and perfect. But the longer you wear it, the more your old self slips away. It's like drowning. But the power calls to you.\nThere are others like you, good, bad and indifferent. All searching for what they call Magonia\u2014the place from their ruined childhoods, where they once escaped from this broken down world. And they all know, as you know, that something terrible is coming.\nUnmasked is 192 pages of super-powered psychological horror. Like the other campaign settings funded by this campaign, it\u2019ll have setting info, new character options, creatures, cyphers, and everything you need to run a complete campaign.\nThe Asset Deck adds a whole new dimension to Cypher System gameplay. Assets are things that help you in completing tasks. They represent the circumstances being in your favor, the perfect tool for the job, and so on. Each card in this 100-card deck has the details of one such asset that a GM can award to a player and that the player can in turn choose to play at any time. Maybe a PC needs to talk her way out of being arrested by the police, and so the player plays the \"Perfect One-Liner\" card, suggesting that the character recalls that perfect joke at the perfect time, thus making the task easier. Or maybe a PC needs to pilot a starship through an asteroid field. The player plays the \"It's Like I've Been Here Before\" card, suggesting that he's either flown through it before, or seen a map or diagram in the past. These cards don't guarantee success, but they put some ability in the players' hands to control their fate.\nAnd More? \nWhat if we hit some stretch goals? In our previous campaigns, stretch goals have allowed us to add additional titles to the lineup, and we\u2019re hoping to do the same thing in this campaign. Among many other ideas, we\u2019d like to expand upon the content in the Cypher System Rulebook, add some support for The Strange\u2014and maybe even build upon the fiction line we launched in the Into the Ninth World Kickstarter campaign.\nMost of the backer levels to the right contain one or both of these packages.\nAll the Ebooks: You receive all the books funded by this campaign in PDF format, along with a PDF version of the Asset Deck. If we unlock new books as stretch goals, those PDFs are added to your rewards automagically!\nAll the Print Books: You receive all the print books funded by this campaign, as well as the Asset Deck in print. If we unlock new print books as stretch goals, you get them as part of your reward. Please see the shipping information, below. (International backers: Please be aware that international shipping is expensive. We subsidize a portion of your shipping, and you can bundle your rewards to save even more. But be sure to read the shipping section, below.)\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire.\nYou can find more details about all of our add-ons at the pledge calculator.\nAfter the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWe offer a variety of backer levels with some great rewards. The reward level details on the right can\u2019t be edited once a campaign is underway, but we can make changes to the words you\u2019re reading now\u2014so the notes below are up to date, including upgrades or additions we may make to the backer levels as the campaign progresses.\nULTIMATE CYPHER GM: Run your game with efficiency and style! Dice, the XP Deck, and a laminated GM quick-reference sheet keep things moving quickly at your game table. The gorgeous playmat is a beautiful centerpiece that puts useful info out where everyone can reference it. And a GM's portfolio keeps your notes, handouts, character sheets, and more handy and well organized. Plus you get a handy pad of 25 full-color character sheets and 18 pre-generated characters (six for each setting) in PDF format to print and use as you need.\nYou also get the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, and a custom autographed bookplate for each book. Details on shipping are below.\nPLAYTEST AND EARLY ACCESS: Gods of the Fall's playtesting is complete, but Predation and Unmasked will each have a playtest phase. As a backer at this level (and most of the higher levels), you can join the ranks of the official playtesters! You'll get all the playtest materials when the official playtest starts, and your playtest comments and observations are welcome (but not required, if you'd rather just enjoy the early access). You'll get your name in the acknowledgements of the product. NEW: This level now also includes GM Gear (see the add-on of that name to see what you get)!\nYou also get the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, and a custom autographed bookplate for each book. Details on shipping are below.\nCYPHER SYSTEM DESIGNER: The Cypher System is a unique game engine, with a number of design considerations that set it apart from other roleplaying games. At this level you'll get an invitation to an exclusive, live, online seminar with Monte. The topic will be the design of the Cypher System, with a peek behind the scenes at the hows and whys of the game. Monte will also talk about designing your own Cypher System material, for your home game or for publication. You'll be able to ask questions if you attend the live event, but it will also be recorded for later viewing if you miss it. NEW: This level now also includes GM Gear (see the add-on of that name to see what you get)!\nYou also get the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, a custom autographed bookplate for each book, and playtest access/acknowledgement. Details on shipping are below.\nCONTRIBUTOR and PATRON Levels: There are four backer levels that allow you to contribute to either Predation, with its bioengineered dinosaurs, or Unmasked and its mysterious, power-granting masks. You'll have to work within the guidelines provided by the designers for your contribution. The quality of our products is our first priority, so while we'll adhere as closely as we can to your contribution, our designers reserve the right to ask you to modify your suggestion, or to make changes themselves. Your name will be included in the book's acknowledgements. And your custom autographed bookplate for each book will include a special message from the designers. NEW: This level now also includes GM Gear (see the add-on of that name to see what you get)!\nYou also get the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, playtest access/acknowledgement, and an invitation to the design seminar. Details on shipping are below.\nGEN CON Game Levels: Going to Gen Con this year? How'd you like a private game with one of the designers as your GM? There are three backer levels that will be of interest to you. Bruce will host a game session of Gods of the Fall, Shanna will run a playtest of Predation, and Dennis will offer a playtest of Unmasked, all at Gen Con 2016. These three are not only great GMs, but in the Predation and Unmasked games, you'll be able to provide feedback that will shape the finished product. Gods of the Fall will be out by Gen Con, but the other titles will still be in development, so these will be actual playtest games. NEW: This level now also includes GM Gear (see the add-on of that name to see what you get)!\nYou also get the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, a custom autographed bookplate with a designer message for each book, playtest access/acknowledgement, and an invitation to the design seminar. Details on shipping are below.\nCREATIVE TEAM DINNER: Enjoy an evening with Monte, Bruce, Shanna, and Dennis! If you back at this level, you and a guest will join the MCG creative team for dinner and a friendly evening. If you aren't in the Seattle area you'll have to get yourself there.

Details on shipping are below.\nCOLLECTOR Levels: These are truly one-of-a-kind! You will have direct, personal access to Bruce, Shanna, or Dennis, and receive regular email updates about their work on Predation and Unmasked. (Bruce will be done with design on Gods of the Fall before this campaign ends, but he'll communicate about his Gods campaign and other ongoing design projects.) You'll get a personal Skype call with your designer. And when the development of the title is complete, you'll get a bunch of physical items from the process: Things like the author's design notebook, sketches of maps or images sent to our illustrators, actual character sheets used by our team during playtest, and physical props and handouts actually used in the designer's personal campaign. And perhaps a few additional items you can use in your game, hand-picked by the designer. We can't tell you exactly what you'll get\u2014we won't know until design is complete, and it will vary by designer\u2014but you can count on it being cool and utterly unique. And we'll send it all to you in a special keepsake box suitable for storing your own campaign materials as well. NEW: This level now also includes GM Gear (see the add-on of that name to see what you get)!\nYou also get the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, a custom autographed bookplate with designer message for each book, playtest access/acknowledgement, and an invitation to the design seminar. Details on shipping are below.\nCYPHER SYSTEM RETAILER: We love brick-and-mortar retailers! Support us at this level, and we'll send you six copies each of Gods of the Fall, Predation, and Unmasked, upgraded by our stretch goals, at a very retailer-friendly discount. The books will include any print upgrades that are exclusive to this campaign (poster maps, for example), including upgrades that won't be available through distribution. You will also have the option of adding on any additional titles offered through this campaign at an equivalent discount\u2014contact us via Kickstarter message for details. You'll receive each book as it comes out. We'll also send you an exclusive deluxe PoP promo kit. And we'll promote your store on our web site and to our tens of thousands of social media followers.\nDomestic shipping is included (if you're outside the US, contact us for a shipping estimate). We anticipate (but cannot guarantee) that you'll receive your books significantly ahead of street date, and you're welcome to sell as soon as you get them.\nThis backer level is only open to actual brick-and-mortar retail stores. Yes, we'll check!\nULTIMATE RETAILER: How would you like one of the designers to visit your store for a day of gaming and conversation? At this level you get all the benefits of the CYPHER SYSTEM RETAILER backer level, plus Bruce, Shanna, or Dennis will travel to your store for a daylong visit that will include running a game for your customers. (Please note that if you're outside North America, we'll have to make special arrangements for travel above and beyond the cost of this backer level.) We'll also write up an article about your store (to which you are welcome to contribute as much or as little as you like, subject to our regular editorial policy) which will appear on our website.\nThis backer level is only open to actual brick-and-mortar retail stores.\nBasic shipping in the United States is free. (If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.) \nInternational Backers: Shipping is not free! You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, but we\u2019ll subsidize $10 of your basic shipping cost. (In other words, if the cost to ship is $42, you\u2019ll pay $32.) Warning: international shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. We anticipate\u2014but cannot guarantee\u2014that our books will weigh about 2 pounds (0.9kg), but they are subject to spec changes, stretch goal upgrades, and the weight of packaging. Please also be aware that you may be responsible for import duties, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Duties are not included in your shipping charge.\nYou can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several titles shipped at once, if you like. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nShow your support for this campaign, and help spread the word\u2014the way we reach stretch goals is to get the word out to more potential backers. And every stretch goal makes our journey into the worlds of the Cypher System that much more exciting!

The crooks are a little ticked off to find out that Bean's flat rate fee accounts for almost all of the proceeds, but business is business.\nShe's gonna need a bigger stun-gun...\nThe next day, Bean and his heavily-armed assistant, Rally Vincent (deadly with both gun and frying pan), receive a visitor with a young girl in tow.\nMinor character Morris gets Majorly Messed Up\nThe visitor barely has time to beseech them to return the girl to her father before a hit-team swiss-cheeses Bean's apartment. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't have Bean's taste in clothes (all Kevlar, including his underwear!)\nProfessional Driver... Do not attempt!\nBean and Rally bundle little Chelsea into the car and make tracks. Alas, what they don't know is that the kidnappers have already made off with the $2,000,000 ransom, leaving them to take the rap. Will Bean discover the ruse in time and get the money for himself? Will he be able to evade the relentless pursuit of Inspector Percy? And most importantly, how much will the Chicago P.D.'s insurance company raise their rates?\nThis limited-edition Blu-Ray release is a \"High Octane Edition\" for a reason. We will be using the same uncompressed HD transfer as the recent Japanese release, but using a BD50 instead of BD25 for a higher bitrate. It will contain both the original Japanese soundtrack and the English dub, plus English subtitles in multicolor, greyscale and SDH variants (or you can watch with no subtitles if you prefer). The disc will not be region-coded, and we can ship it anywhere in the world except for Japan, China and Taiwan.\n(possible poster image; backers will vote on which one we use)\nOther bonus materials include a 9-panel insert sheet with mini-poster, printed program notes and other cool stuff, as well as color artwork, line art (settei), after-recording script, and more. As much as possible, everything will be available both on the disc and online. And of course, all backers will be credited on the disc!\n(Actually, we prefer credit cards and PayPal)\nThe High Octane Edition will only be sold via crowdfunding and direct sales on our website. It will never be available for less than the crowdfunding price. While we currently do not intend to release a regular commercial version of Riding Bean on Blu-ray, if we do it will be in different packaging and will not include any extra physical stretch-goal bonuses.\nRegular Reward Levels\nDigital backers ($5) get access to the data archive, which includes high-resolution graphics, settei, and the original after-recording script.\nRegular backers ($25) get the basic Blu-ray in a premium transparent Amaray case with a reversible sleeve, so there will be two cover variants to choose from, and a 9-panel printed insert with liner notes and a mini-poster. It also includes a custom embroidered patch. There is no \"early-bird\" level because everyone is getting early-bird pricing -- we don't want anyone to feel like they missed out.\nPatches we did for the first two kickstarters\nPremium backers ($50) get everything in Basic, plus a packaging upgrade to a chipboard case with new original art by Mr. Sonoda and an artbook (approximately 180 pages in color and black&white) that fits in the case with the Amaray.\nSupreme backers ($75) get everything Premium backers get, plus a keychain designed by Mr. Sonoda and a personalized on-disc \"Rally Vincent Gun Safety Course\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code.\nThe embossed keychain we did for Bubblegum Crisis\nHere's a demo of how the custom easter-egg works on Otaku no Video:\nNitrous-Injected backers ($110) get everything the Supreme backers get, plus two additional rewards: a 30mm-scale polyurethane garage kit of Buff the Roadbuster, and a personalized on-disc \"Bean Bandit Offensive Driving School\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code. Note that Nitrous-Injected backers get both certificates!\nOriginal design drawing of Buff the Roadbuster\nPatron backers ($200) get everything Nitrous-injected backers get, plus their name also appears on a startup screen every time the disc is played (as part of the copyright screen; you can skip right to the menus).\nInspector Percy backers ($300) get everything Patrons get, plus they will receive one of the actual production check discs to test and keep -- and thus, be the first to see the (hopefully!) finished Blu-Ray.\nNote about Extra Copies: If you want an extra copy or two, don't worry; we will make addons available after the campaign ends (it's just simpler to do it that way rather than have a ton of different reward categories).\nSimilarly, we will be able to provide a limited number of assembled and painted car models -- and since we're making a 3D model as the first step in the production process, we may be able to do some custom 3D prints as well.\nSpecial Limited Reward Levels\nWe also have several special support levels that will gradually go down in price until someone snaps them up.\nCel backers get everything a Patron gets, plus one of 9 original Riding Bean production cels. Here are the cels:\nCel #3 was signed by Mr. Sonoda in 1996! (Click for larger version)\nSonoda Sketch backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they get a sketch of their favorite Riding Bean character or scene -- personally inscribed if desired.\nHere's an example of one of the sketches Mr. Sonoda did for backers of the Bubblegum Crisis set. Note that these kind of rewards will be shipped from Japan and customs duty may apply.\nIllustration backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they also get a full-color B4-size (250 x 353mm / 9.8 x 13.9\") original illustration Mr. Sonoda is creating for this release -- personally inscribed if desired. The number of rewards in this category will depend on what stretch goals are chosen and achieved -- see below for more details.\nHenchmen backers get everything Patrons get, plus have characters in Mr. Sonoda's manga modeled after them. Similarly, Innocent Bystanders have background characters modeled after them.\nAnd finally, the Criminal Mastermind backer gets everything a Patron gets, plus he/she gets listed as the Criminal Mastermind on the packaging! And we'll include 4 extra sets as well.\nOur shipping department will treat your rewards with great care...\nShipping Details\nOn this project, we're charging a shipping fee on all orders, as opposed to giving US backers \"free\" shipping (which isn't really free, it's just bundled in). One reason we're doing this is because it helps establish the correct customs value for international shipments.\nCustoms costs, VAT and \"processing fees\" are a major annoyance for international backers, and we want to do everything we can to minimize or eliminate this hassle. That's why we're pleased to announce that this project is EU and Canada-friendly.\nThis means that we'll be shipping copies directly to fulfillment houses in Canada and the UK (who will then reship to backers in the EU). The extra cost of doing this (and the customs fees we pay upfront) have been baked into the shipping charge on a country-by-country basis:\nBasic Sets:\nUS: $5 shipping.\nEverywhere else: $15 shipping.\nPremium Sets (and higher levels or multiple sets):\nUS: $7 shipping.\nCanada/UK/EU: $20 shipping.\nElsewhere: $25 shipping.\nShipping costs have had to rise since our previous projects because of increased costs. In particular, USPS First Class Mail International rates have hugely increased for packages over 8oz (and the Premium Set will be over 1lb).\nNote that the shipping cost is a flat rate; if you later add on extra sets or other goodies, the maximum shipping cost is the Premium Set cost.\nWe will ship to non-CA/EU international backers directly from the USA using USPS International First Class Mail. Backers in Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway should not have any extra fees because the price of the basic set ($25) is below the personal exemption for those countries.\nWe will check into possibly doing local fulfillment for countries with significant order sizes (based on previous projects, the most likely candidates are AU/NZ). Whether or not it is cost-effective depends on a lot of factors, but if it can save some money we'll either refund the difference or give credit that can be used for addons.\nWe have created a Customs Estimator spreadsheet that backers in other countries can use. If your country is not listed, we would greatly appreciate it if you could research how costs are calculated in your country and let us know so we can update it.\nYou can help tune this project...\nCrowdProduction\nAs with our previous limited-edition releases, there are going to be opportunities for you to get involved in the actual work of producing the set. Backers who do substantial work on the project will get credit on the packaging and on the disc, an IMDb listing, extra copies of the set for family and friends, and a special CrowdProduction bonus item.\nCrowdProduction opportunities include (but are not limited to):\nCleaning up and curating the images.\nTranslation of the commentary track(s).\nSubtitle proofreading.\nPackaging, Disc Art and Logo design.\nLiner Notes Research.\nArtbook Design.\nContact us when the project makes its basic goal if you're interested in taking on the challenge.\nHow it feels to manage a crowdfunding project...\nAchieved Stretch Goals\n$40,000 - REACHED IN 2 HOURS! New Sonoda artwork for the Amaray case sleeve. Mr. Sonoda will create a new cover illustration for the Blu-ray case. This stretch goal unlocks an \"Illustration\" reward that delivers the original artwork.\n$60,000 - REACHED IN 8.5 HOURS! New Riding Bean Manga. Mr. Sonoda will create a new 4-page manga ministory for the insert and artboook. This stretch goal unlocks 3 \"Henchman\" rewards -- backers will be used as models for characters in the manga (and knowing Sonoda, will probably die horribly) -- these rewards will go live at 4pm ET on Monday, March 7th.\n$90,000 - REACHED IN 3.1 DAYS! Japanese Commentary Track featuring Mr. Sonoda and 1-2 other Japanese commentators.\n$110,000 - REACHED IN 21 DAYS!

We ask that people only use this if they cannot back the project via Kickstarter.\nWhat about subtitles in other languages?\nA major reason the Bubblegum Crisis set had authoring delays was that it had so many subtitle tracks (6 languages x 2 variants) that it caused the authoring system to crash! So we'd prefer to keep it simple(r).\nCan I order extra copies?\nWe will make additional copies available (at a discount) as an add-on after the campaign ends.\nWhat about doing a Challenge Coin?\nWe love the challenge coin we did for Bubblegum Crisis, and we'd like to do one for Riding Bean as well, but we think it's best to do it as a separate add-on. After the campaign is over, we'll poll people to figure out how many would like a coin, and if it is feasible, we'll do one. Note that we are definitely doing a keychain, and the Bubblegum Crisis one came out great!\nCan I get one of the previous Limited Edition Kickstarter Blu-rays?\nYes! We still have a few of the Bubblegum Crisis Utimate Edition sets left, and you can still sign up for the Otaku no Video Otaking Edition, which is about to go into production!\nWho is running the project?\nRobert Woodhead is one of the founders of AnimEigo, one of the original wave of Anime releasing companies. Over the years AnimEigo has released hundreds of Anime and Samurai film titles in both dubbed and subtitled form. He's the creative and technical guy.\nUEKI Natsumi is Robert's wife and partner.

The Third Imperium's Navy in three dimensions!\nFeatures\nSquadron Strike: Traveller uses fully Newtonian movement, including displacement for constant thrust, something that has never appeared in a Traveller game. (To old Squadron Strike hands, Squadron Strike: Traveller uses \"Mode 2\" movement without fuel.)\nThe game has a play-through tutorial, that teaches the game over multiple scenarios, starting in 2D and eventually going to 3D. (3D movement has never been in Traveller space combat before. Squadron Strike makes it easy.)\nThe game focuses on the ships of the Fifth Frontier War. Each ship comes in a 2D and a 3D version. All of the ships also come with an extra variant in 3D.\nTraveller Implementation\nSquadron Strike: Traveller is unabashedly a \"big ships\" Traveller implementation. The smallest ship it covers is 1000 dtons. It is NOT the game to break out for your PCs trying to pull a high-G slingshot maneuver in their Beowulf-class free trader to get the drop on a Gazelle-class escort. (However, see below!)\nThe ships are built in the Squadron Strike rules to replicate Traveller features. Squadron Strike's deep toolbox allows us to capture the feel of Traveller, while giving you the tactical depth and fun on-the-map play of Squadron Strike.\nThe Narrative of Battle\nShoals of missiles blot out the stars in the initial phases of a Traveller naval battle. Escorts shoot down missiles so bigger, more valuable ships can maneuver freely. Ships thrust and pivot to line up massive spinal weapons to get a killing strike. Sandcasters ablate beam damage, while meson guns can ignore armor while delivering devastatingly powerful strikes. Jump drives require significant fuel reserves, and multiple turns to warm up. Black globes render you temporarily invulnerable and unable to thrust or fire.  \nAll of the classic Traveller systems are here, in enough detail to make squadron-on-squadron combat fun and engaging.\nEven non-technological details, like Zhodani psionics and the \"ten planetary radii\" Jump limit are part of the game. On top of that, we have overviews of the history of the Third Imperium, focusing on Naval history, and essays on 3rd Imperium Naval Doctrine that have never been been seen before, including class histories and development foibles for every ship in the game.\nRPG Implementation & Integration\nWe're working on the RPG-scale \"small ships\" product, and have class histories and an artist lined up to do illustrations. Squadron Strike: Traveller has playtest rules for using PC skill rolls to modify Squadron Strike mechanics. We need Squadron Strike: Traveller to succeed so we have a player base to rigorously test the RPG rules integration for \"small ship\" Traveller, and to tell us what needs to be more RPG-focused rather than minis game focused. Barring a design miracle, the RPG-scale book will have more than one solution for \"what to do when the PCs ship gets shot at.\"\nHow Does It Play?\nSquadron Strike is a maneuver-centric game of miniatures combat, with a sweet spot of two-to-five ships per player. A large fleet action is an event for an entire gaming club. You will always be looking ahead at where your ship and the enemy ship will be, trying to finesse the range or angle of incoming damage, while getting your gigantic spinal mount into arc to unleash hell.\n\nOnce you're fluid with the game, turns take six to ten minutes each, and complete games can be done in ten to fifteen turns. In playtest, we have had the \"classic meson gun shot\" happen more than once: sometimes, meson guns one-shot kill intact ships.\n3D Display\nSquadron Strike can be played with miniatures in 2D, or in 3D with specialized bases.  What it's played with out of the box are box miniatures and tilt blocks.\nBox miniatures are die cut cardstock that fold into boxes, like so:\nThey get folded up like this:\nAs Kickstarter backer rewards, we offer box mini stiffeners.\nIf you put put weights inside, the stiffeners can contain them.  The weights roll to the bottom of the box mini when they're in tilt blocks (like so).\nAnd we show altitude with colored tiles.  White is one altitude level, light blue is four, dark blue is sixteen and black is a minus sign.\nThe die cut box miniature sheets are a large part of what this Kickstarter is funding.  We own the dies, it's just printing and die cutting fees.\nWhat's in the Box?\nSquadron Strike: Traveller will have three countersheets of box miniatures for the Traveller universe, covering Zhodani and Imperial ships, with a few Aslan for a variety of opponents. It will have a sixty-page book with ships ready to be photocopied and flown, a tutorial booklet to teach you the game, and a setting-and-scenario booklet covering the District 268 campaign at the opening of the Fifth Frontier War. It also has the rulebook, laminated play aids, plastic tilt blocks, stacking tiles and hex maps from the Squadron Strike boxed set. Aside from writing implements, everything you need to play is in the box.\nWhat's in the Folio?\nSquadron Strike: Traveller's folio product has all the Traveller-specific material (countersheets and booklets) packaged as a supplement for the Squadron Strike boxed set. If you already own Squadron Strike, this is the one to pick.\nShipping Details\nAll printed products will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail. The appropriate shipping price has been added to each of the reward levels for Canada, US, European Union and Australian customers.\nConclusion\nWe want to bring the fun of space combat to the Newtonian universe of Traveller, and we feel that Squadron Strike: Traveller is the space combat game that Traveller fans have deserved for nearly forty years. With your help, we can bring it to market, and let players fully experience the deadly dance of maneuver that Traveller space combat should be.\nStretch Goals \nThanks to you glorious people, I've got to think about these while on the road, and away from my quotations files, so these will be a bit haphazard and conservative.  \nStretch Goal 1: Countersheet #4 (AKA \"Mike Was Right.\") -- $6,500\nSS Traveller was spec'd out to have three counter sheets - the mix of counters is shown on one of the FAQs, down below. Mike Llaneza, the Traveller line developer, really wanted four countersheets. I said adding the fourth countersheet would make the price too high for the boxed game. This stretch goal, if hit, would add a fourth countersheet with the following counters to the physical products, and will not change the asking price of any of the physical products, even the ones with box mini stiffeners.\n\nPlankwell #2\nViepchakl #2\nAtlantic #3\nAtlantic #4\nGionetti #3\nGionetti #4\nAfteasea #2\nElsyel #4\nZhdiak #5\nVlezhdatl #4\nP.F. Sloan #5\nP.F. Sloan #6\nStretch Goal 2: New Traveller Minis -- $8,500\nAfter looking over several suggestions, I've decided to put up minis in fleet boxes.  We're putting out two \"old\" fleet boxes for people who don't have them, updating the minis counts to better match how ships get used in actual play.  For people who already own the fleet boxes, there's a third fleet box that has nothing but the new minis, including the Gazelle close escort.  And for the people who are very very generous, we have a \"bundle of fleet boxes\" which is all three fleet boxes combined, coupled with the other RPG-scale minis.\nAslan DD, CA, CH\nImp PF Sloan, Skimkish, Atlantic\nZhodani Vlezhdatl and Driafria\nGazelle and its launch\nStretch Goal 3: Upgraded Paper Maps -- $12,500 \nOne of the cost-cutting decisions I made twelve years ago when printing Attack Vector was very basic hex maps, with black ink on white and blue paper. These maps are serviceable, and they work in all of our games. The Birds of Prey guys love their side of the blue maps with the small hexes. \nHowever, they're not black, and they don't have a pretty starfield on them. If we hit this stretch goal, I'll be printing the maps you can download here and including them in the boxed sets for SS Traveller and all of my space games going forward. (If you already own one of my space game titles, there will be an opportunity to buy these maps via BackerKit.)\n\nThese new maps, for those who didn't immediately download the gigantic zipped PDF file on their phone, will make a 4'x6' play area, with 32 hexes of width by 36 hexes of height (this is two more hexes of width than the old maps). The hexes are numbered continuously over the entire area, and each half has the A-F rosette in the center, with the letters A and D color coded to match the AVID cards. The top map has a red nebular background and the bottom map has a blue nebular background, to offer a subtle reminder of which AVID cards to set up on which edge. Specially marked hexes will make scenario setups a bit easier.\nStretch Goal 4: AVID Stress Ball -- $21,000\nWhen I demo the game at conventions, I have a stress ball that I've hand colored (badly) with the rings of the AVID on it. I've been told by everyone who's seen it that \"Hey, you should totally sell those. I'd buy one. They make it immediately obvious what the AVID is.\"\n\nHere are the art specs.\nAVID Ball.

VAMPEROTICA is the original comic anthology that I created and began publishing in the 1990's. Some of you may already be familiar with the comic because it featured my original comic character THE VAMPRESS LUXURA. However, in addition to the adventures of Luxura the comic also featured Erotic Vampire Horror stories. \nThe goal of this KICKSTARTER is to collect all of these stories for the first time in a 4 volume set. Each book is over 100+ pages of blood, guts, gore, gorgeous vamps and scary stories that you will absolutely love! Just imagine The Twilight Zone meets True Blood. Vampire and Horror fans will really enjoy this collection. \nIn addition to the books you will also get the VAMPEROTICA: TALES FROM THE BLOODVAULT DVD MOVIE. Yes that's right, I made a movie! I took one of the stories from the comic series, grabbed a camera, a bunch of my friends from my local comic store and made a movie. Signed DVDs of the movie are available in this Kickstarter for the first time since it was released.\nNot only can you get the 4 VOLUME set and the movie but you can also get the 8 VOLUME Set of VAMPRESS LUXURA stories that also appeared in the original comic series. \nIf you previously backed THE VAMPRESS LUXURA 8 VOLUME COLLECTION then this set in THE PERFECT ADDITION to your LUXURA/VAMPEROTICA collection.\nThank you for taking the time to view this Kickstarter!

Defeat a champion from each of the 4 other boroughs of New York City\u2026.. or be defeated and bring about the destruction of all species, including her own.\"\nArt by Daniel Campos\nIn order to keep her throne, The Vampress Luxura must battle the monster gangs that run the 5 Boroughs of New York. The relative peace between the Amphibians, humanoid water breathers; the Zombie Masters, controllers of undead hordes; the Made Men, a Frankenstein-ian Mafia and the feral Garou, a fierce tribe of werewolves is put to the test as Luxura must battle each of their champions in The Gauntlet, a supernatural trial by fire.\nArt by Eric Nelson\nAfter centuries of Luxura\u2019s refusals to join his side and rule with him, Pontius Vanthor takes matters into his own hands, deciding that if she will not join him in his quest for domination in a Red Reign, he will remove her as an obstacle. Luxura, determined to defeat Vanthor and protect everyone and everything she holds sacred, faces what could be her toughest challenge yet and quite possibly her own destruction.\nArt by Ashleigh Popplewell\nLuxura: The Monster's Gauntlet is a project that started many years ago when writer David Hayes and I started kicking around the idea of Luxura battling all the classic monsters that horror fans have come to know and love.

With the completion of the Traveller5 core rules, and with all of its concepts fresh in my mind, the inspiration came to me in a flash this past June, and it has been pouring from my fingertips ever since.\nThis project is the publication \u2014 ebook, dead-tree hardcopy version, and hardcover limited first edition, and perhaps more \u2014 of my first novel: Agent of the Imperium.\n    Jonathan Bland is a Decider, empowered by the Emperor himself to deal with the inevitable crises of empire. In the service of the Empire, he has killed more people than anyone in the history of Humanity, to save a hundred times as many. He died centuries ago, but they re-activate his recorded personality whenever a new threat appears. When the crisis is over, they expect he will meekly return to oblivion.\n    He has other ideas.\nThis 80,000+ word (about 250 to 300 pages) novel is faithful to the OTU Original Traveller Universe in the way that only the originator and chronicler of the universe can make it. Along the way, this novel reveals secrets of the history of the empire that have never before been revealed. It spans 400 years from early Imperium (about 300) through the mid-post Civil War period (about 700) touching known and unknown events you may have encountered in your own reading of the Imperium: everyday events, political intrigue, deadly dangers, Arbellatra, Capital, Encyclopediopolis, the Karand's Palace, and a Tigress-class Dreadnought.\nFor the Uninitiated: The Traveller universe is one of the most documented and fleshed-out futures ever contrived; the product of hundreds of writers and thousands of players who have enjoyed its detail and its gaming adventures since 1977. Agent of the Imperium is set in the vast star-spanning Third Imperium and its ten thousand worlds. The novel is more than just a fast-paced adventure that saves the empire several times in the first hundred pages; it immerses readers in the day-to-day life of the empire. The Traveller5 Core Role-Playing Rules (our previous Kickstarter) define the universe: this read shows readers what it looks like, feels like, how it functions, what it does.\nAbout The Author: Marc Miller is the original creator of the Traveller science-fiction role-playing game system at GDW Game Designers\u2019 Workshop. He is the designer of more than 80 game titles across the broad spectrum of gaming: historical wargames, miniatures, science-fiction, and role-playing. He has won just about every award for gaming excellence, and is a member of the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame twice! once personally, and again as the designer of Traveller.\nThis is Marc\u2019s first novel, but not his first writing: he has over a million words in print.\nFinally, there is an excerpt posted here just to get you started: http://www.traveller5.net/novels.html\nDo I Need To Play Traveller? No! We think that Traveller players will enjoy this vision of the Traveller universe, of course, but this is a stand-alone compelling vision of the far future that any SF reader can enjoy. We hope you will too, whether you are a gamer or not.\nThe Softcover Edition. The softcover edition is basically a reader's copy: it is intended to be read in the satisfying old style, and then kept on the shelf or shared with a friend. But you are also participating in a special event with me. I am not restricting inscriptions and autographs to the Hardcover (below); the survey will ask about inscriptions and I will autograph and inscribe regardless of softcover or hardcover. \nThe Hardcover Edition. This publication is a special event and we're producing a limited number of hardcover copies, custom bound by a local bindery. We're going to produce some of these no matter what (if only because I want one on my own shelf), and thus we have the opportunity to make them available to you as well. Each book will receive a custom inscription and author signature.\nShipping: The ebook has no cost to ship. The Paperback and the Hardcover cost to ship, and I have allowed about $5 in each pledge to cover shipping (and packaging materials). For shipments outside the USA, the cost is closer to $20 and that explains the $15 surcharge.\nExport Customs Statements: When I complete customs forms for Kickstarter Rewards as they are shipped to backers, I declare Book $15. I inscribe each book to the specific backer and I declare it as a gift, in sincere appreciation to the individual.\nExtra Copies of the Paperback. You can increase your pledge by $15 and receive an additional copy of the Paperback book.\nExtra Copies of the Hardcover. You can increase your pledge by $50 and receive an additional copy of the Hardcover book.\nDRM-Free: The electronic editions of this novel are supplied DRM-Free as files through DropBox link or a coupon for a download from DriveThruRPG.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript for this novel is complete and edited; it only awaits its publication date.\nThe printed rewards are subject to potential printed and binder delays, we do not expect problems that we cannot handle. \nI could die (unexpectedly) but copies of the files are in the hands of trusted associates who will fulfill if I cannot. \nI have managed one previous Kickstarter and we fulfilled successfully.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "The Audiobook for Agent", "update_content": "Some have you have asked about the Audiobook, which is done, and available.\nWe sent out a link (in one of these updates), but it has long since expired.\nBUT you can still get it.

CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING STAGE 4 - PVP Multiplayer!\nYou did it!\nBATTLETECH is in development for PC, Mac, and Linux in English and will be delivered in standard and DRM-free versions on Steam, GoG, and Humble stores. The game will also be made available in German, French, and Russian (with localized text, and audio subtitles) in a post-launch update. Other platforms and languages may be announced later. BATTLETECH is expected to launch in early 2017.\nBATTLETECH is set in a universe at perpetual war, fought by militarized factions utilizing huge, mechanized combat vehicles called BattleMechs.\nFollowing centuries of space colonization and the rise of six Great Noble Houses, treachery undermined the Star League and toppled its First Lord. The rulers of the five remaining Houses each proclaimed themselves the new First Lord, and so the Succession Wars began - hundreds of years of mechanized armies, scavenged technology, and political machinations.\nNow, in 3025, each faction is near its breaking point. An uneasy stalemate sets in as the Houses scrape to rebuild their holdings, reinforce their worlds, and restock their 'Mech armies. But the conflict continues as the nobility drives their agendas forward covertly through the use of mercenaries\u2026   \nWhether maintained by a House army, or passed down within a MechWarrior family from generation to generation, BattleMechs reign supreme on the thirty-first century battlefield. These massive weapon platforms - ranging from seven to sixteen meters in height, and twenty to one hundred tons in weight - form the backbone of the Great Houses' interstellar armies.\n'Mechs are rare, and often passed down from generation to generation within a noble family.\nOver the 200 years of the Succession Wars, attrition has eaten away at the resources of the Great Houses, and the number of working BattleMechs on the field has dwindled. By 3025, field-ready 'Mechs are a precious commodity, and keeping them running is a tactical necessity.\nWe're excited that Piranha Games, creators of MechWarrior Online, are sharing their incredible roster of Inner Sphere BattleMech models with us for BATTLETECH. Not only are their 'Mechs wonderfully detailed, using the same models adds to the continuity of the BattleTech Universe.\nWe\u2019re also very happy to be working closely with Catalyst Game Labs, publisher of the BattleTech tabletop board games and novels. Even though Jordan created the BattleTech Universe over 30 years ago, the talented folks at Catalyst have been the keepers of the flame for years, and we appreciate their help in ensuring that we deliver an authentic BattleTech experience.\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big dreams for an amazing game.\nWe know that to do 'Mech combat right will be a substantial investment - in fact, Harebrained Schemes has budgeted over a million dollars to self-fund the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME (see below), and we've already started pre-production. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve scoped the project appropriately, and that we can deliver this version of the game without any Kickstarter support.\nBut, we also know that BattleTech isn't just about big stompy robots battling it out. There\u2019s so much more we\u2019d like to include in this game! A full single-player campaign. Full control of your career as a mercenary. PVP Multiplayer. That\u2019s where you come in!\nThe scope of this project expands in the four major FUNDING STAGES below - so that no matter which funding level we attain, we\u2019re sure to deliver a great game worthy of the BattleTech name. Help us co-fund BATTLETECH and let\u2019s see how big this game can get!\nNaturally, 'Mech combat is the cornerstone of any great BattleTech game, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting development. HBS is self-funding a complete 'Mech battlefield experience in the form of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME.\nOur goal is to craft a combat system for BATTLETECH that\u2019s the perfect blend of tactical depth, speed of play, and meaningful unit customization. As we did with our Shadowrun games, we intend to capture the *spirit* of the original tabletop rules, while designing the best PC game we can. That said, Shadowrun and BattleTech are very different games! For one thing, Shadowrunners like to hide behind cover, while \u2018Mechs\u2026 squash cover. Expect turn-based combat in BattleTech to feel very different than a more cover-based combat system like Shadowrun\u2019s\nOn the battlefield, you'll command a Lance of four 'Mechs in turn-based combat. We\u2019d like a typical skirmish to be complete-able within about 30 minutes, without sacrificing the tactical depth that any BattleTech game demands. All of our systems will be designed with a \u201clayered\u201d approach in mind - surfacing the information you need for quick decision-making, while also allowing you to drill-down into detailed stats and unit management options.\nThink of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME like a personal 'Mech command simulation - you\u2019ll be able to set the parameters and difficulty level of each skirmish game, challenging yourself to defeat larger and larger AI-controlled enemy forces over more and more difficult terrain. Or, choose from a variety of pre-built combat encounters created by our design team.\nBetween skirmishes, customize your BattleMechs in the 'Mech Bay. Choose from over twenty-five 3025-era Inner Sphere 'Mech chassis, and configure the weapon loadout, armor, heat sinks, and paint scheme for each. If you want to dive even deeper, tweak their engine, gyros, actuators, and shock absorbers - all of which will impact the 'Mech\u2019s battlefield performance in different ways.\n\nIn the Ready Room, select the best pilots for the 'Mechs you\u2019ve configured. Each MechWarrior will have their own 'Mech and weapon specializations, as well as certain special abilities that can be used on the battlefield. \n\nOh, and one more thing: we want to put the PUNCH back into BattleTech. This game will include MELEE COMBAT and DEATH FROM ABOVE!\n\n>>> STAGE 1+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$250,000 - Combined Arms: We'll add a healthy roster of non-'Mech AI opponents to the Base Skirmish Game including tanks, hovercraft, support vehicles and more. But be careful - even the lightest of combat vehicles can still wreck your 'Mechs under the right conditions. \n$400,000 - Expanded Mission Objectives: We'll add a variety of mission types to the Base Skirmish Game including Escort, Capture, Defend, and more. \n$500,000 - Expanded Environments: We'll add a wider variety of battlefield environments to the game, including time-of-day and atmospheric conditions that affect both movement and combat. Confront enemy forces in the low-visibility conditions of a blizzard on a frigid ice world, or carefully manage your heat in a battle across volcanic fields.\nThe BattleTech Universe is all about stories - of nobles and MechWarriors, fighting to protect their people and their homes. Of mercenaries, surviving from battle to battle in a war-torn universe. It\u2019s a dynamic science fiction setting filled with intrigue and cutthroat politics that spans centuries. It\u2019s a shared universe that has evolved over 30 years, in tabletop miniatures games and sourcebooks, novels, comics, and dozens of computer games. We want to honor that history and make this perennial game setting come to life with a killer single-player story campaign.\nOur STAGE 2 STORY CAMPAIGN will put you in command of your own mercenary outfit, as you find yourself inexorably drawn into a bloody dynastic conflict set in the Periphery of the Inner Sphere. Over the course of the campaign, you\u2019ll manage the finances and logistics of your mercenary outfit - from the modifications and loadout of your 'Mechs, to the salaries and skill growth of your MechWarriors.\n\nA mercenary Lance of MechWarriors prepares for battle.\nAt the end of the day, the life of a mercenary is all about money: the money needed to repair the damage your 'Mechs took in combat, to pay your MechWarriors to keep fighting, and - if you\u2019re lucky - the money to put towards buying new 'Mech chassis and weapon systems. Fortunately, 'Mech components salvaged from the battlefield can be both cheaper and better-performing than the oft-refurbished parts available for purchase.\n\n>>> STAGE 2+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$1,100,000 - Cinematic Transitions: We'll add short cutscenes for various events in game - such as deploying your forces to the battlefield - and for key moments in the single-player story.\n$1,200,000 - Player-Character Origin Stories: In BATTLETECH, you\u2019ll create your own mercenary character to star in the story. If we hit this funding level, you'll be able to choose one of six origin stories for your mercenary commander's career. Are you the only heir of a once noble family that has since fallen from favor? The bastard child of a famous MechWarrior? You decide.\n$1,350,000 - Voice Acting: We'll record a cast of talented voice actors to act as your advisers, provide mission briefings, and record battlefield emotes. We\u2019ll also add voice acting to the animatics for important moments in the story.\n$1,550,000 - 3D MechWarrior Portrait Customization: We'll build a complete 3D portrait customization system for you to customize the look of both your MechWarriors and your own Mercenary commander.\nThe STAGE 3 EXPANDED MERCENARY CAMPAIGN puts you in full control of your life as a Mercenary. The campaign becomes open-ended, allowing you to charter JumpShip transport for your mercenary outfit when needed - travel to various hot-zones across the Periphery and Inner Sphere. You\u2019ll be able to choose your contracts and alliances, with both the Great Houses and other subfactions within the Inner Sphere.\nThe emblems of the five Great Houses of the Inner Sphere.\nOver time, the missions you choose to accept and the objectives competed in those missions will determine your reputation as a mercenary. Your reputation will affect the contracts and contract terms you may be offered in the future. But be wary: each Great House - and in some cases, each House representative - can have their own agendas, sometimes leading you into bad deals or deadly betrayals.\nTheir negotiations complete, a Davion liaison officer briefs a merc outfit on their mission.\nTo support this open-ended Mercenary career, STAGE 3 adds a wide variety of \u201cside-contracts\u201d in addition to the story campaign, as well as a procedural contract-generation system to ensure that you always have fresh contracts available, wherever your Mercenary career may take you.\n>>> STAGE 3+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$2,000,000 - Customizable Home Base: As part of the ongoing campaign, you'll acquire a home base (likely in the form of a derelict DropShip) for your mercenary outfit to call home. At this funding level we'll also allow you to adjust its appearance, repair and upgrade its functionality, and grow and evolve your base as your outfit grows and evolves.\n$2,150,000 - Legendary 'Mech & MechWarriors: In addition to the game's standard 'Mechs and customizable, procedurally-generated MechWarriors, we'll include rare legendary 'Mechs to find, and rare hero MechWarriors to hire - including some famous characters from BattleTech history. Such legends may not stick around for long, but will be well worth hiring if you can afford them.\nThe neutral planet of Solaris VII is home to the Inner Sphere\u2019s most famous gladiatorial 'Mech combat arenas. Here players can challenge each other to casual PvP battles or enter our matchmaking system to be matched against an appropriately experienced opponent. \nEach Great House maintains an embassy and a namesake arena on Solaris VII and each has very different gameplay features - from the Roman-inspired Steiner Coliseum to the frozen glaciers of Davion\u2019s Boreal Reach (or one of Davion\u2019s many other holographic environs).\nTournaments and Leagues will reward the victor with various prizes and Leaderboard fame.\nJon Everist, composer for the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, is creating the music for BATTLETECH. We\u2019re very excited to continue our collaboration with Jon and you can hear his first BattleTech tune in our Kickstarter video!\nInstead of throwing a bunch of random tchotchkes into this campaign, we've focused our physical reward efforts on two really awesome reward levels that we know we can deliver (in addition to all the great digital rewards we've created.) This focus will allow us to devote more of your funding towards making the best BattleTech game we can!\nClick the image to see all 6 Great House sets!\n                                     Click for larger Flight Jacket image.\nTo encourage everyone to get involved and share their passion for the BattleTech Universe, we've created a set of missions for you to collectively complete, listed below. Each mission accomplished by the Global BattleTech Community (GBC) earns a point. Earned points unlock cool content in the game and fun rewards for Backers (also listed below). \nNote: For more details about the Final Week Bonus Missions, see this Kickstarter Update!\nPosts to share & pages to Like/Follow:\nAnnouncement post on Facebook\nAnnouncement post on Twitter\nHBS on Facebook\nHBS on Twitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know there are BattleTech fans that have been burned by other crowdfunding projects, and we\u2019re really sorry you had to go through that.\n\nHarebrained Schemes has delivered solid Kickstarter projects three times.

We're building an all-new codebase in Unity 5, with lofty visual and gameplay goals - and we know that really nailing the feel of BattleTech will take time and iteration. We\u2019ll need a few new team members, too, but we've proven that we have a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people who go the extra mile.\n\nSo, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we\u2019ll need to revise it several times until it works.\n\nBut that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "CAMPAIGN COMPLETE - THANKS AGAIN!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - Season Pass Complete!", "update_content": "Hey everyone, long time!

The remnants of these civilizations shaped the Ninth World into a place of incredible beauty, wonder, and danger. And weirdness. Oh, so much weirdness. Explorers who undertake the challenges presented by the Ninth World look not only to the wilderness, but also to the night sky, the ocean depths, and even into the worlds beyond that they cannot easily perceive.\nThis Kickstarter campaign takes us into these realms through several new titles that expand the Ninth World beyond Earth's shores. We're launching this campaign to fund Into the Night, Into the Deep, and Into the Outside, each an all-new 160-page hardcover supplement, along with the 100-card Numenera Artifact Deck. But with your help, we'll take these books even further, and maybe add some new titles as well!\nEarly this year we started an in-depth exploration of the Ninth World, the setting of the Numenera roleplaying game, with the Ninth World Guidebook. Numenera fans were excited to see the world expanded, as that in turn expanded the options for their own campaigns. We knew we wanted to keep going, and that the Ninth World had many more fascinating lands and cultures to explore. But those conventional (sort of) lands are just one aspect of the Ninth World. There were other sorts of realms, inspiring and unique, many of which had been introduced in our previous products but never really explored in depth.\nThe obvious first direction was up! The eight previous worlds had all, to one extent or another, reached beyond the embrace of Earth\u2019s gravity. Remnants of those civilizations linger in the Ninth World\u2019s datasphere, and were touched on in adventures such as Vortex and discussion of the moon in the Ninth World Guidebook. This is an aspect of the Ninth World we\u2019ve wanted to develop since\u2014well, since Numenera came into being!\nSo we started work on Into the Night, a sourcebook that allows characters to explore the moon, Mars, and much, much farther beyond that. Here and there over the past year, we've let slip hints that this was the next big book for Numenera.\nBut then we got thinking\u2014what if we kept going? After all, the sea\u2014particularly under the sea\u2014is as uncharted, as exciting, and as alien a place as another planet. We began talking about multiple \"Into the Ninth World\" themed books, with the next one being called Into the Deep. And beyond that, an exploration of the other dimensions unlocked by the previous worlds: Into the Outside.\nAfter that... well, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We decided the smart thing to do would be to see if these topics interest you as much as they interest us. In this campaign, you can get any of these books\u2014or all of them. And if things go well, we have lots of other ideas in mind for exploring the Ninth World. Furthermore, hitting stretch goals can allow us to make these books something really fantastic, as well as possibly add more to the Numenera story. New corners of the Ninth World to explore? New character options unlocked by these exciting environments? New creatures encountered there? New stories? It all depends on you!\nInto the Night is already written. It\u2019s in editing, and will go to press before this campaign ends. That said, there\u2019s still time to make it even better\u2014to add elements we wouldn\u2019t normally be able to risk through the normal publication process. In fact, our first stretch goal will add a Kickstarter-exclusive poster map to that book. We have some great ideas for that and for what follows, and we\u2019d like you to be a part of it. So here\u2019s what this Kickstarter is all about:\nWe\u2019re going to further broaden the horizons of the Ninth World, first with Into the Deep and Into the Outside and then with\u2014well, some other pretty cool titles that we\u2019ll unveil as this campaign progresses.\nWe\u2019re going to make Into the Night, Into the Deep, and other titles funded by this campaign as cool as we can, offering elements we normally wouldn\u2019t be able to put into a book developed in the conventional manner.\nWe\u2019re going to give you a voice and a chance to interact with the content of these books. To have a hands-on role in shaping them.\nInto the Night: This 160-page hardcover takes Numenera players and GMs beyond the grip of Earth's gravity, to locations pioneered by the previous worlds on the moon, elsewhere in the solar system, and in remote reaches of the galaxy. Into the Night releases in late September. It's already written and in editing, and it does not rely on the success of this Kickstarter to be released\u2014although we do hope this campaign will allow some cool upgrades to the book through stretch goals.\nInto the Deep: Delve into the depths of the Ninth World's oceans in this 160-page hardcover book. The prior worlds extended their empires into the seas\u2014as previously touched on in the Numenera corebook and The Devil's Spine\u2014and the wonders to be found there are every bit as glorious, mysterious, exciting, and just plain weird as the landbound realms of the Ninth World. Into the Deep will release in the spring of 2016.\nInto the Outside: It's well known that the denizens of the prior worlds bent time and space to their liking, creating links to realms outside the normal world. This 160-page hardcover book takes us into these other worlds, exploring pocket dimensions, the realms of ultraterrestrials, and parallel universes. Into the Outside will ship in the autumn of 2016.\nNumenera Artifact Deck: Experienced Numenera GMs agree that our decks (such as the Creature Deck and Cypher Deck) are great for inspiration, and huge time-savers in game prep and during play. We're going to add an Artifact Deck full of all-new content to help you generate artifacts quickly and easily while getting ready for your game, or when you need one at the gaming table.\nAll the Ebooks: You receive all the books funded by this campaign in PDF format, along with a PDF version of the Artifact Deck. If we unlock new books as stretch goals, those are added to your rewards automagically!\nAll the Print Books: You receive all the print books funded by this campaign, as well as the Artifact Deck in print. If we unlock new print books as stretch goals, you get them as part of your reward.

You are responsible for travel to the party, so if you aren't in the Seattle area you'll have to get yourself there.\nYou also get the benefits of the lower levels, including the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, a custom autographed bookplate for each book, and playtest access. Details on shipping are below.\nARTIFACT PATRON: We want your contribution to the artifacts of the Ninth World (and beyond)! If you back at this level, you may contribute an artifact concept, which Monte and the creative team will adapt for the Artifact Deck. (Select items may also appear in one of the books, but there's no guarantee that'll be the case.) Your idea does not have to be themed to the Into the Ninth World books\u2014in fact, we want the Artifact Deck to be useful to GMs running Numenera campaigns set anywhere in the Ninth World.\nBest of all: You will be credited for the idea on the card, and you will receive a print copy of the card autographed by Monte!

They\u2019re the only ones who can enter Storia and save Wiffle\u2014how will they do it? It\u2019s all up to them!\nNo Thank You, Evil! is tabletop game of creative make-believe, adventure, and storytelling. In No Thank You, Evil!, each player creates a character based on a couple of cool, descriptive, imagination-firing traits. The Guide (a special role often played by a parent or older sibling) presents a dilemma, and the players set off on an adventure of the imagination. Along the way they use their character\u2019s special skills, companions, and equipment to overcome obstacles\u2014perhaps fighting a slime monster, winning over the suspicious mayor, or beating a rabbit at a race.\nWhereas conventional board games constrain players\u2019 actions, No Thank You, Evil! sets kids\u2019 imaginations free: Their options are limited only by what they can think up. Together, the players create a story as they work together to make their way through the adventure!\nFor the Little Kids, the Grown-ups, and Everyone in Between\nYounger kids frustrate easily when a game is too complex for them to master. Older children quickly grow bored by games that are too simple or that strike them as below their level.\nNo Thank You, Evil! is great fun for kids as young as five years old. But it\u2019s also great fun for the rest of family\u2014adults included!\u2014because the scalable rules adapt easily to the abilities of the player. A six-year-old might play, for example, a Princess. An eight-year-old might play a Super Smart Princess. A ten-year-old might create a Super Smart Princess who Experiments With Science. Each of these stages adds a level of sophistication to how the game is played\u2014but all of these characters play around the same table in the same game. After a game or two with the grown-ups, a twelve-year-old might even run games for the other kids!\nThe gameplay rules are easy for novice or young players to grasp, but nuanced and flexible enough for older kids and grown-ups to enjoy just as much. Here's a brief look at how the rules work:\nEnter Storia: The Land Next Door\nNo Thank You, Evil! is set in Storia: The Land Next Door. It\u2019s a world seen through children\u2019s eyes, home to all the elements of kids\u2019 imaginations: Dragons and dinosaurs, faeries and elves, race cars and robots, and all sorts of fanciful creatures. Players\u2019 characters in No Thank You, Evil! are kids who have been specially chosen to help save Storia from evil. Accompanied by their companions and their handy I Gotchyer Back packs (living creatures that carry the characters\u2019 cool stuff in their bellies), characters venture into Storia to save the day!\nFor more detailed info on the setting, game rules, and characters, visit the No Thank You, Evil! web site!\nWhat Is Monte Cook Games, and Why No Thank You, Evil!?\nMonte Cook Games has been publishing tabletop games since 2012\u2014though mostly for a grown-up audience. The idea for No Thank You, Evil! was born after many of our fans told us they\u2019d had unusual success introducing our games to their kids.\nIt wasn\u2019t long after the release of our flagship game Numenera that we began to hear from fans who weren\u2019t just gamers\u2014they were also parents. They were playing Numenera (and, later, The Strange) with their kids, and having a great time! We\u2019ve received drawings of characters, letters from young players, and papercrafts of scary creatures in our mailboxes and inboxes. We\u2019ve seen Disney princesses, weird Santas, saddle-wearing cat balloons, and all kinds of other super-imaginative ideas arise from families gaming together. Here are a few examples:\nNumenera Ninth World Christmas Special\nI Played Numenera with My Kids\nNumenera and a kid with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome\nWhen we were kids, it didn\u2019t seem there were any parents who played roleplaying games. But now that so many of us gaming geeks are old enough to have kids, gamer families are looking for ways to bring their children into our amazingly imaginative hobby. And parents who aren\u2019t into hobby games are more interested than ever in activities that feed their children\u2019s imagination while bringing the whole family together.\nNo Thank You, Evil! will come in a beautiful, sturdy box just a bit larger than 8-1/2\" x 11\" (grown-up gamers, it will fit nicely on your shelf alongside your conventional roleplaying games). We\u2019re offering it in two versions: the Standard Edition and the exclusive Kickstarter Edition. The Standard Edition is what will ultimately be available in stores. We\u2019re adding some cool exclusives to the Kickstarter Edition, which will be available only through this campaign.\nStandard Edition: The Standard Edition contains everything you need to play, all in a beautiful, sturdy box designed to be easy for children to use. All of the components are premium quality. This is the edition that will be sold in stores.\nRulebook\nAdventure book\nFive dice\nCharacter sheets\nCards for characters, creatures, and cyphers\nGame tokens\nKickstarter Edition: The Kickstarter Edition has all the components you\u2019ll find in the Standard Edition. Furthermore, most of the stretch goals apply only to the Kickstarter Edition, so it's gotten (and continues to get) better and better. Back this campaign at a level that includes the exclusive Kickstarter Edition, and you\u2019ll get those upgrades as part of your reward! The Kickstarter Edition is only available through this campaign\u2014the only way to get it is to back this campaign now!\nEverything in the Standard Edition, plus:\nA larger, deluxe box\nExtra tokens\nA pad of character sheets\nPlus a set of five reusable character sheets\nCharacter standups\nA storybook that also introduces a great adventure for new players, called Lucy Lawful and the Awful Waffle\nTwo sticker sheets\nThe My Storia Travel Guide & Passport activity book\nA deck of equipment cards\nA cloth map of Storia: The Land Next Door!\nNo Thank You, Evil! reached its funding goal, so we added several stretch goals to make the game even better! When we reached $55,000 we added an Adventure Book to the Standard Edition and Kickstarter Edition, with more adventure content for your games. Additional goals reached added the Hero Stuff add-ons and a new backer level, new character types and companions, and reusable character sheets, character and companion standups, the storybook Lucy Lawful and the Awful Waffle, two sticker sheets, a deck of equipment cards, and the My Storia Travel Guide & Passport to the Kickstarter Edition.\nIf you\u2019ve followed us on social media or the blog at the Monte Cook Games web site, you may be aware that one of our playtest groups was at the Shanti Bhavan Children\u2019s Project in rural India. We\u2019ve worked with them, and with one or two other groups of children in developing countries, and while it\u2019s been great to see their reactions and get their feedback, it also drives home another point: Many children don\u2019t have good access to creative, intellectually challenging games of the sort that includes No Thank You, Evil!\nSo our last stretch goals weren't aimed at us, or at No Thank You, Evil! itself. Instead, they're for these kids. When we hit $110,000 we committed to donating 100 copies of the Standard Edition to schools, libraries, and organizations that serve at-risk and underprivileged kids. And we added another 20 copies for each $1000 beyond that.\nNo Thank You, Evil! has been in the works for over a year, and the design and development phase is drawing toward its end. That said, the game is many months from release. For grown-up gamers, waiting a few months might test your patience\u2014but in the same period, a child can go through significant changes in interests, intellectual ability, attention span, and more. When thinking about playing No Thank You, Evil!, don\u2019t forget to account for your children\u2019s ages at the time of release!\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. These add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWe offer a variety of backer levels with some great rewards. The reward level details on the right can\u2019t be edited once a campaign is underway, but we can make changes to the words you\u2019re reading now\u2014so the notes below are up to date, including upgrades or additions we may make to the backer levels as the campaign progresses.\nYES PLEASE, PDF! You'll receive PDF files of all the print components within the Standard Edition. It contains the game rules, character sheet, 3 sheets of tokens, and 80 cards. The PDF is also included in the Kickstarter Edition, so this reward is also part of every backer level that includes the Kickstarter Edition.\nBASIC BOX This is the version of the game that will eventually be sold in stores. It contains the game rules, 6 character sheets, 3 sheets of die-cut tokens, 80 cards, and 5 dice. Unless otherwise noted, stretch goals that add items to the game don't apply to this version\u2014you'll want the Kickstarter Edition to get the coolest stuff!\nBOX OF AWESOME! You're going to love the Kickstarter Edition of the game, and you'll also get the PDF (which can be handy if you prefer to have the rules on a tablet or laptop). Most of the stretch goals apply only to the Kickstarter Edition, so back at this level or higher if you want this upgraded version and the stretch goals that make it even better!\nNO THANK YOU, PATIENCE! Can't wait for next February? Gain early access to the game. Components will be delivered in PDF format, so you'll have to print them yourself. And expect them in a very rough format\u2014not unlike what you've seen some of the playtesters using in our videos. You'll also receive updates and other information playtesters get. Our playtesting will continue for a couple of months, and we welcome your feedback, but you are not required to provide it if you'd rather not. You'll have to sign a non-disclosure agreement before we send you the materials. Expect the early access materials in June.\nYOURS TRULY, EVIL!

(Sorry, but you will not be able to specify that message.) You also get early access to the game.\nHERO STUFF + MORE! A bunch of great stuff to go along with your game. You get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, on top of everything in the YOURS TRULY, EVIL! backer level. It's a great deal!\nBASH SOME EVIL! You and your child will be invited to play a game online with creator Shanna Germain! The game will be run via Skype or a similar online platform, and will probably take about an hour. Best of all, you'll get to play early; we'll contact you to arrange a date and time in the summer or fall of 2015. You'll likely be playing with one or two other backers and their children (we'll shoot for four to six total players, including parents and children, per session). NEW: You also get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, at no extra cost!\nBE A HERO OF STORIA!

Not only will he or she will be immortalized in the game, but we'll also send you an art print of the illustration autographed by the artist, and a high-resolution digital version as well. We'll need a suitable image of your child, and we'll need it very shortly after the end of this campaign (we'll contact you for it). Please, only children between the ages of 5 and 11. NEW: You also get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, at no extra cost!\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, EVIL! We'll fly Shanna and Monte in for a party or other event and run No Thank You, Evil!-themed activities for at least two hours, and we'll work with you to ensure it's an event to remember! The destination must be in the lower 48 of the United States, and the event must take place in 2016. Monte and Shanna do have some commitments in 2016, but we'll coordinate with you on timing that works for everyone! NEW: You also get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, at no extra cost!\nRETAILER EXCLUSIVE This one is for retailers only, and we'll verify that you're a retailer before sending your reward. You get 10 copies of the Standard Edition of No Thank You, Evil! to sell, plus one copy of the Kickstarter Edition for you (you're welcome to sell it, but it will not be marked for retail). We'll send you a promo kit with great point-of-purchase materials about a month before street date, and we'll coordinate with you on promoting your store through our web site and robust social media presence in the lead-up to the game's release. You'll probably receive your games a couple of weeks before the street date (and you have our blessing to put them out for sale right away), but we can't guarantee it.\nBasic shipping in the United States is free.

I have four stretch goals for Attack Vector support, but I think that's better served as a second Kickstarter once we've got the coding for this one done.\nRight now, I'm enjoying a beer, and just kinda blinking into space...\nMet Stretch Goals!\nWow.  Just...wow.  I'd had no idea we'd reach these last two stretch goals on the last day.  Seriously - I'd hoped for a surge, but these last three days have generated a bit over $6,000!  \nThank you all!  Spread the word - there's still some great backer rewards here, and the more funding this gets, the smoother the development cycle will go; having a bit of a cash reserve to cover blind alleys is a good thing.\nFreeeeedommmmm!\nAnd now, we bring enlightenment to the masses!\nSet Vectors for Awesome!\n Mode 2 plotting is funded. This has turned the project from an AVID Assistant to the Squadron Strike Assistant!\nMode 1 Plotting: Achieved!\n Mode 1 plotting handles movement modes for universes inspired by Star Trek or Star Wars.\niOS Goal Met!\nThe iOS version is technically trickier to produce than the Android version. The iTunes store costs more to get into, which is why the fourth stretch goal is higher than the third one.\nOur Androids Dream Of Exploding Spaceships...\nWith this stretch goal, we'll run the existing app through Cordova and make an Android version. This means that you won't need an Internet connection to load the tool, and it will appear as a $1.99 download in the Google Play store. Project backers at the $5 and higher level will be given an option to download it for free.\nMultiple Bearings Unlocked!\nOur second stretch goal was tracking and shooting multiple bearings - this requires re-working some of the user interface from the example video, but isn't a significant coding hurdle (like getting coordinates translated for the previous one). We'll have you tracking up to four bearings at once. In addition to this, the old third stretch goal (free web version) has been rolled into this stretch goal. \nAchievement Unlocked!\nOur first stretch goal added an additional control to the AVID Assistant. This control presents live-rendered images of a box miniature in a tilt block, color coded to match your AVID color, pulling the orientation from the AVID itself.  We'll also add a second view that puts the box miniature in an AVID ball, with any bearings shot showing up in the appropriate AVID window.  \nTo see a mockup of the feature in action, see the video below!\nOur Story So Far...\nI'm Ken Burnside. I've published 3D space combat boardgames since 2001, and I currently publish the Origins-award winning Attack Vector and Origins-finalist Squadron Strike. I am also the designer of Saganami Island Tactical Simulator, and worked on Star Fleet Battles and Federation Commander.  I'm working on Squadron Strike: Traveller as this Kickstarter runs.\nI love space combat, whether it's the genre-defining realism of Attack Vector, the epic sweep of Traveller, or the simple fun of recreating a battle from a favorite movie as a convention game. As long as we're all blowing up spaceships, everyone wins.   \nIf you love space combat like I do, you may own one or more of my games. And you may despair of sharing that love with other gamers--the ones who say \"3D? No way.\"\nI'm here to help, with the AVID Assistant.\nAll of these games use a play aid called the AVID, or \"Attitude/Vector Information Display.\" The AVID, a top-down view of a sphere set in a hexagon, is a combined orientation manager and firing arc solution. It takes all of the spherical geometry and trigonometry of moving and shooting in 3D and simplifies it down to something a human being can play.\nThe AVID Assistant automates much of the record keeping for Pivots and Rolls, like you see here:\nCourse change! New heading, 270 by plus 30! Mark!\nOver thousands of demos, I've found three categories of players: those who \"get\" the AVID from the word go, those who need to take a few repetitions before the lightbulb turns on, and those who can't quite make it work for themselves.\nThis project is a computerized version of the AVID. For people who already play my games, it makes managing multiple ships easier and speeds up play. It removes errors in orientation, and it moves some of the head-bendy conceptual tricks from your brain to buttons on a tablet or phone. For people who've tried to get other players to the table, the AVID Assistant removes all of \"am I doing this right?\" questions from newbies. \nI'm in an unusual place here. I've taught the AVID and tilt blocks to people ranging in age from five (like the little girl here) to seventy-five.\nShe does not show two dimensional thinking, Captain...\nI've got a functioning, tested program already. My development team and I have put a lot of work into it, and it handles the three basic functions of the AVID, including heading changes (shown in the first image up above), shooting bearings (shown here)\nTarget bearing at 30 degrees off our prow, declined by 60 degrees!\nand mapping bearings to firing arcs.\nAll Guns! Fire!\nTo see the AVID Assistant in action, I've got a video walkthrough linked in here\nIf you're already a fan of my games, even these screen shots should have you excited. If you haven't played my games, but are interested in learning how, this just made picking them up and playing them a lot easier.\nAs much as the program already does, I want it to do more. The Kickstarter funds I'm raising go to cover development costs, and later funding targets will add more features, including stand alone apps for Android and iOS.  I'll add those as the campaign progresses!\nWith your help, I want to release this to the world and make playing my games easier.  Remember: if everyone's blowing up spaceships, we all win!\nChallenge Coin Image\nAtttitude Makes All The Difference\nFunding Targets & Stretch Goals\nAt $5,000, I more or less cover the cost of development done to date.  Everyone who contributes will get a password-protected URL that they can use with any Android or iOS-based device.\nWe are re-evaluating the stretch goals we had planned!\n\nThe first Stretch Goal will be posted tomorrow - don't worry!  It's one of the ones that was down here earlier.   However, we'll have screen grabs, and it'll be at the top of the page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe most basic version of the AVID Assistant is done. It runs in a web browser. We want to add features to it, and make packaged apps for Android and iOS and put them up in the Google Play and iTunes app stores.\n\nIf the Kickstarter funds, all backers at the $5 level and above will be given a password-protected URL that they can point their web browser to for the current version.\n\nWe anticipate that each of the funding targets that involves extra coding will take about a month to six weeks per added feature; we've done test builds with Cordova, the tool set that converts web-based apps into Android apps. We're still learning how to do this for iOS, but it's something we've seen done, and suspect it won't be too difficult.\n\nThe backer rewards have all been sourced with vendors we've used before, and Ad Astra Games has a good track record of shipping merchandise in the US and to Canada. We expect that we'll be placing the orders for apparel items shortly after the Kickstarter ends, with a three-to-four week production cycle, followed by a couple of heavy shipping days.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Last Stretch Goal Completed!

I didn\u2019t want to prepare what I was going to say to you. Why? Because I am searching for my inner truth, I want to know what will I say. In two more days I will be 86 years old\u2026 it\u2019s a lot. Why, at 86 years of age, am I fighting to make a picture? Why? Nothing is that important for me. Is it so important for a person who can die one day to the other, to make a picture? Because when you are 86 years old, every morning you awake and you say \u201cI am still alive\u201d. You are happy to be alive but you are maybe at the end of something. Why make a picture? What is a picture? Some pictures are only fun and show. It\u2019s necessary, because in the world we are all nervous about everything that\u2019s happening, no? They even say we are destroying the planet. So we need to go, to see a picture, to forget ourselves. Perhaps this is necessary, but for me a picture is not that. For me a picture is for remembering your self, not for forgetting yourself. But what does it mean to remember your self? What can we remember? For me, movies are really an art. And what is art? It is the search for your inner beauty. That is art. I don't want to make a picture in order to make money. But if money comes, I open the pocket in order to make more pictures. But that\u2019s not the finality. It\u2019s not the finality to being admired by others. It\u2019s not the finality to lie and invent things you\u2019ve never lived.\nIn order to say something you need to know the thing you\u2019re speaking of. It needs to be an experience, what you show on the screen. What will I show in this picture? What are human beings, art, museums and movie theatres showing to us? Are we those anti-heroes? Those people who have no dignity? We are slaves? We are liars? Thieves? What are we now? I don\u2019t want to show that kind of person. I don\u2019t know how to make pictures of everyone fighting one another, to have money, to steal money Why ?! I don\u2019t want to speak about \u201clove\u201d either; about this \u201clove\u201d that isn\u2019t real, that\u2019s a fairytale. Love is something great, incredible, \u201csublime\u201d\u2026 I don\u2019t know how you say \u201csublime\u201d in English\u2026 The most beautiful thing. Marpa was a saint in Tibet and he said \u201c Life, everything, is an illusion\u201d. One day his son died, his young son died and he was crying and crying and crying and the disciples asked Marpa \u201cWhy are you crying? Your son is an illusion.\u201d \u201cYes, my son is an illusion. But he is the most beautiful illusion.\u201d Movies are an illusion but need to be the most beautiful illusion. I know what it\u2019s like to scream because one of your sons died. It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s terrible And in that moment you ask yourself, \u201c Why am I doing art, movies? Why?!\u201d and then you say I am making movies and art in order to heal my soul. I need to open! Open ! open ! myself, in order to fin myself. To remember what the human being is. The beautifulness of the human being. The beautifulness of you. I need to show how beautiful the human being is. Now.\nIn Chile, in the forties, I was 24 years old\u2026 it was a fantastic moment. The war was all over the planet, and in Chile : no war. Because we are far and separate of the world: no television, mountains, ocean, peace! It was so peaceful. It was beautiful. And then a miracle happened : Poetry came to the country. Great poets started to write marvelous, marvelous poems; two of them have the Nobel Prize, Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral \u2013 our father and our mother.\nAnd then, everything was poetry. We were living our adolescence in this situation: poetry everywhere. And we started to search for the \u201cpoetical act\u201d. For how it was to live with beautifulness. How it was to live in the mind: free! In heart : in union with world. In the sex: in full creativity.\nHow to make poetical action in order to discover the beautifulness of Life. There it was. In that time, the poetry was there. The human being was there. We had love, we had artists, we discovered all kinds of art.\nAnd that suddenly disappeared. When I was 24 I left this paradise, and went to Europe where the world is illusion or disillusion, you don\u2019t know.\nBut now I want to show what a spiritual paradise is: a young person, searching for the beautifulness of poetry. That is all that I want. I want to express\u2026 how to say it in English?... How I am obliged to this past\u2026 because I knew how it was to live in poetry. I knew that. And I want to show the world that it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s possible to remember your self. It\u2019s possible to open your mind. It\u2019s possible to open your heart. It\u2019s possible to open your creativity. To live with less, but to live well. Well. That is what I want. Poetry without end. Endless Poetry. That is what I will do.\nENDLESS POETRY(Poes\u00eda Sin Fin) Official site: http://www.poesiasinfin.com/\nAfter a 23 yearlong absence, the director of cult classics El Topo (1969) and Holy Mountain (1973) made his comeback in film direction in 2013 with The Dance of Reality. The film was based on the first part of Alejandro Jodorowsky's homonymous autobiographical book, depicting his childhood years in Tocopilla, Chile. His new film ENDLESS POETRY (Poes\u00eda Sin Fin) will be based on the latter half of the same book, depicting the author's youth in lively Santiago de Chile.\nOur world is suffering from a devastating absence of poetry. Na\u00efvely we sometimes hope to reconnect with it through film. But the greed-riddled industry, having colonized this magnificent art form, has done everything to strip it of its poetic power. With this film, Jodorowsky directs his energy more than ever into creating a film that can serve as a vehicle for awaking consciousness. It is our duty to enable all efforts to fight the powers that insist on lowering cinema to just a product in a commercial market. This film will bring forth an example of film's poetic power.\nENDLESS POETRY (Poes\u00eda Sin Fin) flashes back to those decisive years in Alejandro Jodorowsky's youth; years that defined the principle that would reign over his entire life: Poetry. The director's life has been a constant effort to expand his imagination and push back against his own limits in order to apprehend and harness the potential for liberation that lies within each and every one of us. His career has been an open invitation to follow him in his efforts.\nENDLESS POETRY (Poes\u00eda Sin Fin) will be carried out as an offering both to film and to the general audience, who are infinitely more profound, intelligent and sensitive than the Hollywood industry would like to admit.\nENDLESS POETRY (Poes\u00eda Sin Fin) explores the magic reality underlying our surrounding world. The film seeks to inspire and encourage us all to dare to find our true selves. It is an invitation to Life.\n (c)Pascale Montandon-Jodorowsky\nLeaving his childhood and his native Tocopilla behind, the adolescent Alejandro Jodorowsky follows his parents to Santiago de Chile. Between his lack of self-confidence and the family pressure he is under, Alejandro struggles to express his desires and find his own path. But the flourishing capital, filled with artists and poets offers the perfect setting for him to grow out of his cage. Thinking he'd fit in well, Alejandro's cousin Ricardo takes the young boy to the home of Veronica and Carmen Cereceda, where puppeteers, dancers, sculptors and painters all live and create together. There, defying all of his old limitations, Alejandro takes the first step on his path to becoming a poet in the Chilean artistic epicenter of the 1940s. Alongside rising poets like Enrique Linh, Nicanor Parra and in the arms of his first love, Stella Diaz, Alejandro's poetic destiny takes form and a new world unravels \u2026 changing his life forever.\n The film will be shot in Santiago de Chile from July to August 2015 for eight weeks. Its post-production such as editing, music tracks, visual effects and so forth will take place in Paris and Tokyo with completion slated for the end of February 2016. The total buget will be about three million dollars.\nAlejandro Jodorowsky says; \u00ab The necessity for expression is more important than the type of film you want to make. I make a film when I have something I need to express. I don\u2019t think about investors, industries or commercialisation. I just need to express myself. \u00bb\nIn order to realize Jodorowsky\u2019s new film production, we need the support of micro producers across the world who understand his vision of cinema.\nJodorowsky thinks that all money should be transformed into poetry. And so that is what he will do with this Kickstarter project. No matter what level you pledge at, Jodorowsky will exchange your pledge into his brand new Poetic Money (DINERO PO\u00c9TICO) and send it back to you. This money can't be spent on any material goods -- only on the poetry of the universe.\nThe exchange rate is 1US$\uff1d1DP.\n(In the case of $10,000 or more pledge, it is 0.5US$=1DP\uff09\nThere are 3 bill denominations: 1DP, 10DP and 100DP. Each bill has an original money-related poem written by Jodorowsky printed on it in Spanish. There are two versions of each DP bill, each version of the bill presenting a different poem. There are 6 kinds of bills in total.\nJodorowsky wants to fill the world with poetry. So when you pledge, please mumble a poem in your heart.

It is a project Alejandro Jodorowsky has long wanted to make into a film. For now, it\u2019s been brought to life as a comic book.\nAccomplished artist Alejandro Jodorowsky is known internationally for his merits in film, literature and comic book authorship. The \"father of the midnight movie,\" he is best known for his avant-garde films El Topo and The Holy Mountain and has since been admired by cult cinema enthusiasts of all generations for his ability to create powerful, poetic and surreal images. He has been a key figure of avant-garde artistic creation and out-of-the box thinking since the 1940s and 1950s, when he was growing up in Chile. A college dropout he left Chile for Paris, where he joined Andr\u00e9 Breton's surrealists group and studied pantomime with the great Etienne Decroux. He later went on to develop his vision of theatre in Mexico, where he revolutionized popular aesthetics. He is also known for creating and developing Psycomagic, a form of therapy that aims to heal psychological wounds through the performance of certain prescribed acts that can directly tap into and heal the unconscious mind.\nEl Topo, colour, 124 min, 1970. 1972 Ariel Award for Best Cinematography, Best Production Design Best Editing 2006 Cannes Classic Official Selection\nThe Holy Mountain, colour, 113 min, 1973.

We are a small team with an enormous weight on our shoulders and finishing the Film has been our main priority up until now. Even today, we face a new challenge : distributing the Film worldwide and making sure it reaches the audience in over 30 countries where the Film is awaited.

We thank you endlessly for your patience and understanding as we continue the battle against the Film Industry, in defence of the Art of Film and we prepare your rewards to send them out. \n\nThis Film is as much yours as it is ours.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make. The biggest challenge for us would actually be if you blow us out of the water. We're already working with our pals at Cards Against Humanity to make sure that no matter how many people pledge, everyone gets their Exploding Kittens quickly after the campaign ends. None of us want this to be a campaign where you spend the next two years getting fifty emails about production updates and delays. If you back this project, we want to be sure you can start blowing up your friends as soon as possible. This is why (for now) we're not offering t-shirts or other complicated reward tiers that would make the distribution process take a lot longer. We're keeping it as simple as possible: support our project and in return we'll send you the playable game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Listen.
