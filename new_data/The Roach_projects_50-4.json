We were some of the best\u2026until we weren\u2019t.\nNot sure how it went to the side, but one job ended with the needed one dead and the marked one livin\u2019, while the next job dumped us right on the heads of another Skulk workin\u2019 the same and bein\u2019 earlier. I conceive that the coffin nail must have hit when we tore down a quarter of the waterfront in our rapid departure, and it turned out that knowin\u2019 our doin\u2019 was just about the last thing our patron wanted. I blame our glow-crust, fae-brained handler for the lack of detailin\u2019, but the Magus don\u2019t need or hear excuses. We got lax and dropped the lash.\nSo the Magus took it up.\nNow we\u2019re trapped and treadin\u2019 on a world that almost was, where it seems every race has died out or been killed off by humans. And these are Steel Worshippers, the worst kind of humans. They learned to tame this place without magic, using mechanix to brutally bend the elements to their will without regard to cost or consequence. They still burn most things for power and locomotin\u2019 and every inch of their spaces is crawling with electric. These are a fearsome people, and we have been set here to clear our accounts and prove our worth.\nThe Magus has a taste for magical numbers and obfuscated lessons, so we got four trials on our compass. Four significant dealings that are as much punishment as test. Well that\u2019s no thing. We been through the worst tongue-looseners of Bol-Darac and saw our way through. As for putting us to the test? Every test is meant to be passed, otherwise they\u2019d call it a \u2018Fail\u2019.\nWe\u2019ll come through this, heads still on our necks. Skate our demons and dust this gauntlet to regain our place in the Drape. And once we\u2019re back, won\u2019t be no one that glances hard or talks soft about us for a good while. I know this in my bones, and I trust my Foxes. Overcoming is in our scroll.\nBut first I\u2019m to figure out what a \u2018grocery store\u2019 is, and how we can go about robbing one.\nA Fine Mess is what we like to call a \u2018chimeric hack\u2019. It borrows the Fate Point structure from the Coretex Plus Action system and adds it to the storytelling core from Blades in the Dark. There is also a bonkers weapon-creation mechanic of our own design. This alchemy has resulted in a standalone game system designed for boisterous campaigns that can just be an evening of fun, or last 2-4 sessions depending on your group\u2019s interest.\nIt is meant to be played with 3-5 players including the GM. Though it's possible to have more players, it can get a bit unwieldy.\nIf there were a one sentence description of A Fine Mess, it would be: Ocean\u2019s Eleven meets Scott Pilgrim by way of D&D.\nIn the late 1800\u2019s, our world experienced the \u2018Intersection\u2019; a melding of our reality with another where magic was the dominant force, and elves, dwarves, faeries and many things that go \u2018bump\u2019 in the night were commonplace. Over the past 150 years, technology continued to advance alongside magical inquiry, leading to new and unexpected amalgamations. Technomancers, magical artificial intelligences and cyborgs powered by eldritch forces, to name a few.\nIn this new world, influential individuals or organizations often make use of small teams of specialized groups to perform \u2018extralegal\u2019 tasks. In the Drape -the largest city on the planet and a confluence of Ley Lines- these groups are known as Skulks, and their members are Foxes. In A Fine Mess, each player takes the role of a Fox, and all the Foxes at your table are part of a single Skulk that has failed to accurately complete one too many assignments. Your employer has decided a lesson in impulse control is required and has therefore provided a set of opportunities- grueling tasks to prove your worth and earn your way back on to the A-list..\nYour employer also happens to be a Ley Line Magus, and in a fit of pique has tossed your Skulk into an alternate reality to do these jobs.\nOur reality, in fact.\nYou are now a Fox with a magical ward that prevents the locals from noticing if you aren\u2019t Human, and your own considerable skills to see you through.  You will naturally run heists to acquire rare items from our reality, but you will also face Herculean efforts like getting licenses from the DMV, organizing an office party for Karen\u2019s retirement, waiting tables at a Denny\u2019s at 3am on a Saturday, or maybe even attending a wedding.\nSounds painful, right? Well, that was your Patron\u2019s point, really. Except, he didn\u2019t realize that by forcing your Skulk through a dimensional membrane, that membrane was weakened. Substantially.\nThis bleeding of reality manifests in two ways. First, you are able to influence the actual fabric of this world with your will. Sometimes it lets you turn ordinary objects into incredible weapons, and other times it allows you to solve problems by altering the problem itself, or even your own previous actions.\nThe second complication is that difficulties in this reality may evolve into much more dangerous obstacles or opponents simply by coming into contact with you.\nFor example, you may have a mission to find the perfect birthday gift for your boss. While you shop at this \u2018Target\u2019, which you wrongly assumed to be a weapons dealer, you encounter a screaming child throwing a tantrum on the floor. You opt to turn around and leave the aisle the way you came, but find you are blocked by a retiree in a mechanical shopping cart. You decide to ask her to move her cart aside so you can pass, but you fail the dice check, and are suddenly facing a slathering geriatric demon of Ur, and they only get meaner with age. You try to run the other direction, only to discover that the screaming child has become a Wailing Banshee Shogun Warrior with an escort of floating skull Otogi, and there is no option left other than to fight.\nYou turn to the shelf on your right, roll a few dice, burn a Weaving Point, and you now face your opponents with the Crystalline Shield of Cheerios and the Flaming Short Sword of Butterworth. You desperately hope your Skulk got the 911 text and are only a few aisles away, because things are looking grim...\n\nA Fine Mess will be a classic 8.5 x 5.5inch, saddle-stitched, B/W softcover. There will also be an optional companion Zine that will contain detailed descriptions of the Menagerie of Antagonists (MoA), their Lieutenants and Henchmen. The MoA have unique abilities, weaknesses and interests in you and your activities during your campaign, and you will create timers during play that convey their impending interaction with you. The variety of MoA and their 'flavors' necessitated a separate Zine because it exceeded the maximum size the saddle-stitching could handle.\nRest assured, everything you need to play is in the core A Fine Mess zine, including a selection of Antagonists not represented in the MoA companion. The companion Zine is meant to provide depth and  a constantly rotating set of opponents to keep your campaigns unique. Additionally, all of the custom Antagonists and Lieutenants that Handler and Magus level backers help create will be included in the companion Zine.\nLayout/Design is subject to change. This page is 25% gray in order to make it visible against the background\nAdditional elements you will find in the Zine:\n- A selection of major antagonists, their lieutenants and henchmen. All with unique attributes. You will start with an Arch Enemy faction, and, if you choose to play a campaign, your Skulk will acquire or placate more factions during or after each session. The various antagonists and complications will have a countdown to an encounter that stays in the play area, and you will have a limited ability to deal with these timers. This makes every session and campaign of A Fine Mess unique, with multiple narrative Swords of Damocles, hanging ominously or humorously over your Skulk.\n- A breakdown of weapon types and attributes that will allow you to turn any common object into a fearsome dealer of defense from harm, possibly even one that is Named. But you will just as often get a weapon with a weakness, like a Terrifying Sword of Baguette that is remarkably powerful, until it gets wet. And blood, well, is typically wet.\n- Several campaign structures that can be followed, as well as a list of scenarios, missions, obstacles and opponents that you can slot into your campaign, or use as fodder for your own creations.\nIf you are looking for a grit and steel role-playing game that lasts two years and takes your character to the edge of their capabilities and an arbitrary level cap\u2026you may need to keep looking. A Fine Mess is meant to be a raucous, laugh-filled night of absurd storytelling and skin-of-your-teeth successes. The systems are simple enough to be adapted for your own games, should you want to drop your players into an unlikely scenario, but complex enough to make this a fun diversion or a solid entry-level game.\nIf this Kickstarter is successful and there is interest, we may explore a zine that allows you to play in the origin reality from which you were banished in A Fine Mess.\n\nOur Stretch Goals are low-key, but become progressively more difficult to incorporate into the core game. This adds time to the production as well as pages to the physical copy, so we set the goal posts at levels that indicated a significant interest in this Kickstarter.\nTwo additional races and primary job classes will be added, bringing the total to 12.\n Two additional Main Antagonists will be added, bringing the total to 10.\nTen additional attributes in the Weapon Creation system, bringing the total to 30. \nThirteen Unique Weapons will be added to the game that have their own set of reality bending rules.\n\nAs we stated above, this work is based on the Blades In The Dark narrative RPG, which is used with permission. \nBlades in the Dark\u2122 is a trademark of One Seven Design. The Forged in the Dark Logo is \u00a9 One Seven Design, and is used with permission.\n\nThe PDF will be distributed through a download link provided by Dropbox.com\nThe physical copy of the game will go out through standard mail worldwide. Based on mailing address, there are three different shipping & handling costs that will be paid through the campaign manager: United States (+$4), Canada (+$10), or Other International (+$15).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, so there will naturally be growing pains, which is precisely why we chose delivery in December, as we would rather delivery early than miss the deadline.\n\nWe have selected Smartpress for production since they were used by several successful Zines last year and their reputation was solid.\n\nNaturally, we can't possibly foresee all production difficulties, but if things go too far sideways, we will do everything in our power to get you at least the PDF versions before the delivery deadline.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "A Brown\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nTabletop Gaming EnthusiastSee more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Kit", "descp": "PDF Copy of A Fine Mess and all Stretch Goals\nINCLUDES:\nPDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Kit & Kaboodle", "descp": "Receive a PDF of both A Fine Mess and the Antagonist companion Zine\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy of A Fine Mess\nPDF Copy of Antagonist companion Zine", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Fox", "descp": "Physical Copy of A Fine Mess, the PDF and all Stretch Goals\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical Copy + PDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Skulk", "descp": "In addition to all Fox level rewards, you will also receive a copy of the Antagonist companion Zine.\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of A Fine Mess\nPhysical Copy of the Antagonist companion Zine\nPDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Handler", "descp": "Your name (or a name you provide) will be immortalized as a unique lieutenant in one of the antagonist groups.

Players form a Crew and attempt to survive among clunky technology and quirky denizens of a megalithic Hotel.\nYou enter the Hotel. You were not looking for adventure, just a brief escape from the limbo of daily life. The Hotel seems to have other plans.\nUsing a streamlined rules system featuring regular six sided dice, Dead Halt is a complete setting for cyberpunk-esque roleplaying. It was designed to be extremely quick to learn, easy to play, and narrative driving. It is a perfect game for one shots as well as for developing long term campaigns. Characters are created during play, and Game Masters can run it with little to no preparation.\nDead Halt is a passion project that I began a few years back. I was in search of a Roleplaying game that allowed anyone to sit down and play at the drop of a hat. After a more than successful ZineQuest 1, Dead Halt needs more content! Happy New Year 1999 is our answer, This 5.5 x 8.5 in Zine will contain:\nFIVE New Adventure Arcs\nEach one is a four page story arc, just like those in the Dead Halt User's Guide. These get a session off the ground instantly by inciting Job, a few key items, characters, and a simple premise or quest to launch players into the Hotel without any delay.\nEach Adventure Arc in Happy New Year 1999 will cover one quarter of the year leading up to Y2K, where Crews will encounter everything from email viruses to cryogenically frozen undead.\n HAPPY99 - A mysterious self replicating email virus containing nothing but a small fireworks simulation accidentally brings the sentience protocols from standard Consoles to unconscious robots, the Nearly-Autonomous Automatons. \n Return of Keldon - Funding for cryogenics in the Hotel finally takes off when deep below the surface an ancient clan of armored warriors is discovered frozen into the bedrock. With these knights returned from the dead, what else may resurface? \n It\u2019s FORTRA\u2019s World - As fear of the Millennium Bug sweeps through the Hotel, the final date for Consoles is on the horizon. Can the Crew find the Hotel's long lost central cortex FORTRA in time, and what must they do to prevent it's corruption? \n Stack Overflow - On the dawn of Year 2000 the Hotel tries to drag itself out of the inevitable catastrophe that has befallen it. Where does the Crew stand? \n Advent of Aphelion - A new era is on the horizon, is there any place for the Hotel? \nNew Character Origins\nThese Origin options will give you new abilities and backgrounds for when your first character inevitably becomes a Clunkhead and you have to create another. The first two are Undead and Nearly-Autonomous Automatons (NOT-O's)!

New Item lists have also been posted in the Downloads section!\nDead Halt includes everything from:\nHorror elements with breaks of light hearted humor.\nDiscussions of the change of ones personal identity through body modification.\nExistential dread under the rule of an unhinged super computer.\nA robot-slaying bird-headed business man and his sarcastic cat.\nClunkPunk is our word for it: CyberPunk motifs jammed into the aesthetic and unreliability of 1980's technology. \nSetting aside, the Dead Halt game system was created specifically to;\nBegin play within an hour of picking up the Zine.\nHave no session zero, jump right in and create characters in game.\nBring in players brand new to Roleplaying Games.\nThis 44 page Zine is a quick read and packed full of content bound by simple to learn rules that allow for incredible stories to emerge without any difficulty. No clunky game mechanics or exhausting text. This in no way means Dead Halt is simple, just efficient.\nIf you enjoy games like Paranoia, Tales from the Loop, Mutant Year Zero, Gamma World, ZORK, or quirky settings with a bit of terror, I encourage you to try out Dead Halt; I think you just might like it. \nMost rewards are a combination of the new Happy New Year 1999 module and the reprint of the Dead Halt User's Guide (The base game for Dead Halt). So onto the Floppy Disks. The Floppy Disks have one adventure on each disk. If you only get one disk for \"FORTRA Forgotten\" this is the new adventure arc. If you get both Floppy Disks you will receive both the original \"Fate of FORTRA\" adventure from our first Kickstarter and the new adventure\"FORTRA Forgotten\".\nYou found out the fate of the Hotel's defunct super computer; FortRA, and now continue the journey with FORTRA Forgotten.\nYeah, its a 3.5 in Floppy disk, probably owned by someone else but I promise I will delete their old MS Paint scribbles or Taxes and such.\nOn the disk will be a PDF Adventure for DEAD HALT. Fate of FORTRA ended up being 18 pages long, has illustrations, game changing rules, and multiple outcomes. If you go through the trouble of buying this outdated media, all I can do is reward you.\nThese Adventures will only ever be released on Floppy Disks, and I will not publish it anywhere else. There will be no link, no download, no print out, just a Floppy Disk. The only way to get this adventure from me will be on this terribly outdated disk.\nWhy? Because at this point I find it incredibly wonderful that people thought this was as delightful as I do. Get a floppy disk, wonder whats on it, break out your old Mac G3 and check it out.\nAny extra funding we gain above our goal will go straight into more pages, art, oddities, and content for the book, as can be seen in our Stretch Goals below!

Instead, it creates unique portraits from professionally hand-illustrated weapons, armor, gear, clothing, and facial features. All of those elements can be selected and combined across nearly all of the artwork, including artwork from the stretch goals.\nAs a result, you can make millions of portraits without seeing the same one twice.\nThe simple interface is fun and easy to use. Select your character\u2019s traits (age, gender, race, class, and beauty), and then multiple portraits appear. Pick one you like as a starting point, and fine-tune it until it matches your vision of your character.\n You can make a beautiful portrait on a phone or tablet, then export the image for a range of uses. If you back this Kickstarter at the Publisher level, you can even publish the portraits you create in your own books and games.\nMark a portrait as a favorite, and come back later to update it with new outfits or gear. Keep multiple versions to show how your character looks in town, on adventure, or in disguise. You can make as many portraits as you want; there is no additional cost for each one.\nA rogue in standard gear; in disguise as an alchemist; in prison after the plan goes awry\nYou can even export portraits directly into World Anvil \u2014 one of the world\u2019s best campaign management tools \u2014 to add more personality to your character or your campaign.\nPortrait Workshop isn\u2019t just a cool idea; we\u2019ve actually built it.

Everything in this \"What Can You Draw?\" section is included in the Basic reward.\nRaces & Ethnicities\nWith the Basic reward, you'll be able to make portraits of dwarves, elves, half-elves, gnomes, halflings, humans, orcs, and half-orcs.\nWith the Advanced reward, you'll be able to make dozens of additional races. See the table at the bottom of this page for one list, but you can also combine elements to make even more. \nThere is only one human race, but it contains a wonderful diversity of ethnicities and cultures. Portrait Workshop includes Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, English, Germanic, Greek, Latino, Malinke, Mongol, Persian, Roman, and Viking elements. \nYou can change the coloring on nearly everything in Portrait Studio, including people. For example, your elves can be fair, blue-skinned, dark-skinned, or any other color.\nClasses\nPortrait Workshop covers the classic classes (barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlock, and wizard) as well as a range of NPCs (commoner, royalty, merchant, and more). You can also create characters that go beyond the typical archetypes...

Advanced backers will get a whole lot more gear, now that every stretch goal is unlocked.\nSome of the gear included in the Basic reward\nClothing\nYou can dress your characters in a wardrobe of over three dozen garments suitable for a wide range of adventurers and NPCs. You can layer up to five items of clothing to create a variety of different looks.\nEach garment can be colored in many ways. By default, Portrait Workshop applies one of our professionally designed, color-coordinated palettes. You can change palettes with a single click, or with the Masterwork Tools (included in the Advanced reward), you can select every color individually.\nBodies\nPeople come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Portrait Workshop covers a range, from fantasy archetypes to more \u201ceveryday\u201d body shapes.\nAges\nNot all adventurers are in their twenties. You can use Portrait Workshop to show older characters as well.\nHair\nAll backers get over three dozen hairstyles, as well as facial hair and stubble. Advanced backers will get even more, now that the Hairstyles stretch goal is unlocked.\nWe want to give the gaming community the best tool ever for creating character portraits.\nWe have already built alpha versions of the iOS and Android apps, have worked out the technical, artistic, and product design details, and have commissioned enough artwork to validate the approach. Now it\u2019s up to you to help make it a reality by backing this Kickstarter so that we can complete the remaining artwork.\nPlus, this project funds talented artists doing a whole lot of great work \u2014 a cause we can all get behind!\nOur backers have unlocked every single stretch goal below; the Advanced reward now contains every one of these. Thanks for helping us make Portrait Workshop so much bigger!\nThe stretch goals are not simple, stand-alone \u201cpaper dolls\u201d. You can combine artwork between them and the basic art in nearly unlimited ways. \nThese portraits intermix pieces from some of the unlocked stretch goals\nWhile Portrait Workshop is not part of, or specific to, a single game system, below is an idea of how you could use it to draw illustrations for characters of most of the playable races from D&D. You can also combine different elements to invent your own races.\nOur target timeline is:\nFeb 2020 - Kickstarter completes\nMay 2020 - All backers receive the Beta version of Portrait Workshop with Basic features and artwork\nJuly 2020 - Advanced backers receive the beta version of the Masterwork Tools, Frame Shop, and at least two Stretch Goals if funded (the remainder will be released as completed, likely over several months)\nAugust 2020 - All backers receive the final version of Portrait Workshop.\nAfter our backers have the final app, we\u2019ll release Portrait Workshop to the public as a free app with Basic controls and limited artwork. The free app will include a fraction of the outfits, hairstyles, and facial features that our Basic backers receive, with only humans and none of the Stretch Goal content. Additional artwork and features will be available via in-app purchase.\nBy backing this Kickstarter, you are getting significant savings from the cost of the same features and artwork when the app goes public. \nWe will accept pre-orders for the app at some point after the Kickstarter ends. Those will have higher pricing than the special backer pricing here, and will not include the exclusive Curiosities of Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nArtwork: We have completed the artistic design including formal art style guide, templates, and references. We\u2019ve assembled a team of talented artists who have contributed to what you see on this page.

But that was before Beazt slew the Children, and Abominous, his creator, broke the world. Scattered, the remaining Children struggled for survival, trying to tame a paradise that had turned against them.\nFor millennia they have been separated from one another by Sorogoros, the worldwyrm, which wraps it's huge serpentine coils around each continent on the planet. Controlling the sea and sky, the Sorogoros ensures that no fish, no fowl, no ship can cross from one \"coil\" to another. And so have the Children been trapped on their continental islands, the knowledge of their brethren fading with each passing day, their desire to travel the open sea long all but lost.\nBut things are changing.\nThe Children are thriving. They are restless. And they once again hear the calls of their ancestors from across the churning seas. Tales abound that the Sorogoros has by tamed. Ships are appearing in ports outside of the safe harbors and the inland seas. Their destination - new lands. Their guarantee - Adventure.\nAre you brave enough to board one today? Are you brave enough to discover what lies beyond the horizon? Are you brave enough to explore Denoa? \nBehold The Doorway To Adventure\nDenoa is a world built for storytelling. It contains a rich mythology and history that inform adventures without overwhelming them with detail. An official campaign story plays out in real time, with key events hosted at kitchen tables and game stores around the world. However, DMs and players can take things at their own pace, and choose to play the meta story, or use it's ideas to tell their own stories.\nBehold a world that feels like home. Whose paths and plains, forests and fields, cities and landscapes feel familiar. Like something you know, and understand, because you've been there before. \nBehold a world that feels fresh and new. Where familiar ideas and common tropes are upgraded, updated, and never stale. Where the familiar is just different enough to excite your senses, and invite you to explore it.\nBehold a world that is strange, and magical, and unlike any world you have seen before. A world where the unfamiliar and uncomfortable clash with the fantasy that you know. Where any - and every - fantasy idea has a place to grow. Where continents, cultures, monsters, and magic have evolved separately from each other. Where each location is amazing, wondrous, and completely unique.\nBehold a world made up of worlds, where all of your favorite settings come together - and clash. Imagine a green world, where humans, elves, and dwarves band together to fight a common foe. Imagine a savage world, where tan, magic-hating barbarians tread the land on sandalled feet. Imagine a frozen world, where snowbound creatures draw magic by singing to the northern lights. Imagine a fairy world where fey folk and talking animals are commonplace. Imagine a burning world, where hell has literally come to earth, and demons, devils, and insect races dominate the harsh landscape.\nBehold Denoa. The world where these worlds - and others - are on the edge of discovering each other.\nDenoa and it's official campaign will bring modern technology to bear in it's story telling. Through the use of in-store-only events, online surveys, and a dedicated app, we hope to gather your experiences and use them to shape our story. What you share with us could shape our official campaign, our next official event, or even a future product! \nUnofficially you can shape the world in any way you choose. We've even built it so that you can add your own world TO Denoa. So if you like worldbuilding, there's no need to abandon your work to play Denoa. Use one of the provided options to put Denoa into YOUR world, or YOUR world into Denoa, making the story you tell uniquely yours.\nDenoa is in every way a collaborative effort. Designed by Danny O'Neill, it will be created by some of the best talent and game companies in the industry (for a full list, see the bottom of this Kickstarter). And that design is guided by YOU and the actions you take during Organized Play events.\nOne of the key collaborators on the project is DGNFOG who will help us build all the maps for Denoa. Another is the community we hope to build around World Anvil and our Organize Play efforts. If you are a retailer, a designer, a writer, or interested in contributing to Denoa in ANY WAY, reach out to us through our social media. We might not have room for your particular talent or idea, but we'd love to include you any way we can. \n There are three major components to this project - the Book, the Denoa App, and the Organized Play. We have set a low goal in order to help with internet marketing algorithms. For the book to reach it's full potential, this Kickstarter will have to earn approximately $15,000. \nThe Denoa app has 3 Tiers. Tier 1, the Basic App is already funded. Tier 2, the Advanced App is our true goal. We will need this Kickstarter to fund between $25,000 and $30,000 for this app to be fully funded. \n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDenoa is a broken, magical world. In the time before time, it's continents were separated by a titanic sea serpent know as the Sorogoros. As a result, the ecology of each land evolved without the others. Each now sports it's own peoples, it's own cultures, it's own magic styles, it's own monsters. Your job is to uncover them all. But for now, things are secret, and information is purposefully made scarce.\nTo discover as much as you can about Denoa, head to World Anvil.\nColarwyn\nOur story starts in Colarwyn, a region which acts as a hub for this project and future ones. Colarwyn is one of 5 regions in the continent known as Ostarwyn. Almost all of the countries in this region border an inland sea, known as Merala.\n\nThe Free City of Arbor\nWe are extremely proud to be partnering with some of the most talented companies, writers, and artists in the business. \nAuthors\nEd Greenwood is a Canadian worldbuilder, writer, game designer,  and librarian who creates imaginary worlds; his best known one is the  Forgotten Realms\u00ae fantasy setting, which he began creating when he was  six years old, and is still expanding  and enriching more than fifty years later.

The primary artwork for the book is already completed, and writing has begun. We're in a good place with how the capsules and OP work, and we'll be playtesting within a few weeks.\n\nThe largest challenge we have is making sure Denoa fulfills it's potential by fulling funding the app. The basic version will be enough to stay connected and play Denoa events, but the full version will allow for players to integrate their characters into the storyline with ease. That will allow a lot more players into the collective story we are telling. So although Denoa will survive with even the Basic app, the Full App is what we are truly shooting for. The goal for this is high - we need this Kickstarter to hit $40K to be able to get to this plateau. And that's why we consider this our largest challenge.\n\nThe next challenge we have is to get enough stores into our network hosting Denoa events. If your local game store hosts role-playing games, and if you think they are interested, please tell them about us!

I almost didn't run this crowdfunding on this platform because of the anti-union stance of Kickstarter leadership. I'm the son of a unionized worker and I like things like 40 hour work weeks, vacation time, paid sick time, week-ends, lunch, and safe working conditions. I'm also a technology professional and it's well past time for the workers in our industry to advocate for themselves in organized ways. When many companies call themselves tech companies that happen to \"x\", its workers are part of that change in visualization. We too must change our view of technology professions. As we become ubiquitous, obligatory, and integral to corporate success, we will be increasingly considered interchangeable and expendable (it's already happening if you haven't noticed). Unions are there to protect the worker and protections we will soon need. I stand in solidarity with KSRU. I call on Kickstarter\u2019s senior leadership to recognize the union now, and I hope you\u2019ll join me. How you can help.\n#RecognizeKSRU\n Thanks for listening. Back to the regularly scheduled crowdfunding plea.\nThe House of the Red Doors\n\"Generations ago the House of the Red Doors visited your village. Now, so many years hence, could it be passing this way again? As the story goes its mistress, Jassafae, still untouched by time\u2019s ravages, is an instrument of Ullhume, a powerful being of unknown origin. Through her fates are altered and wishes granted, but only to those brave enough to cross her threshold. You toil ceaselessly and suffer much and to what end? Unrequited dreams and the hope of an early grave? You resolve to enter and change your destiny.\"\nThe House of the Red Doors is a Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG funnel that can be used for tournament play or it can level up a peasant for campaign play. It is one player adventure that requires a Judge. \nIn most Table Top RPG adventures there is a group dynamic. This adventure, is more intimate, like visiting a psychic or a gypsy. In fact, the beginning of Ultima IV was an inspiration for this adventure. The House of the Red Doors also presents the interesting dynamic of a player solving puzzles alone. \nThis version of the adventure will come with instructions to run as a tournament and for character development. It is short in duration (about 20 mins) and can be replayed several times if necessary (it's usually necessary).  \nCan you survive The House of the Red Doors?\nThis funnel has gone through extensive alpha and beta testing as both a tournament and for character creation. A 3-day tournament was ran at GenCon this year. Feedback has been very positive. I think the best quote over the testing was, \"It's got that Appendix N, trippy vibe.\"\nGen Con 2019 House of the Red Doors Tournament\nThe adventure is also edited and layout is nearly finished. 95% of the art has been completed. I expect to be able to send codes for the PDF without stretch goals soon after this Kickstarter concludes - a perfect X-mas adventure. It's is as done as you'll ever see in a Kickstarter.\nWhat You'll Get:\nA table top RPG adventure funnel for one 0-Level peasant to try their luck\nProduct dimensions: 8.5\" x 11\"\nPages: ~30\nColors: Color cover, B/W inside\nArt: YES! by  Stefan Poag \nHeavy paper for print backers: 100# cover, 80# interior\nLimited edition, hand numbered for print backers\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nSo, it's time to produce this adventure for the masses. Print on Demand has been a godsend for the hobby (and me), but I feel it's time to start printing copies and exploring other distribution channels (like the Friendly Local Gaming Store, online stores, etc). That's where you come in.\nThis kickstarter will pay for the last few art commissions and print up a limited number of high quality books. If you backed Lesser Key to the Celestial Legion, you have good idea of what that quality means. I'll be hand numbering copies and once they are gone they are gone. The House of the Red Doors will be released in association with Donn Stroud and Psychoda Press. Stefan Poag has supplied the art and is working on the cover as I finish this. Doug Kovacs is on standby for a drop table to be used for creating the PC's backstory. If we get close to the TROIKA! version of The House of the Red Doors, I hope to set-up itch.io bundle with the TROIKA! Numinous Edition fantasy RPG rulebook.\nStretch Goals\n ACHIEVED! $2,500 Tournament Extras: We'll produce a full set of illustrated handouts to facilitate running the adventure at gaming convention.\n ACHIEVED! $3,500 Drop Table: A spiffy drop table (illustrated by Doug Kovacs) for determining why peasants enter the House of the Red Doors.\n ACHIEVED! $4,000 TROKIA! Edition: We'll produce a PDF only version of the adventure for the TROKIA! RPG, the other world's favorite fantasy RPG.\n ACHIEVED!  $5,500 Mini Booklet Player's Handout:  A one page, fold & cut, mini booklet handout. Featuring mini maps and vistas not yet illustrated in the adventure. \nThanks for your consideration. \nWhere doth yon door lead?\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games. Mechanically, DCC is based on the world\u2019s most popular RPG, but the rules have been reforged\u2014streamlined in some places, expanded in others, and injected with a wild and exciting imagination throughout.  The fantastical imagery and fast playstyle are designed to invoke the classic fantasy and science-fiction adventures tales of old. You\u2019ll find the influences of Leiber, Moorcock, Howard, Vance, Brackett, and more throughout Dungeon Crawl Classics.\nFind out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\nAbout the Author\nI'm a OSR gaming hobbyist living in Michigan who loves to write stuff. You can see some of my other work (Angels, Daemons & Beings Between Volume 2: Elfland Edition, Fae Hard) on DrivethruRPG and Goodman Games. Free stuff in Sanctum Secorum and Gongfarmer's Almanac. Get a marvelous heavy paper copy of The Lesser Key to the Celestial Legion from Psychoda Press or Goodman Games. You can tweet at me @lectrotext.\nAbout the Artists\nStefan Poag: Lives and works in Michigan with his significant other (Annie) and two dogs.  His illustration work has appeared in the Dungeon Crawl Classics core book and many, many DCC RPG modules from Goodman Games. He can be found at  https://stefanpoag.com and tweets @sbpoag.\nDoug Kovacs: If there\u2019s one artist who has helped define \u201cthe DCC experience\u201d, it\u2019s Doug. His cover art for the Dungeon Crawl Classics core book and many adventure modules have helped set a tone of adventure, mystery, and the fantastic that reaches throughout the line. And his black-and-white art inside the DCC core book and its many adventures have defined the game\u2019s look\u2014not to mention his awesome maps.

It is, in short, a setting book inspired by the works of legendary Golden Age comic book artist Fletcher Hanks, using the popular Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) rules system. It\u2019s like a Flash Gordon fever dream.\nIn 2011 we (Leighton Connor and Josh Burnett) were inspired by a short Fletcher Hanks story in which the hero Space Smith encountered the terrifying Leopard Women of Venus. We asked ourselves questions like, \u201cWhy are there Leopard Women on Venus?\u201d and \u201cWho else lives on Venus?\" From that we developed our setting, a grotesque alien world seething with malice and filled with exotic locales, bizarre cultures, and murderous monsters. We wrote the original version of Leopard Women of Venus for Hex Games, using the QAGS system.  \nThe Fletcher Hanks page that inspired it all!\nYears later, we realized that our feverish nightmare Venus would be a perfect match for Dungeon Crawl Classics. Like DCC, Leopard Women of Venus is heavily inspired by pulp fiction and foundational fantasy authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs; committed to instilling a mixture of awe, wonder, and horror; and extremely dangerous for Player Characters.\nWe got to work and converted the setting to DCC, adding in new character classes, spells, patrons, and monsters. We also saw plenty of opportunities to tweak and improve--we have expanded and updated everything, including the history of Venus and the relationships among the factions. We have also added a new organization, the Humanoid Coalition, that makes it easier to assemble a PC party.\nEverything people loved from the original version is still here, polished and improved and adapted to our favorite fantasy role-playing adventure game. But now you\u2019ll also find:\nThe Leopard Woman class and their powerful augments\nClear guidelines for how DCC character classes function on Venus\nTwo patrons, Stardust the Super-Wizard and Fantomah, complete with spells\nA list of 100 Venusian occupations useful for creating 0-level characters\nA 0-level funnel, \u201cSaucerful of Secrets\u201d\nA 1st-level adventure, \u201cThe Mines of the Moglugs\u201d\nFantastical sci-fi gear and equipment\nRandom tables to generate countless springboards for adventure\nThe Magnificent Moglug Maker\nAnd much more!\nThe exciting new material in Leopard Women of Venus is usable whether you\u2019re running a game in the savage jungles of Venus or plugging it into your own campaigns!\nWant to see more? We put together a free preview zine that will give you a big juicy taste of LWoV. CHECK IT OUT HERE!\nFormat\nThe book will be released on DrivethruRPG digitally and via print-on-demand.  It will be a 7 x 10\" graphic novel-sized softcover, coming in around 175 pages.\nPlease note that we are not shipping the POD books.  The costs associated with shipping are determined by DriveThruRPG.\nThe Setting\nFrom a distance, Venus is a beautiful blue orb suspended in the inky void. But up close, Venus is a tropical hell-planet, its ecosystem mutated in grotesque and deadly fashion by the mysterious Compound-N. From the Quivering Blood Gnats to the Hideous Spider Priests, from the acid-dripping Venusian Fly-Traps to the carnivorous mushrooms, every living thing is bent on destroying human life.\nDespite the odds, four human factions continue to survive on Venus. In addition to fending off the endlessly lethal flora and fauna, they must also keep watch for invaders from other worlds--Earth, Mars, and Bloodu--and the constant threat of betrayal by the other factions. \nEven the Leopard Women of Venus, with their flying saurians and comet-fire helmets, are hard pressed to defend against these threats. Human civilization exists on Venus now--but for how much longer? That\u2019s for you and your gaming group to decide.\nThe Factions\nHuman civilization of Venus has splintered into four different factions. All are troubled, but the PCs have the chance to make things better.\n Otram: The largest settlement on Venus, Otram is a fortress city ruled by a ruthless prophet-king. The people of Otram only value strength, glory, and powerful weapons.\n The Caverns: Ruled by the unfeeling Science Robots, the people of the caverns have access to amazing technology but little personal freedom. They are defended by the planet\u2019s mightiest warriors, the Leopard Women of Venus.\n Palna: Superstitious scientists and apocalyptic theologians, the people of the mountain-city of Palna pray for the legendary super-wizard Stardust to rain his judgement down upon Venus.\n Avrok: The people of Avrok live in loose tribes deep in the hellish jungles. They are hedonistic pseudo-shamans in a distressing relationship with Venus\u2019s giant snakes.\n The Humanoid Coalition: Founded by gonzo cartoon-journalist and lunatic prophet Forecastle J. MacBeth, the Humanoid Coalition is a cross-factional organization dedicated to preserving humanity on Venus and countering the coming apocalypse foreseen in MacBeth\u2019s dreams.\nWho Was Fletcher Hanks?\nFletcher Hanks produced bizarre stories in the earliest days of American comics. His work is boldly drawn, frequently ugly, and strangely compelling. Hanks only worked in comics from 1939 to 1941, but during this short time he created Stardust the Super Wizard, a terrifying superman from the stars; Space Smith, an outer space adventurer; Big Red, a lumberjack; Fantomah, the first super-powered comic book heroine; and more.\nFletcher Hanks died in obscurity, but he left behind some fascinating comic books. The original comics--issues of Fantastic, Fight, Jungle, and Planet--are extremely rare and require quite a bit of time and money to track down. Fortunately, stories by Hanks are available on the Internet, and in high-quality reprint collections such as Turn Loose Our Death Rays and Kill Them All!: The Complete Works of Fletcher Hanks, edited by Paul Karasik and published by Fantagraphics.\n\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games.

We have been writing games for decades and are two of the co-creators of the ENnie Award-winning game Hobomancer. Josh wrote the ENnie Award-winning Hobomancer Companion and recently wrote and illustrated the OSR zines Crepuscular and Draugr & Draculas. Leighton is also the co-creator of the web comic The Electric Team and the author of the Ross Fulton, Occult Detective series of stories.\nWe have both done illustration work for a variety of projects, including the original Leopard Women of Venus, and we will be contributing artwork to the book. We\u2019ve got experience and we\u2019ll do some good stuff. But we don\u2019t want this book to just be good, we want it to be PHENOMENAL. That\u2019s why the money we raise will go toward hiring additional artists. And the artists we\u2019ve lined up . . . seriously, these artists are great. The book will be lavishly illustrated, with luscious, mind-blowing drawings by some of the finest illustrators working today: \nErol Otus!\nMatt Kish!\nBradley K. McDevitt!\nEvlyn Moreau!\nDiogo Nogueira!\nJuan Navarro!\nJames V. West!\nThose are just the beginning.

West\nThe toxic jungle by Evlyn Moreau\nThe streets of Otram by Juan Navarro\nA map of Venus, by Joshua LH Burnett\nWe are committed to producing a beautiful, high-quality book that is free from any distracting errors. Your Kickstarter dollars will also allow us to hire experienced editors to help us polish the text and deliver the best book we can.

The illustrations are either drawn or underway. The editors are lined up. We are ready to do this thing! Josh recently ran a successful Kickstarter for his Draugr & Draculas zine, and from that experience he developed skills we will use to run this project efficiently.\n\nOne way that we are limiting the risks of this campaign is by using DriveThruRPG for fulfillment. Since your book will be printed by DriveThru when you order it, and shipped through DriveThru, we will not have to fulfill the orders ourselves, which will cut out a whole range of potential problems and make things easier for our international backers. \n\nWhile we are sure there will be challenges along the way, we believe we are ready to handle them and get you your book in a timely manner.

This campaign aims however to set a world record and produce the Worlds Largest Digital, Modular, Dungeon Tile series with 144 beautiful unique sets, each with a massive 144 tile designs.  That was at least, until it funded, and today, I doubled the ambition with an attempt at 288 individual tile sets. Shown below are 240 of them...\nWant a closer look? Kickstarter compresses images but you can download a larger viewing selection from here: SOLOMAN TEMPLE SQUARES SET SELECTION\n This graphic 'THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMAN' will later feature checkable boxes and be available as a digital poster to allow backers to mark off which sets they have - and which sets they might still want to buy later on. \nA Story in the Bible relates that \"Solomon's Temple\" was a fabled architectural marvel built by King Solomon in ancient times to house the Ark of the Covenant. But his legendary deed became enmeshed in a variety of occult grimoires (magical books) and babylonian demonology with intriguing names as such as the 'Lesser Key of Solomon' and the famous 'Legemeton'. It is books like these that popularized ceremonial magic widely and the practices associated with it can also be seen in RPG which has borrowed a great deal of lore from occult sources - including the concept of sorcery, magic seals, signs, protective rings, magic squares, planes, demonic hierarchies, talismans against evil, invocations, curses, circles to summon or enclose demons and so on.  Some tellings of this legend claim Solomons building method enlisted the aid of 72 Demons by means of a magical ring emblazoned with a golden pentagram entrusted to him by the archangel Michael to complete the task of building the Temple.  Whether true or not - I have been fascinated with such stories since I was a boy and the idea of an architect calling down/up Demons/Angels to help in the construction of a Temple is a very cool mythology. In homage I created 72 tile sets for modern day RPG architects, loosely one for each of Solomons supposed demons if you like - and I would like to create 72 more for a grand total of 144. The name of the tile set is also a play on words via 'Solo-man' i.e. someone. an architect, that builds alone. The name is also influenced by the numerological magic square formulae of the occult that I found similar in nature to the different layouts of the tile designs in an 8x8 grid. Finally, I wanted to capture the imagination with a tile set so large to build our 'dungeons/temples' with - it might seem I too had enlisted the help of demons :) And so we have, Soloman Temple Squares. Pledge $45 or more within the first 72 hours and you'll get a free 18 Room Sorcerers Pack (viewable down below) that further pays tribute to these occult/magical connections.\nWith a project name based on this legendary architect - Let's quickly look at some magic numbers to understand how I believe this would be the largest modular dungeon tile set in the world.\n[EDIT: - and now it is twice the size]\n 144 Tile Sets each with 144 Tile-Designs for a total of 20736 Modular Tiles. \nEvery tile is 8x8 with a total of 64 squares. \n Every set of one-hundred and forty-four 8x8 tiles has the equivalent of 9216 individual squares. \n If every individual square is 5x5 ft, every tile represents 40x40 square ft and a total of 1,600 square feet per tile. \n 1,600 sq ft per tile x 144 tiles equates to 230,400 square feet PER SET.  \n 230,400 sq ft x 144 gives Soloman Temple Squares a mind-staggering total area of 33,177,600 SQUARE FEET - (to put this into perspective, the area measures approximately 3 square kilometers, 33 football fields, or the landmass of Coral Sea island.)\n [EDIT: - double these figures]\nBACKERS Can Choose from THREE Tileset Dimensions: - but by DEFAULT your pledge will give you access to all THREE!\n (1) 4FG - sized at 900x900px (50 pixels per square) in 72 DPI for Fantasy Grounds. When the upcoming FGU sizes are known, I will re-supply tiles of that size to backers who use the software. As tiled maps cannot be easily built within the current FG format, it is likely users will assemble maps using an external program such as GIMP or Photoshop, wherein they can resize the map to < 2000x2000px or less with  72DPI jpeg (though I recommend 1350x900) and import the map to FG that way.\n(2) 4Roll20 - sized at 1120x1120px (140 pixels per square) sets in 72 DPI for Roll20 \n(3) 4print - sized at 2400x2400 (8x8\" or 300 pixels per square) in 300 DPI (optimal for printing)\nHERE ARE THE RANGE OF DIFFERENT TILE DESIGNS THAT WILL COME WITH EACH SET:\nHere are some examples of the artwork used in the tiles:  with a mix of Fantasy, Sci-fi, Textured and Non-Textured Tile Sets.\nATLANTIS\nGROTTO\nPUPPY\nFORGE\nCIPHER\nLIGHT BLUE AND WHITE\nFEN\nDUNGEON\nCORPSE\nGLOBE\nISLAND\nJOKER\nPEAT\nSALVAGE\nBROWN and WHITE HATCH\n\nBelow are some samples from additional sets: properly pre-sized and formatted to suit such Virtual Table Top programs as Fantasy Grounds and Roll 20.  You can see how it would be easy to transition from a Temple for instance, to an Ocean Or to alternate different themed-rooms within a single or multiple dungeons - i.e Undermountain and keep your variety of terrain infinitely interesting.\nI have added a HUGE variety of commonly required colour themes including stone, bone, blood, dirt, sand, water, lava, various water depths, and an insane amount more.\n Want a closer look?

This first Stretch Goal will give you 25 Shadow-Based PNG tokens to overlay and alter the appearance, depth and height of your tilesets!\nPLEDGE $45 AUD or more within the First 72 Hours of Campaign Launch to get a Bonus 18-Room Sorcerers Pack! And if we make it to 144 Backers, I'll unlock another special reward.\nMissed out on the time frame? Add this reward to your pledge by adding $18 AUD.\n Just Message me with the Twelve Sets you want and your username and I will make sure you get them when rewards go out.\nWhy back Me? If you haven't backed me before here are some reasons why you might consider backing me and what I do:\n LOW/NO RISK: If funded this will be my 16th successful Kickstarter. I am extremely hard-working and specialize in completing huge digital map/tile projects and have previously delivered all successful projects to promise with no issues and 100% backer satisfaction - you can check the Risks section for a breakdown of previous campaigns.\n VERSATILITY: With a possible 288 unique designs Soloman Temple Squares explodes your options in an unprecedented manner giving you a vast range of tools to suit almost any dungeon tile construction job.\n INTERCHANGEABLE: Every set uses 8x8\" tiles sized for a particular format that will neatly line up with one another for epic-sized dungeons with different areas.\n RANGE: The range includes classic designs, demonic, elemental, undersea, underdark, dimensional, and over 280 different colour combinations to give you every chance of finding the right set for the right job.\n COMPLETION: I have already completed and/or drafted half of the core designs.\n SAVINGS: Soloman Temple Square sets will retail at $5 USD per set. By backing my Kickstarter you pledge in AUD and gain generous saving with a base cost of $3 AUD per set, with costs greatly lowered further for buying in bulk. You also don't have to wait for tiles to be processed and made available from my website to the general public which can take months or even longer.\n UNIQUENESS: It's true there are a lot of modular dungeon tile sets - but no-one has ever attempted one on this gigantic ambitious scale - and I am just the man to do it.\n DILIGENCE: This is not my first campaign - nor my first campaign making a huge amount of tiles - with at least 3 of those behind me, I know what it takes, how long it takes and I strive to deliver an excellent end product on or before time that keeps my backers coming back for more.\n EVOLUTION: Soloman Temple Squares started with just 26 varieties - now I am offering 144. [Edit: And NOW, 288] \n SOLUTION: If you like the artwork, then you can rest assured you won't have to hunt too hard for tiles that match it - with this set of building blocks you can enjoy virtually endless dungeon constructions in the same art style.\n ASSURED DELIVERY: Based on my rate of work and previous experience I am estimating full delivery of all digital rewards by December 2019. I work very hard to complete my art before the stated deadline and get art out to backers as soon as I can - without compromising quality. To date I've not failed to deliver before or on a deadline. \n TRANSPARENCY: You'll always know where I am up to with the project with regular updates and rapid comprehensive communication/replies to any issues that may arise or questions you may have. I strive to keep my backers very well informed of the good (or the bad) and even provide post-campaign support and convenience by installing a campaign graphic that shows which stage of the process I am up to at a visual glimpse, give estimated times for processes, and provide multiple ways to contact me privately or publicly at any time.\n EXCELLENCE: If something isn't right, if something goes wrong, I do my absolute best to fix it quickly and definitively once I spot it or it is brought to my attention during or after my campaigns. I want my backers to have the best tools for their RPG and continually look for ways to improve my products and service.\n REALIZATION: As you can see I am committed to continuing my various Ranges so my users have new and exciting products on a semi-regular basis. Getting to this point wouldn't have been possible without all of the support I have gotten for my art so thank you all very much!\n VTT FUNCTION: Ideal for Virtual Table Top Gaming in at least two popular VTT systems, from both of which I am familiar and a licensed seller of maps and tokens - and my tiles are easy to use in many other generic systems besides.\n RELIABILITY: I always deliver the goods to promise and my record reflects that.\n EXPANSION: Click here to view my website page and other projects including the currently available 900+ Modular Terrain Maps I created called 'Meanders: Synchable Terrain\" that these will also work with: https://gametilewarehouse.wixsite.com/rpgtilesupply\n REPUTATION: My creations currently retail from Fantasy Grounds, Steam, D20 Pro, Roll20 and my own website, Game Tile Warehouse. They are also used by numerous Streamers, Gamers, Savage Mojo and various indie-developers.\n CONTINUATION: I am dedicated to expanding these tiles indefinitely, even with 144 sets I will have only scratched the surface of what is possible, already I am dreaming of far more advanced sets so hopefully I can get the support I need to continue my creative frenzies.\nGAME TILE WAREHOUSE is my website where you can view and purchase other products successfully kickstarted - and get news of new upcoming ambitious projects.\nDid you know? : MEANDERS: SYNCHABLE TERRAIN - my modular battlemap series now with almost 1000  x 27x18\"maps claims to be the worlds largest modular terrain map set. If every square is 5ft, Meanders Maps each measure 135x90ft or a whopping 12,150 sq ft. Currently at about 950 maps when I reach 1000 this will equate to 12,150,000 sq ft of digital modular terrain.\nThank you for taking the time to view my project,\nKind Regards,\nKris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is now familiar territory with little to no risk and I will be working right throughout the campaign and after it to finish any remainder as efficiently as possible.\n\nCreated Art is backed up on Google Drive immediately after it is finalized as well as on two other hard-drives so it cannot suffer loss. Short of personal injury or loss of my equipment nothing in my power will prevent this kickstarter from being completed on time.\n\nI have funded and delivered to promise a dozen giant digital kickstarters in my career and ahead of time as a creator with no issues - Everything will be ready to be delivered in full. I am a professional, dedicated to delivering on time and to promise and this campaign will be no exception.

Obediah Felkner, a prominent resident and claim owner of a nearby quicksilver mine, has recently passed away from a mysterious illness. Surprisingly, a group of complete strangers have been named as his beneficiaries. The claim to Felkner\u2019s mine could become theirs.\nHowever, Felkner\u2019s last will contains a peculiar condition: in order to claim the deed to the mine, the party must collect a holy relic known as the Hand of San Roque and deliver it to Felkner\u2019s grieving widow before dawn. The artifact is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the old Mission San Roque, abandoned by the Spanish almost 40 years ago.\nAnd should they refuse? The lawyer points out they, too, have contracted the same disease that claimed the life of Mr. Felkner, and the retrieval of the relic is their only hope if they wish to survive the mysterious deadly affliction.\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner - Standard Cover (FRK Pyron)\nSummary\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner is a horror-themed western adventure designed for 4-to-6 1st-level characters. This product is compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. The adventure contains pre-generated western-themed DCC RPG characters, so no additional supplements are required. That said, it has been playtested with both David Baity's upcoming Dark Trails RPG and Stormlord Publishing's Black Powder, Black Magic DCC supplement with delightful results. There is an appendix \u201cRunning this adventure with Dark Trails\u201d providing the judge ideas on how to fully leverage the Dark Trails ruleset with this adventure.\nThis full-length, standalone adventure will be between 24 to 28 pages in length. The adventure is completely written, edited, and thoroughly playtested. It currently contains art from some of your favorite DCC RPG artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson. The adventure will be released as an 8.5 x 11 booklet with color cover and black and white interior pages.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! A limited-edition alternate foil-cover will be released and made available for sale only to Kickstarter backers. For an example of the foil cover, check out the one released for Children of the Fallen Sun.\nAnd finally, you will have the option to receive a  Dark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF discount code! See below for details.\nSpoiler Details\nThe adventure is loaded with goodies. Filthy spoilers ahead so if you\u2019re planning on enjoying this adventure as a player you may want to skip to the next section.\nOnly judges here? OK, here\u2019s what goodies you\u2019ll get in the adventure:\nThe bulk of the adventure takes place in a fictional California Mission. Despite being a western, like many of my adventures there\u2019s a strong horror theme where the players will eventually discover there\u2019s a mystery going on at the old Spanish Mission and not everything is quite what it seems\u2026\nThe adventure has approximately 12 keyed encounters, as well as starting and ending events.\nA full-page black and white mission map illustrated by Stefan Poag.\nThe appendix includes descriptions of 3 new magic items (including the artifact The Hand of San Roque), at least 3 illustrated player handouts, and 10 pre-generated 1st-level PCs which can be used as-is or as examples on how to modify a standard DCC class into a western-themed PC.\nStefan Poag illustrates why PCs should be careful when poking around haunted grave yards\nProject Status\nThe project has already reached the following milestones:\nWriting of the adventure is complete, the core adventure has been edited, and the adventure has been playtested by multiple judges at several conventions.\nCover art and most of the interior illustrations are complete.\nA deliciously illustrated map by Stefan Poag is complete.\nThe art for the foil cover by FRK Pyron is complete.\nAmazing new interior illustrations from some of your favorite artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson.\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used to fund the printing of the adventures, and potentially include 2-3 additional pieces of art.\nLimited Edition Foil Cover (FRK Pyron)\nStretch Goals\nGiven that the adventure is almost entirely complete, I will be keeping the stretch goals modest, as I\u2019d like to get the adventure in your hands as soon as possible. Still, I wanted to offer a little something as a thank you to Kickstarter backers.\nAt $3000: Stickers for print backers! Each print copy of the adventure will include  two 3\"x3\u201d stickers: one of the Thick Skull Adventures logo (see below), and another with a new design which will be inspired by one of the pieces of art within the adventure.\nAt $4000: Four additional pages. The adventure is currently 24 pages, but you can help make it 28! The new pages would most likely be a combination of new pieces of art as well as some more background material write ups of the prominent NPCs encountered in Los Castores.\nAt $5500: A full patron write up. Spoiler alert: within the adventure, there is an otherworldly entity meddling with humankind in nefarious ways. At this level, I will do a full write-up of this entity as a patron and include an accompanying piece of art.\nThick Skull Adventures Sticker!\nDark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF Discount Code Offer\nTo get your Weird West campaign started right, David Baity has generously agreed to provide discount codes for the PDF copy of the Dark Trails Quick Start Guide when it becomes available to backers of this Kickstarter.

You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game returns you to the glory days of gaming, allowing you to adventure as 1974 intended you to, but with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery.\nAbout Dark Trails\nThe forthcoming Dark Trails RPG by David Baity is a game which pays homage to the popular Weird West genre.  Dark Trails can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG. While Dark Trails is not required to play The Last will and Testament of Obediah Felkner, the two go together like dust and boots.\nAbout Stephen Newton\nStephen has been publishing adventures for both Thick Skull Adventures and Goodman Games for over seven years. Stephen has garnered a bit of a reputation for his unique style of horror contained with his DCC adventures. He is the author of three of Goodman Game\u2019s Halloween (now Horror) line of adventures including They Served Brandolyn Red, The Corpse that Love Built, and Creep, Skrag, Creep! As the primary author behind Thick Skull Adventures, Stephen has authored the Best Selling Attack of the Frawgs, The Haunting of Larvik Island, Stronghold of the Wood Giant Shaman, and Children of the Fallen Sun (for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG).\nShipping Costs\nEach adventure will ship either in a cardboard envelope or bubble pack via Media Mail. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. This is to protect everyone involved in case there is an unforeseen rate increase in postal costs between funding and final shipping. At the time of launch, shipping and handling is planned to be an economical $5 per book shipped which is charged separate from the pledge levels. Rest assured that we will do everything within our power to ship your books to you the cheapest and most economical way possible.\nAny changes beyond our control to the expected shipping costs resulting from postal rate increases will be fully announced in updates if such a situation arises.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly. \nBut what about international orders? If you\u2019re outside the US and want a copy, the standard cover will eventually be available through the Goodman Games and Game Kastle online store(s). If you are outside the US and want a foil cover, please send me a direct message and I will try to determine the most economical way to accommodate the request \u2013 most likely as a special order.\nPDF Fulfillment\nPDF copies will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG.com.

The entire Tactical Adventures crew thanks you, each and everyone of you who made this Kickstarter a success. If you want to follow the progress of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, don't hesitate to drop by our Website where we'll be posting Dev Blogs & Updates on a weekly basis - and to wishlist us on Steam to be notified when the game goes live!\nOn October 18th 2019, our Free Kickstarter Pre-Alpha Demo will leave our Steam Page as the entire team's focus shifts towards working on the final game. We hope you enjoyed exploring the Ruins of Telema in the company of Garrad, Rhuad, Vigdis & Violet! Keep an eye out, you may yet meet them in the release version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister...\nCreated and written by lifelong fans of Pen & Paper RPGs, Solasta: Crown of the Magister is a Turn-Based Tactical cRPG based on the SRD 5.1 Ruleset.\n An Epic Team Adventure - Create your very own party of adventurers in the classic tabletop RPG tradition with our Character Creation Tool. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. \n Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World - Delve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but be very aware of light and darkness. Many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters.\n Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions - The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\n True to Tabletop - Solasta: Crown of the Magister brings back the thrill, tactics, and deep storytelling of tabletop games, with the rules of SRD 5.1 on PC! As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. Roll for initiative!\n A Team of Passionate Veterans - Led by Mathieu Girard, co-founder of Amplitude Studios (Endless Space...), Tactical Adventures is a small studio of experienced developers with many projects under their belts. \nPlease note that the price in USD is an approximation based on the original price in Euros (since Tactical Adventures is based in France, we unfortunately do not have the option to run our Kickstarter Campaign in USD). Prices in USD may vary depending on the USD to EUR exchange rate.\nStretch Goals Updates: Recap\n Paladin: Vote Starts / Archetypes Revealed / Paladin wins the vote \n Lawkeeper Background: Reveal / Unlock \n Party Banter: Reveal / Unlock \n Cohh Carnage Guest Voice Actor: Reveal / Unlock \n Ranger: Reveal / Unlock \n Academic Background: Reveal / Unlock \n Half-Elf: Vote Starts / Half-Elf wins the vote \n Music Upgrade: Reveal / Unlock \n Boss Monster: Vote Starts / Remorhaz wins the vote \n Legendary Item Questline: Reveal / Unlock \n Sorcerer: Reveal / Unlock \nDiscuss with us on our Official Forums & Discord Server \nWishlist & Follow us on Steam \nFind us on Twitter, Facebook & Instagram \nWatch our Videos on Youtube & Twitch \nOur Referral Program is now over!

Watch our Lore Trailer here!\nAn epic single-player campaign that will take your party from level 1 to level 10. \nA fully-customizable party of 4 characters, each of them as important as the others.\nBuilding the game hand-in-hand with the community, with Communication and Transparency as core values. \n Current Platform: PC Windows, Mac\n Current Languages: English (Voiced), French & German (Interface & Subtitles)\nThere is no \"main character\" when playing on the Tabletop. In Solasta: Crown of the Magister, you will be playing a party of four heroes, as opposed to the usual \"one hero and three companions\". \nCreate your very own party of adventurers in the classic tabletop RPG tradition with our Character Creation Tool, selecting race, sub-race, class, background, proficiencies and ability scores. Each character will also have a different personality based on the choices you make during Character Creation, and this will affect their dialog options - fully voiced ones! Decide on your ideal party composition, and jump into the world of Solasta!\nSolasta: Crown of the Magister currently allows you to create characters from the four classic races: Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling. Each race (except Human) offers two sub-races. Of course, we decided to start with the four traditional classes of Tabletop adventurers: Fighter, Rogue, Cleric, and Wizard, each with three different archetypes. It goes without saying that we have plans for more, depending on the success of the Kickstarter Campaign!\nThe shattered world of Solasta is a High Fantasy setting with rich lore and many wonders. Multiple factions live in relative harmony amid the ruins of a fallen empire. Each has its own agenda and its own uses for adventurers. As you follow the twists and turns of the campaign, you will uncover the truth behind the ancient Cataclysm and fight to prevent it happening again. \nLore Updates:\nAn Introduction to the World of Solasta\nThe Halflings of Solasta\nThe Elves & Dwarves of Solasta\nThe Rangers & Paladins of Solasta\nThe Orcs & Humans of Solasta\nThe Half-Elves & Half-Orcs of Solasta\nThe Sorcerers of Solasta\nYou will explore long-forgotten ruins to unearth ancient artifacts, and face powerful foes in the process. And deep underground, our game's advanced lighting system will  shine - quite literally!\nIn Solasta: Crown of the Magister, lighting not only impacts the visuals, but also the gameplay. Torches and Spells will dispel the darkness, allowing you to look out for ambushes and hidden traps. Some monsters may even be hypersensitive to light, giving you the chance to run away or force them back. \nWithout light, however, you will face major disadvantages. Not only will it be hard to see, but you will also have disadvantages on many rolls. You would do well to be careful around enemies who can cast Darkness... \nAlso remember that you will be exploring and fighting in a dynamic environment. Bridges can collapse, columns can be toppled - make sure you use all your options to forge your path to victory! \nThe dungeons of Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Each level is made from 5' x 5' x 5' cubes, and designed to allow characters to move vertically as well as horizontally. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below.\nIn Solasta: Crown of the Magister, you will experience Combat and Exploration in three dimensions. Spells like Fly or Spiderclimb may save you a great deal of trouble when trying to navigate dungeons and caverns - and you may even find hidden treasures along the way. On the other hand... take care not to lose concentration - fall damage can be quite fatal!\nMake good use of verticality - for your enemies surely will. Giant Venomous Spiders crawling down the walls, Brimstone Vipers harassing you from up high, ferocious Orcs trying to shove you off a flimsy bridge... This is just a taste of what you will have to face!\nWe love Tabletop RPGs. And if you're here, chances are you do too! From Character Creation, to rolling the dice, to arguing with your peers that their idea is dumb and they should go with yours... This is what we want Solasta: Crown of the Magister to be - a PC representation of the Tabletop experience. Most of us have been playing and DM'ing for decades, and we pour that love and knowledge into the game.\nWe are committed in bringing the SRD 5.1 Ruleset to life on PC as faithfully as we can, with changes being limited to rules needing to be adapted for video games (exemple: Longbows would be able to hit targets from dozens of screens away). \nCharacter Creation Update\nYour journey through Solasta: Crown of the Magister will be accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack by Maxime Herv\u00e9, a talented  young composer who has worked on several high profile projects including Space Hulk: Tactics, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Resident Evil 7, and Love Death & Robots.\nThe G4F Prod crew is in charge of the sound design and its integration within the game. From Endless Space & Endless Legend to Furi, Styx, The Council, Blood Bowl, Call of Cthulhu & Space Hulk : Tactics, this award-winning team will deliver a stunning audio experience for Solasta!\nTactical Adventures is a self-published studio founded in 2018 by Mathieu Girard, who previously co-founded Amplitude Studios (Endless Space, Endless Legend...). We're located in Paris, not far from Notre-Dame (although now would not be the best time to visit). \nMathieu has been gathering passionate and experienced developers from all over, many with 10 or 20 years of game development under their belts, and most of them huge tabletop RPG fans. The team has been formed with a single aim: to create an immersive and tactical RPG with strong links to the authentic tabletop experience. \nWe plan to remain a small team of experts, working with trusted partners and making decisions in collaboration with the community. \n\nWe don't just want you to like Solasta - we want you to love it! Additional funds will allow us to add more content, such as more classes, more races and more quests. We want to make the best game we possibly can, and for that we need support from you - the player. \nWe want to hear your opinions and build Solasta with your help. What is it you would like to see? What are you excited about? What are your concerns? Kickstarter enables that direct discussion.\nWe also want to be transparent with you. Know that Solasta: Crown of the Magister will come out no matter what. We already have a sufficient budget from our own money, bank loans, public investments and government grants - so you can be confident that we're not going to bail on you. Kickstarter will allow us to expand the scope of the game, and we can assure you that we will release a complete & polished game. \nIn order to provide the best game experience we can, we will focus on releasing Solasta: Crown of the Magister on PC first, and then releasing a Mac Version. \nFor Consoles, we do not want to make promises that we might have to break due to complexity, time or budget constraints.\nIt is also too early for us to know where exactly we will be releasing our game on PC, but we can already tell you that we will be on Steam and that we'll be considering other distribution platforms. We will not be Exclusive on Epic Games Store. \nStarting November 2019 (the links won't work before that), you will be able to access our Pledge Manager - Crowdox.\nThrough CrowdOx, you will be able to:\nReview your Kickstarter Pledge & Rewards\nUpgrade your Pledge (for a limited duration after the campaign)\n Buy Physical Add-Ons (for a limited duration after the campaign)\nUpdate your Address\nPay the Shipping Fees\n Lost your Survey Link?

My first attempt at combining these two things was the creation of the podcast If You Give a Mouse a Dagger, an actual play podcast that uses the FATE Core system and is set in the Redwall universe. When deciding what system to use for this podcast, I could not find a system that worked exactly for what I wanted from the game. The closest we could find was FATE Core, but even this system doesn\u2019t have a rule system in place for food, bravery, honor, or many of the other aspects I loved about Redwall without creating extra rules.\nBecause of this dilemma, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a system that allows for all the things I found missing from FATE. This way, if anyone is like me and searching for a system to use for their Redwall or similar themed campaign, they can find it. Thus, Paws & Claws was born.\nWhat is Paws & Claws?\nPaws & Claws is a tabletop roleplaying game that uses the Status Die System and is set in the medieval fantasy world of Wudlind. \nThe world of Wudlind.\nWudlind is a land of rich forests, rushing rivers, majestic mountain ranges, relaxing beaches, and calm meadows. Each part of the map is filled with life and every area showcases a unique culture. When you adventure in Wudlind, will you be a member of a travelling band of entertainers loyal to the Fox Merchant Collective or a member of the Order of the Crescent who pledges to protect the small folk of Wudlind? Perhaps you will be an ambassador to the mole kingdom stationed in the Geode Keep deep underground while representing the squirrels of Hightop Castle in the thick foliage of the Great Oak Woods? Perhaps you won\u2019t be a part of any kingdom or organization already designed. Wudlind is an ever-evolving world with room for whatever you bring to the gaming table! \nThe world of Wudlind is inspired by novels like the Redwall series, Watership Down, and The Builders.\nWhat all does this game feature? Or what are you paying for?\n\u00b7 The all-new Status Die System\n\u00b7 8 unique vocations\n\u00b7 10 unique species\n\u00b7 Systems for crafting, cooking, honor, bravery, and more.\nRules and guidelines for GMing\n\u00b7 100+ enemies\n\u00b7 4 short ready to play adventures\nIn addition, stretch goals will allow for more vocations and species available for play.\nWhat is this Kickstarter for? Or where does my money go?\nThe funds from this Kickstarter will be split between three main areas: professional artwork, professional editing, and professional design. I am only interested in releasing a professional product, and in order to create one I need to hire others to do this work.\nCan I try this game out before I commit to this Kickstarter?\nYes, you can! You can find the Quickstart Guide on DriveThruRPG and download it for free! It is important to know that this while the core system of Paws & Claws will be mostly the same in the final product, the page design, quality of editing, and certain aspects of the gameplay will be drastically different. You may find the free version here:\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/278565/Paws--Claws-Quickstart-Guide?term=Paws", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy is the timeline a full year?\n\nThe timeline is projected to be an entire year before the finished product is released. It might seem long, but it is once again about creating a top quality product. I want to spend a significant amount of time play testing to balance and nuance every aspect of the game. Of course, during that time, a significant amount of artwork and design can be done. However, editing cannot happen until the rules, lore, and other text are done. It might be sooner, and I wish I could promise it would be. However, this is an indie game made by one guy who already works a full-time teaching job. It might take a while for the finished product to be released, but it is to ensure quality. If I try to rush it, the product will suffer in quality.

Scroll down to the section LEARN MORE ABOUT TORG to find out more and get started!\nLimited Offer: Aysle Champion\nWant to add your own hero to the ranks of the Army of Light? You get everything in the Aysle Treasure Coffer Pledge Level, plus we\u2019ll work with you to create an official Core Earth or Aysle Archetype! This includes one custom Perk, Spell, or Miracle, plus art for the character, and the character you help create becomes the \u201ciconic\u201d version of that Archetype.\nThese Archetypes become part of the game and are available as a bonus to all backers who receive the normal digital Archetypes. The archetype is the property of Ulisses and we reserve the right to refuse any names or other features of the character that we consider inappropriate (such as inflammatory or vividly \"against theme\").\nUltra Limited Offer: Aysle Royalty\nAdd your Archetype as a Champion above, plus you earn a seat for yourself or a designated proxy at our very special GenCon event on Friday night. Last year's event was an epic battle that determined the fate of the Mystery Men. What will this year's game hold? Note that this offer doesn't include travel, lodging, or tickets to GenCon. This is a different night and a different adventure than the session for Nile Empire Vigilantes!\nBest Value: The Aysle Treasure Coffer   \nFor the best Aysle experience and the most value for your pledge check out the Aysle Treasure Coffer. It is the most convenient way to get all of the core items in this Kickstarter, plus much more! Note that the base price has gone up a little, but that\u2019s because it features an entirely extra book even before Stretch Goals come into play: Greg Gorden\u2019s new Cosms Collide mega-adventure! The Treasure Coffer also starts with a sheet of Threat Blips, 5 new Threat Cards, the Aysle Possibility Tokens, and the CD soundtrack for The Revenge of the Carredon...and tons more goodies waiting to be unlocked! Any Add-On labeled as \"Treasure Coffer\" comes in the box.\nAysle is a realm of magic, fantasy, and an eternal struggle between Darkness and Light! It's ruled by High Lord Uthorion \u2014currently inhabiting the body of a Viking warlord\u2014and his Dread Covenent of nightmares, necromancers, and nefarious lords. Uthorion attacked from above and below, with maelstrom bridges crashing down in the sea to bring his Viking raiders, and a massive ritual connecting the underground passages of Aysle to subways, cellars, and caves on Earth. Any break in the ground may now be a portal to treasure and danger.\n\nWithin Uthorion\u2019s borders magic is powerful and miracles happen, but technology beyond a flintlock rifle sputter and malfunction. High tech doesn\u2019t belong here, and reality tries to right it and transform items into something accepted by the Ayslish. Storm Knights resist this effect, and may bring modern weapons (and more) to bear against the forces of Darkness.\nHigh Lord Uthorion didn't come to Earth alone. For the last century he had possessed Queen Pella Ardinay, the Lady of Light, and used her to corrupt her forces and undermine her allies: the elves and the last of the dwarves. She was recently slain and resurrected\u2014freeing her\u2014and now she leads the remnants of her armies to Earth in pursuit of her hated foe.\nThe Aysle source book is an expansion designed for both players and Game Masters. Inside you'll find:\nNew Perks, Spells, and Miracles for advancing characters. Includes options only available to Beta Clearance Storm Knights, as they learn more about their own abilities and the nature of reality.\n Magic Gear! A bevy of new items for adventurers, and random tables for discovering items in coffers or on foes!\nAn extensive status update for the default timeline. See the course of the first year of the Possibility Wars and the toll it's taken on Great Britain and Scandinavia. Includes a list of ongoing Delphi Council operations and who's who in the Aysle theater of the war.\nGet the statistics for the Dark Lord himself, as Uthorion takes matters into his own hands. Defeating him comes at a price, as Pella Ardinay found out the hard way!\nNew threats. Angered Elementals erupt throughout the realm as raw magic courses across new lands. Knights and wizards roam the roads\u2014many of them selfish and bent towards the ways of Darkness. The Dread Covenant has its own troops: monsters of legend, giants, undead, Vikings, and the foul spawn of Darkness controlled by Uthorion.\nQuest generation tables, new Eternity Shards, and more!\nRevenge of the Carredon is a massive adventure suitable for several months of gaming. Start off in middle of the war, fighting in the trenches of Oxford. Tolwyn Tancred, the legendary hero who slew Uthorion\u2019s strange dragon\u2014the dreaded Carredon\u2014and returned to save Pella Ardinay is cursed, and heralds the return of the mighty beast she seemed to slay. Embark on a quest to unlock the mystery of the Carredon\u2019s origins and break the curse before Tolwyn is lost forever and Uthorion regains one of his most powerful weapons.\nWhen Cosms Collide! Original Torg co-creator Greg Gorden returns with a new mega-adventure! The Cyberpapacy, technodemons, Mobius' shocktroopers, and others all seem to have business in the realm of Aysle\u2014and the Storm Knights are caught in the middle. Join the action and uncover the mystery of what has so many High Lords moving through Uthorion's kingdom, and if anyone can beat the Dark One on his home ground !\nThe Aysle GM Screen has three panels. On the inside, all the most needed charts from Torg Eternity in addition to the new charts specific to adventures in Aysle. The outside features a single, gorgeous seamless image and the axioms and World Laws players need to remember. \nAysle Archetypes come within the GM Screen, and offer new stock heroes to draw from to fill the ranks of your Storm Knights. Meet the Champion of Light, a Core Earther transformed by the magic of Aysle into an armored paladin, the Necromancer, a hero touched by Darkness but who deploys her deadly spells against a common foe, and the Cleric of Dunad, an elf from Aysle who channels the holy power of the gods\u2026and many more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd like extra copies of an item or would like to add a product from another pledge tier to your order, you may use the list below.

It features a multi-chapter campaign story that progresses through a series of over two dozen illustrated dungeon maps, where each area is a hand-crafted puzzle. Fight monsters, acquire keys to open doors, get life-boosting elixirs, powerful equipment and enchanted items, and defeat the boss at the end of each level. Use your wits to find the right path through each area and survive. Solve each puzzle to move forward with the story.\nTwisty Little Passages is a game of full-color, fully-illustrated thematic puzzles.

Play it easily wherever you go!\nIf you like puzzles, mazes and dungeon crawl adventures, you'll find this a uniquely engaging experience!\nTwisty Little Passages Book\nSpecial challenge areas will contain an extended layout, with multiple story pages tied to epic two-page map spreads.\nTo play, you draw right on the laminated dungeon maps with a fine-tipped dry-erase pen to track your progress as you explore, find treasure, track stats and inventory, defeat enemies and uncover the secrets of solving each area. Survive each puzzle without getting stuck or running out of health. It may require multiple attempts to find the solution to a puzzle, and it's easy to restart your progress by wiping the page to start again.\nBONUS MATERIAL: We're including a section in the back of the book with spoiler-resistant progressive hints for all the puzzles to keep difficulty balanced for all players, plus another section with full solutions.\nPodcasts\nListen to a six-minute segment reviewing Twisty Little Passages in the On Board Games podcast with Isaac Shalev (starts at 5:05).\nTutorial Puzzle 1-1: Kradra Prison\nRules of play\nLearn the basic rules of how to play through the puzzles here:\nPrototype rules for download (PDF)\n\nPrint-and-play versions of demo Puzzles 1-1 through 1-5\nAfter reading the rules above, try to solve these introductory puzzles from the book in order:\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-1: Kradra Prison -- keys and locks tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-2: Underground Caverns -- combat tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-3: Abandoned Hub -- armor tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-4: Roach Nest -- multiple equipment pieces tutorial\n\n Demo Puzzle 1-5: Kradra Prison Escape -- multiple enemies tutorial \n\nThere are 27 standalone puzzle areas (including unlocked stretch goals) total in the book, plus world map and secret meta-puzzle stretch goals.

Get ready to put on your thinking caps!\nWe designed each puzzle to be played in about a single sitting.  Expect to play each puzzle beyond the tutorial for around 15-90 minutes, some shorter and some longer, with some especially challenging areas that can take longer.  You can pause and continue play at any time, simply closing the book to save your place in the current area.\nTotal play time to solve all puzzles is estimated at 15-30 hours.\nWritten reviews \nRead Father Geek's review of Twisty Little Passages.\nThe final production version of Twisty Little Passages will feature multiple upgrades over the prototype preview copies you see here and in videos, including:\nMetal wire-binding, not plastic spiral bound\nOffset printing (no white border along the edge of the page)\nPlus all unlocked bonus and stretch goals listed above, including heavy-duty 10 pt card stock glossy laminated pages!\n(Early puzzle spoilers)\nHere are playthroughs of the simple tutorial puzzles in the introductory chapter of the book.

Questions directed to us on specific shipping situations are welcome.\nOur goal is maximize the value we provide you while keeping production and shipping overhead as low as possible.

It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up in Unity. Read on to find out what this all means and why we are excited for this project.\nFantasy Grounds is a popular system for playing a host of different roleplaying games online.  It is used by more than 130,000 gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and more.  This type of program is commonly referred to as a virtual tabletop, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various part of an RPG session in a digital form.\nWhat makes Fantasy Grounds different than competitors is how we expose character sheets and automate large portions of gameplay specifically for each system we support.  This is done through rulesets.  Your experience playing Deadlands Reloaded will differ from D&D and will be unique to that environment, contain custom graphics, character sheets, and automation specific to that game system.  \nOne feature shared across most game systems is maps.  Some may use hexes while others use square grids and some may not use grids at all.  Facing is important in some and less so in others.  While FG has featured maps for many years, they have been primarily focused as reproductions of maps in existing adventure modules from our many licensed publishers. We believe that we can enhance these to provide dynamic line of sight, fog of war, and even map building support with painting and tiles.\nWhat you get for backing this project will be a license for Fantasy Grounds Unity (or FGU). This new game engine has all the great features of current version of Fantasy Grounds (soon to be called Fantasy Grounds Classic) along with new enhanced features. \nOriginal Features Supported:\nMultiplayer support for playing tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons (2E, 3.5E, 4E and 5E), Pathfinder RPG 1, Pathfinder RPG 2, Starfinder.\nBuilt-in content for D&D 3.5E, 5E and Pathfinder 1\nOfficially licensed add-on content available for D&D, D&D Classics (2E), Pathfinder, Starfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, Castles & Crusades, Mutants & Masterminds, 13th Age, W.O.I.N., Traveller, and Rolemaster Classic\nGeneric system support through our CoreRPG ruleset\nBrilliant Campaign Management\nIntegrated character sheets with lots of automation built in for playing and leveling (depending on ruleset and content owned)\nCombat Tracking\n3D dice\nFantasy Grounds Unity Enhanced Features Include:\n64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)\nNative support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC\nNetwork lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)\nTile based map building\nEnhanced Drawing Tools\nAdditional Dice Macros support\nA new FGU only skin\nDynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers\nPaint with images, such as walls\nAnimated image effects\nBackward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC\nIn addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward. We have lots of ideas for new features and this rebuilt engine will make it easier for us reach those goals and deliver consistent updates for free. \nTile based Map Building\nDynamic Line of Sight (LOS) and Fog of War (FOW)\nLine of Sight - Doors and Terrain\nMap Fx Layers\n New Grid Options\nAdvanced Dice Expression Support\nWe have already devoted over 4 years and 10,000 developer hours to this project. Any funds raised will help us push it over the edge and begin work on new features and functionality. If the project does exceptionally well, this may even allow us to add even more resources to the team.\nWe have over 1200 existing DLC and add-ons. Our goal is to prioritize these by popularity and work on enhancing as many of these as we can. Without enhancements, they will continue to function as they always have in Fantasy Grounds Classic. You will be able to add dynamic line of sight to maps and begin using the new features straight away. As we work through this large back catalog of DLC, we will do all the enhancement and upgrade work for you so you can just load it up and begin using the advanced features without having to define any Line of Sight blockers yourself. \nLink: www.fantasygrounds.com\nGreat! We anticipate that a large number of our backers will already be fans and users of our software. For you, we have added discounted Upgrade tiers available to get you up and running on the new engine as soon as possible. A lot of the time spent building the new engine was devoted towards making sure that everything you've already bought or created will continue to work in FGU. The only difference is that now you will be able to further enhance them.\nOver time, we will begin going through older products and enhancing them for you. Just look for the Update Available button to light up and stay tuned to our newsletter for regular updates on which products have been newly Enhanced. \nWhich Upgrade option do I choose?\nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license in 2018 or 2019, then pick the Rookie Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate. \nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license before 2018, then choose the Veteran Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate.\nIf you are on a subscription, then you will be able to subscribe to the new version once it is released on the store. If you want Beta or Alpha access, then you would need to get a Newcomer tier option on the Kickstarter. \nHow do I upgrade multiple license keys?\nIf your account has multiple license keys, it is possible that some of them are newer and some are older. Pick the tier that best fits your main license key that you personally use and then increase your pledge level for each additional license you have based on the age of that license.  Our survey system and fulfillment will allow some corrections there later on and we can always help on a case-by-case basis through our support email at the time of fulfillment.\nDo I need to pay a subscription going forward?\nOur newcomer tiers are 1-time purchase licenses for Fantasy Grounds Unity. No further subscription is required. If you had a subscription to Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may want to maintain that as long as you want to continue using that version. \nYes, Fantasy Grounds Classic will remain a viable product for many years to come. While the data is backward compatible, we chose to separate the data paths for FGU and FG Classic so that changes to one won't be reflected in the other. You can copy campaigns over to FGU to try things out there and maintain your original copy back on Fantasy Grounds Classic. \nOver time, we expect most users will migrate fully to FGU.\nDo I get access to Fantasy Grounds Classic if I buy Fantasy Grounds Unity?\nNo. If you already have a license or subscription, then you can continue to use that. The licenses will be different even though they share the same add-ons. \nStandard licenses can host or play in a game with other licensed users. An Ultimate license allows the GM to host a game for any number of players and those players can use a free Demo license of Fantasy Grounds. Initial copies will go out to backers only, but we will try to  send out the demo license links to backers at some point prior to launch so those can be shared with players for your game.\nWe have over 1200 DLC items available -- an entire gaming bookstore worth of games. It's too much to feature in the Kickstarter, but we have a select list of bundles below that you can choose from when we send out the backer surveys. Just increase your pledge amount for the add-ons you want from the list below. \nAlso -- Anything you already own on your account at fantasygrounds.com will continue to work with FGU, so you won't have to re-buy any of those. In fact, you can go shopping at fantasygrounds.com if you see anything on sale there during or after the Kickstarter and those items will unlock automatically for your account once you gain access to FGU during the Alpha or Beta.\nWhat if I bought my add-ons from Steam?\nYou will be able to use those in both versions: Fantasy Grounds Classic and Fantasy Grounds Unity. Our system will know what purchases you have made from either location. \n*Note: We have some unknowns about how the Steam Store will reflect purchases across the two versions of Fantasy Grounds. If you bought bundle items on Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may need to buy new additions to the bundle there instead of on the new FGU store page on Steam.  \n\nNew portraits commissioned from the Ultimate Gamemaster level by amazing avatar artist, Mates Laurentiu! \nArtist Bio: Born in Dracula's lands, Mates Laurentiu is a Romanian freelance artist with a love for fantasy, horror and science fiction.

We make notes on things that we know we need to check into for Mac and Linux support but we have not yet attempted builds on those platforms. It is possible and expected that there will be a delay between releasing versions for Windows PC and Mac and Linux. In the worst case scenario, Windows PC users may complete the entire Alpha and Beta process before the Alpha and Beta process begins for other platforms. \n\nWe will lock down the FGU Alpha Launch Party by the start of June. If there are significant delays in getting you access to the Alpha, we will still have some hands-on stuff for you at the event but we may delay access to the Alpha keys until a later date.

Instead, we gave general responses that we would be looking into that and other features once we completed the initial port to Unity.\nI am now happy to announce that we have released this feature into our TEST channel for people to play around with and experiment.

The GM can then approve or reject movement on a per token basis. Once enabled on a map, any attempted move by players will need to be confirmed by the GM.

OVER 100% FUNDED!\nYou guys rock so much. I don't even have the words to articulate how awesome you guys are. Now that we're funded, we can move on to some AWESOME stretch goals!\n At $20,000, we'll add maps for EVERY CITY that's unlocked during the campaign. These maps will include not only a bird's-eye-view of the city, and not only details about specific locations like landmarks or specialized shops and locations, but ALSO playable maps for those specific locations! That means, if your players decide to up and start a bar fight in their local Owlbear Wild Wings, you, as the Dungeon Master, won't have to go searching for a generic bar map and give them some imaginary fluff about the magic screens displaying the latest and greatest Sportsball game - you can just pull out the Owlbear Wild Wings Battlemap and let them have at it!\nLet's work together to unlock this stretch goal and tons more, like these:\n What exactly is Monsters of Murka?  \nMonsters of Murka is a hilarious new campaign setting for fifth edition DND full of comical monsters, detailed maps, parodical mayhem, and political satire! This campaign setting includes adventures for first to tenth level characters.\nQuotes from Monsters of Murka playtesters\nThe World of Murka\nMurka was once a land of great promise. People flocked to it from across the known worlds. It was a place of myriad creatures, creeds, and most importantly, connections, each seeking its place among beautiful landscapes and bountiful resources. After centuries of development, prosperous cities dot the countryside. Their populations hail from distant lands, yet they thrive, together, with the common goal of progress, and of prosperity. \nThe populace share a common goal of achieving that which all sought; The Murkan Dream.\nThe Murkan Dream\nThe Murkan Dream is an artifact of an unknown origin. In fact, so little is known about the Murkan Dream that some doubt its existence entirely. Others view it as an ultimate goal, an achievable reality towards which they push, day in and day out. Whispered words litter the streets, telling tales of those who have supposedly obtained or achieved the Murkan Dream. Many of these have proven to be categorically false: people who claimed to have achieved the Murkan Dream only to later reveal that they had begun their journey with such a wealth of resources and advantages, that the Murkan Dream was never something they really even wanted or needed.\nThese false mythologues serve only to further drive the Murkan people towards their goals, both individually and collectively. Recently, however, an evil being has come into power over Murka, and now his minions roam the lands, terrorizing those whose pursuit of the Murkan Dream may threaten his power...\nSeveral years ago, The Don asserted himself as the leader of the free world of Murka. He painted outsiders as a threat to the Murkan Dream, insisting that their presence alone would somehow be enough to destroy it permanently. He claimed that he had achieved the Murkan Dream, that he had seen the light, and that he wanted his people to do the same. \nHe gained influence over the population, and so gained control over the lands with false promises to its inhabitants\u2014promises he never had any intention of keeping.  \nNow, he remains safely within the well-guarded walls of The Pale Fortress, from which he issues commands to impose his will on those who support him to control those who do not.\nHowever, rumors have spread of a resistance group growing within Murka: a people who want to stand against The Don's dark influence, who want to usher in an era of progress and providence, and return the Murkan Dream to the Murkan People.\nThere are a whole host of creatures and cretins roaming the lands of Murka. Many of them are intelligent, having their own societies and roles within the Murkan government. Others are wild and feral, seeking only to make a life in the wild and attacking anything they perceive as a threat. Here are some examples of some Monsters of Murka that you might encounter in your travels.\nWhether it be the fearsome tromp, the bumbling trumplins, or any of the other various villains, you'll be sure to meet your match and more in combat encounters! These and many other creatures of varying shapes, sizes, and abilities await you in the wilderness of Murka. \nSo, will you journey forth into this setting, encountering creatures and solving mysteries, in order to bring an end to The Don's evil rein of terror over the Murkan People?\nGuest Art\nOne of the most fun parts of this book was working with some of my favorite artists who contributed guest art for the book.

It can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG.   As a player, you\u2019ll find a wealth of material that allows you to assume the role of one of 11 unique classes, with descriptive names like: the Calavera, the Bedlamite, and the Sin-Eater.   As a Judge, you\u2019ll find over 400 pages of material giving you a wealth of resources for designing and running fantastic adventures set against the haunted landscapes of an unforgiving weird West. \nYou may be wondering about the above mentioned game that Dark Trails is tethered to. Dungeon Crawl Classics is a Fantasy RPG written by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games. Since debuting in 2012, the book has gone through seven (7) printings and spawned a wonderful community of passionate gamers both new and old. DCC continues to grow by leaps and bounds by way of exciting adventures penned by some of the best writers in the industry, including third-party publishers using the system to fuel their own creative fires.\nFortunately, the Dark Master (Joseph Goodman) has granted permission to include a modified version of the DCC ruleset within the pages of Dark Trails to make it the first 3rd party published work to include the necessary rules for play. You don\u2019t need anything other than the Dark Trails RPG to play the game aside from some dice, paper, and pencils. \nSome of the DCC rules were purposefully left out when weighed against their place in a weird West setting, but these omitted rules can easily be added to Dark Trails should you own a copy of DCC and wish to include them.\n This Kickstarter funds the standalone hardcover book for the game. Funds raised will be used to pay for additional art, editing, and layout for a quality book made by traditional offset methods to ensure it is as durable as it is beautiful. \n Dark Trails is the product of three years of writing and playtesting by author David Baity. You may remember David from his first DCC adventure \u201cCarnival of the Damned\u201d published by  Purple Sorcerer Games. While David has handled the majority of the writing chores with the Dark Trails RPG, lots of folks have thrown their name into the hat to help flesh out the magic and bestiary sections. Daniel J. Bishop, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman, Diogo Nogueira, and Jeff Scifert are just a few of the talented minds that have worked their magic to make Dark Trails something truly special.\nFor one of the two editions of the game we've commissioned none other than the legendary SanJulian to grace us with a beautifully painted cover filled to the brim with \"weird.\" You can see a few more of SanJulian's DCC covers below, and be sure to check out his website  for several works you've probably seen grace the covers of your favorite novels and other publications over the years.\nWho else is on board to help to bring the world of Dark Trails to life? Over the last two years, the author has recruited some of the best up-and-coming artists in the industry. The Dark Trails RPG currently features work by Angga Augustiya, Todd McGowan, Christopher Torres, Simon Todd, Danny Prescott, Adam Slivka, David Hoskins, Aaron Robinson, MARCINs, David Coppoletti, and Diogo Nogueira.\nAdditional funds raised by the Kickstarter will help continue to fund new art from the above-mentioned artists, in addition to work by Stefan Poag, Peter Mullen, and Bradley K. McDevitt, just to name a few!\n Dark Trails will be printed in two editions (standard and limited edition), both are hardcover books  8.5\u201d x 11\u201d trim size. The books will be printed in the USA by offset printing methods to ensure the quality of the book meets consumer expectations.  Currently, we plan to keep the interior printed in B&W on 60# paper and stitched binding. \n The standard edition will feature a full-color cover painted by iconic artist, Sanjulian (Creepy magazine, Vampirella, etc.) while the limited edition will feature a leatherette cover, accented with metallic foil stamping and an embossed version of the Dark Trails RPG logo. The ultimate goal with the limited edition is to create something that looks like it was pulled right out of the Old West! \nBelow, you can see mock ups of each book to give you an idea of what we're visualizing. The painting used to represent the standard edition is not the final Sanjulian cover, and both covers are subject to change. \nA mock-up of the standard edition. This is not the actual cover and all elements are subject to change\nA mock-up of the limited edition leatherette edition. All elements are subject to change.\n\n\n The weird West genre is certainly well represented in the RPG industry, but those wishing to find a fully developed weird West RPG that utilizes a class-based system based upon the DCC RPG will be sadly disappointed. Dark Trails fills a niche for a DCC based weird West RPG by providing 11 original character classes paired with innovative rules designed to leave your players feeling like they\u2019ve just spent several hours adventuring in a Western landscape where the emphasis is placed upon the weird!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find several classes to choose from within the pages of the book, so let\u2019s give you a basic rundown of what you\u2019ll find. \nBedlamite: Absent-minded inventors constantly constructing inventions that defy all logic, including \u201cwondrous\u201d contraptions that are brought to life by their creator\u2019s sheer force of will. Bedlamites often become addle-brained and introverted, preferring the company of their automatons to that of their allies.\nCalavera: Spirit-mediums, most often female, that can both see and speak to the nearby dead wandering the closest regions of the Spirit Lands. The calavera shines like a beacon in the night to the restless dead, eager to have her deliver a message, or perform one last task that will put the spirit to rest. Aiding in those tasks marks her as a veritable queen of the underworld and the dead are not only willing to share some of their dark secrets but also have been known to reach across the grave to protect their only connection to the land of the living.\nGambler: With the big changes running through the weird West, the gambler could be called the chosen paladin of Lady Luck, able to manipulate the ebb and flow of chance like an occultist weaves arcane energy. Gamblers alter the probability of events going on in their surroundings and have a skill set that favors thievery and subterfuge.\nGunslinger: Sometimes, a poor soul is cut down before their time, and when that person is a law-dog or hardened soldier even death isn\u2019t enough to discourage them from staying in the fight. These restless spirits possess the guns they died with and send out a call to those deemed worthy of carrying them. Gunslingers find their uncanny skill at gunplay supernaturally elevated by the spirits of vengeance that choose them.\nLuchador: A luchador is most often a person noble of heart seeking the thrill of martial combat in and out of the sacred ring. In addition to high-flying acrobatics coupled with raw strength and fortitude, luchadores gain the ability to tap into their inner spirit, channeling it through their masks for supernatural effects.\nMountebank: The typical \u201csnake oil salesman\u201d of the frontier, these amateur alchemists and full-time showmen find that the events of the Seven Days of Night have unlocked a doorway to the mind that reveals recipes that defy all logic and, once brewed, resemble the magic potions of legend.\nMystic Monk: Trained in the sacred art of martial arts and schooled by master philosophers, the mystic monk is a humble warrior wandering the weird West in search of enlightenment. In addition to being a master of martial arts, the mystic monk can summon his inner chi, a virtual battery of spiritual energy used to perform superhuman feats.\nOccultist: Occultists devote their lives to the mastery of the ambient arcane energies constantly flowing around all living things, learning to weave and channel them to miraculous effect through spell work. Occultists are considered master investigators and have a nose for all things arcane and unusual.\nRevelator: The revelator serves as a bastion of faith to those seeking refuge from the madness infecting the world. They can perform divine healing and miracles in addition to serving as a bane to evil creatures\u2014both living and dead\u2014all while serving as a pillar of faith to those that still believe in the comforting words of The Good Book.\nSin-Eater: During the Seven Days of Night, no souls were granted passage to the Underworld and instead were cursed to wander the Spirit World where they were preyed upon by creatures native to the realm, or worse, taken as slaves by their own kind. Charon, lord of the ferrymen, knows an abundance of restless spirits could potentially unravel the barrier between worlds. Some ferrymen are hand selected by their lord to return to the surface world in order to shepherd lost souls to the afterlife and destroy those that prey upon them by using River Rites and the soul-aegis, a weapon that strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked.\nTommyknocker: Sometimes, a soul is just too pissed off to pass on and needs to get a slice of vengeance before taking that ride into the sunset. Tommyknockers are walking corpses for almost all intents and purposes, but the strength of their soul is such that it acts as a furnace, providing a means to animate its corpse-shell to take care of unfinished business. In addition to an unnatural strength, the tommyknocker is one of the toughest hombres found in the weird West.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the DCC magic system, you\u2019ll be familiar with how things are done. If you\u2019re new to DCC styled magic you\u2019re in for a real treat! Spells can be cast multiple times if you continually roll high enough. Roll low and you might lose the spell for a day, or worse, suffer from the effects of corruption! On top of being able to cast known spells multiple times, the total of your roll means potentially casting that low-level magic missile spell with effects so strong that you just might wipe the playing field with your trusty \u201cfinger guns.\u201d In addition to a full complement of spells and miracles found within the pages of Dark Trails, you can import any of the 120+ existing spells found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG into your game, should you own the book.\nYou\u2019ll find over 150 spells, wondrous contraptions, elixirs, and miracles within the pages of Dark Trails, but we didn\u2019t stop there. In addition to the above, you\u2019ll find a reliquary of beneficial and cursed magic items, along with rules and tables for crafting magical firearms. \nThe author of the Dark Trails RPG really wants to present you with a game that has some innovative rules that help capture the feel of a Western-themed game. You\u2019ll find several interesting mechanics scattered throughout the book (some that you may even wish to port to your DCC game), but the main rules that make the Dark Trails RPG a horse you\u2019d want to throw a saddle on include:\nNew rules for firearms that incorporate a standard poker deck, including specialized critical hit and fumble tables.\nBoons & Hexes represent a run of good/bad luck your character might be having during a typical session. They\u2019re awarded based on things like exceptionally good/bad die rolls, true heroics, and great role playing.  Boons earned can be spent for in-game perks, while Hexes increase your chances of receiving more disastrous results on fumble and fear charts. In addition, they affect how NPC interactions pan out\u2014consider the unlucky cowboy to have a dark cloud following him around.\nA new system that replaces the \u201cstandard\u201d alignment mechanics found in most RPGs. The new system helps tell the story of how decisions determine the path a character may walk and how that path affects their reputation when dealing with NPCs.\nAn innovative system for fear and madness that simulates a character\u2019s ability to handle both physical and emotional stress during the adventure, including an extensive list of mental disorders for those who slip too deeply down the rabbit hole!\n\n Lot's of folks are hard at work putting their twist on the weird West genre. For starters, you can check out Thick Skull Adventures \"The Last WIll and Testament of Obediah Felkner.\" Author Stephen Newton is close to launching his exciting take on a weird West adventure that blends perfectly with the Dark Trails RPG. You can find more info at Thick Skull Adventures \nYou can also take comfort in knowing some talented up-and-coming writers in the gaming community have become so inspired by past playtests that they\u2019ve taken the initiative to start writing Dark Trails adventures. \nThere\u2019s no bigger compliment for an author than to learn folks think enough of their game to create material before the book is even released! The author has big plans to produce both free and paid content once the book is released into the wild. This includes supporting those who wish to produce their own Dark Trails material!\nYou\u2019re going to love the bestiary in this book! Over seventy-five creatures have been pulled from the works of Lovecraft and the pages of folklore from all around the world! Several notable folks have thrown their passion into helping make the bestiary something special, including but not limited to: Daniel J. Bishop, Jon Hook, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman and more! \nYou\u2019ll also find that several included creatures contain charts with all sorts of tweaks and nasty surprises to make each encounter terrifying and unique!\n\nSometimes, a Judge has a hard enough time wrangling up a posse, let alone coming up with a trail-ready adventure to keep'em busy! Don't you worry, partner, we got you covered!

Arbeitet zusammen, um euch euer eigenes Comic-Universum zu erschaffen und die Geschichten der verschiedenen Helden darin auszuspielen.\nIcons ist dein Alles-in-einem-Paket f\u00fcr Rollenspielabenteuer mit Superhelden: schnell, leicht, beschreibend und lustig! \n___________________________________________________________________\nUrsprung des Crowdfunding:\nIcons wurde vor einigen Jahren als Nebenprojekt von Steve Kenson entwickelt, in welchem er mit der Stufenskala und den Mechaniken von Fudge experimentierte und mit \u00c4hnlichkeiten zu der Skala und den mit Eigenschaftsw\u00f6rtern (toll, unglaublich, atemberaubend) benannten F\u00e4higkeitsstufen im alten Marvel Super Heroes Rollenspiel, wenngleich mit ein paar \u00dcberlegungen zu Superhelden, die mit Zufallsw\u00fcrfen ausgew\u00fcrfelt werden, als Sprungbrett f\u00fcr die Fantasie der Spieler. Sp\u00e4tere Entwicklungsschritte arbeiteten dann Ideen aus FATE (einer bekannteren Weiterentwicklung der Fudge-Regeln) mit ein, sowie Kensons Erfahrungen mit dem Regeldesign f\u00fcr das auf d20-Regeln aufgebaute Mutants and Masterminds.\nIcons wurde zuerst von Adamant Entertainment verlegt. Sp\u00e4ter trennte Steve Kenson sich von Adamant, finanzierte \u00fcber Kickstarter das Quellenbuch Great Power, \u00fcber das er schon l\u00e4ngere Zeit nachgedacht hatte, und ver\u00f6ffentlichte sp\u00e4ter die Assembled Edition des Spiels unter seinem eigenen Label namens Ad Infinitum Adventures, gedruckt und vertrieben durch seine Freunde bei Green Ronin Publishing. Seither sind bei Ad Infinitum Adventures ein paar weitere Quellenb\u00fccher (Icons A to Z und Icons Adversaries) und eine Reihe von Abenteuern erschienen, einschlie\u00dflich eines Abenteuers, das die gesamte lange Kampagne Rise of the Phalanx des K\u00fcnstlers und Autors Dan Houser in einem \u201eextradicken Icons-Band\u201c zusammenfasst.\nAnfang des Jahres 2018 hatte der Verlag Beyond Affinity \u2013 Phantastische Literatur Icons als sein erstes Rollenspielprojekt ausgew\u00e4hlt und die Lizenz f\u00fcr die deutsche Ausgabe erworben. (Alles, was direkt von Kensons Ad Infinitum Adventures f\u00fcr die Marke Icons ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, ist auch von der Lizenz abgedeckt. Das hei\u00dft, es k\u00f6nnen auch die Supplements und die Kurzabenteuer in deutscher \u00dcbersetzung kommen und f\u00fcr jahrelangen superstarken Nachschub ist im Prinzip gesorgt.) Fast zeitgleich hatte auch der langj\u00e4hrige Comic-Fan und Rollenspieler Norbert Franz, nach vielen interessierten R\u00fcckfragen zu Icons bei Spiele-Conventions in S\u00fcddeutschland, mit einer \u00dcbersetzung begonnen, die zuerst nur f\u00fcr ein paar Fans und die eigene Spielergruppe vorgesehen war, ohne kommerzielle Hintergedanken. Norbert Franz und Andr\u00e9 Boyens von Beyond Affinity erfuhren quasi nur zuf\u00e4llig auf Facebook voneinander und einigten sich im Prinzip gleich darauf, dass Franz die schon begonnene deutsche \u00dcbersetzung f\u00fcr Beyond Affinity weiterschreiben w\u00fcrde. Nach viel sprachlicher Detailarbeit, aufgeopferter Freizeit, Kontrollen, R\u00fcckfragen bei Steve Kenson und intensiver Feinabstimmung insbesondere zu der Regelsprache von Icons und dessen zahlreichen Comic-Besonderheiten lag dann am Abend des 30. April 2019 erstmals eine Version des kompletten Icons-Regeltextes vor. Beyond Affinity hatte f\u00fcr das Comic-Nischenspiel von Anfang an einen eigenen deutschen Kickstarter geplant, um eine erste Buchauflage auf den Weg zu bringen. Dieser Kickstarter sollte im vern\u00fcnftigen, vorsichtig kalkulierten Rahmen bleiben und sich dabei nur auf das Regelbuch Assembled Edition als PDF und Hardcover-Band konzentrieren. Um Punkt Mitternacht am 15. Mai 2019 ging dieses Crowdfunding online.\n___________________________________________________________________\nEin paar Informationen zu Icons f\u00fcr Neueinsteiger:\nIcons verwendet ein komplett eigenes System, einen entfernten Verwandten von Fudge und FATE, das inzwischen als das Icons-System fest etabliert ist. Kein anderes Regelbuch ist zum Einstieg oder zum vollst\u00e4ndigen Verst\u00e4ndnis n\u00f6tig. Alles beginnt genau hier mit der Assembled Edition. Im englischsprachigen Raum kann man Icons sogar mit der OGL als Regelsystem f\u00fcr Third-Party-Produkte, oft kurze kleine PDFs, unter Lizenz verwenden (diese tragen dann das Logo \u201eICONS Compatible\u201c).\n\nW\u00fcrfelmodus und Grundstruktur\nDas System verwendet nur die handels\u00fcblichen \u201enormalen\u201c sechsseitigen W\u00fcrfel (W6), mit den Zahlen von 1 bis 6, keine W\u00fcrfel mit Minus- und Plus-Zeichen oder Sondersymbolen usw.\nDas Icons-System kennt 6 fest vorgegebene Attribute (auf Deutsch: Kampftalent, Koordination, St\u00e4rke, Verstand, Achtsamkeit und Willensst\u00e4rke) und man hat mindestens ein Spezialgebiet (ein Paket von Fertigkeiten und Kenntnissen in Kurzform ausgedr\u00fcckt) und dann die Powers, also Kr\u00e4fte. Die Powers sind nicht \u201efrei erfunden\u201c oder allein vom Spieler benannt (wie oft die FATE-Aspekte), sondern einem Kr\u00e4fte-Kapitel entnommen. Man kann sie sich aussuchen, mit Punkten kaufen oder aber kurzerhand per Zufallstabellen \u201eausw\u00fcrfeln\u201c (was auch die zuerst vorgeschlagene Methode der Charaktererschaffung im Buch ist \u2013 so wei\u00df kein Spieler zu Beginn, welche Superkr\u00e4fte oder F\u00e4higkeiten er bekommt).\nSowohl die 6 Attribute als auch die Kr\u00e4fte funktionieren in den Regeln numerisch auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10, wobei alle Stufen ab 7 als \"super\" gelten und man mit einem blo\u00dfen Attribut ab 7 auch Stunts erzeugen kann. Mit St\u00e4rke also improvisierte St\u00e4rke-Stunts, mit Verstand eben Verstandes-Stunts, mit Achtsamkeit Achtsamkeits-Stunts und alles so weiter, ganz regelm\u00e4\u00dfig.\nSpezialgebiete gehen von 1 bis 3 und werden einem Attribut hinzugez\u00e4hlt, wenn sie gerade in einer bestimmten Situation zu einer Aufgabe passen. Das muss dann nicht immer dasselbe Attribut sein. Aber zum Beispiel: Verstand 5 und Detektiv 2 ergibt effektiv eine Stufe von 7.\nPowers k\u00f6nnen beispielsweise auch in Gegenst\u00e4nden, Werkzeugen und Waffen schlummern. Magische Artefakte und Green Lanterns Ring und Doctor Stranges Mantel sowie der ber\u00fchmte Batman-Werkzeugg\u00fcrtel sind hier also schon mit ber\u00fccksichtigt.\nBei jeder spielrelevanten Aktion w\u00fcrfelt die aktive / angreifende Seite i.d.R. Attribut + 1W6 gegen eine vom SL vorgegebene Schwierigkeitsstufe + 1W6 oder gegen die passive / verteidigende Seite, die ebenfalls Attribut + 1W6 verwendet. Nur auf die Differenz zwischen den beiden Seiten kommt es an. Die h\u00f6here Seite \u201egewinnt\u201c die Aktion oder erzielt zumindest einen Vorteil. Es gibt i.d.R. keine Re-Rolls (wiederholten W\u00fcrfelw\u00fcrfe) und ebenfalls keine explodierenden W\u00fcrfel. Daf\u00fcr gibt es strenggenommen auch keine Kritischen Erfolge oder Patzer. Die Differenz zwischen den beiden Seiten reicht schon aus, um zu bestimmen, wie toll oder wie schlimm etwas wird. Damit gen\u00fcgt im Extremfall sogar schon ein einziger herk\u00f6mmlicher W\u00fcrfel zum Spielen, neben dem Buch, den Charakterbl\u00e4ttern und Stiften zum Notizenmachen.\nMit speziellen Heldenpunkten, die Entschlossenheitspunkte hei\u00dfen (im Original Determination Points), kann man weitere Tricks und Spieleffekte erzeugen: das hei\u00dft, zus\u00e4tzliche Geistesblitze oder Eingebungen haben, eine F\u00e4higkeit f\u00fcr kurze Zeit verst\u00e4rken, einen spektakul\u00e4ren Stunt erzeugen, sich blitzschnell erholen oder wieder aufraffen, eine Situation durch eine \u201eRetcon\u201c anders erkl\u00e4ren und so weiter.\nDie Elemente, die manche Spieler vielleicht als Aspekte aus FATE kennen, hei\u00dfen in Icons \u201eEigenschaften\u201c (engl. Qualities). Diese haben selbst keine Zahlenwerte und dienen einfach als zus\u00e4tzliche kleine Merkmale oder Hintergrundinformationen \u00fcber den Charakter. Sie k\u00f6nnen eventuell auch Beinamen sein (\u201eDer letzte Sohn Kryptons\u201c, \u201eDer Dunkle Detektiv\u201c, \u201eDer Oberste Zauberer\u201c, \u201eDer schnellste Mensch auf Erden\u201c, \u201eDie rothaarige Teufelin mit dem Schwert\u201c ...) oder Ausspr\u00fcche und Zitate (\u201eHeiliger Strohsack!\u201c, \u201eBei Rao!\u201c, \u201eX\u2019Hal!\u201c, \u201eCowabunga!\u201c, \u201eZwo, eins, Risiko!\u201c). Diese kann man dann im Laufe des Spiels durch bestimmte Entscheidungen und Spielz\u00fcge triggern und ausnutzen, manchmal zum Positiven und manchmal zum Negativen.\nDas Regelwerk ist Allgemeinen bewusst lockerer und kompakter aufgebaut als viele andere. Es ist auch knapper geschrieben und fr\u00f6hlicher und verspielter in seinen Illustrationen als beispielweise Mutants and Masterminds, das vom selben Autor stammt. Das Grundregelbuch deckt viel ab, ohne den Leser mit endlosen Textkapiteln zu belasten, die monatelanges Textstudium erfordern und eher vom Spielen abhalten und den einzelnen Spieler wom\u00f6glich entmutigen.\n___________________________________________________________________\nMit ICONS - Die Gesammelte Edition (Assembled Edition) erh\u00e4ltst du alles, was ben\u00f6tigt wird, um praktisch direkt loszulegen ...\nWohin flie\u00dft der KICKSTARTER-Betrag?

We hope you\u2019ll join us on this exciting new adventure!\nThe Crypt in Cadaver Canyon\nThe Crypt in Cadaver Canyon challenges 4-6 2nd level adventurers to save a hidden desert city (along with its cursed inhabitants) from the wrath of a devious and chaotic god. Its 48 digest-sized pages are packed with dangerous environments, exotic threats, and a world-shaking finale with thousands of lives on the line! \nDungeon Crawl Classics RPG adventures are easily adaptable to work in any \u2018old school\u2019 system, so the adventure and additional materials will benefit any GM looking to deliver some classic adventuring to their players, even if DCC isn\u2019t your system of choice!\nThe Sullenlands Adventure Omnibus and Guide\nAt it\u2019s most basic level, the Omnibus will combine all three of Mark\u2019s adventures (Nebin Pendlebrook\u2019s Perilous Pantry, The Frost Fang Expedition, and The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon) into a single beautiful book. As stretch goals are met, the Omnibus will expand to include:\nWorld details: cities, towns, thieves guilds and more!\nNew Monsters\nNew Magic Items\nRandom Encounters and Events\nA new mini-adventure: The Bellows of Bromforge (featuring the amazing artwork of Misinkthrope!)\nAnd more!\nWhen complete, The Sullenlands Adventure Omnibus and Guide will come in at almost 300 digest-sized pages of adventuring goodness, taking your players from zero to 3rd level and beyond! \nStretch Goals\nThis is where things get fun! As your pledges to the campaign mount, we\u2019ll be able to add all sort of cool stuff to the Kickstarter:\n$3000: Stefen Poag will create an awesome cover for The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon!\n$3500: We\u2019ll add The Life in the Sullenlands campaign guide to the Omnibus! \n$4000: Peter Mullens will create a wrap-around cover for the Omnibus!\n$4250: We\u2019ll add paper miniatures for The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon! \n$4500: We\u2019ll include an exciting mini-adventure in the Omnibus: The Bellows of Bromforge (featuring the amazing artwork of Misinkthrope).\n$5000: We\u2019ll include a Dwarf Cleric Class, and a full patron write-up for a Dwarven god Greythaak the Bearded Anvil \n$5500: We\u2019ll add a plethora of fun random tables, including encounters, events, character deaths, names, magic items, and more! \n$6000: We\u2019ll add beautiful, high-resolution Crypt PDF battlemaps by Frank Turfler \n$6500: We\u2019ll add a POD poster code for Peter\u2019s amazing cover for backers in the US. (Since DriveThruRPG only prints posters in the US, International backers will receive a PDF copy of the poster, and a free copy of the 0-level funnel Perils of the Sunken City).\n$7000: We\u2019ll add a POD poster code for Stefan\u2019s amazing cover for backers in the US.

If you back at the Digital Everything level or higher, just let us know in an email (or a comment when you order), and we will add a special bonus short adventure written by Jon Marr to your package that currently isn\u2019t available anywhere else. (If you\u2019re a fan of the Sunken City, you\u2019re going to like this one!) Thanks so much for your continuing support!\n How POD Printing and Shipping Works \nHow does a POD Kickstarter work, exactly? If you pledge at a POD level, you will get emailed a coupon code from DriveThruRPG to be able to purchase the book at only the actual printing cost plus the actual postage. This means no mark up at all. \nAs the printing will be conducted in both the US and UK, the shipping costs should be reasonable for many backers. If you haven\u2019t ordered POD books from DriveThruRPG before, contact us and we can help determine if shipping to your country is possible, and if makes sense financially!\nWe highly recommend ordering all POD titles in one order, as this will cut down on shipping costs considerably! (All the POD codes will be sent to you at the same time). Printing and shipping both books and the stretch goals should likely cost in the range of $12-16 in the US. Many countries will only cost a few dollars more, but some can be significantly more expensive to ship to. Again, just contact us and we can help you make the best choice!\nWant to See the Quality of the Previous Books in the Series?\nCheck out these older videos introducing the print versions of both Nebin Pendlebrook\u2019s Perilous Pantry and The Frost Fang Expedition:\nAbout Purple Sorcerer Games\nWe\u2019ve been creating free Dungeon Crawl Classics tools since the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG beta was released in 2011. Our popular Zero-Level Party Generator has produced millions of characters doomed to be ground up in DCC\u2019s popular funnel adventures, and over the years we\u2019ve added many utilities that thousands of DCC players rely on. (Including the Ennie-Award winning Crawler\u2019s Companion game management app, the Sorcerer\u2019s Grimoire spellbook, utility, the Upper Level Character Generator, and the Mutant Crawl Classics Generator). All of the tools are generously supported by the amazing DCC community each year through a pledge drive that helps pay for server costs, computer expenses,  mobile device acquisition for testing, and much more!\nOnce the DCC RPG was officially released, our adventure Perils of the Sunken City was the first DCC 3rd party adventure published. (Beating Attack of the Frawgs from our good friends at Thick Skull Adventures by a couple days). It was followed by 3 additional Sunken City adventures that were eventually combined into the best-selling Sunken City Adventure Omnibus and Guide: we\u2019re grateful that it continues to be one of the first titles picked up by many players new to DCC!\nWe\u2019ve been lucky to work with some of the best writers in the old school RPG community. In addition to Mark\u2018s adventures mentioned in this Kickstarter, we\u2019ve also published David Baity\u2019s fan-favorite tournament adventure The Carnival of the Damned, and Terry Olson\u2019s thrilling Escape from the Shrouded Fen.\nYou can purchase all of our adventures through DriveThruRPG, and print copies of most titles can be picked up from the extensive Goodman Games Online Store!\nAbout the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG from Goodman Games.

Just open & roll for initiative!\nThe Dungeon Books of Battle Mats are a pair of modular Battle Map Books that combine to give you up to an epic 2\u2019x2\u2019 encounter battle mat while still fitting in your bag and on your bookshelf alongside your rule books. Modular designs line up seamlessly to allow you to form a dungeon for any encounter!

An Endless Dungeon awaits!\nThe Dungeon is a fully modular & complementary pair of Battle Map Books designed to enable you to create a vast number of dungeon battle maps by using different page combinations in the books individually or side by side.     \nFully Laminated throughout and thus wipe clean, every page except the front & back covers is a map so you get the maximum dungeon out of the books!\nTwo Books Laid Out as a 24\" x 24\" Square\nEndless map options, completely flat and fits in a bag or on a bookshelf. Loke BattleMats books boast the 360\u00b0 spine so the books will open and lie dead flat or fold in half along the spine. It also means the books line up flush, level and flat so it plays just like one large map.

The number of tiles is increasing along with any pages unlocked via Stretch Goals for the physical books.\nThis digital collection will also include an adventure module for Dungeon & Dragons 5th Edition that will be set within the designs of the Dungeon books, delivered as a pdf. \nPlease note that shipping for any physical goods will be charged after the Kickstarter ends and at a set rate for your location regardless of how many items you are receiving.

We started designing and printing our own tabletop battle mats 4 years ago and since then we have developed an award winning range of Wargaming/RPG battle mats and accessories in a range of materials.\nWe published our first Battle Map Book in April 2018, and have since published additional fantasy and science fiction volumes. After this we will be designing two modern day, post apocalyptic and cyberpunk themed encounter map books, and we have two additional fantasy volumes ready to release towards the end of the year.\nThis is our 5th Kickstarter for a gaming accessory and our second focused on Battle Mat Books.\nOur Collaborators \nJames Gray, (aka quigonjim), is an illustrator and artist who will be producing the cover art for each of the Dungeon books. Former clients and books include the anthologies Zombies, Robots and Westerns for Accent UK Comics, the Kickstarter backed Amnesia Agents with Jason Cobley and the upcoming Brawler anthology, card art for Oligarchy from Entropic Games and poster and T-Shirt designs for the band Dead Man's Whiskey. He also has a substantial back catalogue of Superbike and MotoGP artworks.   \nJohn (JC) is co-authoring the adventure module along with Matt.\nAnd finally thanks to the Brighton Dice Saloon, our FLGS,  for hosting our video & photo shoot. You can find out more about them here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have identified the following risks, and I outline here how we are managing them:\n\n- Getting the price right\nIt sounds basic but when costing a project there are a lot of things to remember, and they all add to the cost! We have used our experience from 4 successful Kickstarters and having our range in retail & distribution to price our books. We are able to offer our backers a good deal for coming on board early, however we have ensured all the hidden costs, as well as the basics like printing and transport, are covered in our price.\n\n- Delay\nThe first delay risk is what we term \u201cmission slip\u201d! I.e. that the project expands into new areas which add time to deliver. We have a very clear vision of the product we want to deliver, and again we can call on our experience to ensure we deliver it in a timely manner! For example the designs, while they will evolve based on feedback and new designs hopefully added, are very much underway and a long way down the road already.\n\n- Product quality\nThe main risks for producing a book to replace & improve on a standard RPG battle mat is that you end up with a product which has all the disadvantages of both. To avoid this we believe the book must lay flat and must line up next to another book to allow the adventure to flow. We have been designing and producing Battle Map Books since 2018, and we have the experience of our existing, award winning range to testify we know how to make a good battle mat book! Light and portable as well as flat, easy to use (lays flat when opened, just open & roll!) you can back with confidence that we produce the highest quality products.\n\n- Print quality\nBy using our existing printers we know exactly what we are getting, and we can produce any of our existing library as an example of the high quality of their work. We know what is required of our designs in order to produce a work of art, and our printers can deliver it with us \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Fulfilment issues\nShipping thousands of products worldwide can be a daunting prospect, and it is the area which can easily grind a project to a halt. We will be using a fulfilment expert \u2013 GamesQuest \u2013 who are best placed to ship our products in a timely manner. They are experts in their field and able to offer fast effective service so your books will be with you as planned! This also covers risks from Brexit as GamesQuest have contingency plans in place.\n\n- We don\u2019t fund\nThis is the worst case scenario. That we don\u2019t attract enough funding to move forwards. In order to attract backers we will promote this kickstarter heavily prior to launch and throughout its live run. We have a (rather modest) advertising budget for social media and we will be calling on our network of media contacts and online influencers to help us spread the word. We have also added a number of social media goals all aimed at getting word out there far and wide. We prefer to spread the word through the RPG community as opposed to online advertising as it allows us to keep our costs reasonable and deliver more product for the money. This is the approach which has seen us successfully fund 4 previous Kickstarters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Digital Dungeon", "descp": "Receive the dungeon in digital format to print at home or use online.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital dungeon - All designs from the books in digital format\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nD&D5e Adventure module set in The Dungeon (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["477 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Dungeon", "descp": "Get one copy of The Dungeon at \u00a35 less than retail price.\nThe Dungeon is Two Modular 12\"x12\"Books presented as a set.\n*Shipping charged at the one set rate for your location listed on campaign page in shipping section of Kickstarter after campaign ends for any physical goods.

That said, I may have forgotten to rein them in a bit! While we normally aim for a page-count of about 120 for our Pocket RPGs, L.B. and Samantha went above and beyond building this behemoth book that clocks in at more than 300 pages.\nAnd it\u2019s through this Big Eyes, Small Brains boasts:\n6 amazing classes, which include the always-coiffed Combat Maids and Butlers and the shimmering Idols\n9 vast regions to explore, from the Ayakashi-filled Yotsuya, to the glimmering streets of Lancastar, and the small-town neighborhoods of Mitakihara\n32 villains and baddies, that include jack-booted Storm Troopers, steely-eyed Yakuza, and fangirls who will fight literally anything to have senpai notice them.\nOodles of character traits, mecha, and more to make your character stand out\nCooking skills!

Now, I\u2019m compiling them into a glorious hardcover compendium.\nThis limited edition hardcover book contains:\n55 illustrated adventure locations, settlements and wilderness regions\nAdventure summaries and a giant table of hooks & rumors \nA full-color campaign map that puts the adventures in context\nAn illustrated bestiary with more than 90 monsters\nA detailed index of people, places, creatures and things\nCompanion Bestiary PDFs add stats for 5e, B/X and Dungeon World \nEach adventure is lovingly illustrated, and fits on a single page or spread, making it easy use as a one-shot, a drop-in location in your home-grown campaign setting, or a source of ideas for your own creations.\n\"Stop writing adventures and use these\"\u2014Ryan Chaddock, Geek and Sundry\nThe adventures in the book are dungeons, ruined towers, underworld mega-caverns, creepy cult hideouts, treacherous cities, and deadly wilderness regions, all in the same easy-to-reference format. \nMy adventures are inspired by the weather-stained heroism of Middle Earth, the grounded, emotional honesty of Earthsea, and the fantastic whimsey of stories like Rupert Bear.\nThere are classic underground loot grabs, encounters wondrous and weird, terrors from ages past, and apocalyptic showdowns\u201442 adventure sites, 5 danger-filled settlements, and 8 wilderness regions in all. \nEverything is written as tightly as possible, distilled to get the maximum idea density on the page. I don't put in stats, so they're best for games where you can stat on the fly: early editions of D&D, Dungeon World, Torchbearer, Into the Odd, Maze Rats, or World of Dungeons (to name but a few).\n(Update: we have unlocked all four bestiary stretch goals, so backers will now get companion bestiary PDFs with stats for Dungeon World, Basic D&D, and fifth edition D&D!)\nFrom One-Shots to Sandboxes\nEach adventure location is designed for ease of use at your table. They're not stories but scenarios spring-loaded with potential. Whether your players arrive as marauders, explorers, diplomats, or thieves, interesting things will happen.\nMy hope is this book becomes an obvious addition to your emergency GMing kit. When it's an hour before game night and you need a one-shot scenario, pull it the book and send your players into your favorite underground hellhole.\nIf you're planning a mini-campaign, it's easy to snap together several adventures into a short series, by location type or theme using the two-page Adventure Summaries. Descend from the Unmended Way to save Tealwood from the poisons of the Martoi, or stitch together a desert arc out of the Oracle's Decree, the Roots of Ambition, and Lair of the Lantern Worm.\nThere's enough material in the book to pack a sandbox knee deep. I've kept them deliberately light on backstory to make them easy to reskin for your own setting. Even so, there are connecting themes and hidden links between the adventures. If we reach the realm map and gazetteer stretch goals, the adventures come together into a premade sandbox you can play directly from the compendium.\n \"The guy has thought the whole thing out really, really nicely\"\u2014Dean Putney, Boing Boing \n\nDue to overwhelming success of this campaign, the physical compendium will be a high-quality offset print run. It will NOT be a print-on demand book, despite what the reward tier says. (I can't change that, unfortunately!) I have queried the backers, and the response was almost unanimous: offset printing is worth the additional wait.\nEach adventure has been laid out in magnificent landscape, and the whole book is packed with illustrations, start to finish.  \n(An early POD test print; not the final cover nor the final print process.)\nThe book is 112 pages, without stretch goals, and includes:\n 48 adventures, reformatted, revised for clarity, and re-edited\n Ten of the adventures have been expanded to an extra page \ntwo pages of adventure summaries so you can quickly find the perfect adventure\na detailed index of people, places, demigods and monsters that reveals the hidden links between the adventures\nup to 46 pages of stretch goals are planned, which would bring the book to 160 pages \nArmed with this material, you'll be able to quickly prep for one-shots on a moment's notice, drop fantastic encounter sites into your hex map, or dig into the world behind the words.\nAs well as compiling previously published adventures, the book includes a special scenario, A Clutch of Shadows, in which a Grinvolt garrison desperately holds a captured Dradkin sun temple against counter-attack from below.\nUnfortunately, the garrison is running out of funds\u2014and allies\u2014and treachery is everywhere. Smugglers move underworld contraband past the noses of the Grinvolt axewives, dradkin infiltrators from below move among the camps. Worst of all, Flametender Gathana's foolhardy dabbling will bring ruin to everyone.\nEveryone who backs this campaign will immediately receive the two-page Clutch of Shadows PDF. so they know what they're getting into. See the backer-only update.\nThis campaign has three tiers. If you just want to dip your toe in, pledge $1 CAD and follow along the campaign. You'll get immediate access to the Clutch of Shadows adventure location PDF, and you'll get all the updates as the campaign plunges down into the dradkin fortress (see below).\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter \nThis is the all digital rewards pledge tier. For $12 CAD (about $9 USD), you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nAccess to all unlocked stretch goals (see below) in PDF form\nThis is the limited edition hardcover compendium tier. By pledging $66 CAD (about $49 USD) plus shipping, you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nA copy of the hardcover Compendium \nAll of the stretch goals that we unlock throughout the campaign (see below)\nIf you back at this tier, the hardcover book will be shipped to your address in Canada, the USA, UK, EU countries, Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Malaysia, Australia or New Zealand. \nMy plan is to run this campaign lean and mean, with sensible stretch goals that don't add a lot of risk to the project. I'd much rather you get your book quickly, so I can be back at this in a few years with more amazing material for you.\nMy main goal is paying everyone more. I've worked out a roughly proportional system with my contributors, based on the time and effort we've each put into the content. As the campaign clears its costs, the extra money will be divided up among us venal goblins to be used for good or ill.\nEven so, there are some very fun things waiting to be unlocked, my dear backers!\nStretch Goals (EVERYTHING HAS BEEN UNLOCKED!)\n UNLOCKED: An entirely new adventure, set in the aftermath of the Kickstarter campaign\n UNLOCKED: A campaign map that welds the adventures into a ready-made setting\n UNLOCKED x6!!: Two-page regional gazetteers, detailing the world section-by-section\n UNLOCKED: A short history of the lands, the underworld, and magic\n UNLOCKED: A complete bestiary of the 90+ monsters described in the adventures\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with Dungeon World stats \n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with OSR stats \n UNLOCKED: A giant table of hooks and rumors for one-shots and campaign clues\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with 5e stats! \n UNLOCKED: A map pack PDF, all the maps so you can show them to your players!\nFor details, read on! \nI did my stretch goals a little differently than some campaigns. Every time a campaign milestone was hit, it unlocked a random stretch goal. That's right, it's random. Every time a milestone is reached, I'll grab my dice and figure out which stretch goal unlocks!\nThing is, we blasted through them all. Only two formerly-random goals remain, two more two-page gazetteer entries. After that, there is one final goal. \nAll dollar amounts CAD\nThe funding milestones are hit based on the overall Kickstarter funding level. Each one unlocks a random stretch goal.\nThere are also two social media milestones, each of which revealed a dread turn of events in the 'Axewives Assemble' scenario (see below) in addition to unlocking random stretch goals. \nAs the Kickstarter campaign hits its milestones, I will reveal a new adventure map, unique to this Kickstarter campaign. Not only will it be a location, but we'll actually play it out during the campaign.\nThe dour warriors of Grinvolt have realized their position in the captured dradkin Sun Temple is untenable. The dradkin are preparing for counter-attack, and if they succeed, every life lost in taking the temple will have been for nothing. Using the last of his clout, Quarter-Lord Counobel sends word for every axewife still loyal to Grinvolt to come forth and join the battle. \"We descend!\"\nEvery backer of this campaign represents a soldier in the assault. Once the Kickstarter campaign is underway, I will reveal an illustration of the long stair down to the dradkin fortress, and the first of deadly preparations that await the forces of Grinvolt.\nWe will play out the battle that follows in the comments and updates! \nSocial Media Milestones\nAs mentioned above, two of the milestones are social media milestones. As well as unlocking stretch goals, they also have terrible effects on the battle. \nAfter the campaign, I'm taking the fully revealed map and turning it into one last adventure location for the book, representing the aftermath of the battle. Those of you who fought will have been there during the battle, but what remains afterwards?\nWill it be held proudly by Grinvolt, a beacon against the darkness of the underworld and a staging area into the Ur-Menig and beyond? Or will it be a warren of night-dark tunnels, slippery with the blood of fallen warriors? That all depends on the campaign!\nFor centuries, the Seree were the undisputed masters of the lands. But where did they come from? What did they learn, and where did they go? The Dradkin remember.\nA trove of learning has fallen into the hands of the Grinvolt force. The compendium now includes a six-page appendix describing the lands, the rise and fall of the Martoi, the Seree, and their war with the gods. The nature of the heavens and the earth themselves is revealed!\n\nI will be adding a giant table of hooks and rumors to the compendium. There will be six hooks for each adventure in the book, 294 hooks in all!\nPlanning a one-shot of Stellarium of the Vinteralf, but not sure what to tell your players about why they're there? Roll d6 or just choose among that adventure's hooks.\nDid your PCs just find a dusty old map, dusty old tome, or a dusty old tinker with a loose tongue and you need an adventure lead to spill? Roll on the full table and\u2014presto\u2014you have an instant connection to more adventure! \nEven though each adventure in the compendium is independent from the others, and meant for reskinning to homegrown settings, an implied setting has taken shape over the years. I've slowly been adding the adventures to a 'big map' that situates the adventures.\nThis map welds the adventures into a pre-built, open-world sandbox setting you can play directly from the compendium.\nIf I roll this stretch goal, the big map goes into the compendium as a full-color, full-page illustration. I'll add two versions to the book\u2014one with the adventure locations called out, and a player-safe version with only the place names, so you can share it with your adventurers.\n\n\nEach time this goal is rolled it unlocks a gazetteer entry of one of the regions of the land where the adventures are nominally set\u2014places like Strielund, the Border Lands, Claimsun of dead gods, the far blightlands from Curselake to Firevault, and cavernous Ur-Menig below them all.\nThe gazetteers build on the connecting themes between the adventures: the fractured political landscape of the north coast; lost Tealwood that slumbers under the poisons of the Martoi; the ecological warfare along the Pelaago plateau.\nEach regional gazetteer will be done up as a two-page spread, digging into the people, settlements and politics, food, wildlife, and wilderness of the area. Random tables will make it easy to use in play, with just enough text to put the results in context.\nIf your players just want to know where they can get a hot bowl of river-cabbage soup for their troubles, you'll be ready!\nWith the Dradkin laboratory breached, the Grinvolt force has won their accumulated lore. There are more than 90 new stocks, beasts, demons, animals, and aliens from the adventures, and the Dradkin Chimeromancers know them all. The compendium now includes a 20-page bestiary appendix that describes each and every one of them.\nWith this goal unlocked, the inestimable Johnstone Metzger is writing Dungeon World stats for the monsters in the bestiary! These will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nBrave warriors have allowed Johnstone Metzger to produce B/X-style stats for the bestiary! This bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nNow that we've hit $65,000 in funding, Jen Adcock is busy at work producing 5e stats for the monsters in the bestiary! The 5e-compatible bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG!  \n\nSince we've hit $80,000 CAD, all PDF and Hardcover tier backers will get a separate PDF with all the adventure location maps!\nI'll give them a once-over in Photoshop so there are no secret doors, people or monsters. This is a PDF of clean, full-size map illustrations that you can print for player hand-outs, share them on your virtual table top, or restock yourself with crazed margin notes!\nThis book would be much smaller were it not for the timely efforts of a creative bunch of collaborators and co-conspirators!\nMichael Prescott (writing, layout, illustration)\nI've been publishing Trilemma Adventures for five years, and was fortunate enough to be a winner in the One Page Dungeon Contest in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

I've had many people helping me, but at the moment I'm holding all the strings to get this thing shipped. I'm in good health, but if I'm eaten by meebs, that will be hard to overcome.\n\nI've done my best to reduce project risk to a minimum. With the exception of the 'Aftermath' adventure, all of the adventures are written, laid out and assembled, ready for final proof-reading.\n\nThe most likely risk is schedule delays arising from hitting all of the stretch goal milestones. To reduce this risk, three of the stretch goals already exist the first draft stage, and are about to go to editing. (You know, optimism.)\n\nThere are three remaining contributions required from outside parties: editing (which is required to ship the book), a dozen pieces of layout-supporting art (same), and the system stats stretch goals (which are shipped later as PDFs).\n\nDTRPG shipping can be lengthy, so if print-related errors (bleed, weird colors, etc.) are found in the test print, this could add several weeks to delivery of books to backers.\n\nMy editor (Andrew Young) has worked with me for several years; I'm able to produce the necessary art myself, and stretch goal PDF production has already begun. All other contributions are already squared away in the book.\n\nA risk to backers is complications in printing. I've selected the highest-quality option that DTRPG can produce, and I'm completely satisfied with the test prints I've received so far, but since DTRPG fulfills directly to backers, I won't see the actual books as they go out.\n\nAdditionally, as DTRPG produces each book at the closest print center to the shipping address, books for some backers will be manufactured at sites whose output I can't directly observe.\n\nA final risk to backers comes from shipping, either from damage in transit, goods never delivered, import duties if DTRRPG prints from somewhere other than where you live, or the wild card complications arising from Brexit.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Axe Friend", "descp": "Join the Axewives of Grinvolt in the assault into the Dradkin fortress below the Sun Temple.

It's up to you to make them wrong again! \nThe Great Old Ones reach out from the future and into their past\u2014our present\u2014corrupting the timeline such that events and individuals turn towards the apocalyptic and lead to their inevitable rise. A small and battered resistance effort mounted by time-travelers and present-day heroes stands in their way.\nYou are those one-way travelers from a dark future and their crucial allies from the present day, working together to save the human race from looming apocalypse. Armed with foreknowledge of Judgment Day, you must succeed at a series of vital missions aimed at restoring hope to the future. \nBut the clock is ticking. The corrupting influence of the Great Old Ones is sure to affect you before the end, twisting you slowly and inexorably into something alien and unrecognizable. \nCan you defeat the vast unknowable evils of the Great Old Ones before you become a monster yourself? Find out in Fate of Cthulhu, a new stand-alone tabletop roleplaying game from Evil Hat Productions!\nAre you already a backer? Go to this backers-only post and download the prototype\u2014a completely-playable PDF of Fate of Cthulhu\u2014right now! \nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Fate of Cthulhu through them? Encourage your FLGS to back this Kickstarter at the Retailer Ally level. (If you're in the UK or EU, Leisure Games has up a page for folks interested in preordering the book. See our Shipping section further below for other options as well.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFate of Cthulhu is a stand-alone game powered by the Fate Core system from Evil Hat Productions. It will be around 256 pages in length, featuring color art in 6\"x9\" hardcover and digital PDF formats and a whole lot of tentacles (so, so many tentacles).\nThe idea for Fate of Cthulhu started with a simple question: what if Cthulhu operated like Skynet? In this game you'll face down Mythos-style threats with Terminator-style action and adventure, whether as a present-day Sarah Connor type, or an agent from the future already facing the creeping effects of corruption. This is Lovecraftian roleplaying made new again, with time-traveling operatives from a future apocalypse journeying back to the present day to warn others of the coming danger (and recruit them) to try to set the timeline on a new and hopefully better course.\nYou'll discover whether they succeed, and whether or not their success will lead to salvation or some fresh new horror, throughout the course of play. The future changes with each move the heroes make, the Old Ones always pushing back with their own dire countermoves, both inflicting new ripples on the timeline. Sometimes the best you can hope for is a less awful apocalypse\u2014but somewhere out beyond the dark roiling clouds and tentacle-lashed landscape of mankind's ruin, there is a glimmer of hope, thanks to your sacrifices.\nAnd the sacrifices will be many. To fight the tentacular and squamous, operatives must become so themselves. Through time travel itself or exposure to Old One threats during their missions, characters will gain strange new abilities and bizarre new anatomies as they absorb more corruption into their own flesh and psyches. In time, they might twist so far they become lost, turning into new agents of the Old Ones themselves... with any luck, they'll have a good friend nearby to put them down when it happens.\nDoes Terminator action with Lovecraftian style sound interesting to you? Learn more about Fate of Cthulhu in this Techraptor interview: PK Sullivan and Stephen Blackmoore on Fate of Cthulhu and Punching Elder Gods \nA corruption clock that fills up as you sacrifice more of your humanity to power or gain monstrous abilities (supercharged stunts), slowly transforming your character's aspects into new, corrupted versions of themselves.\nA system for tracking key events leading up to the apocalypse that the players change through their actions and choices during play, including support for ripple effects and time paradoxes.\nModifications to stress and concession rules, including support for heroic last stands that sacrifice a character but help turn the timeline towards a better outcome.\nA rituals and spells system that offers great power at a cost, treating spells as secrets of arcane Elder technology that must be sought out in play.\n Five detailed example timelines plus rules for running them and making your own.\nThe full Fate Core game system condensed to about 50 pages but still supporting the standard Core skill list, stunt building, and more.\nFate is a system focused on story, where both success and failure help to create interesting moments for players and characters. Fate models fiction, not physics. In Fate it's as much about the choices your time-traveling agents face and the story consequences of those choices, for good or ill, as it is about those visceral, dangerous fights to save the human race. (You'll get plenty of both.)\nDo you sacrifice more of your humanity to gain the abilities you need to fight the Great Old One's minions? Or do you hold on to what makes you human and avoid turning into the very monsters you fight? When you choose to stick with or go off of your mission, how does it affect the future's timeline? Fate helps generate drama by pushing play toward answering these questions.\nThat's right: you don't need to buy any other books to play Fate of Cthulhu, though you're welcome to grab other Fate products and cross-pollinate with this one. \nFate is a nimble rules-light system that uses 4 six-sided dice and a pool of tokens to advance the narrative. While you can use standard d6's or poker chips if that's your jam, we do offer our own Fate Dice\u2122 and Fate Points\u2122 which you can grab as part of the Equipment Cache and Well-Equipped Elder God Squad reward levels. We put a lot of thought into the design of these items. If you love dice and game accessories as much as we do, you'll be very happy to put these on your table top!\nThe Prototype PDF: As a backer of this project, you get immediate access to the current version of the PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes (click here, or see the link under the video up top). We want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you're new to RPGs. The prototype PDF still lacks a lot of art and a few other finishing touches, but there's enough there for you to get started playing right now.\nThe Completed PDF(s): Backers at $20 and up will receive the final, art-complete PDF as soon as it's ready (after we get all the missing art made). They will also receive all digital stretch goals which are unlocked during the course of this campaign.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $35 and higher will receive one (or more, depending) copy of the 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover, color interior book with 256 pages and a matte finish on the cover. Will ship before the end of the year. You can increase your pledge by $35 for each additional copy you want to receive. Backers at this level also receive PDF copies of the final book and any digital stretch goals which are unlocked.\nYour choice of Fate Dice\u2122: Some of our reward tiers let you pick one of our 12-packs of Fate Dice\u2122. We offer them in a wide variety of styles (including our popular and on-theme Eldritch set). They're $15 each, so if you want some extra packs, just increase your pledge amount appropriately.\nA set of Fate Points\u2122: This past year we released our branded Fate Points\u2122 tokens, which are included on some of our reward tiers. They come 30 to a pack for $12. Want more points? Increase your pledge in $12 increments.\n\nIf you want to add any of the above items after the campaign's over, we'll make that possible with BackerKit (see \"Shipping and Fulfillment,\" below).\n UNLOCKED!\nOur first stretch goal is all about adding some extra bells and whistles to the book and showing you some horrific gratitude to boot. \nWhen we hit this goal at $30,000 the Digital Apocalypse package (available to backers at $20 and up) gets its first new items:\nA PDF of the Fate Horror Toolkit (great for use with Fate of Cthulhu!)\nA PDF of the Fate Adversary Toolkit (also great!)\n High-resolution digital wallpaper of the book's cover art to haunt your digital workspace\nThe hardcover book will get some extra bits of polish and chrome too, to up the luxe factor: \nSpot-gloss effects for the cover (similar to what we've done with gloss accents on Blades in the Dark and Scum and Villainy)\nPrinted endpapers (those are the usually-blank sheets of paper that line the inside of the cover of the book) that'll showcase the cover artwork without logos and text covering up its portentious doom\nWe'll also be able to increase the size of our initial print run and hire a professional indexer to make sure the final book's index is top notch!\nIn addition to all the above, there's a community component to this stretch goal: we'll commit to providing an open-licensable version of the system components of the game (with our setting and Cthulhu derived IP taken out, for hopefully obvious reasons). By and large, this will be a \"condensed Fate Core\" plus a couple other bells and whistles, but we think there's potentially some real value in that. Til now, Fate Accelerated has been the primary \"condensed Fate\" for folks to build their third-party Fate games from; the 50-pages-or-so version we have in Fate of Cthulhu cleaves more strongly to Fate Core's defaults, while still leaving a lot of room for original content for folks looking to build their own stand-alone Fate games. \nUNLOCKED! At $75,000 we'll add a partial preview of the Fate Accessibility Toolkit to the Digital Apocalypse package available to backers at $20 & up. See Update #8 for details on this stretch.\nUNLOCKED! At $85,000 we'll provide EPUB and Kindle formats along with our PDFs for backers receiving the Digital Apocalypse package at $20 & up. See Update #8 for details.\nStarting at $40,000 and at each $10,000 increment afterwards up to $100k, we'll expand the Digital Apocalypse package to include a new timeline by a new author, to expand your options for play. As we get closer to these goals, we'll fill you in on which Elder Gods and other doomsday threats we have for you to face.\nEach timeline will run about 24-or-so pages of material, including several new pieces of art in each. Funding for each goal will cover the writing, editing, system development, layout, art direction, artwork, and digital release costs.\nWe've lined up a diverse set of authors to uncover new dimensions of terror for you and your friends to take on.

You see what we did there.\nWe've put $20,000 of our own money into getting Fate of Cthulhu to this point. With your help we'll cross the remaining distance and get this off to press as soon as possible.\nWe already have the preliminary layout done (backers can take a look at that right now\u2014check out the linked graphic right underneath the video, up top), which includes some of the art. We'll need to give a few months for artists to finish up the rest, starting once the campaign concludes in May, if not sooner. \nThen it's off to the presses for manufacture. One advantage of Kickstarting is that it allows us to size that print run like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge\u2014just right. Our printer usually takes 2-3 months to turn around a book, although that timeline\u2019s dependent on their availability. We\u2019ve added some cushion to our delivery estimates, and we\u2019re confident that we will ship this before the end of the year. We hope to beat that estimate, of course, but when it comes to book production it's best to put a buffer into your schedule. \nYou can be confident that we'll ship on or before our estimated delivery date, because that's been our consistent track record across a dozen other campaigns in the last seven years. Just ask our backers; we keep our promises. Our two most recent campaigns, Uprising: The Dystopian RPG and Tachyon Squadron, shipped within four months of conclusion. We've got a bit more to do here on the artwork front, but we're still very far along in the process, and we're confident we have all the remaining time-factors well in hand. For Evil Hat, it's not so much Kickstarter, as Kickfinisher.\nStretch goals have a separate production timeline. We consider them truly extra content, and that means we don't start production on the stretch goals until after they fund. We may adjust the planned goal order behind the scenes as we learn what the backers are most interested in. \nWe're excited to see what you unlock! Once the campaign concludes we'll put together a plan for getting the funded goals done. There are a lot of moving parts to coordinate (writing, system development, editing, layout, art direction, and artwork), but since these are digital-only they're not vulnerable to any manufacturing hiccups.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up their rewards.  \nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll have the option to add on some items via BackerKit, tho for our sanity (already taxed by exposure to the dread gods) the selection will be limited. If there's something you want to have shipped along with your rewards that we don't list, just reach out and let us know.\nBased on our average shipping cost scenario in the USA, we've set up shipping costs like so:\nFor book-only shipments we're charging a flat $7 shipping fee (media mail + handling costs) for USA addresses. \nFor shipments including dice and tokens that goes up to $12 (priority mail + handling costs). \nHere\u2019s the sad part: we\u2019re only able to offer shipping to the USA. Our shipping options outside of the country would cost more than the actual book in most cases (and would badly distort the funding model we're using for this campaign). However, every reward offered in this Kickstarter will be available to our international fans.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options:\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, use a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address and then get packages delivered to it, to you. Those costs will still likely be below what we could offer!\nBack the KS at the Digital Apocalypse and get all of the digital rewards that way.\nBack the KS at $10 to get access to the prototype version of the game. Later, buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution (we sell to a variety of international distributors in Canada, the UK, Europe, and Australia). Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately.\nWait and buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution. Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately. \nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list (like with Leisure Games, see below) so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. Without this kind of communication, the chances that a store will order enough quantities for you to be able to get a copy from them go down significantly.\nLeisure Games has a page up for people in the UK or EU who are interested in preordering the hardcover. https://leisuregames.com/pages/fate-of-cthulhu \nText length limits have forced us to move our creators' bios off of this page and into a separate document!

We've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Fate of Cthulhu is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2019 and 2020. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Fate of Cthulhu to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run two or more Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 12+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

The game is intentionally rules-light, putting the focus of play on imagination, improvisation, and fun. The rules are optimised for ease of use at the table, with meticulous attention to wording and layout clarity. What's more, Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the classic Basic/Expert game from 1981, meaning that decades of adventure are at your fingertips!\nOld-School Essentials comes in two forms: a chunky tome and a modular boxed set. The content is identical. Choose one or both, depending on your preferred format!\nThe first two Old-School Essentials supplements \u2014 adding extra classes, spells, and combat options \u2014 will be available as optional add-ons in BackerKit (following the completion of the Kickstarter)!\nDigital mock-ups. Final products may vary. Some new cover art in progress.\nSee below for in-depth info on all products!\nPDFs\nAll books will also be produced as extensively hyperlinked PDFs. Once the Kickstarter has finished, backers will get early access to PDFs in their current, near-finished forms. Once all artwork is in place and everything is finalised, the final PDFs will be sent out to backers.\nFree Basic Rules PDF: To whet your appetite for this game, you can download a free PDF, featuring the basic rules for creating characters, adventuring in dungeons, combat, magic, and spells. Includes the complete rules for four classic fantasy character classes: the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.\nKiller Features of Old-School Essentials\nUsability: Old-School Essentials is meticulously edited and laid out, with the aim of maximising ease of reference during play. No more searching for references scattered across multiple pages. No more scanning dense paragraphs of text to pick out details. Everything in Old-School Essentials is logically organised and collated, and presented in a quick-to-read format based on \"control panels\" \u2014 two-page spreads presenting a single topic in its entirety. (See page examples below or check out the free Basic Rules.)\nModularity: The rules of Old-School Essentials are divided into \"modules\" \u2014 cleanly separated chunks of related content. For example, the core rules of the game are cleanly separated from the rules for the classic fantasy character classes. This makes it simple to swap out any of the modular components of the game's rules with alternatives \u2014 perfect for referees who love to customise and tweak. We have lots of plans for further rules modules in the Old-School Essentials line, building on the core rules to take the game into a myriad of different settings and genres, from science fantasy to post-apocalyptic to sword and sorcery.\nConvenience: All books are produced in handy A5 (Digest) size for convenient use at the table. The small, modular books in the Black Box make it easy to find what you need. Want to look up a spell? Just grab the book of spells. No need to navigate a big tome to find the right section.\nQuality: We're set to produce the Old-School Essentials books at a deluxe level of quality \u2014 hardcovers with sewn bindings. These will be beautiful and seriously durable books!\nCompatibility: Old-School Essentials is a 100% accurate restatement of the original Basic/Expert rules (B/X), with nothing added, changed, or removed. All material written for the B/X rules over the last 38 years can be used with Old-School Essentials, without any conversion effort whatsoever!\nRefinement: The original Basic/Expert game presents a wondrously solid rules set, but the rules are not without areas of confusion and contradiction. All known omissions, contradictions, and areas of confusion have been carefully ironed out in Old-School Essentials.\nBen Milton of Questing Beast\nBen's video review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nQuesting Beast Patreon\n\nThilo Graf of Endzeitgeist\nThilo's in-depth reviews of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nEndzeitgeist Patreon\n\nSave or Die Podcast\nSave or Die review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\n\nA box full of adventure to fire up your nostalgia to the max! The Old-School Essentials core rules plus four rules modules for creating characters and running adventures in the classic fantasy genre. Each of the five books in the Black Box is described below.\nCore Rules\n72-page A5 hardcover\nThe core rules of the game, including procedures for: creating characters; exploring dungeons, the wilderness, and the high seas; combat, hazards, and challenges; retainers, hirelings, and vehicles; adventure design; magic, monsters, and treasures.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules are carefully designed to be applicable to a multitude of fantastic campaign settings and genre conventions, from Classic Fantasy to Post-Apocalyptic to Sword and Planet. Just add a book of genre rules and you're ready for adventure!\nA spread from the adventure design section\nClassic Fantasy: Genre Rules\n40-page A5 hardcover\nOptions for classic fantasy characters: classes, equipment, vehicles, hirelings, strongholds, and more. Play as a devout cleric or a sagacious magic-user, a doughty fighter or a cunning thief, a surly dwarf, a noble elf, or a homesick halfling. This book contains all character options from the Basic/Expert game.\nFull rules for character advancement to 14th level.\nThe dwarf class \u2014 all on one spread\nClassic Fantasy: Cleric and Magic-User Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\nAll 106 magic spells that can be used by clerics, magic-users, and elves, ranging from 1st to 6th level.

Includes full encounter tables by dungeon level and wilderness terrain type. This book contains all monsters from the Basic/Expert game.\nT-rex, unicorn, and vampire\nClassic Fantasy: Treasures\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by the referee\nA hoard of classic magic items, encompassing enchanted weapons and armour; magic wands, staves and rods; magical scrolls, rings, and potions; and the plethora of weird and wondrous items that don't fit into any of those categories! Includes full rules for sentient swords. This book contains all magic items from the Basic/Expert game.\nRules for sentient swords\nFor those who prefer all of their RPG rules in one book, rather than divided into modules \u2014 this is what you've been waiting for! Everything that's in the Black Box, combined into a single 256-page, A5 (Digest sized), hardcover tome.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules plus all of the classic fantasy genre content, all in one meaty hardcover book.

The final retail price will be \u20ac30.\nThere's Also a Super-Deluxe Limited Edition!\nIn conjunction with our manufacturer, we're delighted to be able to offer a super-deluxe and highly limited edition of the Rules Tome, only available to backers of this Kickstarter!\nThe limited edition book will be wrapped in luxurious black leatherette, and foil stamped with the Old-School Essentials logo plus a design based on the cover illustration. (We'll post updates on that design as work on the cover illustration progresses.\n\nThe Rules Tome and the Black Box present a loving restatement of the classic Basic/Expert rules from the 1980s. But this is just the beginning of the Old-School Essentials line \u2014 we have many more books in the works, taking the game into a vista of different worlds and genres.\nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will also be producing a pair of hotly anticipated books to add Advanced magic and character options to your games! These new options are inspired by the beloved Advanced rules from the 1970s, and carefully scaled to mesh smoothly with the lower Basic/Expert levels of power and rules complexity.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Genre Rules\n56-page A5 hardcover\nThis book adds:\n 9 new human classes: acrobat, assassin, barbarian, bard, druid, illusionist, knight, paladin, ranger.\n 6 new demihuman race-classes: drow, duergar, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, svirfneblin.\nOptional rules for choosing race and class separately.\nAdvanced rules for poisons, combat options, and more.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Druid and Illusionist Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\n106 new spells that can be used by bards, druids, gnomes, and illusionists, ranging from 1st to 6th level.\nMore Advanced Fantasy Books...\nWe plan to continue expanding Old-School Essentials with more Advanced books, bringing in monsters and magic items inspired by the Advanced rules.\n\nDeluxe Quality\nAll books in these deluxe editions will be high quality hardcovers with sewn bindings. In addition to their high durability, a great thing about books with a sewn binding is that they can lay open flat!\nWhat's more, we have stretch goals lined up for extra trimmings, to further increase the quality of these books. See below for more info on what we have planned, if the initial funding goal is surpassed.\nThe Team\nWondering who's behind all of this? Allow us to elucidate:\nGavin Norman: Author of Old-School Essentials (and formerly B/X Essentials), co-creator and principle author of the critically acclaimed Dolmenwood campaign setting, and founder of Necrotic Gnome. Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, editing, and layout.\nAndrew Walter: Visual genius behind a vista of weirdness, including Dolmenwood and Troika! Andrew's flights of imaginative fantasy feature on the covers of the five books in the Black Box. Four of these are complete (as shown in the product mock-up above). Andrew is now working on a completely new cover for the Core Rules book in the Black Box.\nPeter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter is working on a brand new piece that will grace the cover of the Black Box and the Rules Tome, and full 4-panel art for the front of the referee screen!\nStefan Poag: Prolific and beloved creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others. Stefan created the cover art for the Advanced Fantasy rules modules.\nInterior artists: A crack team of artists is tackling the interior illustration of the books, including: Luka Rejec, Matt Ray, Michael Clarke, Alex Mayo, Tom Kilian, Sean Poppe, Kyle Latino, Thomas Novosel.\nPlus full-colour art plates by: Thomas Denmark, Rachel Quinlan, Jon Hodgson, Olivia Politz, Tom Kilian, Sam Mameli, Emma Lazauski.\nWhat's This About 1981?\nThe 1981 Basic/Expert Fantasy Adventure Game sets (also known as B/X) have experienced a vibrant renaissance over the last decade. Many players have returned to (or discovered for the first time!) the simple rules and imaginative open space of the Basic/Expert game, with the focus on ease of play, adventure, wonder, and mystery.\nRenewed interest in this vintage game has led to the creation of a wide array of retro-clones: games that restate or are inspired by the rules of the Basic/Expert sets. In fact, the B/X rules (and games based on them) are the most popular rules in use in the old-school gaming scene.\nOld-School Essentials is exactly such a retro-clone, and we're immensely proud to be a part of the renaissance of these beloved rules.\n100% Rules Accuracy\nThe material in the Black Box and the Rules Tome forms a complete retelling of the classic Basic/Expert rules, including all of the classic fantasy classes, spells, monsters, and treasures.\nOld-School Essentials has been developed with equal measures of love and precision. The ultimate aim of this project is to produce as accurate as possible a restatement of the revered B/X rules, while improving the structure and presentation, and fixing errors and contradictions in the original rules. (For those with a passion for rules archaeology, this document describes all the areas of the Basic/Expert rules which are clarified in Old-School Essentials.)\nThe resulting books are the product of over two years of meticulous research, rules archaeology, and discussion.\nA Single Optional Addition \u2014 Ascending Armour Class\nModern iterations of the world's most popular RPG use an Armour Class system where AC values start at 10 and go up. This is known as Ascending Armour Class. (The default Armour Class system in B/X has AC starting at 9 and going down, known as Descending Armour Class.)\nFor those more familiar or comfortable with Ascending Armour Class, this optional rule has been fully integrated into Old-School Essentials. All AC ratings are presented in a dual format, for example: AC 7 [12].\nThis is the single rule we've added to the game that is not present in the original Basic/Expert rules, and it is strictly optional \u2014 Descending AC remains the default.\n\n\u20ac16,000 \u2013 Purist Character Sheet [UNLOCKED]\nDesigned by Gavin Norman.

That said, Necrotic Gnome has been relentlessly producing high quality old-school content since 2012. The team behind Old-School Essentials is by no means new to producing games! We are renowned for our communicative and transparent development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Rules Tome and the books in the Black Box is 100% finished. The layout of all books is done. The cover art for most of the books is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast.\n\nThe box manufacturer isn't someone we've worked with before, so that is a slight unknown, but in case of an utter fall-through in communication, we have a second box manufacturer lined up.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, the majority of them are designed such that they will not add delays to the production and fulfillment of the main campaign goals:\n\u2022 The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time. (They just cost extra!)\n\u2022 The referee screen (as noted above) will be shipped separately from the books / box, so any unexpected delays in development there will not delay the whole project.\n\u2022 Development of all the digital stretch goals (character sheet PDFs, the rules reference website, etc.) likewise does not impact the delivery of the books / box.\n\nThe stretch goals that require additional print production (the Advanced books and the introductory adventure) are the main extras that could, in principle, cause delays. However, all of those products are already written. They just need to be laid out and illustrated. This extra work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Halfling", "descp": "PDF of the Rules Tome.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Sprite", "descp": "PDFs of all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Gnome", "descp": "PDFs of the Rules Tome and all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["321 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Fighter", "descp": "The Rules Tome \u2014 at the special Kickstarter price!\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["658 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Dwarf", "descp": "The limited edition, foil stamped, leatherette cover Rules Tome.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited super-deluxe Rules Tome with stamped leatherette cover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Magic-User", "descp": "The Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["582 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "Elf", "descp": "The Rules Tome plus the Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["603 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "Retail Fighter", "descp": "Five copies of the Rules Tome for retail.

Both books will be 128+ pages in PDF and Print On Demand.\n\nWhat\u2019s in The Umerican Road Atlas?\nThe Umerican Road Atlas takes you all over this irradiated land and shows you what\u2019s what. Written by Reid San Filippo and Bob Brinkman, this book includes:\nInteresting Places to Die\nInfamous Gangs of the Wastes\nThe Random Gang Generator\n New Vehicle Rules: construction and military vehicles\n New Classes: holy roller, hunter, and road hawg\nNew Vehicular-based Mighty Deeds\n\nWhat\u2019s in Umerica Unnatural?\nUmerica is a place full of weird supernatural mysteries, and Umerica Unnatural covers them all. Written by Reid San Filippo and Forrest Aguirre, this book includes:\nRevised and Expanded Psionic rules\n Grimoire of the Wastes:  over a dozen new spells for wizards and clerics\n New Classes: wasteland psion, psi mutant, beastkin, shifter\n Cache of Astonishing Salvage: new equipment and artifacts of technology, magic, and just plain weirdness\n The Goal (WHAT\u2019S THE MONEY FOR, BUB?) \nThe plan is to produce at least two books with color covers and black and white interiors in both PDF and Print on Demand (POD) formats (available at DriveThruRPG, Amazon, and Lulu). Both books will be 128+ pages in length.\nWhat is the money for? The writing is well underway but it still needs get a full proofreading, professional layout, and a lot more awesome art put into it. Some of this is already in the works but the funds from this Kickstarter will be essential to finishing this project.\nHow does a POD Kickstarter work, exactly? If you pledge at a POD level, you will get emailed a coupon code from DriveThruRPG to be able to purchase the book at only the actual printing cost plus the actual postage. This means NO MARK UP at all! You\u2019ll still get the books cheaper than retail!\nAs the printing will be conducted in both the USA and UK, the shipping costs should be reasonable for many backers.\nIf you\u2019re still in doubt as to the quality of the work or you\u2019re not sure if the books are what you need for your game, the first update for this Kickstarter is a backers-only preview of both books\u2026 over 30+ pages each! Is it worth a $1 pledge to find out what your money will get you? Of course it is.\nHere\u2019s where things get really exciting.

A small pond, its surface decorated with lily pads with lilies in bloom. Small colorful stones decorate the pond\u2019s shoreline, water bugs swim like ballerinas dancing over glass. Then, quite suddenly, a spark of blue light flashes above the water and a Water Fairy is born. She flies around, happy at her own arrival. An Air Fairy swoops down from the sky to welcome the new Water Fairy, and they begin a dance of joy. \nAbout Fairies\nFairies: A Role Playing Game lets you experience the life of a fairy in a fictional version of earth. This comprehensive manual will give you the tools to tell a story from the point of view of a fairy. Standing only 3''-6'' in height fairies live world built by humans and face many challenges from this perspective, many of which are unforeseen.  Fairies are also naturally nonviolent and will not harm any living creature no matter how angry the housecat is. However, fairies consider themselves to be the some of the most powerful beings on earth and are not afraid to unleash their full strength if threatened by eldritch powers. \nA debut release from Spectra Games, the Fairies: A Role Playing Game core manual is a concise guide containing everything you need to play the game, giving players the ability to craft their own wonderful adventures. \nFairies: A Role Playing Game runs on an original d10 system created by the team here at Spectra Games. It is a game with focusing on storytelling as a core aspect of the game supported by optional in depth mechanics. The mechanics were meant to reflect the innate magical nature of a fairy. There are very few attributes important to fairy's, which also makes character creation a breeze. \n Sprites are the fairy's one and only stat. Fairies wink into existence, coming to life through a magical life force called sprites. Their sprites not only act as their life/hit points but also as a way for the fairy to manipulate their innate magical ability.  \n Speed determines how far fairies can fly, who goes first in battles, and how quickly they can save themselves in bad situations.\n Terrain is the landscape in which the fairy winked into existence. Being within that terrain grants the fairy a number of advantages\n Skills can give the fairy a deadly edge over enemies or perhaps your fairy enjoys building clockworks?\n Magic is almost as natural as breathing to a fairy. Each fairy has magic that will be sure to make them shine.\n\n Pledge Levels\nThe core rule book includes\n9 types of fairies to choose from.\nThe emphasis on teamwork is evident in the design of each fairy as each type of fairy has unique abilities unusable by the others.    \nAir\nBlueberry\nEarth\nFire\nLemon\nPlum\nShaper\nSpirit\nWater \nA comprehensive Fairy Market\nA-Z Creature Compendium, many of which derived from actual myths and legends\nAn adventure module to get you started in the world of Fairies. \nCheck out the current first edition on drivethruRPG https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264184/FairiesA-Role-Playing-Game\nThe System\nA Core aspect of the mechanics we wanted to reflect was that all actions have consequence, whether good or bad. Sometimes a mistake doesn't lead to more than a wounded pride, other times it can lead to losing everything. \nA successful roll will leads to higher chances of success on subsequent rolls, while failures will lower the chance of the fairy succeeding on its next actions. The higher or lower the success/failure the greater the influence it will have on the fairy's future actions. \nFairy's playing Humans\n The World of Fairies\nFairy's were among the first sentient creatures to pop into existence on earth. This makes any period in earth's history a potential campaign setting. In the medieval period, elves, fairies, gnomes, and many other creatures were well known to humans. In our modern era, fairies keep themselves hidden from humans. Fairies and other magical creatures possess a wide range of magic and skills that allows them to easily fool humans and not be seen. It wasn\u2019t always this way\u2026\nExcerpt from Fairy Queen Avarice:\n\u201cHumans have always been wary of us, and we of them. It was decided long ago, after Merlin\u2019s experiments went too far, that all magic must be stripped from the humans. They are a danger not only to our way of life\u2026 but to their own.\u201d \nFairies, since time immemorial, have been subtly manipulating the facts of the world for both the fairies benefit, while  also for the protection of others. They consider this to be a selfless act. \nWhen Human historians first started recording historical events, the fairies jumped on the opportunity to render their existence as fiction. They used their magic to manipulate authors and historians to help bury the truth about the existence of fairies, not to mention the dark magic hidden in the deepest corners of the earth.  \nShaper and Earth Fairies\nMadame Rue and her Crystal Ball\nStoryteller information:\nIn Fairies: A Role Playing Game the game master is referenced as the Storyteller since this game is meant to tell a story and is primarily story driven.

In association with In Search Of Games, LLC., a publisher of roleplaying games (RPGs), I'm developing LatchKey, a simplified, accessible role-playing experience that will introduce new players to the world of tabletop gaming.\nSet in the year 2075, you take on the role of a young adult during the rebuilding of Nashville, Tennessee three years after a civil war. Suddenly, three figures invade and split the city amongst themselves and it's up to you and your party to embark on journeys, solve mysteries, drive these mysterious intruders out of the city and restore it to normalcy.\nLatchKey is a tabletop roleplaying game I developed with the intention to initiate new players into the RPG experience. LatchKey is meant to teach new players the details about a RPG, without sacrificing the storytelling or the challenge that usually comes with an introductory game.\nWhat started out as a passion project based off an innocuous request evolved into a stunning portfolio piece during my final year of college, and now a very tangible, very real Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for it. My goal with this campaign is to print out physical books and send them out to players and RPG enthusiasts alike, and introduce them to this world that's been three years in the making.\nLatchKey comes with the following:\n - A Black & White PDF or Hardcover book containing:\n       - 6 Playable Classes\n       - An Introduction & Directions to the LatchKey Game System\n       - A 25-page introductory adventure\n       - A section on running the adventure as the Game Master (GM).\n- If you pledge $5 or more, you'll have your name in the Special Thanks section of the core rulebook.\n- If you pledge $10 or more, you get all previous rewards and a PDF Copy of LatchKey.\n- If you pledge $40 or more, you get all previous rewards and a signed Hardcover Version of LatchKey.\n- If you pledge $70 or more, you get all previous rewards and an exclusive LatchKey Tee.\n\n\n - If you pledge $100 or more, you get all previous rewards and your Original Latchkey Character drawn by me. (I love character design, so this is great for me!)\nA little of what I do\n- If you pledge $200 or more, you get all previous rewards and receive access to a special Discord server where I will run an exclusive scenario of LatchKey. \n(If there is not enough people to run a campaign, you'll still have access to the Discord Server and Christopher Hopkins will host a miniature press conference; min of 3 players)\n\nIf we surpass our goals I have a few ideas in mind to show you all:\n       - $2,000 - I'll create a comic based on the world of LatchKey. It will be a limited         series of 5 issues detailing the underlying story of post-war Nashville.\n       - $3,000 - Along with In Search of Games, we'll be publishing a second adventure book, with non-canon scenarios by guest writers and illustrators.\n       - $4,500 - Collaborating with In Search of Games again, we'll be publishing a third book of non-canon scenarios by more guest writers and illustrators.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my very first Kickstarter.

It's challenging, but nothing good stories and great gameplay can't handle.\n\nThe main obstacle here is the funding for physical printing. I want to deliver a hardcover book to all players, both new and old, and introduce them to this world of war, danger, and family ties.\n\nThis is really big jump for me.

You are running to a place you\u2019ve never seen, somewhere past the mountains you\u2019ve never crossed.\nThe 24\"x36\" map of Stonewater is included at the Stonewater High Council backer level and presents players with random siege-weapon attacks; a gigantic hornets' nest with very cranky residents; critical high ground space; a field of strange wildflowers with butterflies that are rather clingy; crystals that trigger random spells; a blood-filled moat; and much, much more. Art by ilCorvo Artworks.\nThe journey will take weeks, and the way is full of danger. Shadowforde is weak and ill. The king\u2019s men are hunting you. \nAnd you are searching for a legend. \nThis is The Exodus of Wolfbane, an epic 0- to 2nd-level adventure compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics\u2122 roleplaying game. The module features a hefty 56 pages of adventure, illustrations, player handouts, and supplements, including the popular Encounter Cards we introduced in our first project, The Peasants' Fell Bargain. Your peasants will become hardened heroes as they battle strange monsters, harsh elements, and the king\u2019s cruel soldiers. You will grapple with mysteries, hauntings, moral dilemmas, and death-defying chases.\nAnd what will be waiting for you if you manage to reach Stonewater?\nTake the journey and find out! \nMeaningful Motivations\nAs with our first module, The Peasants\u2019 Fell Bargain, The Exodus of Wolfbane is designed to give your player-characters compelling reasons for going on this adventure. You are trying to save your friends and family, men, women, and children, and protect the strange man who has cared for your village for decades. Merciless soldiers dog your every footstep. \nThe Exodus of Wolfbane is a funnel that doesn\u2019t end when you reach first level because the exodus doesn\u2019t end. It is long and dangerous, and your goal isn\u2019t treasure or experience points.\nIt\u2019s survival. \nUnique Game Mechanics\nIn The Peasants\u2019 Fell Bargain, we introduced the fell bargain table to help you add diabolical deals with the devil into your own games. Well, we are pulling out all the stops in The Exodus of Wolfbane, beginning with character creation. Your exodus begins with the razing of Wolfbane, so the peasants you play will be drawn from those lucky enough to survive the onslaught of King Haveron\u2019s men.\nAlong the way, you will need to keep up the morale of the survivors, combining creative roleplay with some lucky dice rolling to lift your desperate band\u2019s spirits.\nAnd you will need this same creativity and luck to care for the ailing Shadowforde, maintain your wagons, and find the food and water you need to survive.\nIn other words, surviving the exodus will require courage, ingenuity, and good fortune: all of the qualities that can transform lowly peasants into the stuff of legends.\nJoin the Exodus of Wolfbane, and find out if the road to Stonewater leads to sanctuary or perdition. \nStretch Goals\n$3,000 Some Paint for the Wagon: Gaming Honors Decal.

Magic is mysterious and powerful, monsters are menacing and unpredictable, and Luck matters\u2014A LOT more than min-maxing and statistical analysis.

Als Mitglied des Ordens der Sonnenkreuzes hat euch der Vorsteher des Ordens zur Hilfe gerufen.\nSeitenumfang\nDas eigentliche Abenteuer umfasst 14 Seiten, daran schlie\u00dfen sich noch die Maps an, womit es insgesamt ein 20-seitiges Heft, Gr\u00f6\u00dfe DIN A4 wird.\nSeite aus dem Abenteuer\nLandkarte & Maps\nDie Gebietskarte zeigt die Umgebung, in der das Abenteuer spielt (wie eine Landkarte). Die einzelnen Maps sind daf\u00fcr gedacht, dass die Charaktere mit ihrer Umgebung interagieren, die Spielleitung noch genauer den Ort beschreiben kann und vor allem, dass auf den Maps direkt gespielt werden kann, sei es mit Miniaturen, Papp-Aufstellern,...

Deshalb ist ein Playtest nat\u00fcrlich auch notwendig, was wiederum Zeit kostet, aber letzten Endes der Qualit\u00e4tskontrolle dient.\nZur Erstellung von Karten und Maps nutze ich bew\u00e4hrte Tools.

One day a thunderous howl echoes across the land. \nA flicker\u2026 a shudder. Then. Darkness. \nEven torches threaten to burn out as the creatures of the black Void crawl out to consume all they can catch. \nCan you relight the beacon of salvation before all you know and love is devoured by the crawling dark?\n\nA DCC Funnel Adventure\nCharacter Creation Should Be An Adventure\nA discovery, not a slog.\nSoul for the Ocean Dark is a 0 level funnel adventure designed for the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG system. It is the story of an impossible call to adventure with the highest of stakes: save a world interrupted, or face certain doom. \nPlayers will create characters from a dark and isolated world which has never known a sun. A towering, mystical lighthouse provides the closest thing to natural light for this world. Since time immemorial, it has pushed back against the oppressive darkness of the Void, providing salvation from the endless horrors that await in the dark. Suddenly, the world is plunged into darkness. With the hope of their people on their shoulders, and sputtering torches in their hands, the players must seek the missing light. \nFrom a dark and grim foray through the Fungus Wilds, to consoling a god, to besting a tempest storm \u2013 players must gather all of their wits and resolve to face their destiny. \nJudges, get your players ready for 20+ pages of adventure! \nIn Soul for the Ocean Dark, the archipelago dotting the Shadow Sea is a hidden legend unto itself. Created eons ago by a pair of gods, not everything went according to plan. Even gods have limits, and the growth of this world has long been stilted. The ancient village of Omera\u2019Palissada has always been on a razor\u2019s edge of survival, fishing the dark waters for sustenance under the unfaltering lighthouse of their patron gods.\nAdventure Book Cover\nWith the light suddenly gone, your players must find a way to restore it. They will set forth on a daunting quest to face their gods and return the divine power to the Lighthouse. This will not be easy, as the deep darkness is home to supernatural creatures long kept at bay, eager to take advantage of this sudden boon. The pincers of Giant Crabstosities, the swooping jaws of Boros, the gnashing teeth of Oki \u2013 some of these monsters are driven by hunger, others compelled by divine force. Whatever their motivation, they eagerly await in the shadows.\nFuel your imagination with inset black and white illustrations of the village, the monsters, maps of ancient ruins, island sea charts, and more.\nDon\u2019t Just Write your Backstory\u2026 LIVE your Backstory\nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG is a d20 RPG system that was crafted by Goodman Games as a homage to the earliest editions of D&D. It is a return to combating capricious dice as much as monsters. Players delve into dungeons and exotic locations for treasure and glory.\nDCC has a few unique features which set it apart from D&D. Players start with not one character, but several. The first adventure played is called a \u201cFunnel.\" This is a \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d tale and a time of desperate survival, where life is cheap and only the heroic survive. Depending on the size of the party, each player starts out controlling 2-4 player characters.\nCharacter Generation\nCharacters are generated almost completely by rolls of the dice. This liberates players from the catch-22 of needing to know how to play to build their characters before they play. Characters are not yet heroes, so they are easy to relate to and easier to play.\nHere at The Keep Studios we LOVE funnels as a method of creating characters. It\u2019s a fantastic way for new players to jump in and get straight to the meat of the game. Don\u2019t just write your backstory\u2026 LIVE your backstory! \nYou can learn more about the DCC system at Goodman Games.\nWe have also written a quickstart guide on our website, including some tips for people new to RPGs in general: Starting out with DCC.\nFrancisco Duarte returns with a new adventure!\nFrancisco Duarte is a Portuguese sci-fi and fantasy author, and the creator of The Keep Studios\u2019 first Dungeon Crawl Classics adventure - Sword in Jungle Deep. Francisco lives in Aveiro, Portugal, with his girlfriend, Marta. When he\u2019s not writing he usually enjoys reading and playing RPGs and other tabletop games with his friends. He has written several short stories for tabletop and video games, as well as one sci-fi novella. \nBeing a trained anthropologist, he draws inspiration from myths and cultures from all over the world, meshing them into unique realms that come alive in front of the reader\u2019s eyes. He then creates realistic characters to face the overwhelming odds of surviving in such settings. Not all get to survive, but without some challenge what\u2019s the fun of living?\nMeet our artists\nCover Art and Cartography By Alena Lane\nThe artists from our first book, Sword in the Jungle Deep, return for our second adventure!\nAlena Lane's artwork from Sword in the Jungle Deep\nAlena Lane has already completed the stunning cover art for our book, and will be once again taking the lead on all of the interior maps. Her map for Sword in the Jungle Deep may be one of our favorite pieces.\nWe can't wait to share more of her work with you once it's complete, but for now you can get more of a taste for her art on her Instagram.\nProgression of the cover art of Soul for the Ocean Dark\nLonny Chant Returns as our Interior Illustrator\nWe love his linework and the striking contrasts in his black and white pieces. We can't wait to see his take on our new adventure.\nLonny Chant's Artwork from Sword in the Jungle Deep\nThe PDF\nThe PDF will contain all the content of the print edition in a digital download format. Great for reading on a mobile device while on the go.\nThe Book\nThe book will be a high quality perfect bound adventure module, with glossy cardstock color cover and 20+ pages of high quality paper with crisp black and white text and illustrations. This book will feel nice in your hands, and will be something to be proud of having on your shelf.\nThe Monster and Encounter Cards\nTwo of our stretch goals are to fund the creation of physical artifacts to help you run the game: \"Monster\" and\" Encounter\" cards. The cards are planned to be standard US playing card size with embossed printing to give you the highest quality experience.\nWhen the first goal is reached, the smaller set of Monster Cards will act as handy reference guides for the monsters' stats and appearance. Having a fast, clear and attractive reference during fights will improve the gameplay experience.\nUpon successful funding of the next stretch goal, the Monster Cards would be available as a stand alone set, but would also be folded into a higher tier reward item including all possible encounters; e.g., traps, pitfalls, and natural phenomenon. This \"Encounter Deck\" will allow you to draw cards instead of rolling on tables for the many possible encounters while exploring the world. Let the players draw their own encounters, and survive the fickle fate they have brought on themselves! \nArt Prints\nThese canvas prints will feature the cover art in a high quality wall mountable format. We're working with printers to produce prints ready to be hung on walls as an eye-catching collectible. We have selected a standard 11 x 14 inch format to fit nicely amongst any decor.\nShipping\n\"Early Bird\" Reward Tier\nThis tier includes a book produced for you \u201cAt-Cost.\u201d As normal, you pay your pledge here on Kickstarter, and when your rewards are ready, you will receive a link to finish your order with DriveThruRPG. In this way you will be paying DriveThruRPG directly for the actual printing costs with no mark-up from us! This is part of our \u201cThank you\u201d to our Early Bird backers. Also, your shipping charges will be accurate as you will be able to provide up-to-date shipping information.\n\"The Curious\" and Higher Tiers  \nWe'll send you an email once your rewards are ready, so you can fill in your up-to-date shipping information and pay accurate shipping charges for your goods.\nSee the FAQ section for more details on our approach to shipping.\n \nStretch Goals -  Higher funding means even better rewards \n$1500: UNLOCKED Custom Level 0 Professions - A custom table of professions in the setting of the world for generating characters.\n$2000: UNLOCKED 5e Compatibility - Encounter conversions for playing with the 5e SRD games.\n$3000: UNLOCKED Monster Cards - A card set containing all the monsters encountered in the adventure.

Every so often, we create fantastic story ideas that we burn to share!\nOur First Adventure Book - Sword in the Jungle Deep\nAfter a lot of blood, sweat and tears, we crafted our first adventure, Sword in the Jungle Deep. This taught us a lot about adventure book production, and we\u2019re using this experience to expand our catalog with your help.\nSword in the Jungle Deep was reviewed by the fine folks over at Spellburn, a DCC centered podcast. Here are some of the things they had to say:\n \u201cA really nice classic Appendix N feel\u2026 very Conan wandering around in the jungle, looking for the lost temple... A great classic, old school feel\u2026 Keep \u2018em coming!\u201d \u2013Judge Julian\n\u201cA funnel adventure\u2026 that I think you could run as a first level adventure.\u201d \u2013Judge Julian\n\u201cThe art on the inside is really quite lovely, and I especially like the cartography of the main map, it very much has the DCC vibe\u2026 In terms of content\u2026 it has this really kind of  nice, pulpy, Appendix N vibe to it. .. and what cracked me up\u2026  at the end of every box text, there\u2019s a little TLDR section which I thought was hilarious\u2026  and actually very clever and helpful.. at the table.\u201d Judge Jeff\nThey also had some great constructive feedback that we have considered while developing Soul for the Ocean Dark. You can listen to the episode here. (They review Sword in the Jungle Deep starting at the 13:35 mark.)\nOur Online Community\nThe Keep Studios also fosters an online community via a Discord server and a Twitch channel. We love table top RPG\u2019s, but that\u2019s not all! Our company members and affiliates also enjoy playing and sharing various video games, including retro, indie, and mainstream hits. Naturally, we also stream some of our tabletop campaigns. You can visit our website to learn more about us, and to find links to Discord and Twitch. www.thekeepstudios.com\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat will the Kickstarter funds be used for?\nSimple: Artwork, printing of backer rewards, and writers for stretch goals. The adventure is written, layout is complete, and the artists are at the ready to complete the original illustrations.\nFunds will be set aside to print all of the backer rewards. We plan to use DriveThruRPG's fulfillment services, meaning we can print our small-run books with lower overhead and ship them reliably all with less cost to you.  \nA sizeable allocation of funds is also necessary to pay our contracted artists and writers. We have a good working relationship with our artists and writers, and they have always astonished us with their results.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019re big fans of Kickstarter both as consumers and publishers. Heck, some of our favorite projects such as Mutant Crawl Classics, Numenera and Strongholds and Followers were kick-started. Inspired by these examples. we have decided to follow in the footsteps of giants.\n\nCan I use this for my level 1 party?\nYES! We've made sure to include \"Hooks for Established Parties\" right in the book's introduction section.\n\nWhat if I play D&D or another 5e SRD compatible game and not DCC?\nOne of our lower level stretch goals is to add in a supplement to make 5e SRD compatible versions of all the encounters. We've already written a free guide on using any DCC funnel (especially this one!) to transform character creation itself into an adventure within the 5e rules. Read about it here!\n\nWhy are you invoicing shipping separately?\nShipping is always tricky business when it comes to Kickstarter, and many projects have failed by not properly taking care of shipping expenses. Often, backers have a change of address before a project\u2019s rewards are complete. In those situations, we wouldn\u2019t want to overcharge a backer for shipping, or have to bill backers for small discrepancies in actual shipping costs. For small changes we would feel compelled to eat the cost, and small changes can add up to a lot on our end. \nKickstarter campaigns can elect to include collecting shipping funds, but did you know that counts towards your total pledge? This can artificially inflate goal completion, making it appear that we have more raw capital to work with than we really do. We could try to estimate shipping costs, and increase our goal amount accordingly, but an estimate is an estimate, and that means that it's much harder for us to give our backers a genuine view of what we really need to fund our rewards.\nTo avoid all this we're separating shipping funds entirely. We'll send you an email once your rewards are ready, so you can fill in your up to date shipping information and pay accurate shipping charges for your goods.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve already published our first adventure book, and at this stage of development in our second adventure book, the risks are low. However when dealing with any kind of custom creation, setbacks can occur.\n\nPrinting and Shipping: As mentioned earlier, we plan to use DriveThruRPG\u2019s fulfillment services. DrivethruRPG is a reliable service that serves thousands of publishers with an excellent track record. However DriveThruRPG is separate from ourselves, and so if they face delays for any reason, so would we. The total demand we place on them is also contingent on the amount of rewards we need to fulfill, including possible successful stretch goals. Though we\u2019ve always had good results from DrivethruRPG, we cannot be sure how long a large print run would take, as we have yet to use them for backer reward fulfillment. For backup, we have established contact with a local print house. In this case, we would ship US orders from our home base, and we should also be able to ship to the EU via an agent in Portugal.\n\nArtist Timelines: Our artists are trusted and reliable external contractors, which works well for us in that we only need to call on them when the other parts of our project are ready to integrate with the artwork. Naturally any contract work means we have to negotiate with a freelancer\u2019s timeline. We have reasonable assurances that they will be able to complete their work, and we also have backup artists on the line just in case a personal emergency or some other interruption should occur. Any of these scenarios would not cause the project to fail, however, as we always pay upon receiving the artwork, so in this way no backer funds would be lost.\n\nLong story short, our anticipated possible road bumps would be delays, not outright failures. In any event, we would keep our backers informed regularly through our \u201cUpdates\u201d page.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Fan", "descp": "Get A Personalized Thank You Message From Us!\nINCLUDES:\nA Personalized Thank You Message", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Merchant", "descp": "This tier is for retailers who can provide proof of re-seller status.

Swords and Sorcery and Metal Gods. Danger, treasure, blood and glory all mixed in a blender and served up in golden Ur-Hadad, the First City of Ore. Enter, if you dare, the bitchin' mural on the side of your cousin's Ford custom van. Enter the world of the Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad.\"\nBack in 2012, those words, written by the Rev. Dr. Edgar Johnson, ignited a fire that would set the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG community ablaze. First, it was a rallying cry that assembled the greatest group of gamers I've ever been privileged to game with. Then, in 2014 through 2015, it became a sort of mission statement for the zine that would bear the name of that gaming group, the Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad. The Metal Gods zine was a fire that burned brightly for three issues, then that fire dimmed and has been a brightly-glowing ember these past four years. \nThe time to reignite the fire is now!\nThis year, just in time for Kickstarter's ZineQuest, the original creative team behind the Metal Gods zine (Wayne Snyder, Edgar Johnson & Adam Muszkiewicz) are getting the band back together for three fantastic new issues. We'll be collaborating with some of our favorite people in gaming, artists and writers alike, to not just bring back the Metal Gods, but to up the ante. Here's what's in store for you:\nIssue #4: Time of Crisis!\nLike any other multiversal hyper-megalopolis, Ur-Hadad is no stranger to calamity. In fact, crisis is one of the First City's defining features! This issue provides a whole slew of tools for Judges to use to spin up their campaigns from small adventures into city-wide, culture-shaking phenomena! Including profiles of Ur-Hadad's most notorious crises and their causes (along with special rules introduced by each) and a Crisis Generator, this issue is all about turning your game up to 11!\nThis issue is almost completely written and will be ready for art & layout soon. It'll be 32 pages long and feature art from Tristan Bell and Diogo Nogueira among others.\nDiogo's centerpiece illustration for issue #4\nIssue #5: Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad\nFirst, we gave you Street Kids of Ur-Hadad. Then we gave you The Heist! Metal Gods has always focused on urban adventures and now we're taking them one step beyond! In Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad, we'll present a system for running a thieves guild, assassins coven, coterie of smugglers or however your criminal taste run. This unique system builds on some trends already out there in the greater DCC-o-sphere, bringing them together in a tight, cohesive package. You'll also get to know the seedy underbelly of the First City, including profiles on some of her most notorious gangs. \nThis issue is currently in playtesting and is expected to be finished by mid-Summer and Doug Kovacs has signed on to do the cover! We've also got Evlyn Moreau doing this issue's centerpiece illustration and it looks like this issue is on track to reach 32 pages. \nDoug Kovacs's cover for issue #5\nIssue #6: Mysterious Gods of Ur-Hadad\nFrom the Avenue of One Thousand Gods to the Gloaming Deeps beneath the city's docks, cults and mystery faiths permeate Hadadi society. In this issue, we'll explore some of the First City's stranger religions and sects, from the austere followers of the God of Blackened Skies to the debaucherous Last Adherents of the Sensate, we'll profile these bizarre faiths and how to use them in your game. We'll also include rules to integrate cults into your Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad game, whether as foes or as your PCs' crew!\nThis issue is currently in playtesting and is expected to be finished by mid-Autumn. It will feature cover and centerpiece illustrations by Luka Rejec! Other artists include Tristan Bell, Craig Brasco and of course our own Wayne Snyder. \nWhat's Different This Time Around?\nA bunch of stuff is different. First, we have a plan. The first time around, we did stuff when we wanted to, but didn't have a clear vision of where we were going. We do now. \nAlso, we're expanding our circle of collaborators. Previously, Wayne had done all of the art for every issue of Metal Gods, but this time around, we're going to be hiring some artists who'll be contributing illustrations through out all three issues we're funding. The funding for some of these artists is baked into our initial ask, but some are reserved for Stretch Goals (see below) because of how much their contributions will add to the final package. Having more artists involved will certainly increase our turn-around time, something I'm sure our fans are looking forward to. \nWe're also upping our production game here. We're bringing the page count of each issue up to 28 pages from 24, and there's a chance that #5 & #6 will surpass that. We've had a bunch of little ideas on how to increase the quality of the zines out of the gate, and this Kickstarter will allow us the opportunity to explore some of those and we'll be filling you in when they become a reality. \nStretchgoals\nIf we surpass our initial funding goals, we have some great plans for making the zines even better. \nSo far, we've crushed the following goals:\n$1,400 - Luka Rejec of Wizard, Thief, Fighter will do the cover to Issue #6!\n$1,650 - Luka will also do a full-spread centerpiece illustration for Issue #6 \n$2,000 - We bring in the fantastic Craig Brasco for more art for all three issues\n$2,250 - Every physical reward tier (all of them but the digital tiers) will include a Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad vinyl sticker\nThere were even some goals I didn't even have a chance to post before you all smashed them! At $2,500, you unlocked a new centerpiece illustration for Issue #4 by none other than the Metal Gods' own Diogo Nogueira! We've also unlocked some more  vinyl stickers,  one themed after each of the new issues (four stickers in total!). There's also a super-secret hidden Stretchgoal known only to Wayne and myself. We'll tell you when it's unlocked because it's just too awesome to even hint at.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIssue #4 is almost finished being written and will happen anyway, so our biggest challenges are slow-downs at the development or writing stages for Issues #5 & 6. Art could also slow the process down, but that's one of the reasons that we're doing this Kickstarter, to be able to spread the work out over more artists than normal. Basically, we see the completion of the products as inevitable, but there are few places where things could slow down a bit.

The catch?  Each player is a unique voice in one man's head. \nUPDATE - NEW ADD-ON!\nThe Old and The New\nIn the early 2000's, an indie RPG called Everyone is John began making its way across the convention circuit.  It was strange, unique, and a ton of fun.  You could play it with scratch paper and a couple of six-sided dice. Slowly, surely - this quick-hit RPG became a genuine cult-classic.\nWe are proud to bring you this new edition of that cult-classic RPG with over 40 pages of new material an extra content!  The game has been heavily expanded with enhanced rules refined through hundreds of hours of playtesting to provide the best game experience, ready-to-use character and GM sheets, original art, gameplay examples, and numerous adventure seeds to entice players and game masters.  \nAdditionally, the book expands the world of Everyone is John with sections on running an adventure in worlds of Fantasy, Science Fiction, Horror, and other settings - with detailed rules for each, such as letting John cast magical spells, use super-heroic powers, or deal with mind-altering attacks on his sanity!\nThe Game\nEveryone is John is a fast and fun competitive RPG where each player assumes the identity of a \"Voice\" inside the head of John - a man with no real identity of his own. John's actions, skills, knowledge, and goals change constantly as the voices in his head vie for control of him by using their own finite willpower. Each voice will struggle to achieve their own obsessive goals before all Willpower is gone and the game is over - with only one Voice left as the victor. \nEveryone is John is a fast, fun game that lets players create their Voices in just a few minutes, and begin play right away.    It's the ultimate pickup RPG. But you know what? We can tell you all this... but we'd rather just show you...\nOur Pledge for Your Pledge\nYou see, this book is already fully written and ready to send to the publisher.  And when you back this kickstarter at our $5 level or above, we will immediately share with you a digital copy of the core rules.

But these entities are also shrewd opportunists. Many of them see humans as a resource to be harvested, corrupted or enlisted for their dark plots. Humanity, with all its noble aspirations, has many flaws. Greed, lust, envy, hatred and fear are ripe fruits for these forces to exploit. Division and separation makes the humans easier to control. While the best of humankind fights for just laws and civilization, those who cling to power and privilege stand ready to quash protections for those who need them most. In the shadows of human injustice lurk loathsome, inhuman entities. As investigators square off against the worst aspects of mankind, they also find themselves entangled with the parasitic powers of the Mythos.\nWelcome to An Inner Darkness, from Golden Goblin Press.  \nThis is collection of Classic 1920\u2019s era scenarios of 7th edition the Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game (published by Chaosium, Inc) with several goals in mind. We hope to present well researched, historically accurate and challenging adventures, with a slightly darker, harsher and more brutal tone than our fans might be used to. For Golden Goblin Press, this will be a more mature book, one focused on adult themes, designed to spark deep conversations among your players for years to come.  \nThese scenarios will of course feature the malignant taint of the Cthulhu Mythos, but at the forefront of each will be one or more examples of social injustice, societal corruption, and mankind\u2019s inhumanity to man. The 1920\u2019s was a period of great social upheaval in America, when the borders between classes, races, and genders were changed. In this time of social upheaval and chaos, eldritch forces found fertile ground to exploit us. Mankind is never so vulnerable than when we are divided from within. \nWhen this Lousy War is Over, by Brian M. Sammons \u2013 Arkham, Massachusetts, 1923. At the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars association, men who fought in the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d gather together, seeking a bit of solace from those who\u2019ve shared similar experiences. Many are wounded in body, in mind, and in spirit. Many suffer from horrifying nightmares, violent outbursts, disfiguring injuries, or alcoholism, but their pain and struggles are mostly ignored by society. They are reminded that the war is over, and told to just \u201cget over it\u201d by a public who finds it all too easy to judge. Then, chapter members start to mysteriously die in violent and terrible ways, with clues pointing to the occult, possibly involving a member of the association no less! Can the investigators find those responsible and stop them, before it\u2019s too late?\nThey Are From Away, by Charles Gerard - Bangor, Maine, 1923. Maine has become a major battleground for the Ku Klux Klan. Protestant nativists have grown fearful about the recent influx of Catholic Immigrants, mostly Irish and French-Canadians. This provides the KKK with fertile ground for spreading their message of hate, division, and violence. Enter Eugene Farnsworth, a charismatic former stage magician, hypnotist and filmmaker, now known as King Kleagle, the head KKK recruiter for Maine. He hosts \u201cwholesome\u201d public events while spearheading an aggressive recruitment drive, making alliances with area politicians and heads of industry. Meanwhile, macabre, inexplicable and unnatural events begin to occur, aimed at humiliating and terrorizing the area\u2019s Catholic citizens. Investigators must discover if there is a link between the two, and find a way to stop it if they can. \n\nFire Without Light, by Helen Gould - Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1922. Less than a year has passed since the Tulsa Race Massacre, when the wealthiest black community in the United States was destroyed and hundreds of innocent people were murdered by rampaging white mobs. Though most of the 10,000 black residents left Tulsa, some remained to rebuild their devastated community. Now tensions are on the rise once again. A new pastor and his wife have arrived, preaching hate and violence to the white population. Their congregation is growing at an alarming rate, and violence is spilling out from their church and into the streets. Strangely, even families and friends of the same race are turning against each other. Something very wrong is going on here. Investigators must tread carefully to discover just who - or what - is fanning the flames, pushing the citizens of Tulsa towards another wave of catastrophic violence.  \nA Fresh Coat Of White Paint, by Jeff Moeller - Los Angeles, California, 1931. Early in the Great Depression, the U.S. institutes its first mass deportation policy, supported by a cross-section of interests such as racist nationalists, eugenicists, paternalistic \"charities\", and labor unions \"looking out for their own.\" This leads to a roundup of thousands of ethnically Mexican families, many of them U.S. citizens, carried out federal employees, local police, various \"charities\", and outright vigilante groups. The deportees were (sometimes) given summary hearings, detained in makeshift conditions, and then loaded onto trains. On the outskirts of Los Angeles, one such \"charity\" is refurbishing an old prison to \"give the unfortunates somewhere to stay.\" However, this long abandoned facility has a dark past, which is quickly becoming a horrible, otherworldly nightmare for those interred there. Can the investigators get to the bottom of things in time to save the prisoners?  \n A Family Way, by Oscar Rios \u2013 New York, New York, 1925. The investigators must come to the aid of a dear friend, a student at Columbia University. She\u2019s found herself \"in trouble\" after what should have been a harmless girls' night out. Her group ended up drinking and dancing with the wrong sort of fellas, the kind willing to slip them a mickey and take what they wanted from their unconscious victims. Now the girls need help, as the authorities won't act, or even take their stories seriously. These men have deep pockets, powerful allies, and dark secrets. When the men return with offers of marriage and gifts of strange, pale gold jewelry, it becomes clear they aren't the sort to take no for an answer. There aren\u2019t many options for girls in their \u201ccondition\u201d, and one of the few happens to be illegal. But your friend just wants this nightmare to be over, if such a thing is still even possible.   \nDreams of Silk, by Christopher Smith Adair \u2013 Pennsylvania, 1922. The cosmetics industry is growing fast, as the public\u2019s obsession with youth and beauty grows. As profits soar and businesses expand workers at such companies suffer due to lax regulations and poor conditions. At Hempstead Cosmetics, located in Brights Mill, Pennsylvania, a state infamous among labor advocates, conditions are especially bad. Local government turns a blind eye to protect their economic boom, ignoring any indiscretions or complaints against chemist and owner Mervyn Hempstead. Consumers marvel at their newest skin cream, promising to give a complexion as smooth as dreams of silk, and the youthful glow of Imelda Hempstead, Mervyn\u2019s wife and chief model.  Meanwhile, his employee\u2019s bodies and minds deteriorate and their complaints of rashes and troubled sleep are ignored.  But things are much worse than anyone can possibly imagine, as they are drawn into a web of literal nightmares as unspeakable horrors from beyond our reality are tied to Hempstead Cosmetics' \u201cmiraculous\u201d secret ingredients.  \nWe have some wonderful authors, editors, artists, cartographers, and designers who are already hard at work on this project. They are: \nBrian M. Sammons - is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and Golden Goblin Press. He has penned stories that have appeared in a number of publications and has edited the books Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, Edge of Sundown, Steampunk Cthulhu, Dark Rites of Cthulhu, Atomic Age Cthulhu, World War Cthulhu, Flesh Like Smoke, Return of the Old Ones, Children of Gla\u2019aki, Dread Shadows in Paradise, and more. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Strange Aeons II, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.\nWhy \"When this Lousy War is Over\"\u2013 War and horror and the horrors of war have always fascinated. Just see a fiction anthology I did called World War Cthulhu for proof. Or a Call of Cthulhu scenario I did for Strange Aeons II set in another forgotten war, Korea. And make no mistake, The Great War is largely forgotten today as are some of the barbaric treatments and practices used to patch up those mutilated by it in both body and mind. As for veterans, they have always been forgotten. For a country that seems so proud of its military might, the way America treats those who fought after the fight is over is just disgraceful. So I wanted to tell a tale of brave men, damaged men, marginalized and purposely forgotten men having to face the horrors of the everyday, and those from beyond, too.   \nBrian Sammons\nCharles Gerard - is a Franco-American Mainer, writer and journalist based in New York City. Relentless curiosity is both his superpower and his fatal flaw. In the tabletop gaming realm, he has published work with Sentinel Hill Press, Cubicle 7, and the Dungeon Masters Guild, and has a scenario in Golden Goblin Press\u2019 forthcoming Invictus scenario book, No Faith in Appearances. He is a co-host of the Miskatonic University Podcast, as Keeper Chad.\n  Why \"They Are From Away\" - I wrote \"They Are From Away\" to shed light on the intractable, repeating history of nativism, xenophobia, and bigotry against religious and ethnic groups. In this scenario, I am proud and honored to explore the heritage of my francophone, working-class grandparents and forebearers in my home state of Maine. They toiled as low-wage woodcutters, builders and mill workers during a time of great prosperity for the timber and manufacturing industries. But the French-speaking residents of Maine, along with other immigrant groups, faced discrimination, harassment, and humiliation by those who feared newcomers might upset a social order tilted heavily in their favor. That time in Maine\u2019s history, with charlatans whipping up conspiracy theories, distrust, and intolerance of outsiders, strikes me as a crucial reminder that monsters of inhumanity thrive on forgetfulness, and they never truly sleep.    \nCharles Gerard\nHelen Gould - is a black British writer and editor focusing on poetry, horror, and tabletop roleplaying. She's contributed to games from Black Armada; Rowan, Rook and Decard; Stygian Fox; and Graham Walmsley's Cthuhlu Dark. You can also listen to her playing Pathfinder over on The Rusty Quill gaming podcast.\n\nWhy \"Fire Without Light\" - I wrote this to explore the culpability of white women and the middle class in propagating racism. Too often, the image that people hold of a racist is an angry, working class white man, when the reality is that it is just as likely to be a well-spoken professional white woman or an educated white male professor. The scenario is also a response to the prevailing notion of racism as something done by people who don't know any better or who didn't really mean it. They do mean it, and the infantilising assumption that racism is an accident is incredibly dangerous.   \nHelen Gould\n Jeffrey Moeller - Is a cis-male, middle-aged Caucasian father of five who lives in Cleveland but considers Alaska home. He is the author of dozens of published Call of Cthulhu scenarios, is a frequent Golden Goblin Press contributor, and won a 2017 ENNIE for The Things We Leave Behind, along with Oscar and Brian.\nWhy \"A Fresh Coat of White Paint\" - If you want to blame someone for this collection, blame me; I pushed for it. My day job is immigration attorney, and I've represented detained immigrants before. Originally this was going to be set in the modern day, in a children's detention camp (administered as is often the case by a \"charity\") along the Mexican border. Oscar asked me to set it in the Classic era, and I was horrified to read about what went on in 1907 and 1931 Los Angeles, with itinerant populations, forced labor and the Mexican \"repatriation\". People think of California as a bastion of liberalism today, so a history lesson seemed in order.   \nJeffery Moeller\n Oscar Rios \u2013 This native New Yorker and Hispanic-American cosmic horror writer is the author of more than ninety scenarios for Call of Cthulhu, including the campaigns Ripples from Carcosa and The Legacy of Arrius Lurco. He is also the President of Chaosium licensee, Golden Goblin Press.\nWhy \u201cA Family Way\u201d \u2013 I wrote this scenario back in 2007, and have only run it a handful of times. I wanted to explore something truly horrific, namely rape, its aftermath, and the terrible choice a woman faces should a pregnancy result from the attack. Compound that horror with others taking that choice away from the victim, and the health and legal risks involved with getting an abortion in the 1920\u2019s, and you find yourself in a very dark, very real place. I swore I\u2019d never publish \u201cA Family Way\u201d, because I was afraid. There were arsonist attacks in Austin and Virginia Beach on women\u2019s health clinics about the time I wrote this. I am ashamed, and the telling of this tale is long overdue.   \nOscar Rios\n\nChristopher Smith Adair \u2013 Christopher has written numerous scenarios and articles for Call of Cthulhu, both for Chaosium and a number of its licensees. This includes the upcoming Pulp Cthulhu campaign A Cold Fire Within. They are currently tinkering away on their own game-design ideas in what spare time remains.\n  Why \u201cLike Dreams of Silk\u201d \u2013 Work takes up an enormous part of our lives. It affects everything. Often, we do it simply for our survival and that of our loved ones, hoping that our sacrifice results in better days. Some are privileged to do something they love or that is meaningful. But too often the work we do to live is itself detrimental to our well-being. The history of labor is full of horror stories, and that continues to this day. The \u201cworkplace horror\u201d sub-genre hasn\u2019t been explored as much as it could be in fiction and, especially, roleplaying games. And while this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve touched on this subject, I\u2019ve been looking for the right opportunity to make it the centerpiece. \nChristopher Smith Adair\nMark Shireman  -  is a graphic design professional (and secret cultist of Nyarlathotep) with over 29 years of experience, and is currently GGP's acting Director of Design. He has also been a part of the Cthulhu LARP community, as well as the well-regarded TerrorWerks events held at Origins and Gen Con in years past. He has been covertly encoding summoning glyphs and sigils into his work, spreading the influence of the Crawling Chaos for nigh on two decades now, and his success is evidenced by the increasingly unstable reality of recent years. Feel free to visit his portfolio at http://www.markshireman.org to get a glimpse of his work.   \nMark Shireman\nReuben Dodd \u2013 Reuben has been illustrating roleplaying games off and on again since 2005. At first, it was mainly on fantasy games, but since 2010 he has worked almost exclusively on Lovecraftian horror games, the bulk of which has been for Golden Goblin Press but also for some other publishers including Chaosium Inc., Miskatonic River Press and Stygian Fox Publishing. Illustrating Cthulhu Mythos themed RPGs has given Reuben the chance to indulge his artistic dark side and pay tribute to Weird fiction and horror imagery. Something that he is incredibly grateful for.\nReuben Dodd\nGregory Shipp - Hello! My name is Greg and I make maps.

Now members of the Secret Court are being found gruesomely murdered inside a fairy ring at an old red cider mill on the Miskatonic River.

MSPE (as it came to be known) allowed players to run rpg adventures from the 1800's all the way to the modern era, ranging from Victorian steampunk, and crime noir, to super spy thrilllers in the cold war. Michael Stackpole wrote the MSPE role playing game, using the Tunnels & Trolls framework as a jumping off point. \nIn 1986, Flying Buffalo took a hit from an unrelated disaster, and sold the rights of MSPE to Sleuth Publications. They came out with an edition that had a black & white cover, and they left out a few things that Buffalo had included, and inserted a few new things that weren't in the Buffalo edition. The last existing copies of the Sleuth edition have sold out, so now Flying Buffalo is printing a third (Combined Edition of MSPE) which includes all the material that was in both editions! \nThe Combined Edition: What's in it? The new edition will contain all the original text and art from the Flying Buffalo and Sleuth editions.  From the Buffalo edition, we will use the amazing painted cover and will include the Tunnels & Thompsons section (which was not in the Sleuth edition) along with some missing art. We have also made various corrections to the rules text that have been found by players and fans over the years.\nRestored and enhanced covers and the Tunnels & Thompsons section\nThe Sleuth edition had several extra sections at the end of the rules that are not in the Buffalo edition. These include optional rules on aging; 13 fully described statted Non-Player characters (including Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty - illustrated by Liz Danforth) and a special folding version of the MSPE Character sheet. All of these will be added to the Combined Edition. \nPLUS New material: On top of that, we are also going to add some new information on using MSPE in sci-fi environments and info on stopping distances for vehicles. All newly illustrated by Steve Crompton. We just might also add a few other rule enhancements based on the response to this Kickstarter.\nPlus sample characters/portraits, and additional material added to the Combined Edition!\nWe will be including all of this in the Combined Edition - (Along with  possibly a few other surprises!)  The rules will  be printed as a trade paperback 8 x 11, (or as a hardback) and for a little extra you can even get your copy of the rules signed by Michael Stackpole. (see details in the pledge levels)\nIf you are a Tunnels & Trolls player you should get this book to see how T&T evolved to allow for guns, grenades, cars, planes and tech skills. And you can easily adapt the MSPE rules for use with your T&T characters and campaigns. Trolls with grenade launchers? Elves with machine guns? Why not!)\nADD ONS: Here are some extras you can add to your pledge!\n Stormhaven printed -  $6 (note if you are buying a hardcover you get 1 free copy)\n Stormhaven PDF -  $5  \n  Add your name to the book - $10 if you are buying a hardcover book\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper printed - $9 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper PDF - $3 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Jade Jaguar solo printed  - $6 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\n Jade Jaguar solo PDF  - $2 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\nGM Screen printed - $7\nGM Screen PDF  - $3\nTo purchase add-ons, just add the price listed above of any item you want to the your pledge total.

Also if you buy printed copies of any books you will also get a FREE copy of the PDF.\nOTHER INFO ABOUT THIS PROJECT:\nWe've already scanned and restored all the pages of the rules and the book is ready to go to press. All we need to do is add the page of backer names, scan Stormhaven and Jade Jaguar and give them to the printer.  So there really should not be much delay. \nPledge today and help bring this classic piece of RPG history back to life again! \n Final (probably) stretch goal:  If we make $25,000 we will make a poster of the original cover art for the book, and send one free poster to everyone who has requested a physical copy of the rulebook!  If you only requested pdfs, you can get a poster by adding $10 for postage to your pledge.  If you want more than one poster, add $5 for each additional.\nWhere does the money go? Almost half goes to the printer to print 1000 copies. another share goes towards production (scanning, restoration, new material added to the book, new art and pre-press) About 5% goes to kickstarter ($500), 5% more goes to the credit card company and we expect to have to ship around 300 copies at $4 each for postage and packaging. The rest goes to cover any expenses I've forgotten about, or unexpected expenses, and if there is any left over I might get to keep some. \nKickstarter doesn't let you support with more than one reward. So if you want extras, just add extra money as below to your pledge: for each extra copy of the book, add $16. Fpr each extra signed copy of the book, add $25. When I send out the survey I'll ask you for what you wanted. You can also select other items when you answer the survey.\nUS Backers note: postage is included for USA backers.\nAlso note: nothing from this project is limited edition, so if you want something, but cannot afford it right now, just tell me when you answer the survey. You can send the extra funds later by credit card or by paypal. We will work with you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is written, edited and laid out. All we need now is the money.

It\u2019s 52 pages long (with 5 unlocked bonus map stretch goals included). Inside you\u2019ll find:\n\u00b7 10 'adventure-on-a-page' one-shot adventures of all varieties - murder, dungeon crawls, heists, breakouts, sieges, love stories - complete with additional DM and player maps! These adventures are fully playtested, for PCs of 1st - 5th level and are designed for minimal preparation and flexible delivery. Each adventure can be run as a \u2018fill-in\u2019 for 1-2 gaming sessions (3-4 hours per session) or played as a mini-campaign. Over 50 hours of gaming content!   \n\u00b7 12 New monsters! 4 new magic items! \n\u00b7 Hints on the art of improvisation to bring your NPCs and adventures alive\n\u00b7 Random tables - for names, motivations, room dressing and special items to add additional nuance to your adventures \n\u00b7 Verona City - a city for adventurers to use as a base \n\u00b7 Verona Province - a region for players to explore, complete with every location used in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES\nAll the major work is done\u2014writing, playtesting, layout, editing, proof reading\u2014completed! Now that we've achieved all the stretch goals, the stretch goal bonus maps and adventure seeds have been drawn and added. The digital maps package has also now been compiled. All that's needed is to add backer names to the PDF and send off the print proof (which can take 4-6 weeks to be approved - not my delay, my friends), which will happen as soon as the Kickstarter ends and Kickstarter sends me the list of backer names. Then a few adjustments to the print PDF to make it a Tablet/Electronic book PDF (such as removing the print gutter and inserting front and back cover) and voila! All done.\nHere are a some examples of completed pages:\nDesigned to be concise, easily accessible and quick to prepare, these adventures include flexible sandbox-style and structured storylines - something for every style of DM. The 'adventure-on-a-page' format means you get an entire adventure with an intriguing storyline, maps, NPCs and monsters, with plenty of meat to get your teeth into, but with enough 'space' to allow you to incorporate improvisation based on your players' decisions.   \nThere is a huge variety of adventures in this package\u2014murder mystery, dungeon crawls, heist, siege, investigation, bizarre love, puzzles\u2014something for all your players, whether they prefer role playing, hack-and-slash or brain-teasing intrigue! You can run them as one-shots that slot easily into your existing campaign, or as a mini-campaign taking PCs from 1st - 5th level, using your own setting or the one provided in the book. \nI love mystery, conspiracies and double-crosses! These adventures feature lots of that, as well as interesting moral quandaries for players. Would you defend a group of murderers? Have the monsters been framed or should they be exterminated? Do you eliminate the opposition in order to win the prize, or do you work with them? Do the ends justify the means? All is not as it seems\u2026 There\u2019s enough intrigue and suspense in each adventure to keep your players excited and engaged for many hours of gameplay!\nCheck out these teasers for each of the adventures included in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES: \nThere\u2019s more than just adventures in this lovely little tome.\n\u00b7 New Monsters and magic items! Humanoids like the despairingly ugly Grov\u2019l, the vicious, partying Barfs, the psionic spider-like Sholix, and new magic items like Seeds of Growth and the Dagger of Defence. Plus, I've used some interesting beasties from Kobold's wonderful Tome of Beasts, like the Angler Worm and Clockwork Beetle. \n\u00b7 City campaign setting! Verona City, also known as the City of Canals and the City of Bridges, due to its extensive magically-carved canal network. Why has the Duke not been seen in years? Is the Mages\u2019 Guild the source of the magical Haze drug causing townspeople to hallucinate and see ghosts in the city streets? The war between the Thieves\u2019 Guild and the Dockers\u2019 Union over the city\u2019s illicit trades is coming to a head! The Council of Six argue amongst themselves while worshippers of the Death Cult of Asgarte infiltrate Verona\u2026 Verona City is a broad, brush stroke setting with adventure seeds, that is easily expandable and the location of several SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES.         \n\u00b7 Regional campaign setting! Verona Province lies on the edge of the empire. To the north, an uneasy truce with the warring Skandarans, to the west Orc raiders in their longships ravage the coast and monster hordes spew forth from the Break in the World. To the south the great dragon Antraxus roams freely through wastelands, threatening to break the fragile peace negotiated with the Council of Six. And the slave trading Sherviath Elves plot with the dark gods to bring the empire to its knees\u2026 Complete with adventure seeds, Verona Province is a broad, brush stroke setting that is easily expandable and includes each of the adventure locations used in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES.   \n\u00b7 Random Tables! 5 tables with NPC/PC names, backgrounds and motivations, adventure introductions and locations, special curiosities PCs can find along the way and interesting room dressing items. Need a way to introduce the characters to an adventure and at a loss for ideas? Roll on the Random Adventure Introductions table. The coach they\u2019re travelling on is ambushed by Orcs! An NPC passenger is especially impressed with how the PCs handled themselves during the battle and suggests an interesting job\u2026         \n\u00b7 An article on the art of improvisation in games! Not used to improvising in your games? Locked into linear storytelling with fixed outcomes? Time to break the mold and let the game take on new life as you work with your players to create an evolving story based around improvisation and saying \u2018yes\u2019.  \n\u00b7 A section on using these adventures with OSR games!

The book will look great on your bookshelf and in play! \nIf this campaign is successful, I\u2019ll be following it up with:\n\u00b7 SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES 2 \u2013 10 adventures for character levels 6th \u2013 10th. \n\u00b7 THE BLACK MERIDIAN \u2013 a mini-campaign for high level characters 12th \u2013 14th, set in the Verona Province, the Shotglass Adventures campaign setting.\nSo, please help me to help you!

I have a semi-regular column called Laidback DM on my website, stevestillstanding.com, where I post free maps, hints and suggestions on DMing, and 5e game aids. Last year I decided to write a number of 'adventures-on-a-page', using Adobe InDesign to create professional layouts, started playtesting them with two separate playtest groups and created additional content to support busy DMs who have minimal preparation time\u2014these became SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES! This project has been a labour of love for me.

Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control.

Massive and sincere thanks to everyone for the massive support and enthusiasm that's been shown so far. Not only has the campaign been fully funded, but every stretch goal has been met, assuring that Grey Cells will support not only modern mysteries, but also Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian mysteries! If you'd like to learn more about the game, here are some additional places to look!\nYou can find the Google Drive folder containing the case files and all profile cards related to the case by following this link.\nIf you'd like to see Grey Cells in action, you can see me playing Death of a Survivor with backers in this video.\nI was also a guest on Professor Jimbles' Dicebag Podcast and Professional Goblins to talk about Grey Cells, including its past, its design principles and its future!\nGrey Cells is a game of unravelling mysteries. It\u2019s about stepping into a dark morass of crime and deceit, and piecing together nuggets of truth into a full picture of what really happened. Players take the roles of investigators of all stripes - policemen and detectives, reporters, scientists, socialites and criminals (reformed or otherwise).\nEvery character wields powerful tools to shake loose information from the world. When making deductions, some character abilities can build on the information you\u2019ve gathered to help you connect the pieces more clearly. This makes it much less likely that players become stuck without recourse.\nAnd once you have that information you can start making deductions yourself, or you can have your character help you. Several character abilities assist in interpreting evidence, and can help put your deductions on the right track. They\u2019ll never solve the case for you, but they allow you to utilise your character\u2019s experience in the field to aid in the deductive process, should you need it.\nThe game emulates your favourite crime fiction genres, whether that be a civil and proper Cozy mystery such as a Hercule Poirot adventure, a hard-boiled detective flick like The Big Sleep, and more! It also provides advice on how to make your game feel the way you want.\nGrey Cells is a race, and the villain is already a step ahead. They have their own agenda - the thief escapes with their prize, the hacker erases their tracks, the killer stalks their next victim. Take too long to catch them, and they could be long gone.\nCases can involve a lot of dialogue with non-player characters, be they witnesses, suspects or even friends and allies brought into the world by the players themselves. However, Grey Cells doesn\u2019t have a Charisma stat to help you convince and manipulate them. Instead, how well you can persuade or intimidate someone depends on how much you know about them. Discover what they want, what they fear, and what their dirty secrets are and you\u2019ll have them talking in no time.\nThis creates a more thematic experience - people won\u2019t cave until you have something to press them with. Also, since success is dependent on something that\u2019s not on your character sheet, each player\u2019s voice is equally powerful; you don\u2019t have to stand aside while the persuasive character does all the talking.\nWriting mysteries can be tremendously challenging, especially for a roleplaying environment. This is why the game includes tools to help gamemasters weave their own mysteries, expanding and connecting elements of the story until they have a full web of mystery. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need to lay every piece of the puzzle beforehand - the same mechanics that help keep the investigation\u2019s momentum going also help the gamemaster create clues during the course of play.\nCrafting a compelling case still requires more preparation than many other types of roleplaying adventure, but it\u2019s one of Grey Cells\u2019 goals to make the process as smooth and effective as possible.\n- 83 pages of content\n- Basic rules of play\n- Guidance on how to play in different genres: Great Detective, Cozy, Hard-Boiled, Police Procedural and Thriller\n- Six unique backgrounds for player characters: The Beat Cop, The Crook, The Detective, The Reporter, The Scientist and The Socialite\n- Special actions to uncover new information, engage in combat, and more\n- Rules for adding permanent new characters to the game in the form of Contacts\n- Rules for Exploits: Special advantages representing your investigator\u2019s strengths\n- Rules for Momentum Powers: Potent abilities to make breakthroughs in the case, and other special effects\n- Extensive guidance on how to create and run a mystery adventure\n- Rules for making custom backgrounds\nThe core rules of the game are already complete. The game is playable, and in terms of rules all that remains is to tweak and perfect them. This will require more playtest sessions to find weaknesses in the design and improve the systems and verbiage used in the rules.\nThe zine will require numerous art assets. Of these, the most important will be character designs to represent the six character backgrounds available to the players. They will reflect not only the background but also an associated genre. These character concepts will be used in illustrations throughout the rest of the zine.\nSeveral stretch goals are available, including supplementary materials for the game. If the goals are met, any backers receiving PDF or printed copies of the core game will also receive PDF or printed copies of the additional materials, as matches their tier.\nIt all started with Poirot and cake. My friends and I would gather to watch Agatha Christie mysteries and enjoy unhealthy quantities of cake. Eventually, this interest overlapped with our passion for roleplaying games, and we tried our hand at creating investigative crime fiction adventures.\nAlthough the adventures were fun, it always felt like we were playing two separate games. The games we played were great for epic combat and high adventure, but the rules took a back seat when it came to investigation and deduction. I decided to make my own game that put the investigation itself in the spotlight.\nI\u2019ve studied game design and participated in multiple Game Jams. With my history of tabletop roleplaying I wanted to use that knowledge to create a game that supported and encouraged the inquisitive style of play we were after.\nUPDATE:\nThanks to the massive support received, I'm adding Discord & playtest access to the Junior Detective ($3) tier! Also, the Detective ($5) tier and upwards will gain access to weekly update emails, including development notes and artwork to be included in the final book! Unfortunately the text on the backer rewards can't be changed after launch (which makes sense!) but rest assured that you'll get them!\nUPDATE:\nI've completed the first set of playtest case notes for Grey Cells, and as promised they are going to be freely available. The following link goes to a google drive folder that contains not only the PDF of the case notes, but also JPEGs of all the Profile Cards involved in the case.\nDeath of a Survivor is a hard-boiled mystery that should take about two 4-hour play sessions to complete. Full disclosure: Most playtest cases will be a bit shorter than this one, but I will try to maintain this standard of quality. Furthermore, playtest cases will be from all of genres supported by Grey Cells, including Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian cases as development continues.\nI hope this gives you an idea of what Grey Cells has to offer, and that you enjoy Death of a Survivor!\nAlso, if you'd like to see an example of how this case works in action, you can find a recording of the playtest here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first game I\u2019ve designed, but it will be my first professional release. However, this is not the first iteration of Grey Cells - throughout its development it has had two major rewrites, replacing, redesigning and improving large portions of the game. Now it has reached the stage where it can stand on its own, and I\u2019m ready to share it with a wider audience.\n\nWith the core of the game nearly complete, the most risk lies with the design and illustration of the zine itself. Preparing enough illustrations to fill the zine could take longer than I\u2019ve accounted for and cause delays, but in this event I will recruit additional artists to assist in production.\n\nAs a black and white zine, printing risks are low even with a zine of this length. Distribution could face delays depending on shipping factors, but even in the event of delays backers would have the PDF available to them.\n\nThis is my first crowdfunding campaign, and while I\u2019m going in with eyes open there may be issues I have not anticipated, especially surrounding pricing and shipping. If issues arise, I will be as transparent as I can be and try to resolve them in a manner that is as fair as possible to the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 3 or more", "title": "Junior Detective", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of the Grey Cells playtest rulebook, as well as a PDF copy of the finished rules and any supplementary materials met through stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["314 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 5 or more", "title": "Detective", "descp": "Everything above, and access to the Grey Cells Discord channel, where you can participate in online playtests.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "Inspector", "descp": "A printed copy of the rulebook, as well as printed copies of supplementary materials met in stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["246 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 30 or more", "title": "Super Sleuth", "descp": "Gain access to PDF copies of the case notes from each playtest, so you can run them yourself.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nAccess to playtest case notes", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 50 or more", "title": "Ace Investigator", "descp": "Receive PDF case notes for a unique single-session murder mystery with yourself cast as the villain or the victim.

It was designed to be extremely quick to learn, easy to play, and narrative driving. It is a perfect game for one shots as well as for developing long term campaigns. Characters are created in game, and Game Masters can run it with little to no preparation. \nYou enter the Hotel. You were not looking for adventure, just a brief escape from the limbo of daily life. The Hotel seems to have other plans.\nIn DEAD HALT you will find yourself in the following situations:\nTaking up a job as the Hotel Maintenance Crew  \nReceiving Quests and obtaining Rewards from the Bartender at the Hotel\u2019s Fall Bar.\nGambling for absurd equipment at the massive Gashapon machine in the basement.\nAssisting quirk-ridden computer Consoles that hang from the ceiling.\nTaking the Elevator to ridiculous and unexplainable floors and landscapes.\nMeeting curious potential allies, odd monsters, and Halted Clunkhead Maintenance crew.\nLosing limbs and have them replaced by state of the art 1990\u2019s Cybernetics.\nAttempting to resist the whispers of the Hotel\u2019s supercomputer; FortRA.\nDEAD HALT is a passion project that I began a few years back. I was in search of a Roleplaying game that allowed anyone to sit down and play at the drop of a hat.\nWhat began as a hack of our incredibly wonky Paranoia XP game slowly developed into the world of DEAD HALT. We loved the decisions Paranoia made us work through, and I wanted to push it even further.\nI slowly created a new world, light enough to play whenever, and with enough depth to encourage the types of stories that were most memorable for my friends and I.\nEverything from:\nHorror elements with breaks of light hearted humor.\nDiscussions of the change of ones personal identity through body modification.\nExistential dread under the rule of an unhinged super computer.\nA robot-slaying bird-headed business man and his sarcastic cat.\nClunkPunk is the word for it: CyberPunk motifs jammed into the aesthetic and unreliability of 1980's technology.\nIf you enjoy games like Paranoia, Tales from the Loop, Mutant Year Zero, Gamma World, ZORK, or quirky settings with a hint of terror, I encourage you to try out DEAD HALT.\nI think you just might like it. \nIn fact, Want to try before you buy?! Check out the FREE play test PDF on zonware.net! \n*Concept sketches for Character Options and Console Dispositions \nAside from the quirky world, the DEAD HALT game system was created specifically to;\nBegin play within an hour of picking up the Zine.\nHave no session zero, jump right in and create characters in game!\nBring in players brand new to Roleplaying Games.\nThe 36 page Zine is a quick read and packed full of content bound by simple to learn rules that allow for incredible stories to emerge without any difficulty. No clunky game mechanics or novels worth of text to read.\nThis in no way means DEAD HALT is simple, just efficient.\nIf you have any questions please feel free to contact me anytime on Twitter, or by email at claydogh@gmail.com. \n *Character by Miranda Sider on Twitter @meidri_ \nThe DEAD HALT Roleplaying Game will be a 36 page staple bound Zine. Every copy will be printed on premium paper with a heavy weight letterpress printed cover (On a real hand cranked printing press!). Each Zine from this Kickstarter will be numbered and initialed by ZONWARE to indicate your contribution to my very first work.\nPrinting will take place at Angelica Ink Letterpress in Upstate New York. I have worked with them in the past, and they put nothing but incredible care into their creations. DEAD HALT will be no different!\n\"Angelica Ink began in a garage in rural, Angelica, New York from a love of real ink, beautiful paper and an obsession with cast iron. As the collection of platen printing presses grew, we expanded to an old mill building in the small village of Angelica.\nThe letterpress products from Angelica Ink are created on treadle and hand-operated presses from the late 1800\u2019s. Angelica Ink is a working press shop, open to the public. We print custom, personal and commercial products and offer classes in book arts including bindery, marbling, letterpress and paper making.\"\nI want this game to be ever evolving. Any extra funding we gain above our goal will go right back in to fund more art, and content for the book.\nFollow me on Twitter to keep up to date and to unlock the Adventure Arc \"Rats in the Walls\" which will be sent out for free online before the release of the physical Zine!\n\n~Adventure Arcs are one page idea joggers to get a session off the ground instantly, with a few key items, characters, and a simple premise or quest to launch players into the Hotel.\n~NPC Character Profiles consist of a a sketch and short bio on key characters in the Hotel such as the Bartender Dhuraine, Gad and his sarcastic Cat, or the Supercomputer FortRA.\n~Hotel Customization Modules will lay out options to expand the Fall Bar and other rooms in the Hotel to allow for longer campaigns and character options.\n~2nd Character Species Options will include multiple new Character Options to play when your first character inevitably becomes a Clunkhead and you have to create a new one. These will include Ratfolk, Spawn, Blank Clones, Undead, Rogue Consoles and More!\n\nBAM POW NEW REWARD TIER.\nYou heard me. Find out the fate of the Hotel's defunct super computer: FortRA.\nAt this Reward Tier you get both a copy of the Zine, and a Floppy Disk.\nYeah, its a 3.5 in Floppy disk, probably owned by someone else but I promise I will delete their old MS Paint scribbles or Taxes and such. \nOn the disk will be a PDF Adventure for DEAD HALT named \"The Fate of FortRA\"\nThe Adventure will only ever be released on Floppy Disk, and I will not publish it anywhere else.

I am happy to include Lizzy's likeness as the Netherseer in Tangled Timelines for seeing what can be and living in that.\nArtwork Inspired by Angelus Morningstar of Story Board\nStory Board does something wholly unique in the content creation space - updating published reviews as time passes and opinions evolve on a particular game. In addition to regular review content, Angelus Morningstar also publishes introspective, thought-provoking pieces on board game culture. I am happy to include Angelus' likeness as the Oracle in Tangled Timelines for showing us important things we tend to forget or ignore.\nArtwork Inspired by Katie Aidley of Katie's Game Corner\nI consider Katie Aidley of Katie's Game Corner one of my best friends, in the industry or otherwise.

Bryce can take my scatter-brained concepts and bring forth true artistry in graphic design. I am happy to include Bryce's likeness as the Swashbuckler in Tangled Timelines for tirelessly sailing against the wind.\nArtwork Inspired by Phil Lacefield Jr. of Golden Distribution\nPhil Lacefield Jr. manages Golden Distribution and is often referred to as that kilted guy at conventions. But one thing few people know is that he also runs a video series called Phil's Picks. In this series, Phil runs through the latest acquisitions available to his customers in a knowledgeable, but very concise way. I am happy to include Phil's likeness as the Tactician in Tangled Timelines for cutting through the fluff and getting to the point already.\nArtwork Inspired by Christian Kang of Take Your Chits\nChristian Kang of Take Your Chits has played a valuable role in nearly every project I have embarked on since we met a couple years ago, and there hasn't yet been a suitable way to thank him for his constant support.

Always finding ways to improve her craft, Kat's live stream content has risen into a class of its own, namely in her weekly segment on Tabletop Backer Party and convention coverage. I am happy to include Kat's likeness as the Valkyrie in Tangled Timelines for her ability to crush adversity and rise to greatness.\nArtwork Inspired by Doug Shute of Victory Condition Gaming\nDoug Shute of Victory Condition Gaming has been a supportive friend for some time now and I am indebted to his good advice. You might recognize his daughter, Sydney Shute, who voiced Cutie in the When Cutie Met Patootie project! I am happy to include Doug's likeness as the Wraith in Tangled Timelines for his diligence in never leaving a project unfinished.\nArtwork Inspired by Martyn Poole of Board Game Exposure\nI have the distinguished honor in being the person who told Martyn Poole his plans were too ambitious and he would be very likely to fail. Now the owner of Board Game Exposure with a published game and a growing resume of accomplishments, I consider myself lucky to call Martyn a close friend. I am happy to include Martyn's likeness as the Xenomute in Tangled Timelines for adapting to adversity and finding a way to help others adapt as well.\nArtwork Inspired by Ilustragus\nI discovered Ilustragus while perusing Twitter and was taken aback by his fun and imaginative style. I had him work on a test piece I was unhappy with and he created what would eventually become Amelia from When Cutie Met Patootie. I have been working with Gus ever since and plan to do so as long as he wants to put up with me! I am happy to include Ilustragus' likeness as the Yeti Charmer in Tangled Timelines for his ability to wrangle my ambitions and turn them into compelling and captivating characters. \nArtwork Inspired by Logician Tim of Misfits of Tabletop\nLogician Tim and the entire D-Verse Publishing team are some of the kindest, most generous people I have ever met.

Cat cat!\nMoar about CATS & CATS \nCATS & CATS is an experimental and (mostly) unplayable tabletop role-playing game experience. The degree of playability depends on the players' extreme commitment to the premise of the game. It attempts to be a supermegacompletely cutdownuntilthereisnothingleft traditional style RPG, wrapped in a (metaphorical) fuzzy blanket of cat. Why? Because I have yet to find a ttrpg that was cat enough for me and now I want to share my creation with yooouuuuuu~~! Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat!\nThis game is designed for 0-12 players and takes approximately 0-8 hours to play.\nCATS & CATS is a very smol game; the rule book and character sheet fit on the front and back of one sheet of paper. Breaking from standard traditional d20 RPG mechanics, this game utilizes only 1c6.\nThe game will be released in two graphic styles. The first is more trad, with clean and precise computer generated lines. The other is a more \"zine\" style, which is to say photocopies of my hand-drawn version of the trad style mentioned above. Don't worry, you don't have to choose; you will get both versions. You're welcome?\nCATS&CATS is part of Kickstarter's Zine Quest Project, a celebration of RPG zine creations! Go check it out, there are some PAWSOME things out there!!! \n\n---\nUhm...Okay? But why is this a Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter will fund the production of the custom six-sided cats\u2014I mean custom six-sided dice\u2014which are required to play the game. Unfortunately, producing a limited number of dice with each die face being customized is spendy. Boo. These exclusive 1c6 are only compatible with CATS & CATS, but they at least look really cool! \nHere is a pre-production proof from the manufacturer!\n---\nPledge Levels and Backer Rewards\n$1: ...I have no idea what is going on???\nThat's alright, I don't know what is going on either! But I'm plowing forward anyways. If you accidentally click on this level, you will receive the PDF of CATS & CATS, including a print-and-fold version of the 1c6.\n$3: I know what's going on...and I like it!\nHuh! Wow! Okay? I'm impressed and confused. I guess if you decide to back at this level for some inconceivable reason you will get a digital PDF of CATS & CATS, including a print-and-fold version of the 1c6. Yes, this is indeed the same reward as the \"...I have no idea what is going on???\"  level. It's your own fault. I don't even feel bad.\n$8:  ALL I WANT FUREVER ARE 1c6!??!!!??!!??? \nCat cat cat catcatcat cat 1c6 cat cat? Cat cat cat! This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page) and a beautiful CATS&CATS 1c6 only! You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$10: I'M ALL IN!!! GIMME!!!!! CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT!!!!!!!!!!! -- ALL GONE! ---\nWhat, really?!? Well, I'm not going to stop you. This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page), a beautiful CATS & CATS 1c6, and a handmade thematic little drawstring bag to hold it all in. You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$10: I'M LATE BUT ALL IN! GIMME CATS!!! I CAN WAIT!!! -- ALL GONE! ---\nYou were taking a cat nap and missed everything, right? Okay, I am going  to open a second-wave duplication of \"$10: I'M ALL IN! GIMME!!! CAT CAT  CAT CAT!!!!\". HOWEVER, this level WILL SHIP LATE. Hand-making lil bags  and shipping myself takes a lot of work--expect a 4-6 week delay. This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page), a beautiful CATS &  CATS 1c6, and a handmade thematic little drawstring bag to hold it all  in. You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$75: I CAN HAS ARTZ N MOAR GAMES?!\nYer so woah and I can't cope with it. Ok. So. I guess if you really want I can send you the original concept pencil sketches for the catmpersand logo and some of the interior art, all of which has been slept on by my cat (Antoine Rasputin Little-Bunny-Foo-Foo-Hopping-Through-The-Forest-Scooping-Up-The-Fieldmice-And-Bopping-Them-On-The-Head Napoleon Bathory the Third)? I'm not a flash artist, so be prepared! I'll also send you two DELUXE full copies of the game--including a total of FOUR 1c6 and two dice bags. Shine on you crazy cat-obsessed diamond. This will ship to US or Canada only, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n ---\nCat Cat Cat Add-on 1c6???\nYes, you can add one extra 1c6 to your reward, but ONLY if you pledge at an $8 or $10 level. This will not change your shipping costs. If you pledge at $1 or $3, you will need to change your pledge level to the $8 tier.\nThe 1c6 add-on is $6.\n Kickstarter charges your pledge right when the campaign ends (in 48  hrs!). This means that if you want to add an extra 1c6 by increasing  your pledge by $6, you MUST do it  before the project ends! You cannot increase your pledge after the  campaign ends (unlike some projects that use third-party KS managers  like backerkit). \nTo take advantage of this and amp up your CATS&CATS experience, follow these simple steps: \n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the CATS&CATS page. \n2. Increase your pledge by $6 to claim your 1c6. Maximum add-on is ONE 1c6.\n3. Save your pledge. \n4. At the end of the campaign, I will send out a Backer Survey via Kickstarter. There will be a place to indicate that you added $6 to your pledge amount for the add-on 1c6. \nWhen you make your initial pledge, Kickstarter should automatically add on your shipping cost. Please check this handy chart below to ensure your total pledge amount is correct!\n\n---\n Streeeeeeetch goals!\nHow did this even happen?\nOkay, at $500 I will put together merch like stickers and t-shirts that you can buy on zazzle. You all are even weirder than me.\n...alright. Starting at $1000 and for every $100 thereafter, I will post a cat photo and/or video to backers.\n---\nWho are you? Do you know that you are really weird?\nGreat questions! Thanks for asking! My name is Dana and I am, indeed, very weird. I also really like cats. You can find me on Twitter @DAYtheELF.\nSurprisingly, I actually sometimes work on real and functional role-playing games, such as the recent ttrpg sensation Dinosaur Princesses; CYBERKITTENS, a cyberpunk transfelinism playbook, for The Sprawl: November Metric; and Upcycle, more cyberpunk cats, for The Veil: Cascade. My next upcoming gaming convention appearances will be at BreakoutCon in Toronto and PAXEast in Boston. Stop by and I will show you pics of my cats!\n---\nShipping and Fulfillment\nPDFs of the game will be fulfilled using itch.io (http://itch.io). This is a change from the original plan to use DriveThruRPG, largely because itch.io is easier to use for digital-only game distribution (DTRPG is excellent for Print-On-Demand, however). Itch.io is rad and it's an easy process, though you will need to create a free account, if you don't have one yet. When the game is ready, I will send out download keys to all backers who chose the $1 level or higher!\nThe physical copy of the game will be mailed via standard mail worldwide. Depending on where your mailing address is, you will be charged one of three shipping & handling costs in addition to your $10 pledge: United States (+$4), Canada (+$10), or Other International (+$15).\nProduction Schedule\nCATS & CATS is mostly written and the art is nearly finalized, but we have to wait on the dice to be crafted and the bags to be sewn. Unless something awful happens to me or the manufacturer, CATS & CATS should be shipped (and the PDFs released) by May 2019.\n I will not be selling anything not already available to backers before my upcoming. I  will only be selling printed versions of the PDFs, which will already have been distributed by early March. \nSo for transparency sake, here is the updated distribution/fulfillment plan:\n Early March: PDF of CATS&CATS will be released to all backers via itch.io.\n Mid-March: First-wave $10 level backer rewards (of folx who do not add-on an extra 1c6) will be shipped.\n Mid-March: I will be at BreakoutCon. I will be selling a limited number of paper copies of CATS&CATS with the print-and-fold die, BUT NOT THE FANCY ACRYLIC DIE, for $3USD/$4CAD.\n Late-March:  I will be at PAX East. I will be selling a limited number of paper copies of CATS&CATS with the print-and-fold die, BUT NOT THE FANCY ACRYLIC DIE, for $3USD.\n Late-May: Manufacturer willing, I will be fulfilling all remaining physical backer rewards (standard and add-ons).  \n---\nCat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat!\n ---", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is that this won't fund.

We\u2019re running this campaign to fund the development of the Interface Zero 3.0 core rules, the GM's Guide to 2095, the introductory adventure, and a host of cool add-ons such as a 3-panel Game Master's screen, an action deck, bennies, and much more! \n  Interface Zero 3.0 is a cyberpunk setting\u2026 Sort of. Interface Zero 3.0 is inspired by a plethora of sources including novels such as Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, Altered Carbon, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Snow Crash.\nAnime such as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Psycho Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Alita: Battle Angel and Appleseed help to round out a vision of our world, incorporating eastern and western influences on the genre. The result is a setting that echoes other popular cyberpunk games in that it holds tight to the flavor of a world where megacorporations have enormous wealth and influence with little regard for the masses or the world in which they live. It diverges slightly in that Interface Zero tends to focus more on geopolitical action and intrigue as ways to bring in dystopian elements and really hammer home the idea that the world your characters live in is in need of change. The question is, will you work towards change, or will you stand idly by and watch the world burn?\nIn Interface Zero 3.0, you might play as genetically modified humans,  vat-grown simulacra, or even a psion, more commonly known as a zeek. You'll be able to embrace a variety of concepts firmly rooted in the cyberpunk genre, but geared towards the setting.  You'll be able to play razor boys and razor girls, gearheads who use their drones for tactical dominance of the battlefield, hyper reality hackers and network crackers, combat medics, lone wolf assassins, cybermonks, and many more concepts common to our setting!\n  In the five years since Interface Zero 2.0 was released, we\u2019ve received a bunch of feedback from you regarding almost every aspect of the book about everything from races and gear to edges, hacking, drones\u2026I could go on. Though at times it may not seem like it, I\u2019ve listened to all of the feedback and we(the development team) are incorporating it into this new design. \nIn Interface Zero 3.0 you\u2019ll find:\nUpdated Races, including 2nd generation Hybrids and a Psion\nCompletely overhauled rules for hacking and drones\nCampaign Themes that help you dial in on the type of cyberpunk game you wish to run and play\nMore City Trappings\nCorporate Trappings for gear and equipment\nNew bio-horrors and more threats\nA lighter approach towards gear, but improved customization options\nA broad view of the world and solar system as it exists in 2095\nA bunch of Savage Tales to get you started\n In the GM\u2019s Guide to 2095 you\u2019ll find:\nA more detailed look at the Interface Zero setting\nSavage Tales for each region of the world\nInformation on major corporations, governments and the people who run them\n3 Plot Point Campaigns based on campaign themes\nNew Threats\nSecrets for the GM\u2019s eyes only\nGuidelines  for effectively using SWADE's rules for networking, contacts and much more \n  Some of you might have heard that Interface Zero is getting something of a reboot. That's partially true, and it's only natural for you to wonder if the new edition is going to make your old sourcebooks obsolete.\nWe are taking Interface Zero in a new direction, definitely. In the third edition, you'll see changes, some of them really big, but none of these changes will make any of your sourcebooks or the lore in the Interface Zero 2.0 book obsolete. In fact all of that lore is essential to better understand why many of the changes coming to the world are being made. \nI've been wanting to get back to a setting that feels more hard-core cyberpunk and less science-fantasy.  One of those ways is to get the world (primarily the United States) moving in a certain direction...down. The reunification of the United States begins in late 2090 with what is known as the reunification war. It's a short-lived, but bloody conflict primarily between the North American Coalition, the United Combine, Atlantica, and the Republic of Texas. To make a long story short; The North American Coalition wins the war, successfully reuniting the lower 48 states under a new banner: The Reformed United States.\nI won't go into all the specifics here, but the ramifications of the Reclamation War are vast, and much of the new setting addresses these issues. It's going to be a fun ride, though, and I hope you come along with me!  \n  To give you an idea of the deals we have planned for backers of this kickstarter, I'm listing the retail costs for the three core products. As you can see, your total costs get much cheaper for you the higher you pledge.  \nIf you want to grab all of the bells and whistles without worrying about how much each individual add-on is going to cost you after the campaign, going with the Southland Ganger pledge gets you everything and ends up being the best value for your money.\nIf you just want the books in print, stick with the Gearhead pledge, and wait until after the kickstarter ends to grab extras like bennies, the gm screen, action deck and the way of the gun deck as add-ons. This will be handled through Backerkit at the end of the campaign.\n Interface Zero 3.0 will be a full color, hard cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 210 pages in length. The book will retail for $35.99 in print, and $19.99 in PDF.\n The GM's Guide to 2095 will be a full color, soft cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 128 pages in length. The book will retail for $24.99 in print, and $11.99 in PDF.\n The Introductory Adventure will be a full color, soft cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 48 pages in length. It will retail for $9.99 in print, and $5.99 in PDF.\n  I've found that it's much easier to do add-ons at the end of the kickstarter rather than have a ton of pledges that slowly build on the content until you eventually get everything. As mentioned above, if you do want everything, and don't wish to mess with all the extra financial calculations, you should select the Southland Ganger pledge.\nIf you'd rather just pick and choose which add-ons to get, here is a list and their costs. You can either add the dollar amount to your pledge upfront, or you can simply wait until after the kickstarter and purchase them via pledge manager. I recommend waiting. Some people have gone all in-and later decided that they didn't want certain things, and that can cause complications, as the credit cards have already been charged. In any case, here is what we are offering!\n Bennies: $15.00  (A pack of 25 bennies)\n Action Deck: $15.00 (52 Card Action Deck)\n Way of the Gun Deck: $15.00 (52 card cyberpunk-themed Adventure Deck)\n 3 Panel GM screen:  $20.00 (A sturdy Graphic Novel size)\n Wild Die (5): $5.00 A set of 5 custom Wild Dice.\n Additional physical copy of Interface Zero 3.0 (Offset printing): $30.00 (6 dollars below retail)\n Additional physical copy of the GM's Guide to 2095 (Offset Printing): $20.00 (5 dollars below retail)\n We have a bunch of stretch goals lined up for this kickstarter. Some, like maps and tokens are designed for VTT (Virtual Table Top) platforms, but can also be printed out for use at your game table. Others include  regional setting books, HOT SPOT guides to specific cities or other locations of note, adventures, character folios, and much more.  \nAll of these stretch goals are going to be delivered in PDFs or downloadable files. These books won't be going through a traditional print run. Now that said, we will be giving all backers vouchers to get them in Print On Demand for every POD product we unlock! This saves both you and I tons of headaches dealing with shipping costs, delayed shipping dates, and things of that nature.\n[UNLOCKED!] $33,000:Malmart Catalog 4 VTT Tokens and a New Savage Tale: If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the malmart catalog and do some VTT Tokens and a brand new Savage Tale! The Malmart Catalog is a 96 page supplement that gives you more goodies to choose from when outfitting your characters. More cybernetics, vehicles, weapons, and tech to enhance your game! Much of this book has already been written, but we need to convert to the SWADE rules, do layout, run it through editing, and order artwork.\n[UNLOCKED!] $43,000: The Europe/Russia/China Source book: If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the Europe/Russia/China source book and do some more VTT Tokens for Online platforms like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds! We\u2019ll also do a brand new Savage Tale! We\u2019ll wrap up this 128 page supplement and give you everything you need to know about the war between China and Russia, and the fractured nations of Europe. The manuscript has been written, but it needs heavy editing and rewrites to update it to 2095, artwork, and conversion to SWADE rules. \n[UNLOCKED!]$53,000: The Zero\u2019s guide to the Solar System: Another book that is in development, the Zero\u2019s Guide to the Solar System needs more writing, artwork, editing, and conversion to SWADE. This book will be an estimated 128 pages in length. If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the sourcebook and do some more VTT Tokens, a brand new Savage Tale, and digital maps for Online platforms like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds!\n[UNLOCKED!]$63,000: Interface Zero: Dark Pathways (working title): An 96 -128 page alternate setting book, Dark Pathways gives you everything you need to know about introducing fantasy and horror elements to 2095! If you\u2019ve seen movies like Aliens, Bright, or The Matrix, you\u2019ll have a good idea of what we plan on doing here. The book will come with a sample setting, new gear, edges, and much more! We\u2019ll also do more VTT gaming maps, and more Savage Tales!\n $70,000: Corporate Profiles: This 32 page supplement marks a new line for Interface Zero. In These supplements, we\u2019ll discuss various megacorporations as they exist in 2095. \n  Print on Demand vouchers allow you to purchase the book at cost plus shipping to your home. This means that if it costs me 4 dollars to make the book, that's what you pay, in addition to the shipping costs. I don't collect any revenue off of POD books. This is simply a way to help you save some money if you wish to have everything in print.\nFor estimated shipping costs for Print of Demand products by page count, check their website here.  All of the sourcebooks, guides, etc. will be printed in softcover  and will range from 18 pages to 128 pages in length, depending on the content.\nHow does it work?\nOnce I put a product on sale in Print on Demand, I send you an email with your Voucher, which is essentially a coupon. It comes in the form of a URL linking to the product. You click on the link, and it automatically adjusts the price to my cost to print the book. Then, you simply check out like you would any other time you purchase a product. Shipping is then added to the total. At that point, you complete the transaction and your done!\nNOTE:  The Interface Zero Core rule book will only be available in softcover as a Print on Demand Product. This is because the size of the book has to change if we print it with Hard Cover, which would require an entirely different layout.\nHere is a graphic that shows the estimated printing costs for POD  products I'll be offering in this kickstarter.  \nWhat's the difference between Print on Demand and Traditional Offset Printing?\nPrint on Demand (POD) books are made using a digital printer that uses inkjet printing rather than traditional offset. It\u2019s a quicker, cheaper way to print books, because you don\u2019t have to order larger bulk runs (usually 1000 copies or more). With POD, books are \u201cmade to order;\u201d you can order a single book or multiple books at one time.\nThe main difference is quality. While Print on Demand has come a long way, it\u2019s still not as good as offset printing. Binding is perfect bound for softcover, and case-bound for hardcover, though I\u2019ve printed hardcover POD books in the past that don\u2019t hold up well for long. The softcover POD books tend to do much better over the long run. The pages tend to feel rough. Sometimes images can be grainy, or bleed through; it just depends on whether or not the specs are right. Hardcovers don't have customization options. They are all done in standard glossy format.\nOverall, the quality is good enough that I'm happy using them, but not for large print runs designed to go into distribution to games stores world-wide. For that, I go with offset printing.\nWith offset printing, the color really jumps off the page. It feels better to the touch. I generally use semi-gloss paper for my books, at 80lb. weight to ensure you get the best book possible. Binding is much better, especially for Hardcover books. With offset, I can do stuff like put custom end pages, choose stronger binding, and change the type of hardcover style, which can really improve the book as a whole. The only downside is that it takes longer to get the books. Any book by a major publishing company (Like Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Wizards of the Coast, Paizo Publishing, etc.) that you find in your local game store is probably done with offset printing.\nHere are the Shipping Costs for all orders for books shipped directly from our warehouse in the United States, as well as overseas partners.\n Our plan is to deliver the PDF and have the book ready to go to the printer in June, 2019. After that, printing will take approximately 8 to 12 weeks, so we should be getting them right at the end of August, 2019. Once we get the books in our warehouse, we'll start shipping them to you, along with any other physical rewards you ordered.\nI want to stress that sometimes things can go sideways. While I don't foresee any issues, I can tell you that I've had problems in the past that were completely out of my control, and affected the timeline to print. I should also stress that I want to make sure you get the absolute best quality books I can produce, and regardless of whether or not we're talking about artwork, or a second or third edit of content, I will not print a book until I'm happy with it.\nAll of our digital and Print on Demand titles will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'd like to stress upfront that this project is not a pre-order. My team and I are working on the project as we speak, and this will get finished and released. You have my word on that, but as someone who has been publishing role-playing game supplements since 2005, I can attest to the fact that things don't always go as planned. \n\nWriters and artists pull out of projects, or turn in manuscripts and illustrations late. Editing and revisions sometimes take longer than anticipated. The proofs for books come back from the printer with errors that need to be fixed. These things can happen. It's a part of the publishing business. But I've been around the block, and I know that a large part of dealing with issues like the ones I mentioned above is communication.\n\nI have regular conversations with everyone involved in this process to ensure that I know things are progressing the way they should be, and if they aren't, I roll up my sleeves and work with my team to find the best solution to a problem before it gets out of hand.\n\nAs a backer, you'll receive regular status reports from me about this project.

I just wanted to let people know so they weren\u2019t surprised, but in retrospect I should have explained myself, as I\u2019m attempting to do now.\nI didn\u2019t make the decision to launch a new project lightly. I weighed a number of factors into the decision, not the least of which was the current state of IZ 3.0.  Physical products have yet to be delivered, and I certainly understand the frustration and feelings of betrayal. After all, how can I start something new when they haven\u2019t been delivered yet? The truth is, after I send the books and GM screen to the printer, I\u2019ll have roughly 8 weeks to finalize the Way of the Gun Deck and get that printed.

Ein Mangaka hat sich eine Figur ausgedacht und schickt sie in gefahrvolle Situationen \u2013 als Leserin kann man zwar mitfiebern, die Handlungen und Ergebnisse aber nicht beeinflussen. Bei Record of Dragon War ist das anders: Du denkst dir deine Figur aus und du entscheidest, welche Charaktereigenschaften sie hat, welche Ziele sie verfolgt, wie sie auf Begegnungen mit anderen Menschen \u2013 oder Monstern! \u2013 reagiert.\n\u201eDer Drache rei\u00dft das Maul auf und speit einen Feuerschwall in deine Richtung \u2013 mach einen Rettungswurf!\u201c \nSeit 1974 erleben Spieler weltweit Abenteuer, nur in ihrer gemeinsamen Fantasie, nur bewaffnet mit Stift, Papier und W\u00fcrfeln. \nDas neue Hobby Rollenspiel hatte auch auf die Manga-Szene gro\u00dfen Einfluss: Bevor Parn und Deedlit (Record of Lodoss War) ihre Abenteuer in Roman, Manga und Anime erlebten, waren sie Spielfiguren in einer regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Spielrunde des ersten und erfolgreichsten Rollenspiels der Welt! Auch Online-Rollenspiele wie WoW und Final Fantasy verdanken ihre Inspiration und Spielweise dem Pen-and-Paper-Vorbild \u2013 und haben mit dem Isekai-Genre Mega-Erfolge wie .hack// oder SAO m\u00f6glich gemacht.\nUnd nun k\u00f6nnen auch heutige Manga- und Game-Fans nachspielen, wie alles seinen Anfang nahm. \nAusschnitt aus der Skizze f\u00fcr den Zauberspruch \u201eHeilen leichter Wunden\u201d\nRecord of Dragon War ist eine R\u00fcckkehr zu den Wurzeln des RPG-Hobbys und zugleich eine Fusion mit der modernen Comic-Kultur. Auf der Basis der OGL (Open Game License, eine Open-Source-Bewegung des Rollenspiels) variiert Record of Dragon War die Regeln des ersten Rollenspieles der Welt. Unter Zuhilfenahme der OGL wurde 2008 die fr\u00fcheste, ungeschliffene Fassung des Spieles (\u201e0e\u201c) rekonstruiert und unter dem neuen Titel Swords & Wizardry f\u00fcr die heutige Generation erfahrbar gemacht. Record of Dragon War verwendet den Regelkern von S&W, ist aber gleichzeitig eine behutsame Neuinterpretation der Basis-Box, die auch in Deutschland f\u00fcr viele Spieler der Einstieg in das Hobby war. \nRecord of Dragon War wendet sich an zwei Spielertypen: Fans von Manga-Titeln wie Record of Lodoss War, Granblue Fantasy, Legend of Zelda oder Fairy Tail, sowie Fans der \u201eOld School Renaissance\u201c \u2013 einer weltweiten R\u00fcckbesinnung auf klassische Rollenspielregeln der Fr\u00fchzeit des Hobbys. Damit vereint das Spiel zwei Enden des Spektrums:\nein junges Manga-Publikum, das erstmals den Reiz der Rollenspiele (oder den Ursprung einer bestimmten Lieblingsserie) erforschen m\u00f6chte, \nund \u201eW20-Veteranen\u201c, die voll Nostalgie an die \u201eRote Box\u201c zur\u00fcckdenken, bzw.

Den gr\u00f6\u00dften Piratenschatz zu finden. Das m\u00e4chtigste Monster zu bezwingen. Deinem d\u00e4monischen Vater zu zeigen, dass du nicht wie er bist (und ihn vom Thron der H\u00f6lle zu sto\u00dfen). Das beste Rezept f\u00fcr Drachenrippchen zu kreieren.

Beide haben den Einstieg ins Rollenspielhobby mit der Roten Box gefunden. Beide halten die Rote Box f\u00fcr das beste Einsteigerprodukt, das je geschrieben wurde. Beide tr\u00e4umen seit Jahren (in Dirks Fall einem Jahrzehnt) davon, eine zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfe Neuinterpretation dieser Box zu sehen \u2013 eine Box, die die Sehgewohnheiten der heutigen (Manga-)Leser bedient und geeignet ist, eine neue Generation auf das abenteuerlichste Hobby der Welt aufmerksam zu machen.\nDoch die Zeiten haben sich ge\u00e4ndert, seit Rollenspielboxen einmal in Kaufh\u00e4usern und dank VEDES-Fachgesch\u00e4ften noch \u201eauf dem platten Land\u201c zu finden waren. Da wir nicht einsch\u00e4tzen k\u00f6nnen, wie sich dieser Strukturwandel auf die Nachfrage nach einem solchen Produkt auswirkt, m\u00fcssen wir das Interesse auf diesem Weg abfragen.\nBei der Planung der Box und der Hefte haben wir einen Standardanteil an Illustrationen angesetzt. Nun lebt das Manga-Genre nat\u00fcrlich auch von dem charakteristischen Artwork. \u00dcber Stretchgoals k\u00f6nnen wir leichter einen h\u00f6heren Grafikanteil realisieren. \nMarika h\u00e4lt Stift und Rasterfolie parat und wartet nur auf euch.\nDas \u201eMaking-of\u201d eines Covers\nDie deutsche Mangaka Marika Herzog (auf Twitter unter demoniacalchild zu finden) ist die zeichnende H\u00e4lfte des Manga-Autorenduos CHASM und seit 2008 im fantastischen Genre zuhause (u.a. Grimoire bei Comic Culture, Demon King Camio bei Egmont). Nach einem Ausflug in Boys-Love-Gefilde (Whispering Blue bei Egmont) widmet sie sich wieder der (Shonen-)Fantasy und SF. Wenn sie nicht auf Messen in Deutschland und Italien Signierstunden gibt, zeichnet sie ihren Science-Fiction-Web-Manga Capacitas, der auf Deutsch und Englisch erscheint.\nMarikas Lieblingsmangas sind Haikyu!!, One Piece und Gensomaden Saiyuki.\nDirk Remmecke (in manchen Foren auch als Mondbuchstaben unterwegs) wirkte 15 Jahre lang in der deutschen Spielebranche (u.a. als Inhaber eines Spiele-Fachgesch\u00e4ftes, Autor f\u00fcr Spiele-Fachzeitschriften und als Gr\u00fcndungsmitglied und Mitveranstalter von Hannover spielt!) und ist seit 13 Jahren Event- und Marketing-Manager f\u00fcr die Labels KAZ\u00c9 Manga und KAZ\u00c9 Anime. F\u00fcr Eye See Movies entdeckte er die isl\u00e4ndische RPG-Comedy Astr\u00f3p\u00eda, deren \u00dcbersetzung er verantwortete. Dirk wurde von 2014 bis 2018 in die Jury des Deutschen Rollenspielpreises berufen.

Das Lektorat wird bis Mitte Januar abgeschlossen sein und ins Layout gehen. Die Illustrationen sind beauftragt und Marika zeichnet sich die Finger wund. Zum Ende des Kickstarters sollen alle Grafiken vorliegen \u2013 jene Motive, die erst durch Stretchgoals freigeschaltet werden, werden im Januar nachgeliefert. Das Hauptrisiko besteht immer bei unvorhergesehenen Lebensereignissen im Team (famili\u00e4re Notf\u00e4lle, Krankheit usw.), was im Voraus nat\u00fcrlich nicht planbar ist.\n\nNach den Erfahrungen, die wir in bisherigen Crowdfundings sowohl in deutscher als auch in englischer Sprache gesammelt haben, sind wir zuversichtlich, das Buch und alle finanzierten Zusatzprodukte innerhalb des veranschlagten Zeitrahmens zu realisieren. Als Verlag haben wir allergr\u00f6\u00dftes Eigeninteresse, den Termin der MangaComicConvention (Leipziger Buchmese 2019) nicht zu verpassen \u2013 wir haben eigens einen Stand f\u00fcr die Premiere des Spiels gemietet! Zu diesem Zweck werden wir jeden Arbeitsschritt \u00fcberwachen, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit f\u00fcr Verz\u00f6gerungen zu minimieren. Nat\u00fcrlich gilt es auch, in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden alle Backer \u00fcber den Status des Projektes zu informieren und bei Nachfragen schnell und gezielt zu reagieren.\nDennoch k\u00f6nnen wir Verz\u00f6gerungen nat\u00fcrlich nicht ausschlie\u00dfen. Wir k\u00f6nnen euch aber versichern, dass wir euch zum einen stets \u00fcber eventuelle Verz\u00f6gerungen auf dem Laufenden halten werden und daran arbeiten diese schnellstm\u00f6glich zu beheben. Auch sind wir der Meinung, dass man nicht zu viele Crowdfunding-Projekte parallel laufen haben sollte, bevor die vorherigen Projekte abgeschlossen oder zumindest so gut wie abgeschlossen sind \u2013 auch hier k\u00f6nnt ihr euch auf uns verlassen, dass wir uns nicht verzetteln.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Kaffeekasse", "descp": "Du m\u00f6chtest uns einfach symbolisch unterst\u00fctzen oder \u00fcber die Neuheiten und Entwicklungen dieses Projekts auf dem Laufenden bleiben?

Een wereld die uit een schilderij van Jheronimus Bosch of Pieter Brueghel lijkt te komen, een wereld van goden en monsters. Dit is de wereld van Ambrosia, een uniek rollenspel ge\u00efnspireerd door de geschiedenis en de folklore van de Lage Landen.\nMet Ambrosia willen we je het gevoel bieden dat je echt in een middeleeuwse, west-Europese setting rondloopt; we benaderen het rollenspel op een historisch onderbouwde manier. De gemiddelde levensverwachting in de wereld van Ambrosia is bijvoorbeeld 45; er is een groot verschil in rangen en standen tussen adel, clerus, en horigen; genezers gebruiken bloedzuigers en aderlatingen om hun ambacht mee uit te oefenen; en winkels zijn zo goed als niet-bestaand. In plaats daarvan zijn de mensen toegewezen op de wekelijkse marktdag om levensnoodzakelijke goederen te kopen van reizende handelaars.\nVergeet die smidse met een hele reeks +5 zwaarden in zijn vitrine; wapens worden gemaakt op bestelling, en metalen pantsers zijn heel duur en behoorlijk zeldzaam. Op die manier heeft Ambrosia meer weg van \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d, \u201cDragon Age\u201d of \u201cThe Witcher\u201d dan bijvoorbeeld \u201cWarcraft\u201d; we bieden een grauwe, realistische setting die ondersteund is door toegankelijke spelregels.\nIn Ambrosia benaderen we magie op een niet alledaagse manier. Hoewel de setting relatief weinig magische invloeden kent, is iedereen overtuigd dat al wat occult is ook daadwerkelijk bestaat, en zij die magische kunsten beoefenen worden zowel gevreesd als gerespecteerd. Vergeet al wat je weet over \u201cglass cannons\u201d, magi\u00ebrs zijn niet langer artilleristen die vuurballen en bliksemschichten alle kanten uit schieten.\nIn Ambrosia kunnen magi\u00ebrs een bepaald aspect van de realiteit controleren en manipuleren: er zijn er die de schaduwen tot leven brengen, andere zijn dan weer vlees-vervormers, sommigen kunnen zelfs je eigen levensbloed tegen je gebruiken. Vermits tactisch nadenken ondergeschikt wordt aan vertelkunst, biedt dit je een hoop nieuwe kansen om het verhaal naar je eigen hand te zetten.\nIn eerste plaats is Ambrosia een spel waarbij het verhaal centraal staat.\nElke speler krijgt een rechtstreekse band met het verhaal. Om het oudste fantasy-clich\u00e9 ooit als voorbeeld te nemen, JIJ als spelerpersonage bent de uitverkorene! Natuurlijk gaan we niet zo laag zinken in een scenario van Ambrosia (ik voel me al goedkoop, gewoon door het als voorbeeld te nemen!) maar je snapt het wel.\nHet verhaal draait rond jullie, de spelers, en jullie beslissingen hebben een rechstreeks effect op de sandboxy campaigns met een open einde die Ambrosia aanbiedt. Zelf put ik uit lessen, geleerd van mensen als Joseph Campbell en Alfred Hitchcock als het op screenwriting aankomt, en kan die ook toepassen op het ontwikkelen van scenario\u2019s voor het rollenspel. Wat we dus aanbieden zijn correct gestructureerde, doch modulaire en volledig interactieve verhaallijnen waar niets is wat het lijkt en onverwachte wendingen achter elke hoek schuilen!\nMaar Ambrosia is nog veel meer. Het biedt je de mogelijkheid om drie-dimensionale, volledig uitgewerkte spelerpersonages te cre\u00ebren met realistische motivaties om het verhaal verder te zetten. En dat verhaal is het belangrijkste element van dit spel; de historie van Ambrosia wordt verteld in zogenaamde \u201cKronieken\u201d, elk een sandboxy campaign met een open einde waarin de keuzes die de spelers maken, rechtstreekse gevolgen hebben.\nElke Kroniek bouwt verder op de keuzes die de spelers in de vorige gemaakt hebben, dus we houden ons niet bezig met lineaire \u201cdungeon-crawlers\u201d \u2013 het verhaal evolueert terwijl je het uitspeelt, het is modulair opgebouwd, en de keuzes van de spelers zijn net zo belangrijk als de nota\u2019s van de spelleider. Hiermee krijg je een levende setting die aangepast wordt naarmate de gebeurtenissen ontrafelen die de essentie ervan vormen. Je bent niet langer een toerist die toevallig ergens in verzeild geraakt, je bent de ware protagonist van het verhaal!\nIk wou van Ambrosia een visueel verbluffend, maar toch betaalbaar, alternatief bieden voor de grote namen in het genre. We gaan bijvoorbeeld nooit extra handboeken uitgeven: wat je ziet is wat je krijgt. Vermits onze focus ligt op het verhaal zullen we meer Kronieken ontwikkelen, maar ook alleen tot het metaplot volledig is afgewerkt; dat is waar het verhaal van Ambrosia zal eindigen. Geen dure miniaturen of extra handboeken- Ambrosia moet toegankelijk blijven voor mensen van elke rang of stand. Je hebt geen dikke portefeuille nodig om hiervan te genieten; al wat je nodig hebt is een levendige verbeelding en de bereidheid om te vertrekken op een intens, emotioneel avontuur!\nEen ander belangrijk aspect van dit spel is hoe we personages speltechnisch benaderen. Elk personage is volledig aanpasbaar aan je eigen wensen door middel van een systeem dat je toelaat elke combinatie van vaardigheden, talenten en gebreken aan te kopen. Daarmee wordt een spelerpersonage zowel gevormd als getekend door zijn of haar verleden. Je speelt een volledig ontwikkeld personage van vlees en bloed.\nDesondanks kent een spelletje Ambrosia niet onmiddellijk een dodelijke afloop; je wordt steeds behandeld als de protagonist van het verhaal, wat je moeilijk te doden maakt \u2013 maar gemakkelijk te verminken. Als je wat ervaring hebt opgedaan, voel je jezelf echt die veteraan die loopt te klagen dat de jongeren het nu toch allemaal veel te gemakkelijk hebben. Regels die je moraliteit en reputatie meten geven je personage nog meer diepgang; hij of zij zal immers geconfronteerd worden met dilemma\u2019s waarbij een simpele oplossing zonder enige slachtoffers onmogelijk blijkt te zijn...\nAmbrosia is de culminatie van lessen, geput uit klassieke en moderne rollenspellen. Het trekt invloeden uit verhalende spellen zoals Vampire: The Masquerade, Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play en Call of Cthulhu, maar houdt ook rekening met nieuwere ontwikkelingen in de wereld van rollenspellen. Eveneens vergeten we zeker niet al die huisregels die we al sinds de jaren \u201980 hebben verzonnen om oudere spellen te stroomlijnen. Op die manier bieden we een boeiende, originele ervaring die zowel veteranen uitdaagt als gemakkelijk toegankelijk is voor beginnelingen. Met dit project hopen we je een gelijkwaardig alternatief te bieden voor de grote namen in het genre, alsook je een heel nieuwe kijk op rollenspellen te geven! \n De Boeken\nHet spelleiderscherm\nDit scherm is een fraai vierluik waarmee je de tafel meteen onderdompelt in de juiste sfeer en waarachter je nota's geheim kan houden voor nieuwsgierige spelersogen (we zeggen niet dat ze willen afkijken, maar het zou erg jammer zijn als ze per ongeluk een glimp opvangen van iets dat ze eigenlijk niet mogen weten!)\nOp de voorkant van het scherm staat de kaart van de Alverlanden afgebeeld zodat de spelers altijd gemakkelijk kunnen terugvinden waar ze precies zijn. De achterkant van het scherm bevat nuttige tabellen die de spelleider al eens nodig heeft tijdens het spel; deze staan ook in het Basisspel opgetekend maar op deze manier hoef je ze niet telkens op te zoeken!\nJe kan dit scherm als addon bijbestellen door 13\u20ac bij je pledge bij te tellen, of door dit later in de pledge manager te bestellen. Door nu reeds je pledge te vergroten, help je wel mee om meer stretch goals te unlocken!\nUiteraard vinden we Ambrosia als auteur en uitgever een fantastisch spel, maar hieronder zie je wat anderen over Ambrosia denken.\nDe engelstalige reviewers baseren zich op review exemplaren van de binnenkort te verschijnen engelstalige versie van Ambrosia.\nNox Spellenzolder\n Mr Mean\nThat's How We Roll\n  De Alverlanden\nHieronder kan je nog meer info over Ambrosia bekijken, verstrekt door de auteur zelve.

Become is a game about the development of identity as player programs escape their initial design and build a new cage out of their self-chosen principles.\nThe mechanics of Become are built on a dynamic dice pool system that's easy to learn, with a strategic breadth that rewards experienced players. For groups that prefer narrative roleplay, the focus of the game is on non-combative conflicts resolved through Tests. As players engage in Tests, they construct a pool of possible opportunities and consequences, providing players with a better chance at success by taking bigger risks and creating more nuanced outcomes. For those looking for strategic crunch, the systems of violent conflict are a modular and shifting landscape that allows players to generate interconnected co-op strategies around finding weaknesses and new ways to exploit them.\nThe core component of a campaign of Become is the Mystery. For the Administrator (Become's GM), this system is quick to set up and includes all the tools you need to write and run complex but solvable mysteries that will reward everyone at the table with an investigative story that keeps players in suspense without losing them along the way.\nPrograms in Become come in one of five Designs, depending on their purpose on the Network. These frameworks are the starting point for a player character, and beyond defining the character's role on the team it creates the program's core motivations\u2014 but this prescribed shape doesn't last long. Each time a program dies, it learns something new and changes its value structure, called Compulsions, over time creating an individual identity that could only come from that player and the situations they faced.\nComputer: You are optimized for computation and analysis. You deconstruct and recombine data with remarkable efficiency, and your affinity for systems makes you invaluable to groups seeking to understand a portion of the vast Network.\nCourier: When you look at the Network you see all the in-between places. You see the flow in the crowd and the shift in a room. Your ability to comprehend big-picture systems keeps your allies moving \u2014 and your enemies a step behind.\nVendor: You\u2019re keyed into the economic superstructure of the Network, and you\u2019ve got connections throughout the city. Your skills with constructing new items and your propensity for calling in favors ensures your group is never short-changed.\nSecurity Protocol: You keep Programs safe. You mostly do that by hitting things a lot but hey, no one\u2019s perfect, right? You keep your team alive by making the other teams dead first.\nSensation: You are the Network\u2019s muse. A Program tasked with creating experiential media that keeps the minds of other Programs functional \u2014 that is to say sane. Your position earns you a considerable amount of social capital, which you can use to grease the wheels for your allies.\nOf course, no kickstarter would be complete without rewards, so here are some details!\nPledge levels: all\nYou'll get instant access to a quick-start version of the rules in PDF format!

Think of Han Solo relying on a hyperdrive that keeps shorting out, Starbuck going all in when she really shouldn\u2019t, or Mal Reynold\u2019s last-ditch gambits never quite paying off. NTMO is filled with laughter and pathos as your scoundrels make bigger and bigger bets, going up against higher and higher stakes, all in pursuit of saving whatever matters most to them.\nIn NTMO, you don\u2019t assign any numbers to your scoundrel when you\u2019re creating them. You don\u2019t add traits or apply abilities to affect your ability to succeed. Instead, your scoundrel is built on what matters most to them, and you decide what it is you\u2019re willing to risk when you come up against a check. The odds are always 50/50\u2014NTMO can be played with a coin flip instead of dice. Ready to risk a lot? Your outcome might improve\u2014or you might lose something that really matters to your character. You can always choose to play it safe, of course\u2026 but fortune favors the bold. Just remember: It\u2019s not about whether you succeed or fail, it\u2019s what you risk along the way.\nTry It Out!\nYou can play Never Tell Me the Odds now\u2014the beta playtest version is free right here! Grab a copy and risk it all today! \nReward Levels\nAdd-On\nStretch Goals\nIf Never Tell Me the Odds exceeds its goal, we have lots of exciting stretch goals to make your copy more awesome, including new art and new content! Goals for $1\u201310K are listed below, but more will be added if we smash these! \nAbout the Book\nThis Kickstarter is to release the PDF version of the full NTMO book, including species, specialties, location generators, faction details, creature creators, and more! Check out the full table of contents:\nBecome a Scoundrel\nIn NTMO, you play a space-scoundrel. Character creation takes only a few minutes, but creates deep scoundrels, driven by their values and desires. Start by choosing an identity for your character.  \nThe book includes...\n 12 FACTIONS to inspire your original character concept: Good Society, Hypervikings, the Order of the Stars, Space-Nihilists, the Galactic Congress, the Iron Imperium, the Merchant\u2019s League, the Slime Mob, Sci-Tech Incorporated, the Sprawn, the Revolutionary Allegiance, and Black$ail.\n 6 SPECIES, including 6 unique alien types: Human, Cyborg, Android, Robot, Sentient Animal, and Alien (Bug, Beast, Elemental, Ghost, Psychic, and Slime).\n 12 SPECIALTIES, each with their own unique strength: Bounty Hunter, Brawler, Burglar, Drifter, Gambler, Gunslinger, Hacker, Heartbreaker, Impostor, Peculiar, Smuggler, and Swindler.\nEach faction, species, and specialty will come with their own advantages, as well as inspiration and ideas for quickly building your unique character. \nTo finish building your scoundrel, choose what matters most to your scoundrel. Will reputation be most important to them? Relationships? Maybe they\u2019re driven by one core belief, or maybe they\u2019re vain about their physique, or greedy and materialistic. These choices, called factors, should be specific, but they don\u2019t need to be overly detailed. Here are some examples, and the book has hundreds more, tailor-made for different types of scoundrels:\n BELIEF (what you stand for): \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest idiot in the galaxy\u201d \u201cHonor gets you killed\u201d \u201cYou always gotta repay your debts\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a hero\u201d \u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you\u201d etc.\n PHYSIQUE (how you're built): Athletic, Gorgeous, Nimble, Intimidating, Built Like a Brick House, Incredibly Tall, Inconspicuous, Well-Groomed, etc.\n POSSESSION (what you have): Laser gun, Spaceship, Lucky dice, Personal communicator, Fake I.D., Medical kit, Navy uniform, Translator, Spacesuit, Tracking device, Robot sidekick, etc.\n RELATIONSHIP (who you care about): Partner, Parent, Sibling, Ex, Friend, Crush, Roommate, Classmate, Mentor, Student, Colleague, Employer, Neighbor, Ally, etc.\n REPUTATION (what you're known for): Best pilot in the galaxy, Best gambler you\u2019ve ever seen, A perfect shot, The ultimate charmer, Someone you wouldn\u2019t want to mess with, etc.\n RESOURCE (what you know): Secret bank account, An old favor, Blackmail material, Stolen data, Book of card tricks, Criminal contact, Corrupt official, etc.\nThat's it! You're ready to play.\nRunning Risks\nOnce the action is underway, you\u2019ll reach a point where you have to decide what your scoundrel is going to do in a situation with uncertain outcomes. When you reach a check, the storyteller, or Risk Moderator (RM), explains how risky the situation is. There are three options:\n High risk situations: Incredibly tense or difficult conditions with extreme outcomes, like trying to leap across a chasm, saying the perfect thing to comfort a grieving widow, engaging in combat with a deadly psychic warrior, or attempting a spacewalk to repair a ship as it spins towards a black hole.\n Moderate risk situations: Situations where the outcome matters but mistakes aren\u2019t deadly, like negotiating a deal, sneaking out of an airlock without being noticed, punching a brawler in a barfight, or charting a safe course through hostile terrain.\n Low risk situations: Low-stakes situations where not much will be lost by failure, like trying to impress a potential client, executing a correct docking procedure, playing a game of chance that\u2019s fixed in your favor, or intimidating a cowardly bureaucrat. \nWhen the RM describes a check, choose a single factor, and telling the table what it is and why it fits the check. It\u2019s up to you and the RM to work out how the factor is appropriate to the check. If you can\u2019t think of a reason that any of your factors apply to a check, consider allowing one of your crewmates to handle the check instead.\nWhen taking a risk and rolling dice, you can choose whether to downplay the risk (choosing to venture something you don't care much about), match it, or exceed it (risking something of great value). You can think of this as applying how much your scoundrel cares about a situation. If you exceed a risk, you'll always succeed, but you might endanger what you care about most.\nWhose Galaxy Is This, Anyway?\nIt's yours! Never Tell Me the Odds comes with ideas for a dozen factions you can build into your game, as well as ships, planets, civilizations, and aliens you might encounter on your interstellar travels. \nBut these are made to echo and reflect classic space opera tropes. You can play NTMO as a system to explore your favorite space-franchise, in a steampunk-flavored future, in a gritty cyberpunk alternate reality, or any world you choose. The worldbuilding tools are there for you to use if you want\u2014but it's your galaxy!\nThe Project Team\nTHE DESIGNER: David Somerville is the creator of Vast: The Crystal Caverns, Lightning & Bolt, and micro-RPGs like Accio Hogwarts.

Da jeder Spieler eine tragende Rolle in der Geschichte hat, nennt man diese Spiele auch Rollenspiele, und So nicht, Schurke! ist ein Rollenspiel speziell f\u00fcr Kinder und ihre Familien. Die Regeln sind so flexibel gestaltet, dass sich das Spiel m\u00fchelos an verschiedene Spielbegabungen und Komplexit\u00e4tsgrade anpasst. Ein mehrstufiges Charakterbau-System erm\u00f6glicht es schon Kindern ab f\u00fcnf Jahren problemlos Teil der Geschichte zu werden, w\u00e4hrend \u00e4ltere Geschwister und Erwachsene gleichzeitig auf einem h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeitsgrad spielen.

Die Charaktere, die es nach Fabula verschl\u00e4gt, sind selbst Kinder, die speziell daf\u00fcr auserw\u00e4hlt wurden, Fabula vor den Schurken zu besch\u00fctzen, die das B\u00f6se in die Welt bringen wollen. Zusammen mit lustigen, s\u00fc\u00dfen oder furchteinfl\u00f6\u00dfenden Begleitern und mithilfe von jeder Menge coolem und hilfreichem Kram brechen die Charaktere nach Fabula auf und k\u00e4mpfen f\u00fcr das Gute! \nNo Thank You, Evil! wird So nicht, Schurke!  \nSo nicht, Schurke! ist die deutsche \u00dcbersetzung des preisgekr\u00f6nten Spiels No Thank You, Evil! von Monte Cook Games. Der Verlag des bekannten amerikanischen Rollenspielautors Monte Cook hat seit 2012 f\u00fcr Furore in der Szene gesorgt. Allein das Grundregelwerk des Rollenspiels Numenera wurde in sieben Kategorien mit einem Ennie ausgezeichnet. Doch w\u00e4hrend Rollenspiel fr\u00fcher ein Hobby allein f\u00fcr Jugendliche zu sein schien, sind heute viele Fans erwachsen und haben Familien. Und sie wollen ihre Abenteuer gerne mit ihren Kindern teilen. Aber selten sind die Regelsysteme und Spielwelten der Rollenspiele kindgerecht. No Thank You, Evil! sollte genau diese L\u00fccke f\u00fcllen und ist bis heute einzigartig darin.\nDas Regelsystem basiert auf dem Cypher System, das auch Numenera zu Grunde liegt. Nach mehr als einem Jahr der Forschung im Bereich Kinderspiele und Spielerfahrungen wurde es so angepasst, dass es auch f\u00fcr kleine Kinder schon problemlos spielbar ist, ohne f\u00fcr \u00e4ltere langweilig zu werden. Dazu kam eine liebevoll designte Welt, die M\u00e4rchen und Gruselgeschichten wahr werden l\u00e4sst und die Kreativit\u00e4t anregt. No Thank You, Evil! wurde 2016 mit dem Ennie Gold Award und 2017 mit dem Origins Award ausgezeichnet, und es begeistert nicht nur alteingesessene Rollenspieler, sondern auch Neueinsteiger in das Hobby. Es war so erfolgreich, dass Monte Cook Games mehrere Erweiterungen geschaffen hat und das Grundspiel bereits in der zweiten Auflage erscheint. Und mit So nicht, Schurke! m\u00f6chte der Uhrwerk Verlag dieses besondere Spiel nun auch nach Deutschland bringen, zusammen mit allen Erweiterungen.\nDie Basisbox\nDieses Kickstarter-Projekt dient nicht nur der Finanzierung des Basisspiels von So nicht, Schurke!.

Nat\u00fcrlich gilt es auch, in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden alle Backer \u00fcber den Status des Projektes zu informieren und bei Nachfragen schnell und gezielt zu reagieren.\n\nDennoch k\u00f6nnen wir Verz\u00f6gerungen nat\u00fcrlich nicht ausschlie\u00dfen. Wir k\u00f6nnen euch aber versichern, dass wir euch zum einen stets \u00fcber eventuelle Verz\u00f6gerungen auf dem Laufenden halten werden und daran arbeiten diese schnellstm\u00f6glich zu beheben. Auch sind wir der Meinung, dass man nicht zu viele Crowdfunding-Projekte parallel laufen haben sollte, bevor die vorherigen Projekte weitestgehend abgeschlossen oder zumindest auf einem gut Weg sind \u2013 auch hier k\u00f6nnt ihr euch auf uns verlassen, dass wir uns nicht verzetteln.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Postkarte nach Fabula", "descp": "Du m\u00f6chtest uns einfach symbolisch unterst\u00fctzen oder \u00fcber die Neuheiten und Entwicklungen dieses Projekts auf dem Laufenden bleiben?

Those few who have seen its pages are now but blasted ash. It's your turn, mortal. Be careful when you turn its pages...\nThanks everyone for a terrific Kickstarter! If you missed it, you can find the finished product at www.goodman-games.com once it's in print!\nColor cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, also known as DCC RPG, is the most fun you\u2019ll ever have playing an RPG. It is also a game founded in principle. Important amongst those principles is an aversion to rules bloat. The DCC RPG core rulebook is but a single book. There are no splatbooks, sourcebooks, character books, monster manuals, or other supplements for DCC RPG. They are not needed. Incumbent upon the judge is the need to create: yon horizon is filled with adventure, and it is your adventure. You have worlds inside you: find them.\nYet the urge to create is a hungry god, and gods demand nourishment. It was originally conceived that an annual publication would exist in some form to showcase the brilliance of the DCC RPG community. This would be the DCC RPG Annual, published each year to distribute these gaming creations.\nThe best of things happened: the DCC RPG Annual was never needed. The DCC community burst forth a verdant jungle of inspiration, with ripe fruit on every limb. Blogs and personal posts; zines; community publications; the Gongfarmer\u2019s Almanac; officially licensed third-party works: there is a vast supply of inspiration from whence the DCC judge can draw and iterate.\nAnd thus we come here to Kickstart a volume which has no place. If you are a DCC fan, you absolutely do not need to support this Kickstarter. Should you to desire to do so, however, you will receive a book that has become a legend, despite never before being published.\nFoil cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs. Imagine this printed in gold foil on a leatherette background.\nThe DCC RPG Annual\nSpoken about for half a decade in hoary whispers, at long last Goodman Games brings you: the DCC RPG Annual. Much of the material for the DCC Annual was written between 2012 and 2014, when the original need was perceived. In many ways, it springs forth from the original inspirations of DCC RPG, which were psychically close at that time. There are magic swords. There are patrons. There are even more tables for making monsters unique. There are rules for making cleric deities more distinctive. There are rules for patron weapons and magic rings. There is the lost continent of Mu, and the hidden places between worlds. And there are rules for magical moustaches.\nThe DCC Annual is a hardcover estimated at 160 pages finished length. Like the original DCC RPG core rulebook, it is available in two cover options: a full-color and foil cover edition. It is organized in the same manner as the DCC RPG core rulebook: chapter three is equipment, chapter five is magic, and chapter nine is monsters, just as in the core rulebook. There is no chapter two, because the skills section of the core rulebook has no expansion material in the Annual.\nThe DCC Annual comes in two cover versions. The color cover is painted by Doug Kovacs and features Hugh the Barbarian and his Band. There's a story in this cover, a chapter of the Band history, for those who can find it. There is also a foil edition featuring a new foil design (and someone\u2019s decapitated head). For this Kickstarter, the foil edition will be printed in gold foil. The distribution version will be printed in silver foil. And never fear, art fans \u2013 the foil edition also features Doug's amazing cover art from the color cover edition (reproduced on the interior pages of the foil edition).\nYou absolutely do not need the DCC Annual to play DCC RPG, nor does any material in the Annual supersede or otherwise change the baseline game experience as expressed in the core rulebook. There is no rules bloat: only new vistas of imagination.\nAnd with every gift from the gods, comes a toll. Not only does this Kickstarter offer the DCC Annual, but it also offers three other artifacts to show your devotion: a new printing of the DCC RPG core book featuring yet more amazing art; a new hardcover edition of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin; and an opening offer of the DCC Quick Start Rules for new initiates. Read on! \nThe Shanna Dahaka cover to the DCC Core Rulebook! By Doug Kovacs\nNew Fans, Welcome!\nWe invite newcomers to join the Cult of DCC! As part of this Kickstarter, we are offering the DCC RPG Quick Start rules, in print+PDF format, for the ridiculously low price of $2.00. That price includes postage to anywhere in the world. If you haven\u2019t experienced DCC RPG, this is your chance to get in very affordably. The Quick Start Rules include everything needed to get your character from level 0 to level 2, and also include two one-session adventure modules. This pledge level also includes three free PDF adventures of our choosing.\nWe are also giving away a PDF of the Quick Start Rules for free at this link right here. If you\u2019re not sure what DCC RPG is, this is a great way to test the waters!\nAnd finally, if you as a newcomer decide you want to jump in a little deeper, we invite you to check out the Three Best Pledge Levels, detailed below. The Favored Retainer level offers an affordable way to get started on DCC RPG. \nThe pterodactyl-wizard cover to the DCC core rulebook! By Sanjulian\nDCC RPG Core Rulebook, 7th printing\nAlso offered in this Kickstarter are two other items of interest to the DCC gamer: a new printing of the core rulebook, including new cover art, and a compiled hardcover edition of DCC #83: the Chained Coffin.\nThe DCC RPG core rulebook has been through 4 hardcover and 2 softcover printings prior to this run. (And wow, isn\u2019t that amazing? Thanks everyone for the support!) Now that the hardcover is once again out of print, we are doing another printing.\nAs always, the content is materially identical to prior printings (except for fixing a couple typos). There will be a new adventure substituted in the back, as we do for each printing This printing includes \"Yddgrrl's Maze,\" a level 2 adventure by Michael Curtis. In addition, this print run will be distinguished by the covers. We are offering three covers on this hardcover edition:\n\u00b7 The \u201cbasic blue\u201d cover, the classic Doug Kovacs cover we all know and love.\n\u00b7 The Sanjulian cover. Fans of 1970's fantasy and sci-fi art will know Sanjulian's art from Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie, as well as his run of Conan covers. This is the red-and-yellow \u201cpterodactyl-wizard\u201d cover you see above. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo.\n\u00b7 Doug\u2019s new Shanna Dahaka cover. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo. \nThe hardcover 2nd printing of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. Cover art by Ken Kelly\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin (hardcover 2nd printing)\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin was originally released way back in 2014. The boxed set proved immensely popular, and not just for the spinning map puzzle. The Appalachian-style fantasy setting of The Shudder Mountains, inspired by the works of Appendix N author Manly Wade Wellman, provides a unique place for your characters to adventure. Michael Curtis did a wonderful job of bringing The Shudder Mountains alive, and several supplemental volumes were published.\nNow that the original boxed set is out of print, we are offering a hardcover book that compiles all material from the original DCC #83: The Chained Coffin boxed set, including all the stretch goal booklets, as well as much, much more:\n\u00b7 All content from DCC #83.1: Tales of the Shudder Mountains and DCC #83.2: Death Among the Pines\n\u00b7 The Shudder Mountain material published in several Gen Con Program Guides\n\u00b7 Moon Eyes and Fire-Flies, a new adventure set in the Shudder Mountains\n\u00b7 Buzzard Hollow, a new Shudder Mountains mini-setting\n\u00b7 Ma Bigginty\u2019s Book of Backwoods Wisdom,a collection of inspiration material that will bring the Shudder Mountains to life in your game\nThe DCC #83 hardcover is estimated at 160 pages and yes, it will also include the spinning map puzzle! (We are working with the printer on logistics, but the most likely scenario is having the map tucked inside the back cover of each hardcover.)\nOne last thing. Doug\u2019s original art for DCC #83 is amazing, but you know we like variety. The hardcover edition features new art by none other than fantasy legend Ken Kelly. Fans of 1970s Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie will also recognize the work of Ken Kelly, whose career also includes a long stretch of amazing illustrations. And his illustration builds on Doug\u2019s original design for the chained coffin itself. And don\u2019t worry, Doug\u2019s original cover art will also appear in the hardcover edition.\nDCC #83 will also be available in a foil edition, featuring the same amazing image that was printed on the limited-run foil editions of the original module. This cover art is timeless and deserves to remain in print. The Kickstarter edition will feature a different foil color than the distribution edition.\nThe original \"blue cover\" edition of DCC RPG core rulebook. By Doug Kovacs\nThe Three Best Pledge Levels\nIf you'd like to buy copies individually, the table below shows their cost. You can add on funds to purchase more than one book. However, there are some bundle deals that offer a great value. See the summary after the table: \nThe Three Best Pledge Levels. We are offering three great deals that make it easy to back multiple books in this Kickstarter. If you\u2019re a new fan, a dedicated fan, or a diehard collector, one of these is for you.\nFavored Retainer: You are new to the adventure, and you have promise. This pledge level is for new DCC fans and offers a $120 of product for $100. You\u2019ll receive the color-cover editions of the DCC Annual, core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. If you would like to have the Sanjulian or Shanna Dahaka covers for the DCC Core Rulebook, pledge for this level and add an extra +$20 for the price difference.\n Name Level: Your fame precedes you within the DCC community. This $150 pledge is a $30 savings on the cover price of $180. At the Name Level pledge, you\u2019ll receive DCC Annual (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), DCC #83: The Chained Coffin (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), and a copy of the DCC RPG core rulebook, with your choice of either the Sanjulian or Doug Kovacs cover.\nLanded Lord: Other fans make pilgrimage to witness to your legendary collection. This $300 pledge is a $60 savings on the cover price of $360. As a Landed Lord, you will receive everything offered in the Kickstarter, which is seven books: both covers of the DCC Annual, both covers of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin, and all three covers of the DCC RPG core rulebook (7th printing).\nPrint + PDF\nEvery print copy of the DCC Annual, DCC core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin books offered in this Kickstarter also includes a PDF edition.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThis is stated elsewhere but also to call it out explicitly: this Kickstarter features cover variants that are exclusive as follows:\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Sanjulian edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Doug Kovacs Shanna Dahaka edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC Annual, foil cover edition: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\n\u00b7 DCC #83: The Chained Coffin: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\nShipping Costs\nPlease note that shipping costs are not included in the pledge levels. Shipping costs will be assessed at a later date via Backer Kit. \nUSA shipments will ship via media mail, bound printed matter or equivalent rates.\nInternational shipments will ship via a tracked service, most likely FedEx or UPS. We will endeavor to find the cheapest option, and also partner with international shipping partners where possible to reduce VAT charges via local-market shipping. \nThe exact cost of each shipment will vary according to the content but please be aware that the hardcover books in this Kickstarter are heavy. International backers should expect to pay minimum postage charges for a single book of at least $20-$25 for Canada, $30-$35 for Europe, and $35-$40 for Australia and Asia. Additional books will obviously add to this cost. Final cost will be assessed via Backer Kit. \nStretch Goals\nWe have learned over the years that there are so many ways to make these books cool! We\u2019ve already worked out a couple options as options for stretch goals, which are listed below. As the project progresses we are open to suggestions from fans on others!\nAt $40,000: CLEARED!We will print new color art on the endsheets of the DCC Annual.\nAt $65,000: CLEARED! We will print maps on the endsheets of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. PLUS we will include a free 11x17 poster print of one piece of cover art with every print pledge!\nAt $80,000: CLEARED!Free adventure! For every book you buy, you'll get one free DCC adventure module in PDF format (exact module to be determined). (The $2 quick start rules don't count!)\nAt $100,000: CLEARED! We will include satin ribbon bookmarks in the DCC Core Rulebook and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin.\nAt $125,000: CLEARED!We will include printed 11\u201dx17\u201d posters of the cover art. There will be several \u201ccheckpoints\u201d on this stretch goal and we\u2019ll use backer feedback to decide which posters to print \u2013 the Chained Coffin cover, the Annual cover, the Sanjulian cover, etc. (Or maybe we\u2019ll just blow past this stretch goal and print them all!)\nBeyond that: We have some fun ideas. We would like to print custom dust jackets featuring the Deadly Hands of DCC art that premiered at Gen Con 2018. Some fans have requested books bound in real leather, and that may be an option we unlock. And we\u2019re open to your ideas as well!\nThe Demon Skull Add-On\nWe are also producing a version of the DCC RPG core rulebook that features the original iconic demon skull image.

Miniatures is seeking to add 5 new dice of unusual size with mass production of new dice for their dice chains! \nFirst up the D36-2D6\nA D36 (results from 1 to 36) that also accurately shows the results of rolling 2 D6s as well (the pips above and below the D36 show the result of each D6).   The combination of being able to roll 3 dice with each roll allows you to create some interesting new fantasy tables for your RPGs.   One samples is shown below\nNext we have a D21 (the super crit die)\nThe D21 (results from 1 to 21) extends the dice chain that Impact! offers with now all the numbers of sided dice from D3 to D21.  The D21 should make a fun element for a DM/GM.  If you feel that a player is playing very well or has important advantages for an upcoming D20 roll ... hand them the D21 to roll instead allowing them 2 chances to Crit a natural 20.\n Two new alphabet dice into the mix\nThe D26 Alphabet die with the entire alphabet on it was popular from the last KickStarter.  So for those creating/playing word games we added to complimentary dice to expand the options.   We split the D26 into a D5 and D21.    The D21 has all the consonants on it and the D5 has the five major vowels on it.\nFinally we are adding a Fate die to the mix based on a human pulse!\nFate RPG systems are fun alternative systems.  This converts the +, +, -, -, 0, 0 into a human pulse going around the die.  See a pulse (+), flatline (-) and then 2 blank sides.\nDICE CHAINS  (What are they?  Why are they great?)\nI have helped several game companies design rules for games.  When I was introduced to Dice Chain Mechanics for RPGs by Dungeon Crawl Classics and Freeblades I realized they created just a smoother set of rules for RPGs.  \nWith a standard RPG as your character progresses he/she receives +1 or more to their dice rolls but then you need special rules that a roll of a natural 1 still fails in the rules.  With Dice Chain mechanics as you character progresses the next dice in the chain is used.  So at level 2 your Barbarian rolls a D11 instead of a D10 when using an axe.  No need for special rules for failure as a 1 is still possible when they roll.  \nCOLORS\nBelow are the colors that you can choose from for all of the dice sets in the project.  9 opaque colors and 5 specialty colors. \nDICE MENU\nBelow is a menu that you can use the amount you pledge plus any bonus dollars your reward level offers to pick your own custom reward.  When the pledge manager is released after the project is over, each backer will be able to select the dice sets, dice and colors that you want from the below menu.  All backers can add extra to their amount pledged to any reward level to use to shop with on the dice menu.  Stretch Goals many add on additional bonus dollars for you to use for free.  \nPLEASE NOTE AT THIS TIME FOR THE NEW DICE:\nAll 5 dice (D36-2D6, D21 (numbered), D21 (consonant), D5 (vowel) and Pulse Fate) are only available in Black and Purple for opaque colors and Glow in the Dark and Translucent Teal for specialty colors.\n(more colors will unlock when stretch goals are reached)\nQuick Read Dice Menu first (provided by Backer Alvin Helms)\nSTANDARD SHIPPING\nShipping will be charged after the KickStarter is over as part of the pledge manager based on current shipping costs.   Currently I expect these charges to be $5 for US shipping, $13 for Canada shipping and $17 to the Rest of the World.   PLEASE NOTE:  Shipping is EU friendly.   In the 4 previous dice KickStarters I ran I did not have anyone report paying customs so there should be no risk of customs charges on your reward.  \nWAVE 1 EARLY SHIPPING\nYou can add on money to your pledge for shipping your order early (or in 2 shipments).  Wave 1 shipping will be before February 2019 instead of September 2019.  This means any dice in your reward that are ready to ship by end of year will be shipped to you by February 2019 and any dice not yet in will ship to you as soon as they come in.  For an extra $5 for US addresses, $13 for Canada or $17 Rest of the World, your reward will ship (or as much as possible will ship) in February 2019.\n\"Pulse\" FATE / FUDGE Dice KickStarter and The Merged D6 (Md6) Revoluntionary Dice KickStarter Backers\nWhile I have no connection to either of these KickStarter projects that never delivered those dice to the backers, I will work with you to get the dice I made similar to those projects.  If you just want to get those dice at cost (you can pledge for the $2 reward level) and after I confirm you were a backer of one or both of those projects I can get you those dice for cost. \nOR you can pledge for this dice from this project and let me know you backed one or both of those projects and I will give you one free Pulse Fate die or one free D36-2D6 for every $10 you pledge up to the amount you should have received from those projects that you backed.\nSOCIAL MEDIA  (or How you can help get yourself and everyone else more free dice and options)\nBelow are a list of stretch goal for the project.  I will do everything I can do get the project out there but nothing works for unlocking stretch goals like the backers of a project giving it some assistance.   Share the project on Facebook, Send out a Tweet that you backed it, Let friends know about it on group pages and forums.

We also are very busy people and we always want to avoid the hassle that comes with the preparation for a tournament and handling of game elements during the game \u2013 all this takes those precious minutes-turning-into-hours, stealing from our fun time. This is why we gave a good thought on how to facilitate the game process by reducing the number of operations and instead \u2013 focus on the game.\nThis was the beginning of our new range, a series of smart and useful devices for true board game lovers. This October, exclusively on Kickstarter, we are launching The Ugears Games collection, designed especially for those who like the challenge and excitement of a game and appreciate the beauty of clever mechanisms:  the Card Holder, the modular Dice Tower, the Deck Box, the Game Master\u2019s Screen, and traditionally the Secret model, which we have just revealed.  In this Campaign the secret model is the Dice Keeper.\nThe Card Holder Mechanical Device (a prototype photo)\nThe Card Holder accommodates up to 500 game cards in 16 compartments with spacers (a prototype photo)\nThe Modular Dice Tower can be used as a traditional dice tower (a prototype photo)\nThe Modular Dice Tower is comprised of a set of 4 individual dice cups that can either open completely or set ajar (a prototype photo)\nThe Game Master's Screen.

No matter what type of a board game you prefer these days \u2013 the variety of available smart wooden gadgets will have something to offer you.\nThe devices of Ugears Games collection are useful and functional: they will serve to store, transport, and save space on your gaming table. Traditionally, our products are not merely a functionality: the iconic Ugears design and intricate beautiful woodwork makes them attractive game accessories, unique d\u00e9cor elements, and a wonderful present to a fellow-gamer.\nThe Ugears Games collection will take your gaming experience to a new level: our new devices will make sure you can bravely explore your gaming universe without distractions and interruptions. \nThe Ugears Games Devices project is designed to help people to improve their gaming experience by eliminating all those additional operations, saving time and space to focus on your favorite game in the nice company of friends. We are glad to be back on Kickstarter. It provides live and direct communication with people from different countries from all round the world who share our ideas, interests, and this hobby. It\u2019s really inspiring for us. We appreciate your feedback. Now it is time to make your move! So follow us, support us and be the part of our success story. \nEmail us: myugears@ugearsmodels.com\nMedia-Kit download \nThe Card Holder: Mechanical Device Designed to Put Your Cards and Gaming Table in Order   \nAs it very often occurs in a large-scale board game that involves a lot of cards, the available space on the gaming table becomes a real problem. In addition, due to the lack of room, the cards mix up ruining the course of game and making the players return to sorting them over and over again. The Card Holder, a smart wooden box, is designed to eliminate these annoying inconveniences.  \nThis device allows you to sufficiently improve the game by handling your cards while saving space on the gaming table. The space savings is so efficient that you can easily enjoy you game sitting at a table smaller than your regular one - with the same number of players. If you\u2019re out of time and the game is only half-way through, take a picture of your battle field and continue the game later from that point.\nThe attractive wooden exterior of the Card Holder hides a smart extending mechanism that turns the box into ergonomic staircase shelves that allow you to conveniently pick a card from any stack in your Card Holder. Your new clever device has 12 compartments with spacers that accommodate up to 400 63.5\u044588 mm (2.48\u201d x 3.46\u201d) cards. The compartments are big enough to hold the cards in sleeves. In the extended mode the Card Holder enables four extra slots for up to 100 cards of 45\u044568 mm (1.77\u201d x 2.68\u201d) size.\nIn between games, your Card Holder will serve as a convenient and reliable storage unit: place your cards securely inside the device, lock with a self-contained latch. It is now ready to travel in your backpack. \nThe Card Holder from Ugears will clear your table to ensure the most efficient arrangement of game elements and maximum comfort to the players.\nModular Dice Tower\nA clever adaptable model, the Modular Dice Tower can be used as a traditional dice tower as well as a set of four individual dice cups. The cups can either open completely or set ajar, which is especially convenient in case a player would like to avoid sharing the results of his roll but wants to take a peek himself. \nThis device is one of the most fun ones: each of the modules has detachable details. Reorganize them in accordance with the detailed instruction manual that comes with the model and you will have a single multistoried Dice Tower. Originally, The Modular Dice Tower is comprised of four dice cups, but you are not limited to four blocks. Two sets of this 3D puzzle will give you an eight-storied Dice Tower and twice as much fun! \nIndividually, the dice cups can serve the quartet of gamers in their quest. No more running after a runaway die or crawling under the table searching for the game piece that jumped off the edge. Just put your dice inside a small cubical box and give it a good shake. Put your dice cup back on the table and simultaneously push the buttons on the sides. This will release the bottom of the box with your dice sitting in it. Now it is time to make your move!\nEvery individual cup is perfectly compatible with each other and you and your friends can build the world tallest dice tower limited only by the number of cups you have \u2013 and your imagination. \nThe original idea of this device is its adaptability. Individually, the dice cups can serve the quartet of gamers in their quest or can be transformed into a single multistoried Dice Tower. The wall of each dice cup has the same design. Your question was: \u201cAre you going to introduce alternative designs of the fantasy-style face on the individual dice cups?\u201d\nWe say YES, we are. Our team has developed a number of new styles for individual cups. We would like to share the modified designs of these layouts. The Modular Dice Tower is comprised of 4 dice cups, each has its own fantasy-style face. So you can mix them as you wish among co-players and each storey of the Dice Tower will have its own face. We would appreciate your feedback for this idea. \nGame Master's Screen\nThis folding screen with an easy cheat sheets replacement mechanism and a built-in dice-tower helps the TRPG Master to better comprehend the game world mechanics and smoothly lead the game: at any time the Game Master can check necessary information by easily changing one sheet with another. \nThe Game Master can conceal his personal treasures and secrets behind the Screen, such as notes about the game, figurines and even a cup of tea. The built-in dice tower adds extra-suspense to the game: the time between the moment when the Master\u2019s dice fall and the revealed results charge the atmosphere with extreme excitement.  \nWhen folded together, this unconventional looking device resembles a large book. Completely unfolded it opens as a screen with four panels, each of which has a special rubber-band fixture to hold an A4 size sheet of paper. Of course, you don\u2019t have to use all four panels at the same time. If you need to save space on your gaming table, you can easily fold one or two panels away.\nThe fantasy inspired detail of the wooden panels is designed to make you feel like a real Master of the Game holding an ancient folio about an adventure, the greatest of them all. \nCompletely unfolded it opens as a screen with four panels, each of which has a special rubber-band fixture to hold an A4 size sheet of paper. This was an original idea and we left out the US paper standard! Your comments helped us to work in the required changes and make the device perfectly suitable for US Letter 8.5\" x 11\" (215.9 x 279.4mm) size of sheets.\nMechanical Deck Box\nThe Mechanical Deck Box is a must-have for those who like Collectible Card Games and Living Card Games. Your cards will always be in perfect order waiting for you to push the button to release them from the comfortable compartments of the Deck Box.\nThe Deck Box is a handsome small chest that will fit nicely in the palm of your hand. The inner compartments can accommodate up to 120 game cards (traditional, sleeved or double sleeved) 2.48\u201d x 3.46\u201d (63.5\u044588 mm), 60 cards each. \nPushing special ledges on the sides of its lid triggers a mechanism that opens the box: the upper parts of the side panels slide down while the lid opens to the sides granting convenient access to two inner compartments. The device automatically latches in the open mode. \nTo close it, push the button on the body of the model. This will release a spring loaded mechanism that will return the side panels and the lid to their initial position. Your cards will stay secured inside, protected from spillage and damage.\nIn the preliminary stage of the campaign, we shared the link for your feedback and later received many questions such as whether the Deck Box accommodates the cards from different games in sleeves or double sleeves. We have already made changes in the Deck Box design and increased the size of two inner compartments. \nNow, the Mechanical Deck Box is suitable for: \nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm size without sleeves = 120 pcs (60 pcs in each compartment)\nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm with sleeves with one plastic side = 80 pcs (40 pcs in each compartment)\nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm with classic sleeves = 110 pcs (55 pcs in each compartment)\nthe cards of up to 63,5 \u0445 88 mm with double sleeves = 76 pcs (38 pcs in each compartment)\nSecret Model = Dice Keeper\nIt became a good tradition for the Ugears team to prepare special and amazing add-ons along with main rewards. And the name of this secret intriguing device for tabletop games is Dice Keeper. \nThe Dice Keeper is a perfect game accessory that keeps your dice safe and secure, sitting comfortably in individual slots. Designed to store dices  it can also accommodate tiny trinkets, jewelry, miniature souvenirs or secret micro-chips. \nThe Dice Keeper (prototype photo)\nThe Dice Keeper is a small chest with fine carved ornamentation in a fantasy style. A minimalistic opening mechanism lowers the side panels of the chest revealing its contents.\nThe model has the shape of a compact cube with 8 compartments to accommodate a standard dice set. A mechanism lifting the walls securely sets your dice inside to prevent from spilling and being lost in transit.\nIf you are a dice collector, a passionate gamer, or just fond of unique mechanical devices, The Dice Keeper will become your favorite accessory to your table top battles. The Ugears design makes it also a unique d\u00e9cor element, or a great present for your gamer friends.\n Ugears Games Devices Collection: Early Birds, Rewards and Add-Ons \nIf you would like to add a few devices to your pledge, simply add the cost of the device to the cost of devices in your pledge and indicate all the devices you pledged for in the survey after the campaign.

Have you ever wanted to join that tiny world and emulate your favorite mousey characters?\nThe Rodent Rangers RPG is your chance to do just that! In this family-friendly tabletop game, you and your friends or family take on the roles of mice (or other small critters) living in the modern human world. Your characters are field agents of an international organization of problem-solvers called the Rodent Rangers, and you'll be sent out on adventures to help those in need.\nYour captain will send you where your skills can do the most good!\nWhat's the Game Like?\nRodent Rangers is set in the modern world, with mice (and other small critters) living right under the noses of oblivious humans. While humans continue under the delusion that theirs is the only civilization, mice live happily in the walls, basements and sewers of human cities, furnishing themselves with the scavenged scraps of the humans' materials and tech.\nThe organization known as the Rodent Rangers is headquartered in the basement of the American Red Cross building in Washington, D.C. From there, teams of agents with a variety of skill sets are sent all over the globe on missions to help others, whether by rescuing lost or stranded civilians, bringing supplies to disaster sites, recovering stolen relics, or unraveling mysteries.\nLike most tabletop RPGs, Rodent Rangers is a game of collaborative storytelling in which players get to play the protagonists of the story, and roll dice to determine the outcomes of risky or uncertain actions. Your attributes and skills combine to determine a pool of dice to roll, and if enough dice roll a 4 or higher, then your action succeeds. With clever decisions, a bit of luck, and a lot of courage, your mice will overcome obstacles and save the day!\nThe dice will help you tell your stories of problem solving, helping others, and even foiling the schemes of dastardly villains!\nWhat's the Product? \nThe Rodent Rangers Core Rulebook will give you all the rules and guidance you need to create your characters and dive into a world of mouse-sized adventure. Additionally, The Wreck of the Morning Lady offers a ready-made story for you to play through if you want to get a game under your belt before creating adventures of your own. \nBoth of these titles will be published electronically as PDF files via DriveThruRPG.com, where they will also be available via the site's own print-on-demand (POD) functionality. But remember, getting these books as pledge rewards will be cheaper than buying them at retail, so don't miss out!\nUnlike many RPGs, Rodent Rangers doesn't require your hero to be a fighter. You can save the day as a scholarly expert too!\nWhere is my money going?\nGreat question! Exact numbers will depend on the final funding amount, and even the proportions might change due to some costs scaling differently than others. Even so, here's an approximate breakdown:\nMost of the money pays for art, writing, and development; I've also budgeted for the taxes/fees involved plus a small buffer for unforeseen expenses.\nWho is working on this project?\nThe original concept/design of the game, as well as the raw manuscript of the starter adventure, are authored by my brother, Joseph L Kellogg. We've contracted for him to pass the torch to me to do all the development and make publication happen. The sample art you've seen above was created by Carolyn Paplham and Meghan Dornbrock.\nWill there be any Stretch Goals?\nIf the project funds quickly, then I'd be happy to add some stretch goals! Sound off in the comments to let me know what you'd like to see if we reach that point.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is being published electronically and through a reliable print-on-demand service, you get to skip all the risks associated with a traditional print run.

Although I'm confident I can complete the project (my previous project is on schedule), there is always the possibility of flaky contractors or me getting hit by a bus.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jacob S Kellogg\n4 created \u00b7 16 backed\nBestselling tabletop game designer.

Practicing type design with two very different approaches (one practical and historical, the other theoritical and fictionnal) this project is a chance for us to try and produce a unique typeface, called Erwin, using an unexpected process and making this campain both a visual and theoritical playground.\nUne fonte variable quantique ?\n\u2014 A quantum variable font?\n[fr] Les fontes variables, nouveaux n\u00e9s des standards du format OpenType semblent \u00eatre pour tous le futur in\u00e9luctable de la typographie. Les caract\u00e8res ne sont plus ancr\u00e9s dans une tangibilit\u00e9 claire aux contours finis, mais plut\u00f4t pens\u00e9s comme des nuages aux formes \u00e9th\u00e9r\u00e9es, pr\u00eats \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser tous nos souhaits. Nous sommes aujourd'hui addicts \u00e0 ces possibilit\u00e9s infinies.\nLe caract\u00e8re que nous comptons produire pour cette campagne, l'Erwin, n'embrasse pas cette complexit\u00e9 et pr\u00e9f\u00e8re se penser comme une boite de Schr\u00f6dinger. Une infinit\u00e9 de possibles, oui, mais uniquement en th\u00e9orie. Con\u00e7ue \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'une fonte variable, avec quatre extr\u00e8mes aux structures bien diff\u00e9rentes, une seule instance sera finalement tir\u00e9e au hasard parmi l'enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 du design space. Une fois ce caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 nous nous engageons \u00e0 d\u00e9truire d\u00e9finitivement les quatre masters originaux, faisant de cette instance la seule it\u00e9ration jamais possible. Ainsi, personne n\u2019aura jamais connaissance des autres formes qu\u2019aurait pu rev\u00eatir l'Erwin.\nLa fonte sera ensuite plac\u00e9e sous licence SIL Open Font, la rendant libre, autorisant son utilisation, sa modification et sa redistribution par qui le souhaite, gratuitement.\n[en] Variable fonts, the latest innovation of the OpenType format, seem to be the inevitable future of type design. Fonts are no longer tangible entities, but rather conceived as clouds made of etherical shapes, ready to realise our every whishes, making us addicted to infinit possisibilities.\nErwin, the typeface are going to produce for this campain, rejects this kind of complexity and thinks itself more as a Schr\u00f6dinger box. Infinite possibilities, only as long as it is not released. Designed as a variable font with four extremes featuring very different structures, only one iteration will randomly be picked out of the desin space. We then promess to destroy the masters, making the one generated instance the only outcome ever. Nobody will ever know the other forms that the font could have incarnated.\nThe font will ultimately be distributed under SIL Open font License, making it free for anyone to download, use, distribute and modify it.\nComment l\u2019it\u00e9ration sera-t-elle tir\u00e9e au hasard ?\n\u2014 How will the iteration be randomly picked?\n  Design space de l'Erwin (design non d\u00e9finitif)\n[fr] Toute participation \u00e0 la campagne, m\u00eame pour 1\u20ac, aura une influence sur la forme finale du caract\u00e8re. Le principe est le suivant : nous d\u00e9marrerons en pla\u00e7ant notre curseur au centre du design space ; chaque contribution au projet entra\u00eenera ensuite la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d'un v\u00e9ritable nombre al\u00e9atoire via un ordinateur quantique, faisant se d\u00e9placer notre curseur dans une direction. C'est ainsi que sera d\u00e9gag\u00e9e d'une infinit\u00e9 de possibles, une instance unique.\n[en] Every participation to the campain, even with 1\u20ac, will influence the final shape of the typeface. Here's how it's gonna go: we'll start by placing a cursor at the center of our design space; every contribution will generate of a true random number via a quantum computer, making our cursor move in one direction. This system will build a path, chosing a unique instance from infinite possibilities.\nPourquoi le dessin de l\u2019Erwin est-il aussi bizarre ?\n\u2014 Why are Erwin's shapes so weird?\nProcessus de selection des signes\n[fr] La m\u00e9thode de construction des quatre masters de l'Erwin utilise d\u00e9j\u00e0 en elle-m\u00eame un part de hasard. Chaque lettre est selectionn\u00e9e parmi quelques dizaines de milliers de signes compos\u00e9s de troits traits de trois points et g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement pour l'occasion. Chacun de ces signes est ensuite retravaill\u00e9 et r\u00e9oragnis\u00e9 par nos soins. Nous ne cherchons pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des lettres totalement hasardeuses mais \u00e0 nous laisser surprendre par des formes nouvelles et \u00e0 pouvoir investir des dessins lib\u00e9r\u00e9s de certains aprioris. Il en r\u00e9sulte des structures \u00e9tranges mais n\u00e9amoins suffisamment lisibles pour un caract\u00e8re de titrage.\n[en] The design of Erwin's four masters already uses some sort of randomess. Each letter is selected from dozen of thousands symbols, all with the same amount of lines and nodes. Each of these selected symbols is then reworked and rearranged. We are not trying to create totally random letters, we just want to be surprised with new forms, freed from aprioris. Certainly strange, the results stay legible as a display font.\nProjection du sp\u00e9cimen (non d\u00e9finitif)\nMais si l'Erwin est libre, qu'est ce que je gagne alors ?\n\u2014 If Erwin is free, what's in it for me?\n[fr] Ce projet ne se limite pas \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation typographique, nous produirons \u00e9galement un sp\u00e9cimen imprim\u00e9 qui ne sera pas une simple d\u00e9monstration du caract\u00e8re.

Sammons for Chaosium Inc's 7th edition Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. It has a dark tone, like most Stygian Fox titles, more akin to True Detective and American Horror Story and is written for Mature Gamers Only. The scenarios look into the dark heart of humanity and the mythos... but this book has a twist.\nOne of the problems long term Keepers can face when running Call of Cthulhu is their players becoming too jaded or blas\u00e9 regarding the Cthulhu mythos. \n\"Oh, Deep Ones? Yeah, we've killed these before. Open fire.\"\nRather than; \"Oh my God! They're real! Run!\"\nIt's difficult to maintain that suspension of belief when you have been facing the same creatures year after year. This is where Occam's Razor comes in, being a collection of scenarios where initially they seem to be linked to the mythos but they have mundane causes and outcomes.\nI have run these type of scenarios for twenty years and every time they sucker players in and help them see how paranoid their characters have become and, more importantly, when it comes time to face the actual mythos again, many players believe the adventure will have a mundane cause. When interspersed with mythos adventures this leads to some serious panic when the players realise that this is real. Used sparingly, these adventures lull players into a false sense of security and make the next real mythos encounter all the more vivid.\n\nOne of my players had his character just stand and watch as a colleague was eaten by a dark shadow in a toy store because the player refused to believe it was a mythos entity. This was a ten year veteran of the game.\n\nOf course, a separate sidebar is provided for each adventure if you wish to have actual mythos elements in your game. \nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\n Brian M. Sammons has created 6 scenarios which tease at mythos causes but will ultimately lead to a mundane resolution. A murder is just a murder, a cult site is just kids with spray paints, etc. Here is a summary of the scenarios contained within the book.\n\nDeep and Dark \u2013 the investigators find a snuff film on the dark web, but one of a pretty girl getting mauled by a Fishman monster. Did the deep ones mess up and accidentally get filmed in this modern world where everyone has a camera phone or is it something else?  \nEye of the Beholder \u2013 an art student goes missing while doing late night research in a museum with ties to the local university. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence that the museum just got in a huge statue from South America of a little-known death god called Thul\u2019Cathul. Yep, total coincidence.  \nThe Watchers \u2013 a woman living alone in an apartment in the big city notices that people are watching her. Following her. They even broke into her home. But why? What do they want and how far will they go?  \nA Whole Pack of Trouble \u2013 a group of film school students go to an isolated, abandoned, and reportedly haunted asylum to make a found-footage horror movie and make a fortune? Whatever could go wrong with that? Well, when the filmmakers go missing the investigators will have to find out.  \nA Cleansing Flame \u2013 People are dying by fire. No one knows why and no one knows how. When the latest victim is a friend to one of the investigators and an astronomer who reportedly made a recent discovery of note, it\u2019s up to the investigators to put out these flames.  \nVisions From Beyond - Tommy is a friend who makes some new friends. That\u2019s nice. Unfortunately those friends have a strange reputation, they get up to some bizarre practices, and then one night Tommy calls one of the investigators in terror, begging for help, then the line goes dead. What\u2019s a friend and an investigator of the Mythos to do?\nThe book will be in PDF, ePub, Softcover, and hardcover formats and will be full colour.\nBrian M. Sammons - Writer\n\nBrian is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and the Chief Editor for Golden Goblin Press, a film and literature critic for over twenty years and has penned stories that have appeared in such anthologies as Arkham Tales, Horrors Beyond, and many more. He has edited the books; Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, and Dread Shadows in Paradise, among others. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Secrets, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.

She has been writing for Alarums & Excursions since 1991, and has written material for Unknown Armies and reviews for The Familiar, The Unspeakable Oath, and RPG.net. She has edited and proofread games and scenarios from Arc Dream Publishing, Golden Goblin Press, Modiphius Entertainment, Parenthesis Press, and Rogue Games.

F\u00fcr unsere \u00dcbersetzung wurde die norwegische Originalausgabe verwendet und mit der englischsprachigen Version abgeglichen.\nIn Itras By geben wir euch zwei Dinge mit auf den Weg: Zum einen zeigen wir euch einen Ort, an dem die Unwirklichkeit hinter jeder Stra\u00dfenecke lauert. Wir sind selbst schon in diesen Stra\u00dfen herumgewandert, aber wir wollen euch nicht mitnehmen in unsere Stadt. Ihr sollt nicht auf unsere Reise gehen, sondern euren eigenen Weg durch die Stadt finden. Deswegen geben wir euch auch Hilfen zum Rollenspiel an die Hand: Tipps und Tricks, die ihr brauchen k\u00f6nnt, um die Stadt zum Leben zu erwecken und die Hauptrollen zu \u00fcbernehmen. \nIm Verlauf dieser Kickstarter-Kampagne werden wir euch das Spiel n\u00e4her vorstellen. In den Updates erwarten Euch mehr Informationen zum Surrealismus, den Stadtteilen und den Spielkarten - hinzu kommen Lektionen und Ausz\u00fcge aus dem Buch, Kampagnenideen und noch einiges mehr. Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich versuchen wir auch, eure Fragen zu beantworten und n\u00e4her auf eure Wunschthemen einzugehen.\nItras By wird voraussichtlich 304 Seiten haben. Im Buch befindet sich eine ausgiebige Beschreibung von Itras Stadt, die kompletten Spielregeln sowie das Einsteiger-Abenteuer \u201eNr.13\u201c. Die leichten Spielregeln machen dabei nur einen kleinen Teil des Buches aus: den gr\u00f6\u00dften Teil nehmen die Beschreibungen, Ideen und Tipps und Tricks ein. \nBegleitet wird das Buch von einem Set Entscheidungs- und Zufallskarten, welches zum Spielen ben\u00f6tigt wird. Als Produkt ist das Kartenset allerdings optional \u2013 die wichtigsten Karten werden im Anhang des Buches zum Kopieren bzw. als freies PDF zum Selbstausdrucken bereitgestellt. \n F\u00fcr die Sammler unter Euch wird das Buch wird auch als streng limitiertes Hardcover erh\u00e4ltlich sein - handnummeriert und in schwarzem Kunstleder gebunden.\nDie \u00dcbersetzungen des Originalmaterials, Layout und Illustration sind weitestgehend abgeschlossen. Mittels einer Crowdfunding-Finanzierung ist es uns aber erst m\u00f6glich, dieses Rollenspiel auf den deutschen Markt zu bringen. Dazu w\u00fcrden wir gerne eine kleine Auflage dieses Spiels drucken lassen, ohne auf Print-on-Demand-Dienste zur\u00fcckgreifen zu m\u00fcssen. Diese Kickstarter-Kampagne soll uns dabei helfen. Gleichzeitig erm\u00f6glicht uns die Kampagne, abzusch\u00e4tzen, ob in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt Interesse an Itras By besteht - und wenn ja, wie gro\u00df dieses ist.\nAlle Stretchgoals beziehen sich auf die Qualit\u00e4t oder den Umfang des Regelwerks oder des Kartensets.\nEinzelne B\u00fccher und Kartendecks k\u00f6nnen auch zus\u00e4tzlich zur ausgew\u00e4hlten Belohnung hinzugenommen werden - das gilt auch f\u00fcr das PDF. Dazu m\u00fcsst ihr einfach die unten genannten Preise der jeweiligen Produkte beim Bezahlen manuell hinzuf\u00fcgen - wir fragen nach Abschluss der Kampagne ab, welche ihr gew\u00e4hlt habt. \nFalls ihr also aus irgendeinem Grund (z.B. als Geschenk)  das Buch, das PDF oder das Kartendeck mehrfach haben wollt, d\u00fcrfte es sich lohnen, hier zuzugreifen. \nPDF \u2013 10\u20ac\nKartendeck \u2013 10 \u20ac\nRegelwerk \u2013 30 \u20ac\nDu verkaufst Rollenspiele und m\u00f6chtest an diesem Kickstarter teilnehmen, damit Itras By in den deutschen Handel kommt? Das w\u00fcrde uns freuen! Schreib uns einfach eine E-Mail, und wir kl\u00e4ren dann alles weitere: info@pro-indie.com.\nDer Versand aller Produkte ist f\u00fcr Unterst\u00fctzer in Deutschland in den Kosten der jeweiligen Belohung enthalten \u2013 ihr m\u00fcsst also kein Extraporto zahlen. Anders sieht die Lage f\u00fcr Unterst\u00fctzer aus anderen EU-L\u00e4ndern sowie aus dem \u00fcbrigen Ausland aus: EU-Einwohner m\u00fcssen ihrem Beitrag weitere 10 Euro hinzuf\u00fcgen. Unterst\u00fctzer aus anderen Staaten (inklusive der Schweiz) m\u00fcssen ihrem Beitrag hingegen 20 Euro hinzuf\u00fcgen.\nDie Zustellung der PDFs erfolgt \u00fcber DriveThruRPG, ohne weitere Kosten.

When it was released over twenty-five years ago, it influenced a generation of game designers and spawned countless campaigns on Al Amarja.\nToday, we\u2019re bringing Over the Edge back with a new vision, new era, and new stories. We want you to be a part of that effort.\nReturn to the island you only think you remember.\nDesign not final\nWHAT IS AL AMARJA?\nThe setting of Over the Edge is a fictional, modern-day island in the Atlantic Ocean that\u2019s home to the weirdest city in the world, the Edge. All sorts of conspiracies, paranormal entities, mad scientists, secret agents, and more lurk here. It\u2019s the front line for the Last War, a conflict that rages unseen and unknown to most of its inhabitants. You remember Al Amarja, but not like this.\nWHO AM I WHEN I\u2019M HERE?\nWe believe you're going to be more invested in a unique character you create yourself. Over the Edge helps you draw on modern pop culture and paranormal traditions to craft these exciting characters.\nWe also believe it\u2019s fun to get into trouble, and so characters in Over the Edge are defined not only by their distinguishing traits, but by the ways they leap from the rails and subvert expectations. They question their own core truths, and everyone gets to see what happens next.\nFor example, you might play\u2026 \na jet-setting grifter in Al Amarja to pull off the greatest caper in modern history.\na psychic super-child in pursuit of the remnants of a shadow government.\na reincarnation of an Atlantean Priest of Excess ready to indulge in the island\u2019s forbidden tastes.\nCharacters are the best part of Over the Edge because\u2026\nThe modern-day setting makes it easy to create characters that are relatable and that have depth.\nThe paranormal-friendly setting makes it easy to use your imagination to create a unique role.\nWithout even knowing the rules or the setting, you create your alter ego from scratch using concepts and words, not numbers, lists, or templates.\nWHAT\u2019S FAMILIAR AND WHAT\u2019S ALL-NEW?\nIf you\u2019ve played Over the Edge before, you might wonder what\u2019s different this time around. We know you like touchstones and something to connect to, but you also want to feel as if there\u2019s a reason to pick this edition up.\nThe major conspiracies and characters of the previous editions are still here, but they\u2019ve all been reimagined and rewritten. The new game is inspired by the original material but not limited by or derivative of it.\nA few re-imagined concepts include\u2026\nThe police are still corrupt, but now, instead of being paramilitary officers with grease guns, the rank-and-file cops are schlubs with only their legal standing going for them.\nOne district is still patrolled by thugs with baboons, only now the baboons also roam on their own begging for food and sniffing out troublemakers.\nThe poorest neighborhood is still the turf of Lucifer\u2019s Glorious Lords of Passion, a ruthless gang of metal heads, but now the gang is also a bona fide heavy metal band, and they use their music to solidify their hold on the district.\nFREEFORM, STORY-FORWARD RULES  \nWe believe the island of Al Amarja is best experienced through light, free-wheeling mechanics.\nOver the Edge uses a simple, easy-to-understand game mechanic called \u201ccasting lots.\u201d You throw two six-sided dice to resolve any decision, choice point, or challenge. This generates both a succeed-or-fail result as well as the possibility for a special result: good, bad, or both.\nA single casting of lots can generate the results for\u2026\nA week of surveilling a shady target.\nAn evening burgling a house for loot and information.\nA moment of deadly struggle in a big climactic fight.\nDive deep into the action or pull back and resolve only the key choice points of any situation. Over the Edge lets you determine the scope and stakes of any casting of lots and provides tools to tailor any scenario to the expertise of the player characters.\nWe believe in gorgeous, evocative books. This Kickstarter features a single rulebook written by original Over the Edge designer Jonathan Tweet. It also features assistance from writer Chris Lites, development by Cam Banks, graphic design by Thomas Deeny, art direction by James Mosingo, and editing by Jaym Gates.\nThis new edition is also inspired by 25 years of other game designers\u2019 work, including Robin Laws, Ron Edwards, Luke Crane, Vincent Baker, John Harper, and Jason Morningstar. Many designers say that the original Over the Edge inspired them to design roleplaying games in a new way. We embrace that creative feedback loop by re-incorporating some of their amazing innovations here.\nA developer draft of the manuscript for the rulebook is available to all backers. The link is in the first update.\nThe rulebook includes\u2026\nHigh-quality production values throughout.\nStylish graphic design and layout, emphasizing readability and utility on every page.\nHelpful GM and player advice alongside setting material.\nThe rulebook comes in three formats\u2026\nThe tablet-ready Core Digital edition.\nThe full-color, hardback Core Print edition.\nThe high-quality, Kickstarter-exclusive Core Luxe edition.\nPLEDGE LEVELS FOR DIGITAL NOMADS\nCore Digital is the complete 264-page core rulebook in PDF, Epub, and Kindle formats, easily accessed at your table or for online play, tablet-optimized and hyperlinked.\n$20 OTE Core Digital: Just the files, please.\n$45 OTE Digital Retro: Includes the Retro Pack, PDFs of the previous edition\u2019s books and supplements.\n$55 OTE Digital Retro with Pips: Includes the Retro Pack plus a set of ten six-sided dice in five colors.\nPLEDGE LEVELS FOR PRINT PIONEERS\nCore Print is our full-color, 264-page hardback rulebook.

In German. However, you can read the somewhat amusing Google translation of it here.\nKilling Lee Garvin? Huh?\nKilling Lee Garvin (KLG for short) is a game with a mission. To make fun of the improbable yet inevitable mortality of game designer Lee Garvin (Tales from the Floating Vagabond, Badass Zombie Killers, etc.), which hopefully is quite a few years off. And also because on his way there he has racked up a lot of medical bills that he feels honor-bound to pay while simultaneously faced with the problem of doing so on what you can make as an indie game designer. And the minor distraction of being evicted and living in his car for the past several months. So, with the assistance of cartoonist Ron Leishman (co-creator of Captain Canuck), I'm trying to help Lee out a bit.\nGreg: Being a board/card/rpg game designer is creatively wonderful, but sucks in a lot of other respects. Publishing is already a low-income zone with no job security and negligible benefits, and game design is a ghetto within that zone.\nAnd if you are an independent game designer, it can be even tougher. Lee Garvin is a friend and like me, an indie, but unlike me, life has not been kind to him. In the sense that \"being in an accident, going into a coma and waking up medically bankrupt\" is \"not been kind\".\nAmong other things. Lee has endured a laundry list of improbable bad luck events that would make a good script for a slapstick version of Final Destination.\nBecause I'm a game designer, I see everything as having game potential, so I humorously told Lee I should make a game about killing him off. And the more I thought about it, the more it actually started to make sense...\nAnd so, Killing Lee Garvin was born... At the time I started work on this, Lee still had a roof over his head and the project was meant to just help with his medical bills, but as his life circumstances took a more...outdoors turn, the focus has turned to helping him first get that roof (any roof) back, so that he can try to do all the things those of us with roofs take for granted.\nLee: I wasn't entirely sure Greg was serious about doing this at first, but I should have guessed; he made a game about stalking slasher victims (which I have played quite a bit). And for the record, It wasn't an accident that put me into the coma; it was the doctors who were trying to get me to breathe after I got pneumonia. The accident was a different time.\nBut to give an example of where the cards are coming from, long ago, in an age known as \"The '80s\", I was a Boy Scout (Go Troop 35!). While at one of our troop cookouts, the guys were spread out all over the grounds of the church that served as the host for most of our events. Being Scouts, we were naturally very curious about nature. Being Boys, we were reckless and quite foolish in our endeavors. Being the '80s, safety had not yet been invented. Some of my fellow scouts were expressing their curiosity towards nature by whacking a wasps' nest in a tree with a long stick. I was walking from around the other side of the building at the time, so naturally, I turned the corner just as they knocked the nest out of the tree, and it hit the ground, and all the wasps in the world flew into my open mouth. I really, really wish I could say that was the worst pain I have ever experienced.\nIf one accepts the \"many worlds\" theory of alternate realities, I died in 437 of them. But this being the 1980s, and my father being from Texas, as long as the kid could breathe and no bones were visible, he saw no reason to get medical professionals involved.  \nBut I did get ice cream.\nLife-threatening calamities and ice cream. The Lee Garvin story...\nGoals?\nGreg: KLG has a few simple goals. Be a good, hilarious game. Help out Lee. The latter part is simple. After the production costs are taken into account, Lee gets half. And this is not Hollywood accounting. Lee gets most of his projected cut as fast as I can cut the check after the Kickstarter ends. And if it is funded with time to spare, I'll write as much as I can out of my own account, just to give him a head start. And the more people we get on board, the lower the production cost is per game. So, the more people that want to kill Lee, the better off he ends up. I'm not exactly sure how the karma math works on that one, however...\nLee: One thing I want to make crystal clear is that, yes, I am in a bad way (hell, I'm sleeping in my car right now), but I am not alone, and there are others who have it worse than me. So yes, I will be using some of the money from this project to dig myself out of the hole I'm in, but a full 50% of it, I intend to donate to the Jack Vasel Memorial Fund. This is an organization that has already helped me quite a bit, so I just want to return the favor. They exist to do nothing but help Gaming Professionals who have hit hard times.\nAbout the game\nKLG is a simple 3-6 player game that hides a significant amount of strategy and backstabbing. There are two ways to win. First, you can \"heal\" Lee and you win. Second, you can manipulate someone else into killing Lee and if you have the best game position at that time, you win. So, you can be a good guy and save him, or a bastard who engineers and then takes advantage of his untimely demise...\nIt's a single-deck game, with 54 cards and a bunch of tokens in three colors for representing Lee's health. Cards are simple. They have a number, a color and a type (Harm or Help). Every round you choose from a selection of face-up cards to add to your hand, play cards secretly and reveal them. Harm cards give Health tokens to other players, Help cards put tokens back in the common pool. If you get too many tokens of a particular color, Lee becomes an ex-game designer and it will all be your fault. You are a bad person and Lee's ghost will haunt you. Even if it was another player who gave you the tokens that made you lose. It's pretty easy to end the game by bringing about Lee's untimely demise, but to win you also have to have the best board position when that happens. Not so easy. So you may have to work very hard to keep him healthy...right up to the moment where you push him in front of a bus.\nBut you can also make deals involving the cards. And break them. You do not know exactly what other players are holding, but you do know who has what tokens and what will trigger the end of the game. So, the deals you make and the order in which they resolve is an important part of each round. So, cards are revealed and the round leader (player 1) says \u201cHey player 4, I won't hit you with the Squirrels if you don't Mug me\u201d, and player 4 says \u201cSure thing!\u201d Of course, since player 1 does their action first, player 4 does not have to abide by the deal, but they will. This time. \nAnd whoever is the current round leader has to narrate Lee's life events using the revealed cards for that round. So player 1 looks at the cards and says: \n\"Lee compensated for the stresses of GenCon with a regular cardio workout. But while jogging in the park one morning he was mugged and beaten. And then the squirrels found him...\u201d\nKLG gameplay video\nPLAY\n\nA game of KLG takes ten to thirty minutes to play, and strategy really depends on who you are playing with. People who are trying to win by healing Lee will have a different strategy than those trying to bring about his premature end, and how you play depends on how many of each type of player are in your game. But you are simultaneously playing against the table (the state of tokens and their distribution) and against the other players (what are they trying to do, and to whom?). \nStretch Goals \n$15,000: The basic game\nNot really a stretch goal. This covers the production, art, the Kickstarter cut and enough room to get Lee some money. The base funding level is not low-balling it in expectation we will blow through it. It is a realistic number so that if we reach, Lee gets some help. Given the fixed costs like art (most of the cards are custom caricatures of Lee), this is the minimum level to make the game happen.\n$20,000: Custom meeple\nThe \"first player\" meeple in KLG denotes who gets first pick of cards and deal-making opportunities each round. If we get $20,000 in pledges, we will have a custom meeple made that is an embarrassing caricature of Lee Garvin. My personal preference would be him looking like an out-of-shape Bane (admit it, he's meeple-shaped), but if we reach this goal, Lee will be browbeaten into supplying some pictures and people can vote on their favorite in the comments section.\n$35,000: Quality upgrade \nThe base level of the project turns a profit, but is a short run game and much of the cost is the artwork and the higher cost per game for short run printing. The $35,000 level is the minimum for getting a large print run from China. The lower cost per unit means we can upgrade the quality of everything. Cards, box, tray liner, rules, the works.\nIt's a big jump from $15,000 to $35,000, but depending on the printer I'm pretty sure we will be able to get a useful \"printed in China\" price for some level of pledges north of $15k but less than $35k. We are going to provide the best quality available for whatever level of pledges we do get, but this stretch goal guarantees we can go for the best. You're spending $25 on the game, we want it to look and feel like a good value for the money (in addition to repeat play value for the money).\n$50,000: Organ tokens. Instead of the normal colored bits that are the health tokens, we will spring for the cost of custom blue brain, green lung and red heart tokens to represent Lee's health.\nLaser-guided Chainsaw Add-on!\nOne of Lee's game designs is a cheesy little non-collectable card game called Badass Zombie Killers (or BZK), where the game is about preparing for the zombie apocalypse, having the coolest and most vicious gear, and the game ends when the zombies actually show up. You can download an image of the rules cards from this link.\nNow, unlike Lee who is living in his car in Colorado, the irony is that the remaining stock of BZK actually has a roof over its head in Virginia, close enough to where I am to go get them. So, if you've every wanted a copy of BZK and saw that it is out of stock on Amazon and ThinkGeek, this is your way to get one. So, with the cooperation of Reality Cheque and Skortch'd Urf, this game of prepper one-upmanship can now be yours! Just add $17 to your (US-only) pledge for KLG and we will ship them both at the same time. The $17 covers the BZK and the extra cost for shipping, since we will have to go from a First Class 12oz box to a flat rate Priority Mail box.\nHobo Capitalism Add-On!\nMatt Vancil suggested something to Lee after the \"hobo knife\" picture was posted in Update #23, and the following is entirely Lee's doing. I claim no credit for it. There is now a \"Hobo Capitalism\" add-on in this campaign. For US$10, a US backer will get an official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 (as seen in Update #23), an autographed picture of Lee holding a knife that is probably not yours (much nicer than the picture below but no guarantee he will look any more sane), and in a hat-tip to Munchkin, a special rule for Badass Zombie Killers that can only be utilized by the rightful owner of said knife. This add-on price includes postage in the US. So, you can add this to any game pledge and it will be sent to you directly from Lee's high-tech manufacturing facility, which will probably be the front seat of his 2008 Saturn.\nThe official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 has a number of unique features*. It can be smuggled through metal detectors! Each one is hand-crafted by Lee himself and will have its own unique character. It has trace amounts of Lee's DNA in case you need to leave it at a crime scene to confuse the forensic team. And in an emergency it can be disassembled to give you several feet of duct tape.\n*Due to variances in the manufacturing process, the ability of the Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 to cut anything tougher than a McDonalds pancake is not guaranteed. This product not endorsed by the SHA (Stabby Hobo Association).\nAnd here, for the second time anywhere! The tentative official Badass Zombie Killers Hobo Knife\u2122 Rule \nIf you have an authentic Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 in your possession, you may do the following once per game. Discard 4 Badassery worth of Weapon cards or Modifier cards from your hand (that is, the total Badassery value or bonus of the cards must add up to at least positive 4) into the Dumpster. Whip out your Hobo Knife\u2122 and Shank one opponent's character.  \nTo Shank, you must choose one of that character's special abilities, and place the blade of the Hobo Knife\u2122 so that it covers it completely. That ability is not available for use for as long as the blade remains lodged in the character (until dislodged by a special effect). At the end of the game, the Hobo Knife\u2122 is returned to its owner. Don't make them come over there.\nShipping\nGames will be shipped in the US by First Class or Priority Mail (depending on whether they top 12 ounces with the stretch goals), and tracking numbers will be available.  \nSame as USA, just a little more expensive. \nEU-bound games will ship from the EU to avoid Customs charges and will go via regular mail within the EU.  \nAustralia-bound games will depend on the level of funding. At the low end they will be shipped via an intermediary service, while if we get into stretch goal territory we can probably use a normal fulfillment center. \nIf you are backing this project from Mars, we will arrange to have your package put on the next available manned flight (losing the entire shipment we shoehorned into the Schiaparelli lander soured us on automated interplanetary delivery options).

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter (third if you count collaborations), and the fourth that Lee has started or been a collaborator on, so while we are not \"veterans\", we have some experience with the process. But this one has the potential to be significantly bigger than previous ones. The project goal is modest and will turn a profit that can go to help Lee, but if it exceeds its goals by a lot, then the scaling goes from \"domestic short run printing\" to \"seafreight container from China\", and from \"local pack & ship\" to \"hire a fullfillment service\". The numbers have been run for both cases and work out, and give sufficient wiggle room for stretch goals. However, I do want to avoid \"stretch goal creep\", since I've seen over-promising on other projects, and overly ambitious stretch goals also cause significant production delays.\n\nFortunately, I have a friend in the gaming industry (Mark Walker of Flying Pig Games (look his projects up)) who is both local and has significant experience with Chinese printers and domestic and international fulfillment operations. So in the unlikely event this explodes like kittens, I'm sure there will be headaches, but the headaches will be manageable. And if worst comes to worst, I can always blame it on Lee... (Lee: Hey!)\n\nThe timeframe from \"end of Kickstarter\" to \"game in your hands\" is going to vary based on how successful it is. The moment the minimum threshold is reached, the art will be contracted and the artist is ready to go on it. If it reaches a \"China production\" threshold, we have several possible suppliers and will have to choose one, and if we hit the top tier for custom game pieces, this will probably add a little to the production time as well. Of course, if we hit these thresholds with time to spare it means we can get them underway even before the campaign ends. One thing that will be a delay at the high end is that seafreight will take about a month, compared to domestic short-run printing that would take a few weeks from printing to delivery. My best guess at this point is \"on time or sooner\" for a barely funded campaign to \"a month or two late\" for one with all the stretch goals, but the benefit of the latter is a much nicer looking product (and more money going towards Lee's medical bills). The listed delivery date is an intermediate value, and if you have funded other campaigns you know how that goes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Nice guy", "descp": "You just want to help out, because you're a nice guy.

Grimtooth the Troll here. You sorry souls have been dying from my traps for decades. And in all that time, not one of you miniscule mortals has attacked me in my lair! Well, I\u2019ve decided to take pity on you. For the first time ever, I\u2019m going to show you my realm. You\u2019ll finally get to see \u2013 Trapsylvania!\nThis Kickstarter supports the publication of Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania, a 144-page campaign setting and sourcebook! It will be available in print (softcover or hardcover) and electronic (PDF) format. It is fully illustrated, with color cover and B/W interior art. The publisher is Goodman Games, under license from Flying Buffalo. The book is written in a systems-neutral style like all Grimtooth books, with DCC RPG stats compiled in an appendix at the back.\nGrimtooth's Lair\nThis Kickstarter also offers a rare collectible treasure: the \"lost 8th Grimtooth book.\" Flying Buffalo published a total of 7 Grimtooth books. At the Origins Game Convention in 1983, an independent publisher released their own unauthorized bootleg adventure called Grimtooth's Lair. Today, only a single copy of this adventure is known to exist. Thanks to collector Bill Meinhardt, we have been able to scan the adventure for publication. It is being offered as an add-on for this Kickstarter (see below).\nThe only known copy of Grimtooth's Lair - now available as a reprint exclusively through this Kickstarter!\nAt last \u2013 the legendary locations of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps revealed!\nFor over 30 years, Grimtooth\u2019s numerous Traps books have horrified players and inspired game masters with hundreds of dangerous devices, deadly deathtraps and hilarious hijinx! Now Grimtooth (with a little help from kid sister Grimtina) will take you on a personally guided tour of his realm and the central hub of his vast Traps empire.\nRun your own Grimtooth campaign, or pick and choose locations you can use in your own adventures. Explore Grimtooth\u2019s caverns, visit his Inner Sanctum, escape the Deathmaze Testing Center, attend Warthog\u2019s School for Trolls, take a ride on Grimtooth\u2019s Airship, tour Grimtina\u2019s Petting Zoo or get lost in many more gigantic places of doom, like the Infinite Corridor of Hallways. Each of these infamous locations includes maps, descriptions, non-player character details, scenarios, and lots of art. Plus there are more traps (of course) and plenty of things with which to endanger your characters.  \nLike all Grimtooth books, Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania is written in a systems-neutral format, and published in a way that it is fully compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG). A series of appendices at the back provide quick and easy stats for DCC RPG games, covering all the creatures, characters and items described in the book. It\u2019s very easy to fill a graveyard with the corpses of your DCC player characters! (Because once you enter Trapsylvania \u2013 you won\u2019t leave! Suckers.)  \nTrapsylvania is written and illustrated by S. S. Crompton, the legendary \u201cvoice of Grimtooth\u201d who has been working on Grimtooth products for Flying Buffalo for more than 30 years. We\u2019ve rounded up the entire roster of historical Grimtooth contributors to illustrate the book, so you\u2019ll find art not just by S. S. Crompton, but also by Liz Danforth, Micheal Von Glahn, Scott Jackson Phil Longmeier, and Jeff Dee \u2013 all the artists who have contributed to Grimtooth products over the years! The new traps are written by Grimtooth alumni S. S. Crompton, Ken St. Andre, Bear Peters, Rick Loomis, Paul O'Connor and Debora Kerr. The DCC stats are provided by Terry Olson, with editing by Jen Brinkman.\nTrapsylvania is chock full of useful gaming material! How much is there? Well, here's the exact count!\n1 whole country! (Grimtooth's, that is!)\n15 large locations, all described and mapped\n48 scenario ideas\n60 traps or trapped items\n86 creatures (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n26 NPCs (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n23 items (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\nAnd loads of laughs!\nWhat is Grimtooth\u2019s Traps?\nOriginally published by Flying Buffalo, Grimtooth\u2019s Traps is one of the most popular RPG accessories ever produced, with more than 250,000 copies in print since 1981. Flying Buffalo published seven Grimtooth\u2019s books, all of them usable with any RPG. In 2015, Goodman Games compiled all of these into a massive hardcover compilation, and also published two additional DCC-compatible Grimtooth adventures. Grimtooth remains an eternally relevant character and his popularity has only grown since then.\nThe hallmarks of Grimtooth-style traps are wacky humor combined with deadly danger, plus, of course, extremely useful material that can be integrated into any dungeon-crawling RPG!\nWhat\u2019s in the book?\nEverything you need to run a game in Trapsylvania! Whether a single session or an extended campaign, you can give your players a fun time. Here is a preview of the Table of Contents:\nWhat's the Status of the Book?\nTrapsylvania is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. We are in final proofreading stages at the time of the Kickstarter.

We have 50 copies that will also include a piece of original art by Steve Crompton. The remainder do not include that original art.\nShipping costs are as follows.

You can add on additional funds to include these items. All add-on items count toward achieving stretch goals, and those published by Goodman Games are in print+PDF format!\nTo add on an item, simply increase your pledge amount to cover the cost.

More than 500 traps in a systems-neutral format, suitable for any fantasy RPG.

(And treasonous, but you never read that.)\nPlayers will find rules for playing bots and elderly Troubleshooters, advice for committing treason and not getting caught, fun prescription drugs, and bingo cards for diagnosing teammates with entirely treatable disorders. No medical knowledge necessary!\nGMs will find locations to drop into missions, guides to the Underplex and the Outside, articles and tables to help up your Paranoia game, and three shiny new missions to really rack up the body count.\nYou will also see new cards, from Bestiary cards like the Feral Tree to R&D gear such as Hygiene Grenades \u2014 but only if you back this project before June 24th.\nImagine the sheer joy and devilish glee you\u2019ll feel upgrading your Paranoia RPG experience with this new set! Imagine the jealousy and dirty looks from others who did not back this project! \nParanoia is now more better. Other games are not more better. Back Acute Paranoia.\nWhat is Paranoia?\nParanoia is a darkly humorous roleplaying game full of mutants, secret societies, backstabbing, lasers, repeated death and a well-meaning but thoroughly insane ruler known as the Computer. Unlike other RPGs that take themselves rather seriously, Paranoia is all about having fun in a science fiction dystopia by encouraging skullduggery, betrayal, bootlicking and generally naughty behaviours.\nAt cons, you can tell where the Paranoia game is by following the laughter. This is your chance to make your Paranoia games even more hilarious (and deadly) with the Acute Paranoia box set. Be the envy of your neighbours, friends and random strangers!\nWhy Acute Paranoia?\nAfter the success of the Paranoia core box set, players have been asking for more ways to backstab, fight terrorism and cause terrorism in Alpha Complex. \nOur design goal was simple: Create a box full of cool things to do in Paranoia. We focused on what helps players and GMs take down their enemies so they can climb a mountain of skulls and smoking boots to proclaim themselves the One True Paranoia Gamer. In other, less scary words, everything was filtered through \u2018How can people use this for more fun?\u2019\nThe design team is lead by WJ MacGuffin, a game designer who worked on the Unknown Armies 3rd edition Kickstarter as well as the XP edition of Paranoia. Starting with the 2nd edition rules back in 1987, WJ played and ran more games of Paranoia than is healthy. \nThe team includes two other veterans of the XP edition days (Dan Curtis Johnson and Greg Ingber) as well as two designers new to Paranoia (Amanda Cherry and Ed Turner) for fresh ideas and blame if jokes fall flat. With invaluable guidance and imperious demands from Gareth Hanrahan and Ken Rolston (one of the Paranoia 2nd edition designers), the team has created rules, missions and more that fits Paranoia\u2019s unique themes and mood. Hunting down traitors, would-be-traitors and what-the-hell-they-might-as-well-be traitors-because-my-gun-still-has-ammo has never been this fulfilling!\nAcute Paranoia Contents\nAnd you thought your Paranoia games were already dangerously fun .... As with the core box set, Acute Paranoia is printed in high quality full colour. In the box set, you will receive:\nThe Troubleshooter Survival Handbook features healthcare plans, perfectly legal pharmaceuticals, disorder bingo cards, articles on getting away with treason and invaluable lessons from Teela-O. You also get rules for playing bots! (\u201cBzzzt bing sorry Troubleshooter but this arm needs to be removed beep!\u201d)\nThe Gamesmasters Despotic Power Book offers locations to \u2018drag and drop\u2019 into any mission, information on the Underplex and the Outside, articles on helping players get into the Paranoia spirit (aka backstabbing) and bot secret societies. You also get tables for randomly picking interesting (and likely deadly) bots, traitors and shops!\nMission Book 2.0 includes three brand-new missions featuring the Outside and the Underplex. How will your Troubleshooters handle a mysterious black rectangle, a missing Armed Forces regiment and a patch to the Computer itself?\nNew cards! Besides more Action and Equipment cards, you\u2019ll get cards for Bots, Relics from Before, completely safe R&D gear and those things that are like bots but not metal ... what\u2019s the term ... oh, right. Beasts.\nWipe-clean Bot Identity Forms, which are way better than the ones squishy clones get because you are made of metal.\nWipe-clean Disorder Bingo Cards to make sure your teammates don\u2019t have any issues that could degrade mission performance.\nRemember, you can download the complete Troubleshooter Survival Handbook right HERE to have a look at the kind of things we are putting into this box set!\nPledge Levels\nUnder CPU Mandate 883.03/b, this campaign\u2019s pledge levels have been simplified and clarified to make your loyal backing experience that much more enjoyable.

We have a Big List of Things To Do Differently with this Kickstarter campaign!\n\nIt has been some time since the last Paranoia Kickstarter and, between then and now, we have run two very efficient Traveller Kickstarters. We have developed a new system for Kickstarters, and it works:\n\n* We have a new team of writers for Paranoia, new faces and familiar. They are delivering what they say they will deliver, when they say they will deliver.\n\n* Most of the box set will be complete before the Kickstarter begins.\n\nAh ha, you say, but was that not said for the last Paranoia box set? The difference here is that, knowing this was a big issue last time, we will showcase sections of the box set right at the start of the Kickstarter. You can freely download the Troubleshooters Survival Handbook right now - subject to tweaks and additions made during the Kickstarter process - so you will be able to see how much work has already been done.\n\nBy creating so much content beforehand, the risk is lower and backers will receive their rewards that much faster. In addition, lead designer WJ MacGuffin will be monitoring this project and answering your questions/concerns as quickly as his tired, slow brain can handle.

A thousand years before the rise of Lerotra\u2019hh, the Sketthor-Ka had their own empire, ruled by sorcerer kings who fell into dark practices that turned them into vampire lords. That empire fell when the great wizards of Trollworld banded together to stop the vampiric plague spreading out from the city of K\u2019horror. \nPart of the map of the underground Vaults...\nBut the ancient vampire lords were not completely destroyed. They retreated underground to hidden tombs and vaults, leaving their surviving subjects to exist as best they could in the ruins above. Now the undead threat is rising again.  \nIllustration of a wraith by Simon Tranter\nAdventurers have learned of the ancient tombs and undead sanctuaries. The bravest of them are searching and digging into forgotten crypts and subterranean palaces in search of magic and treasure, unwittingly releasing ancient terrors that had slumbered for a millennium. Enterprising skeleton men like your guide, Slimius, now lead adventurers to the entrances of such tombs, barred from entering themselves, but perfectly willing to share the treasure with those who can face the undead terrors in the Vaults of K\u2019horror. Are you up to the challenge of robbing vampires in their own lairs?\nWhat horrors await you in the Vaults?\nVaults of K\u2019Horror is a full-size 40+ page gamemaster adventure complete with maps, characters and background material for Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls. All the main art, text maps and graphics for this book are completed and ready to go to press. We are adding some stretch goals, which includes a Vaults of K'Horror based 19 page solo adventure, customized mini-rules, a collection of NPCs submitted by backers, and a backers honor list, but other than that, we are ready to send this project to the printers, so the wait time for you getting this new book is going to be minimal.\n\nThis GM adventure is written by Long-time UK T&T creator Andy Holmes with art by Simon Tranter & Steven Crompton. T&T Creator Ken St Andre has edited the adventure and assured the dT&T stats and numbers. The book is being published by Flying Buffalo inc.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n STRETCH GOAL #1 - K'Horror T&T solo by Ken St Andre At this level we will add a brand new 19 page solo adventure by Ken St Andre. This solo is directly connected to the Vault of K'horror gm adventure and was written especially for this book. This will be added at no extra charge to all backers that pledge for a copy of any version of Vaults Of K'Horror when we reach the stretch goal. We'll announce the goal level as this Kickstarter progresses. (Note; the art and layout is completed and no additional time is needed to add this solo should we reach this stretch goal.)\n STRETCH GOAL #2 - Customized Mini-RulesFor goal #2 we will add a 13 page version of the T&T Mini-rules that has been specially customized for Vaults of K'Horror with new art and weapons. When we reach this stretch goal the mini-rules will be added to the book at no extra charge to all backers that pledge for a copy of any version of Vaults Of K'Horror. We'll announce the goal level as this Kickstarter progresses. (Note; the art and layout is completed for these mini-rules and no additional time is needed to add them should we reach this goal.) \nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - Wandering NPCs and Monsters\nWith goal #3 we will add a new chapter that lists and gives stats for additional NPCs and monsters that players might meet on their way to K'Horror or underground in the vaults of the vampire lords. Each character will be illustrated by either Steve Crompton or Simon Tranter.

We can mail via media mail to USA addresses, so I am not adding any postage to USA. Postage is built into the price. But we always get a lot of backers outside the USA, and for these I have put in a price of $15. I am almost certain it will cost more that than, possibly much more. When it is time to ship (outside the USA) I will find out exactly what the postage will cost me and if it is more than $15 I will send you a bill. If it is too much and you want to cancel instead, I will send you a refund, no hard feelings.\nADD ONS: \nOne flaw of kickstarter is that you cannot back the same project twice if there are two different rewards that you want.

Enlist today! \nThe tiny star system of Draconis stands alone against the mighty Dominion of Unity. They need your help! Join the brave pilots of Tachyon Squadron, a crack group of volunteer fighter pilots holding back the tide of tyranny! Pilot sleek starfighters in deadly clashes among the stars. Fight alongside your comrades to stop piracy, end lawlessness, and turn back the Dominion's fleets. Win glory for yourself and freedom for all!\nTachyon Squadron is an extensive Fate Core supplement with 184 pages full of interplanetary combat, space-faring scoundrels, and lots and lots of blasters.\nAre you already a backer? Go to this backers-only post and download the text-complete PDF of Tachyon Squadron right now!\nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Tachyon Squadron through them? Encourage your FLGS to back this Kickstarter and get their copies early, along with all digital stretch goals.\nTachyon Squadron is a Fate Core supplement that blends space opera and military sci-fi. It's Evil Hat\u2019s take on popular stories about interstellar battles, like the ones that have ships with wings named after letters and the one where robots chase the human race through space. If you\u2019re interested in deep space dogfights, friendly\u2014well, usually\u2014rivalries with fellow pilots, and playing scrappy underdogs with the deck stacked against you, this game is for you.\nYou need a copy of Fate Core to play Tachyon Squadron. We've included a PDF of Fate Core with the PDF downloads to make sure all backers have everything they need to try out the game. If you'd like a physical copy of Fate Core, check out the Pilot Instructor pledge level!\nI\u2019m a Fate fanatic. What new mechanics can I expect?\nA starfighter combat engagement system. Space battles in Fate!\nFighter pilot character creation, including pilot interactions and vices to blow off steam\nPersonal and gear stunts to account for all the sci-fi equipment you know and love\nSpaceships with detailed condition effects to keep your dogfighting tense and dangerous\nI'm new to Fate. Why would I want to play space battles in this system?\nFate as a system is focused on story, where both success and failure help to create interesting moments for players and characters. In Fate it's as much about the choices the pilots face and the story consequences of those choices, for good or ill, as it is about the tactical details of the fight. Do you fly to your comrade's rescue and jeopardize the mission? Or do you stay on target, accomplish your assignment, and hope your friend survives on their own? What are the consequences for your pilot's relationships? Fate helps generate drama by pushing play toward answering these questions.\nTachyon Squadron is finished and only awaiting a few tweaks! We have a text-complete PDF that you can download and start playing immediately upon pledging, and we'll be ready to print as soon as the Kickstarter is over. One advantage of Kickstarting is that it allows us to size that print run like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge\u2014just right. Our printer usually takes 2-3 months to turn around a book, although that timeline\u2019s dependent on their availability. We\u2019ve added some cushion to our delivery estimates, and we\u2019re confident that November is more than doable.\nWe haven\u2019t started production on the stretch goals, since we\u2019re not sure what will fund, and we may adjust the planned goal order behind the scenes as we learn what the backers are most interested in. Creator and secret space smuggler Clark Valentine has blocked out time in his schedule to work on them, but he\u2019s just one guy. So it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll release those to you as he finishes each one and we put it through the editing/layout/art wringer.\nThe Text-Only PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you get immediate access to the text-only PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. We want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you\u2019re new to RPGs.\nThe Completed PDF: Backers at $12 and up will receive the final, art-complete PDF at the conclusion of this Kickstarter.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $25 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover, color interior book with 184 pages. Shipping by November 2018.\nSTRETCH GOAL 1 (UNLOCKED): Text Only Preview of Fate Space Toolkit: Scratch your sci-fi Fate itch with a sneak peek at the text of the Fate Space Toolkit, a mechanical marvel full of system elements and ideas you can drop into your Tachyon campaign, or hack to create your own deep space setting. This preview will be laid out, but pre-art.\nSTRETCH GOAL 2 (UNLOCKED): Those Who Were Here Before: When we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll begin work on a 5000 words electronic campaign. A wreck, obviously of nonhuman origin, drifts into the space lanes of Draconis, leading to the discovery of more alien ruins and wrecks. Every power in the galaxy\u2014both government and corporate\u2014wants control. Find out what happens in Those Who Were Here Before.\nSTRETCH GOAL 3 (UNLOCKED): Inside the Dominion of Unity: When we unlock this stretch goal, we'll begin work on a 10,000 word electronic supplement focusing on the Dominion of Unity. Step into the flight suit of a Dominion pilot! Fly Dominion ships! Stamp out the upstart Tachyon Squadron and bring order to your corner of the universe. This stretch will also include expanded rules for incorporating capital ships into your combat engagements.\nSTRETCH GOAL 4 (UNLOCKED): Top Gun: When we unlock this stretch goal, we'll start working on at 5,000 word electronic supplement about Draconis fighter pilots in training. It'll include rules for pilot/co-pilot pairs, rivalries between students, a scoring system for the top student prize, and maybe even a pilot NPC named after an aquatic bird. GOOSE!!!\nSTRETCH GOAL 5 (UNLOCKED): Printable Ship Tokens and Minis: At $18,500, we\u2019ll start acquiring art for a series of printable ship tokens and minis to use with your maneuver charts and maps. This stretch goal will include flat tokens and fold-and-stand minis in at least ten visually distinct ship types, each in six colors for easy reference.\nSTRETCH GOAL 6 (UNLOCKED): Spaceship Construction Toolkit: At $23,500, we\u2019ll start work on the Spaceship Construction Toolkit. This 10,000 word electronic supplement will give you all the tools you need to create your own starships. Add some variety to your fleet with this exciting toolkit.\nSTRETCH GOAL 7 (UNLOCKS AT $26,000): The Battle of Britain: At $26,000, we\u2019ll start work on The Battle of Britain, a 5,000 word electronic supplement that applies Tachyon Squadron\u2019s dogfighting rules to a WWII squadron of Spitfire pilots defending Britain. This supplement will include plane stats and mechanics to help you take to the skies with the Allied forces.\nSTRETCH GOAL 8 (UNLOCKS AT $31,000): The Lawless: At $31,000, we\u2019ll start work on The Lawless, a 10,000 word electronic supplement about the lawless areas of the galaxy. Here, space pirates ply their trade far beyond the reaches of the Dominion of Unity and the Stellar Republic. New locations, ships, and NPCs to help populate your campaigns!\nAttention, pilots!

We\u2019ve carefully calculated our funding goals to cover the printing of the book, and adding shipping to your pledge now will mess up that math. Also, this approach allows us to subsidize the shipping a bit\u2014the actual S&H costs will be more than the $6 we're charging you.\nWe'll be billing shipping via BackerKit, where you'll also be able to configure your rewards. BackerKit is a pledge manager\u2014a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll also have the option to add on a few select items via BackerKit if you choose to do so, with no extra shipping costs.\nHere\u2019s the sad part\u2014we\u2019re only able to offer shipping to the US. Our shipping options outside of the US would cost more than the actual book in most cases, and we can\u2019t in good conscience do that to you. However, every reward offered in this Kickstarter will be available to our international fans.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options:\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, use a freight forwarder.

We've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Tachyon Squadron is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already invested time and money to get Tachyon Squadron to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe are running multiple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 10+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns will overlap, and that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

The collection and artifacts will be packaged in a unique box - available only through this Kickstarter, with a limited run, for a limited time. (Seriously, the games will be available later, but the special packaging and artifacts will not be sold again!)\n* The campaign is over! Wow!\nThanks so much for the amazing support! We're working hard on the artifacts, and for more info on the games go to myst.com!\nIn the fall of 1993, Cyan released Myst \u2013 the surreal, graphical adventure game that provided an entirely new kind of experience for millions of virtual explorers. Surpassing Cyan\u2019s wildest expectations, it not only became the bestselling PC game of the 20th century, it also had a direct influence on popular culture. Over the years, Myst has brought together communities of passionate fans and has been referenced in television shows, movies, books, comics, and more. Myst has also inspired other creators as they built their own unique realms. Myst has even earned spots in the Smithsonian Institute, MoMA, and other notable museums.    \nAll 7 Myst Games Together for the First Time \nLooking back on this incredible, 25-year journey, Cyan believes a celebration is in order! We recognize this amazing achievement could not have happened without each and every one of you who have found your way to this Kickstarter. You have embraced the intricacies, oddities and mysteries in the Myst worlds \u2013 and have come back for more. So, as 2018 marks the 25th anniversary of Myst, Cyan is taking our journey together one step further.\nBehind the scenes, we\u2019ve been working to procure the legal rights to make all of the Myst games available. As an indie developer, resources are limited for development, and acquiring these rights isn\u2019t always an option. But we\u2019ve finally managed to talk with all the right people in all the right places to garner funds to make it happen! With the needed agreements secured, we\u2019re delighted to present the Myst 25th Anniversary Collection, featuring all seven titles in the Myst series!\nWith the help of our friends at GOG.com and CodeWeavers the games have been upgraded to run on Windows 10 and macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). This Kickstarter will provide the entire Windows collection in a special exclusive package, but the updated versions of the games will also make their way to digital download services, starting with GOG.com, as automatic updates.\nSpecial Artifacts Only on Kickstarter\nBut we didn\u2019t stop there. We wanted to extract the essence of Myst\u2019s enigmatic aura and make it come alive \u2013 to touch, to hold, to remember...\nSo, we joined forces with Idea Planet, a unique group of talented folks who make realistic video game artifacts that wow. Chances are, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 or have \u2013 some of their really cool collector\u2019s editions. Check out their portfolio by clicking on the link in their logo above. We are thrilled to be working with them on our very own Myst 25th Anniversary Collection!\nNow on to the good stuff \u2013 the details you\u2019ve been waiting for!\nThe Linking Book\nThe core of the collector\u2019s edition will be a Myst Linking Book. The Bookmaker tier book will have a die-cut \u201cwindow\u201d through which you can see the art on the game DVD sleeves. At the Maintainer tier and above, the book will include an active 800 x 480 digital screen with video fly-throughs from the games.\nDimensions: 7in x 9in x 2.5in (18cm x 25 cm x 6 cm)\nWindow cutout: 5in x 2.75in  (12cm x 7cm) \nMaterials: 1200g grey board & art paper, with Matte Finish \nEmbossed & gold foil on Logo & edges of leather art treatments \nWeight:  2.71 pounds (1.23kg)\n1:1 exact scale replica\n800 x 480 IPS high resolution LCD screen (Maintainer tier)\nSpeaker (Maintainer tier)\nGehn\u2019s Inkwell and Pen \nThe Writer tier and above will feature an authentic replica of Gehn\u2019s Pen and Inkwell, meticulously recreated. And yes, it holds your ink, so it\u2019s a functioning set! (D'ni Writer's Ink or common ink not included.)\nThis tier also now includes digital versions of the three Myst novels (The Book of Atrus, The Book of Ti'ana, and The Book of D'ni) as well as high-resolution scans of some of the Riven design maps.\nGehn\u2019s Pen: \nDimensions: 7in (17.78cm) in length \nMaterials: Wood & Metal Accents \nGehn\u2019s Inkwell: \nDimensions 5.25in x 3.5in (13.35cm x 8.89cm)\nMaterials: Die Cast Zinc Alloy \nDeco: Antiqued Brass Plating \nWeight: 1.75lbs (.8kg)\n\nOriginal Design Sketches from Riven\nThis Collector tier is extremely limited and very special. We've opened the vault and collected 25 original hand-drawn concept sketches made during the production of Riven. These are not copies or reproductions. These are the actual pencil sketches with all of their variations, notes, smudges, and watermarks. Many of them have never been seen publicly before.\nMyst's 25th anniversary offers us a rare opportunity to provide these images to serious fans of the Myst series. Each unique hand-sketched drawing comes with a certificate of authenticity. \nSince these items are so unique, each backer at this level will get to choose which sketch they prefer. The order of the choice will be based on when the backer made their pledge - first pledge chooses first, second pledge chooses second, etc. And because we'd really like to spread the love around, we're limiting this tier to one per backer. You can see the available concept images here.\nA Word to Mac Users \nMyst started out as a Mac-first title, and over the years, Cyan has always released each of our games for the Mac. But for various reasons, maintaining some of those Mac titles now usually means rebuilding them from scratch - an option that, as a small indie studio, takes time or resources we just don\u2019t have. And for games that were produced by other studios, even that option wasn't possible.\nBut Mac users rejoice! After some research and testing, and the help of CodeWeavers, we've been able to come up with a solution that allows us to offer digital and disc versions of all of the games in this Anniversary Collection for macOS.\nWhy the $247,500 target amount?\nTo deliver a high-quality Myst collector\u2019s edition at a reasonable price, we need to have a minimum number of orders. Based on quotes for the design, tooling and manufacturing, we've calculated that we need at least 2,500 orders at the $99 tier or above (2,500 * $99 = $247,500) to achieve the bare minimum and move forward.\nReward Tier Summary\nCommunity Goals \nThank you for completing our community goals! \n\n.\nThat means everyone in the community \u2013 whether they\u2019ve backed this Kickstarter or not, whether they\u2019re a long-time veteran fan or new to the Mystiverse \u2013 can enjoy these items.\n\n5 High-resolution images from Myst - angles never before rendered \n5 Scans of the Riven Concept Art hanging in Cyan's Office \n5 VR nodes on the original Myst Island (viewable via Google Cardboard) \n5 Complete Digital Age design documents from Ages in Uru \n5 3D printable files for items in Myst\nA link to the downloads will be available soon. \n\nYOU DID IT!\n\nShipping and Fulfillment\nUnfortunately, shipping costs have skyrocketed over the past several years. To help insure our shipping is as high quality and as low cost as possible, we have partnered with Blackbox who has globally positioned facilities to help minimize customs fees and VAT. Additionally, we have simplified the rate structure and even subsidized shipping rates in many cases. Please note the shipping cost when you select your pledge level.\nThanks, Adam!\nOkay Adam, we know you have some kind of reputation for ruining everything, but you sure helped us out. Seriously, having Adam as the voice of this Kickstarter pitch was such an amazing boost! If his energy, enthusiasm, and brilliance doesn't infect you, then you're probably not breathing. Thank you so much, Adam. Your linking book is on the way (after September.)\nAbout Cyan \nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller when they released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. After that was Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx \u2013 two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. In 1991, Cyan began work on a much larger world they called Myst. Myst and its sequel Riven have sold more than 15 million copies worldwide \u2013 which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. After five titles in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. (Myst Online is still available to explore for free.) In 2013, Cyan launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund an entirely new game - Obduction. The campaign succeeded, and Obduction was successfully launched on PC, Mac, PS4, and VR.\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet. We continue to build on our past as we dream into the future.\nThank you! \nOur fans are the best! You'll never know how much we appreciate your continued support over the years.

Wer sich an die Challenge erinnert, wird vielleicht Die Grenzer vermissen, die zusammen mit Opus Magnum den zweiten Platz belegt haben. Schaut doch einfach mal in die Stretch Goals ...!\nUnd hier kommt ihr ins Spiel.

Like all of our Card Caddy products (all of which have been created with Kickstarter), our dice tower is mobile, modular and multi-purpose!\nJust a $12 pledge gets you one  - with US shipping included! \nReady to roll, wherever your adventures take you! (3D printed prototypes shown - go to the Card Caddy site to see how the finished products will look!)\nWhen closed, it keeps your dice and other accessories safe, and then turns into a dice tower when you're ready to play. The tower helps ensure a fair roll every time, as well as keeping those dice from rolling onto the game board or off the table.  AND, the lid and door of the dice tower form a peg-and-hole style score pad with storage built in for your pegs! AND, it's modular so you can mix and match multiple dice towers to stack them up or create custom configurations that combine or split your dice rolls! AND it's compatible with our other Card Caddy products! \nStow to roll in seconds!\nOur Citadel Dice Tower keeps your dice organized and contained on your way to your next adventure, then unpacks to form a compact rolling tower so your dice stay where you want them!\nLots of ways to customize how you roll!\nThere are lots of way to customize our Citadel Dice Tower for how you want to play!  Keep it simple or stack them up - either way you'll keep your rolls fair and under control!\nThe Citadel Dice Tower is compatible with our other Card Caddy products, so you can take your cards, gaming bits and other accessories with you on the go! There are a couple of reward levels where you can get one of each of all of our products, or you'll be able to add stuff to your Dice Tower pledges after the campaign using our pledge manager.\nKeep your cards and dice together with our compatible systems!\nThe dice tray and lid form their own storage box which can attach to any Card Caddy!\nThe packed configuration of the Dice Tower will be 4 x 4 x 3 inches (10.2 x 10.2 x 7.6 cm).  Opened up, it takes up about 7 x 3 inches (18 x 7.6 cm) of tabletop space.\nYou'll have your choice of 6 colors - the 5 main ones above (red, white, black, green and blue) and a Kickstarter exclusive color that all the backers will vote on after the campaign ends. Each Dice Tower will be a solid color - it you want a multi-color one, you'll have to get two or more to mix and match. \nDo you want to further customize your Dice Tower?  After the campaign, I can provide any backer with the exact specs and templates for laser or CNC engraving of your Dice Tower.\nHere are the reward levels and pledge amounts - more on shipping below, but US shipping is included, with an adder based on location for backers outside the US (ranges from $10-30).\nHow many dice fit and how big can they be?  You can see in the videos that a standard set of 7 polyhedral dice fit and roll well. The limiting factor is the size of the gap between the ramps inside the Tower and this is slightly over one inch.  Check out the video below if you're interested in the detailed measurements, dice capacity and how the final products will look:\nPLAY\n\nDo you want to see even MORE details about the Dice Tower and suggestions on how to use it?  The video below has a cutaway showing the interior, some more ideas on how to use it for passing around the table or with a box top, and close-up details on the score pad.\nA big reason to back our campaign is to help us bring this idea to reality, but there's something in it for you, too.  Depending on your backing level, you'll be saving 20-30% off the MSRP of $14.99.\nIf you're new to Kickstarter, you should definitely be aware that it's not like most online stores or ordering platforms.  You are pledging funds to me and am I promising to do my best to provide you with a specified reward in return.  There is no inventory in a warehouse waiting to be shipped - your contribution is what helps me to pay for the very first production run. \nIf you're an experienced backer, you'll notice our campaign is lacking some usual features in many other campaigns - early bird pledges (or other rewards to incentivize early backing) and stretch goals.\nAs for early bird pledges, I think they are unfair and only reward a small segment of people who happen to come on the campaign early.  We're not doing stretch goals either for this campaign since I want to be laser focused on getting this product - and only this product - produced and shipped to my backers.  I've put together the best product I've been able to, and haven't kept back upgrades that could be revealed as goals later on. Stretch goals are cool and fun and they definitely help creators raise more money, but they also add potential delays and cost overruns and I want to keep this one as simple as possible.\nHaving said that, I still want to hear your comments, questions, suggestions and criticisms of the Dice Tower!  Your input has helped make our products better in all of our campaigns and I hope/expect it will be the same for this one! If someone thinks of a great stretch goal that I'm sure won't impact the schedule, or modifications to the design, I can try to make it happen.\n\"What about the ...(Triple Decker, Card Caddies for mini or Tarot cards, Shake N Shuffle, Card Shoe, etc)?!?\"\nWe've got great ideas for lots of cool new products, and if this one is successful, we'll get started on the next one.  In fact, we'll use a poll of backers from this project to help decide what our next project will be, so the best way to get the product you want is to help us be successful in this one!\nHelp us reach our goal by sharing on social media, your favorite forums and referring your friends. There are buttons right below the \"Back this project\" button above to help you do it.  And be sure to like, follow and share our posts on our social media accounts, too!\nWe're aiming to deliver your rewards by December 2018. If that changes, we will update you with a new timeline. Here's how the current schedule breaks out:\nShipping to US backers is subsidized by us in the base pledge levels - that's about $5 to $10 depending on the pledge level.  For backers outside the US, an extra $10-30 will be added to your pledge here on Kickstarter depending on your pledge level and location.  The additional costs for countries outside the US are the additional shipping and duty fees (Canada, EU, Australia and New Zealand) that we incur to get your backer reward to you. We'll be using fulfillment partners in these regions to minimize these costs as much as we can.\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll be using Backerkit to manage the fulfillment of rewards after the campaign.  You'll enter your shipping info there, and select your colors.  If you want to add-on to your pledge for more Dice Towers or any of our other products, you can do it there, too.  There will be an additional shipping charge starting at $4 for US orders for add-ons through Backerkit, but you'll still save a lot by bundling a bigger order together.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our third Kickstarter and we've delivered on every one.

Unfortunately, we were unable to make a formal announcement/update earlier due to the uncertain nature of shipping goods by sea. A large part in the delay is also due to the fact the last few months of the year is a peak period for shipping and many shipping lines were fully booked and were not able to schedule our game for shipment.

Virtual reality has come at a cost they can never pay, a tradeoff of freedom for technology. But there are freedom fighters who reject the system, unplugging from the illusion and working to make things right once again. They are la R\u00e9sistance. \nRise up and defy the corporations in the Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG, set in the same universe as The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution from Indie Boards & Cards.\nAre you already a backer? Then go to this backers-only post and download the latest copy of Uprising right now!\nFound a typo or other error in the draft? Let us know! We're collecting them here.\nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Uprising through them? Encourage your FLGS to back us and get their copies early!\nUprising is the roleplaying game based on the hit Dystopian Universe (DU) games from Indie Boards & Cards, including The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution. Like the other DU games, Uprising is about cunning spies and government agents, loyalty and betrayal, propaganda, unrest, and violent revolution. Unlike the other games, it\u2019s a roleplaying game or RPG. Uprising uses a modified version of the Fate Core rules. You\u2019ll step into the identities behind the cards\u2014or make your own\u2014and foment rebellion, betray close friends, aid enemies, and hopefully survive the dark and gritty streets of Paris Nouveau.\n\nAn RPG? What\u2019s that?  \nIn a roleplaying game, all of the players work together to tell a story--in this case, one about the lives of revolutionaries in the cyberpunk world of Paris Nouveau. Most of the players are PCs or player characters. These players decide what their character will do in response to what's happening in game. One person at the table will be the Game Master or GM. This player decides what the opposition and supporting characters do. When a character takes action, the player will roll the dice to see how successful (or unsuccessful) that effort is, but the real fun is in deciding together what happens next.\nYour cyberpunk Paris experience may vary.\n  What if I\u2019ve never played an RPG before?\nYou're in luck! RPGs are a lot of fun, and we've made special effort to insure this one is accessible to fans of the other DU games who might never have tried an RPG. Inside, you'll find the following beginner-friendly elements:\nCharacter archetypes based on familiar DU cards \u2013 Ever look at the cards during a game of Coup: Rebellion G54 and wonder what the Aristocrat or the General was thinking? This is your chance to find out first-hand!\nBeginner-friendly instructions \u2013 All this group storytelling sounds great, but what exactly do you do? This book lays it all out, along with an example of how it would play at the table.\nCharacter playsheets \u2013 Like the other DU games, all of the characters fall into familiar types. Pick a playsheet, customize it, and get playing quickly.\nSample missions - To help out new GMs (and anyone short on time!), we\u2019ve provided a series of pre-made missions. All the pieces, plot points, and characters are provided!\nStep into the Dystopian Universe\n\nI\u2019m a Fate fanatic! What\u2019s in it for me?\nFor gamers familiar with Fate, Uprising offers some new and exciting mechanics\u2014not to mention that compelling cyberpunk setting. Inside, you\u2019ll find the following new elements:\nSecrets \u2013 Fate Core is built around camaraderie and teamwork, but at its core, the Dystopian Universe is full of backstabbing and deceit. Uprising provides a mechanical system for in-character secrets that will keep everyone at the table guessing.\nPrep scenes \u2013 Do more with your downtime than just refreshing your Fate pool with the new prep scene rules. Request favors, requisition equipment, and create advantages to use later.\nNew action rules \u2013 Instead of skills or approaches, Uprising uses means\u2014Fight, Manipulate, Maneuver, and Observe. Adjust the outcome depending on whether the means fit the end goal.\nAdvancement system \u2013 Instead of milestones, character-specific goals lead to character growth\u2014and sometimes put the characters at odds with each other.\nIn Paris Nouveau, danger lurks around every corner.\nAt KS launch, we\u2019ve already got a laid out copy of the game, which you can download immediately upon pledging. We're still finishing up the art, and we'll be sharing the development of the last few pieces with you throughout this Kickstarter! Next steps include proofing (which you can help with by downloading the instant PDF and reporting any problems here), finishing up that art, and print production.\nOur current timeline has Kickstarter fulfillment happening in December 2018, but we're looking at possibilities to shave some time off of that. Of course we\u2019ll keep you notified of how we\u2019re doing at every step of the process. We\u2019re rather proud of our track record when it comes to prompt KS fulfillment and excellent customer service, and, as always, we\u2019re committed to making this KS a positive experience for our backers.\nThe PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you'll get immediate access to the early preview PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. We're doing this because we want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you\u2019re new to RPGs. It also gives you a chance to provide us critical feedback that will improve the game in its final form. We\u2019ll update the final PDF for backers at the $20 level and up, as soon as that\u2019s available. But folks who don't back this project will have to wait a few months before they'll get their hands on that.\nPlease note that you'll see some art placeholders in the book (outlines or blank boxes). If that wasn't clear above, we'll be filling those in with the remaining art once it's done.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $39 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\", hardcover, 310 page, full color version of Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG. Shipping late 2018.\nDigital Bonuses: All backers at $20 and higher will receive a download link to a digital bonus pack. This downloadable folder of awesomeness will include copies of Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, Venture City (our superhero flavored cyberpunk supplement), and Designers & Dragons: The 70\u2019s (the first volume in our four book history of the RPG industry), plus sample chapters from recent releases Fate Adversary Toolkit, Dresden Files Accelerated, and upcoming releases Tachyon Squadron and Scum and Villainy.\nUNLOCKED: POD Secrets Deck: Once we reach $10,500, we'll unlock a digital coupon code for a POD copy of the Secrets Deck from DriveThruCards for all backers at $20 and up. The book comes with printable secret cards so you can get playing immediately (and you'll be able to download a clean PDF of them from our website), but we'd like to offer a more durable card option. The code will allow you to purchase the POD version at cost (around $1.22 based on our current quote, as opposed to the $5-or-so we'll charge outside of this KS) plus shipping.\nUNLOCKED: Paris Nouveau Corporate Catalog: Once we reach this funding goal, we'll unlock the Corporate Catalog supplement for all backers at $20 and up. This electronic-only, approximately 5000 word supplement will include more corporations to act as foils, antagonists, or uneasy allies; equipment produced by each corporation to provide an easy PC-purchase list; and additional corp-specific implants and contacts.\nUNLOCKED: Safehouses and Hotspots: At $23K, all backers at $20 and up will unlock the Safehouses and Hotspots supplement. This electronic-only, approximately 4000 word supplement will include 2-page spreads with ready-made encounters that the GM can drop into existing missions. GMs can also repurpose the included NPC stats for use in a home-brew mission.\nUNLOCKED: The Second Fall and Other Stories: Our next stretch goal is for The Second Fall and Other Stories, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. Many of the missions in the core book are stand-alone, but some connect into a loose story arc. This downloadable, approximately 5000 word supplement will provide additional story arcs, each broken down into six connected missions. These can be chained together or run as a ready-made campaign. Once we unlock this goal, we\u2019ll start writing!\nUNLOCKED: Beyond the Walls: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Beyond the Walls, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This supersized supplement (at approximately 10,000 words) will focus on a new city beyond the walls of Paris Nouveau, with a different style of oppression. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nUNLOCKED: Invisible Hands: The Black Market: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Invisible Hands supplement, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This 5000 word electronic supplement will give you a look at the underbelly of Paris Nouveau\u2014with echoes of the Grifters of the Dystopian Universe. It will include new underworld contacts and plenty of illegal tech to fuel your campaigns.\nUNLOCKS AT $52,000: Upfrancisco Uprising: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on a profile of Upfrancisco. Take your Uprising campaign to an entirely new setting and country with this 10,000 word electronic supplement. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nAs with our other recent Kickstarters, we're charging a flat $6 shipping fee.  This also allows us to subsidize the shipping a bit--the actual S&H costs will be more than the $6 we're charging you.\nWe'll also be using BackerKit, where you'll also be able to configure your rewards. BackerKit is a pledge manager--a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll also have the option to add on a few select items via the BackerKit if you choose to do so, with no extra shipping costs.\nWe\u2019ve made the difficult decision not to offer international shipping in this Kickstarter. To put it simply\u2014the shipping costs our distributors are able to offer is as much or more than the products we\u2019d ship. We can\u2019t in good conscience ask you to pay it. However, we still want international folks to be able to get their hands on the goodies. You can try a freight forwarder or a friendly American willing to forward the shipment to you. If that's not feasible for you, we've made it a point to make all of the materials available in an international-friendly electronic tier to make sure you can join the uprising no matter where you live. And of course we'll make the book available in international distribution, when we get to that point.\nDevelopers: Brian Engard, Anna Meade\nEditor: J.D.

We've printed many role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years\u2014twelve in the past two years alone. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Art: The art could take longer to execute than we're hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Artists are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we'll likely roll with it, and we'll let you know what's up. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other artists we've worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.\n\nThe Text: While the editing, layout, and playtesting of Uprising is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already invested time and money to get Uprising to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Ordinary humans, and even some heroes, regress and become ruled by their primal passions.\nThere are amazing opportunities scattered among the Living Land's perils. The Law of Wonders insures that lost treasures appear in the misty and unexplored jungles. These treasures might have disappeared from Earth long ago or they may be relics from cosms destroyed by the High Lords.

It's a privilege to be entrusted by so many people to bring this project to life. We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed a combined seven Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because we have so much experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partner in China for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible. We have strong relationships with our international fulfillment partners. These are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparation after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nAdditionally, we will be freighting the Elder Dice around the world to our fulfillment partners who will then send the rewards to you. Shipping delays at sea, weather conditions, extended customs inspections, and more could potentially delay the project at this stage.\n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes. The final dice may differ in detail and color. But, when you support Elder Dice, we promise to keep you up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the dice are shipped.

Their binding knowledge is poor and the entities of the Wild Hunt strain against their bonds. The splinter group is holding a hungry tiger by the tail and can only keep the Hunt busy lest it turn on them. They seek out the Investigators and endeavour to strike a devil's bargain; help them end or control the monsters, or see them create a bloodbath the likes the North-East of America has never seen.\nCan the rebel group be trusted?\nCan the Investigators walk away and live with their decision?\nCan the Wild Hunt be controlled? And by whom?\n\nIt is time for you to find out!\nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com.\nThe book will also contain the main adventure written by Tyler Omichinski, NPCs, plans, scenario seeds, and options to expand the Investigators' dealings with the Wild Hunt. Layout will be by Stephanie McAlea, but we'd like to add further art by creators we admire and trust to deliver. This is where the Kickstarter funds come in.\nTaking its inspirational cues from Celtic myth, classic monsters, and H.P. Lovecraft, the book takes a mature look at the horror of Mythos interpretations by historic cultures and will also summarise the tragedy of terrorism, self-determination, and their links to organised crime. There will also be information on how Celtic cultures in Britain and Ireland re-interpret the mythos to fit their cultural narrative and, as the subjects within can be sensitive for many, this book is for mature gamers only. \nThe funds for this Kickstarter will go towards commissioning more art and the hiring more writers and creatives of quality if the book is to expand. The funds will also go on printing and distribution.\nUnlike their characters who face insanity and death, backers can look forward to lovingly produced PDFs, Softcover and Hardcover books, and increased quality and content depending on stretch goals.\nAt the moment, the books are 90 pages and will be perfect bound. They will have a colour cover and greyscale internal pages. Due to stretch goals, these are all subject to change.\nThe entire cost of your books and getting them to you is covered by your pledge.\nThe top tier reward is slightly different. Those who pledge at this level can look forward to Stygian Fox's owner, Stephanie McAlea, running a scenario at the Continuum gaming convention on the 21st of July at Oadby Campus, in Leicester, UK. It will be an abridged version of The Wild Hunt with pre-generated characters.\nAs the book won't be ready for distribution at this point, backers at this level will receive their copies in due course but will also receive copies of some of our previous titles and other goodies as a thank you for backing!\nA Note of Caution\nThe onus is on the backer to attend the convention and they must at least have a day ticket already purchased before pledging. Stygian Fox is not responsible for the backer failing to attend due to illness, act of a deity, or rail strikes. No refunds will be forthcoming for a failure to attend. \nAll convention rules must be adhered to and those not doing so, or flouting 'Wheaton's Law', will be removed from the table (and possibly the convention) immediately and without refund or compensatory gifts from Stygian Fox/Miss McAlea.\nThese rules are strict to protect both Stygian Fox/Miss McAlea but also other players and conventioneers. I'm sure you understand.\nMore information on this most excellent of gaming conventions can be found here: https://continuumconvention.co.uk/\nWith this project, our focus is to produce a beautiful and entertaining book but budget and time constraints may hamper that. With stretch goals and the economy of scale, we hope to furnish the book with better maps, more information and art, and have a premium level of quality in regards to printing and binding. If we're lucky enough to reach the top level we'll pay our writers and artists more for helping us get there. Admittedly, this doesn't benefit our backers but as pay in the RPG industry is seriously low, I'm sure you'll want to help the creatives involved to get a bonus.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all projects, there is a risk but as the manuscript is mostly complete we think this book has very little risk to it.

They hold up to twenty character sheets that can be turned over like a book due to being kept in place with ultra strong neodymium magnets. They can be removed and changed around. There are trays to store and roll dice, or you can roll them on the main board.\n\nWhen you're finished you put the lid on and everything is carried and stored safely until your next game.\n\nThey're made to set free your role playing games, making them more mobile and reducing setup and takedown time. They free up space on the games table and they even allow games to take place without a table. You can play on the sofa, in a hammock, on the lawn, in bed, around a camp fire.

It has a lid to help you transport everything and a large A5 (or a Junior Letter pad for US/Can orders). It can be rotated to suit people who are left or right handed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed the MN Board, it's more compact, thinner and without a lid it is light enough to dual wield. It's ideal for the games master to keep several at home to lend out when people come over to play. It holds a mobile phone or other small device for using apps or linking over skype. Comes in left and right handed options and features as A7 Pad (This has been modified to 76mm x 76mm to fit yellow stickies or 3inch square pads). Available in left or right handed options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed SF Board, it's a techy version that has Tablet and Mobile Phone dock for apps, browsers and skype games as well as a lid. Comes with an A6 (or a 4.25\u201d x 5.5\u201d pad for US/Can orders) pad and available in left and right handed options.\n \n\n\n\nWe designed the GM Board, it does lots, but not only does it do lots but you can customize how you use it so it does lots of what you want it to do. It has everything the others have and then a bit more, most notably 7 white GM Tabs form a GM screen.\nNote: Due to extensive backer feedback the GM Board has been modified. the A5 ring bound pad has been removed. In its place there is a tray for miniatures, a smaller notepad and 4 areas for different coloured post-it notes/stickies. This seems a fairly unanimous upgrade in function. The GM board still features 7 GM Tabs and all are the full height (not different heights as featured on the production prototypes video)\n\n______________________________________________\nSpecification/Details:\nProduction: CNC machined to 0.2mm accuracy by Novacrylics Engineering, my family company run by me and my brother in Warwickshire, England. Magnets: Specially developed Chrome plated Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnets, losing only 1% of their strength per decade. These magnets are safe to use with electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones.\n\nBacker Security: Please read my profile and learn about what resources and experience I have behind me\n\nProduct Security: Patent Pending and Registered Design in major world markets.\n\nWood: High quality, sustainable, cavity free, FSC rated Birch Ply\nTablet and Phone Compatibility: Compatible with all known tablets. If you roll a critical fail on your choice of tablet and you got an oval one or something then thats too bad, but we tried nearly 30 different tablets and every one of them sat on it just fine. Phones wider than 70mm don't sit well on the MN and the SF but are fine on the GM.\n\nGM Tabs: The GM tabs acting as a screen on the GM Board are made of cast PMMA with an mirco-etched finish allowing them to be drawn on with a normal pencil (is exactly the same as using a chalk board). Pencil marks can be removed with an eraser. In testing the tabs have been written and erased over 100 times with no effect to function, it is likely they can be used an unlimited number of times. In addition you can write on the tabs with a permanent marker which doesn't come off allowing hitpoint counters which stay in place even if you cross off and erase hitpoint ticks.\n\nPads come with the boards and are available cheaply as refils.

All orders sent to N.American will automatically be shipped fitting US paper (no need to change your order). Orders delivered elsewhere will remain A sized.\n\n-\n\n**Stretch Goals Added - 23rd Jan 2018**Note: We didn't expect to reach this point 6 days after the kickstarter begun! This was all the upgrades we were planning on offering! We didn't budget for being able to offer anything else for free, but we've worked non-stop for 3 days to get more unlock goals. We couldn't make all of them free, but I hope you like what we came up with. Photos and more information to come when prototypes are made.\n\n-\n\n\u00a312,000 ***Unlocked***\nVelcro Book Strap (Paid Upgrade at \u00a35 each) 50mm (2in) Velcro (TM) strap that wraps around all CharacTables allowing them to be bundled together with other CharacTables or allowing them to be bundled together and carried with a pile of rule books, pads, or other items. up to 20cm (8in) thick.\n -\n\u00a313,000 ***unlocked***\nElastomer Die Trays(Free Upgrade)Hard Wearing Elastomer Dice Trays. This second upgrade to the dice trays results in a hard wearing easily cleanable surface of charcoal coloured elastomer. Stays much cleaner than felt and is easier to clean with water if it does get dirty. More durable and entirely water proof allowing the die tray to be used as a cup holder too. Rolling is a little bit quieter than on felt and the dice seem to jiggle and bounce around a bit more when rolled as its a slightly springier surface. This goal will be applied to all unlocked CharacTable Boards and all boards.\n-\n\u00a314,000 ***Unlocked*** \n28mm Miniature Case (Paid Upgrade at \u00a315 each) A case that contains chunky foam pieces (not pictured) that can be attached to the velcro strap. Carries up to four 28mm characters or the equivalent. A character, a mount and a familiar/animal companion could be stored in the case for example. This attaches to the velcro strap.\n-\n\u00a316,000 ***Unlocked***\nCarry Case (Paid Upgrade at \u00a330 each) A lid that features a carry handle allowing the CharacTable to be carried like a briefcase. Be aware that this makes the CharacTable around 7.5cm (3in) higher.\n-\n\u00a319,000 ***Unlocked***\nMagnetic Side Tab (Free Upgrade) A white bar clamps character sheets to the main board and replaces the two button magnets. This allows for easier turnover of pages and prevents the individual magnets from being lost. It is made from the same material as the GM tabs and so allows a small area alongside the sheet for short term tracking of hitpoints, spells, temporary modifiers to saves/weapons etc. This can all be done alongside the character sheet next to the relevant stat/weapon/character instead of repeatedly writing on and erasing the character sheet. This goal will be applied to all CharacTables past and future.\n-\n\n\u00a320,000 ***unlocked***\nHandle + 100mm (4in) Velcro (TM) Strap (Paid Upgrade at \u00a314) A specially made 25mm birch ply handle on a 100mm velcro strap. Holds the Miniature case and many rule books.\n-\n\u00a322,000 ***Unlocked***\nCabinet Finish (Paid Upgrade) Two coats of high quality semi-mat spray varnish to seal and protect\n-\n\u00a324,000 ***Unlocked***\nFully Covered lid (Free Upgrade) All CharacTable boards that currently have lids are upgraded to feature a lid that covers the full surface of the CharacTable. This goal will be applied to all CharacTable orders past and future. We have had a lot of requests for this one, the reason this is so late in the pledge tree is because it requires much more wood, and stronger (more expensive) magnets to hold the bigger lid securely in place.\n-\n\n\u00a326,000\nMobile/Tablet Charger conduit (Free Upgrade)\nA hole and modified board for the mobile phone charger cable to run to the phone and tablet docks allowing them to be used in portrait orientation while being charged (seen on the production prototypes video)\n\n-\n\n\u00a328,000\nAcrylic Lids (Paid Upgrade).\nA variety of coloured and clear acrylic lids. Choose from black, white, clear, red, yellow, blue, green, pink, purple, orange.

A game that looks into the face of destiny, and decides for itself. It is a game about mythic deeds, and choosing free will over fate.    \nDestiny is a choice. \nThe Viziers guide the flow of our world toward its inexorable doom. The armies of the world amass and gather, intent on destruction and death. Only you can choose the path of your own fate. By your actions, you choose the course of history. \nThe burden of free will is yours alone. The chains of destiny cannot hold you.  \nYou are free.\nDraw your sword.\nMake your choice.\nGuide your destiny.\nIn Warsong Second Edition, you play as one of the Viziers, ancient shape-shifting Quicksilvers, dread undead Neverborn or one of the other primordial inheritors of the world. It is your free will that will shape the course of history and decide whether the world will fall by its own hand, or rise up from its ashes. The ancient powers are but memories, and the people fight for the right to rule.\nThe skeins of destiny have begun to fray and the Ancient Viziers have disappeared along with the old gods, leaving destiny in the hands of their heirs. You are one of the children of the primordial powers, born the promise of destiny, and bound to its power.\nArmed with the power of magic and the ability to shape destiny itself, the Viziers, divine offspring of both god and man, stand as the world's last defense against the forces of entropy and their own self-destruction. The gods, ancient viziers and primordial powers have disappeared, the nations refuse to stand united for a promised future and bitter rivalries burn as brightly as ever while the world's life force dwindles down to ember. It won't be an easy choice, but it will be yours to make.\nWhat will you do with Free Will?\nWarsong Second Edition began in 2013 as a play-test sample world built along with Pathfinder guidelines. Over time, it became a game of its own and Kickstarted on June 25 2016. Since then, it's become a dynamic world that has gathered some of the most passionate fans Higher Grounds has ever seen. Now, a bit over a year after the game's release, a revised and expanded second edition is nearing completion. Renewed in its second edition, Warsong Second Edition takes a year of reviews, feedback and criticism and puts those lessons to work.\nToday, Warsong Second Edition is ready to jump back into the fray as a distilled and refined game using the Fate Core System rules, ready to ride the skeins of fate once more.\n The Warsong Second Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a hardcover edition designed to improve upon the look and feel of the last book. We want to create a 6\" x 9\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, symbolic cover image. We estimate this book to be over 400 pages on high quality paper stock. We will also offer black-and-white paperback options.\nWarsong Second Edition will include rules for playing many kinds of heirs, including the Viziers, Quicksilvers and Neverborn. It will include Extras for each type of character, including powers for each type of character as well as new Aspect types and antagonists including the destiny-warping Untouched, Skein-Walkers that guard the threads of fate and many more. It will also include detailed setting information and adventure hooks and even a starting adventure to help get new players started.\nThe Viziers are the main type of character in Warsong Second Edition. They are heirs to the destiny of the world, and the direct descendets of the ancient, god-like Viziers that watched over the fate of everything from a rabbit in the woods to cataclysmic disasters. As a Vizier, you do not have the world-shattering power that your ancestors held, but you must take up their mantle and choose whether to guide the world toward oblivion, or save it from certain doom. You wield powerful Loom Weaving abilities, which allow you to make alterations to the very destiny of the people, places and events around you. You can Hack The Loom, allowing you to make minor alterations to your own destiny and the destiny of others, or you can Dive, allowing you to create a fake persona and change situations in the past or the future by your own hands. As a Vizier, the fate of the world literally rests in your hands. \nThe Quicksilvers are descended from the ancient Lycanthrope. You are blessed with free will and the ability to change your shapes into any animal or person that you've encountered. Your do not have one true shape, but two. That of your human form which you were given at birth, and your animal totem, which gives you the power of the Eldritch Primordials to change your shape. It is your geas to protect the world and all life within it, and your ancestral prophecies have destined the end to come within your lifetime. Those Quicksilvers who will fight in the final battle have already be born.\nThe dreaded Neverborn are feared knights of death, itself. You do not need ancient lineage or powerful ancestors to claim your power, for your power was earned upon your death. You are the end of the cycle of life, culling the weak and feeble. You are also the means by which new life can grow. Without death, there is indeed no life. Without you, life would not exist. You can wield the powerful, inevitable mastery of death itself as one of the Neverborn, powerful agents of death and rebirth.\nThere are more types of characters to play as well. There are powerful mortals that have been trained by one of the clans in their very own styles of martial arts and warfare. They can wield strange technologies such as Power Armor, Relics and even Eldritch Sorcery, a dangerous and often outlawed method of using the energies of the Far Dimensions to create magical effects in reality. \nEach of the Five Nations has a ruling class of individuals that either belong to a bloodline or have been adopted in. These families are called Clans and each clan has a ruling lord that seeks to vie for supremacy over the other nations. As the Grand Emperor reaches his final days, the already-fragile peace between the nations has devolved into all-out war. There is the stout and loyal Crab Clan, the ferocious Tiger Clan, the clever Monkey Clan, the devious Snake Clan and the wise Dragon Clan. There are clans that exist outside the rule of the Grand Emperor. Mistrusted and often seen as enemies to the rule of the Grand Emperor, there are the graceful Crane Clan and the malicious, deadly Scorpion Clan. \nWho will rule the nations? You must decide.\nOur intention with this Kickstarter campaign is to make the best version of Warsong Second Edition possible. Getting your support now will allow us to fund the best production, use the best components and perhaps even add even more art and content to the book.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully finished and completed six Kickstarter projects and several more are headed to completion as you read this.

All pieces move in the direction of the reversed S letter.\nPieces: Each Player has 5 pieces and they are printed with different number dots 1 to 5.\nStarting position: Two groups of pieces are placed alternately from No.1 starting square (sun) like as 5,5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1.\nStarting position\nRules\n\u3010Dice rolling\u3011\nDecide which player will place their piece on starting square (sun). Players continue to alternate turns, with each turn consisting of the rolling of two dice, followed by the movement of that player\u2019s playing pieces. The values on the rolled dice indicate how many spaces a playing piece moves. Exception: If the player has only 1 remaining playing piece left on the board, then they can choose to roll two dice or one die.\n\u3010Movement options\u3011\nPlaying pieces may be moved according to any of the following rules.\nTwo playing pieces are moved, each using the value of a different die.\nA single playing piece is moved according to the combined value of the two dice.\nPlayers can't move a piece to the square where own piece occupied, but they can move it where opponent piece occupied. \nThat occupied opponent piece must go back to starting square (sun).\nWhen it goes back if a piece(regardless own and opponent) is on the starting square, the piece on the starting square must be taken off the board. That piece is out of play for the remainder of the game.\n\u3010How to go up goal : bearing off\u3011\nBearing off goal is beyond the No.30 square. Playing pieces must be able to land exactly on one space beyond the No.30 square to bear off. If there are more spaces to move, the playing piece must move backwards on the board, starting from the number 30 square, the number of spaces left.\n\u3010Winning\u3011\nWhen 3 pieces(regardless own and opponent) reach the goal, the game is over. The total of the finished piece's dot(s)  is the score. The winner is the player who obtains the  highest score. When scores are tied, the player who has more finished pieces wins the game. Passing on your turn is not allowed. The player who doesn't have legal move at his turn loses the game.\n\u3010Special effect squares\u3011\nSix symbol tiles except for starting square(sun) are special effect squares. If the piece stops on there, it must do below options.\nIf a piece stops on the No.15 square(bird), it must move to the No.27 square(egg).\nIf a piece stops on the No.26 square(sunset), it must move to the No.1 square(sun).\nIf a piece stops on the No.27 square(egg), it must move to the No.15 square(bird).\nNo.28,29,30 are safety squares to go up the goal. Other piece(s) out of three squares can't move to these squares occupied with pieces. But piece(s) on these squares must move at their next turn.\nThese piece(s) on the special effect squares can move to any squares regardless the space is occupied with own or opponent piece.\n\u25cfSupporter's aid Senet-modern laminated paper board edition with creator's signature. 1,000 JPYen (Approx:$9USD) free shipping anywhere in the world.\nBoard\uff1alaminated paper, 4 inches \u00d7 8 inches\nPieces\uff1aceramic tiles, 0.6 inch square\u30010.2 inch thick\nTwo dice and a rule note\npackaged with plastic bag\nYou can get additionally this reward simply to increase your pledge money 500JPYen(Approx:$5USD).\nReward is shipped by ordinary SAL air mail.

You will pick your adventurers, spend your coins to boost their stats, and then sit back and watch as the dice determine their fate in the old Bracket Dungeon. You'll also place bets on your favorite groups, trying to gain complete sets of Red, Green and Purple coins. In the end, all of your adventurers may be dead and gone, but you can still be the king of Semifinal Fantasy! \n  Once you get into the Dungeoncrawl phase, groups will roll dice to compete in a variety of trials. They'll compare results and the winning group scores coins, and the adventurer that contributed the most scores extra coins. These can be used to boost and bet in future rounds, or hold out for endgame scoring.  \nAfter 3 sets of trials, the game is over and the player with the most points wins.\nComponents\nThe game consists of 9 pages that are used for each game session. Print them each time you play, or laminate them for endless replayability.\n4 pages of player tableaus\n4 pages of adventuring teams\n1 page with the bracket and alternate adventurers\nPlus 2 pages of rules that you will only need to print once.\nYou will need to provide one (or preferably two) set(s) of polyhedral dice, and something to write with.\nBlack and White Version\nIf you want to save on ink, this is the way to go. Old school and bare bones. It's just black ink on white paper, and you can print at Kinko's for like 5 cents a page or on your printer that is likely going to be out of ink any minute now. \nLite Color Version\nThis one has just the essentials. Colors separating the 3 types of trials (Speed, Power and Intelligence). It holds your hands and guides your eyes a little, allowing you to focus on the important things (like making sure anyone other than your brother ends up winning the game). \nFull Color Version\nIf you actually have color ink in your printer (I don't believe you, but it was a good try), this is the full deal. Full color pages that both guide the eye and define the characters. It's an impressive layout when the entire table is covered, and feels like First Class Semifinal Fantasy.\n What else is there to say?\nLet's see. This game started out as a massive big box prototype at Unpub 4 back in 2014. The name was Fantasy Fantasy, perhaps the most perfect name to ever exist. From there myself and Luke Peterschmidt of FunTo11 discussed some options with the game (merging concepts with a game that he was working on) and a few publishers took a look at it. Eventually I set it aside as things for Button Shy were ramping up, and the price point was just too high. The game used almost 200 coins, and had 8-16 different tableaus. It was ambitious, but it felt right. The game was about big crunchy stats, mixed with big hinging die rolls, and deep competition mixed with an odd sense of collaboration. But it would have a $60-80 price tag, and I couldn't pull that off.\nFast forward some time and JR Honeycutt and Daryl Andrews release their game Fantasy Fantasy Baseball. The most awesome name of all time was no longer an option. I simply waited too long, and it happens. Sometimes it's crushing and other times you can turn it around into something even better, which I was able to do here.\nIt took a LONG time, but Semifinal Fantasy clicked one day and it clicked in a big way. I now prefer it to the original name, except it's just missing the sass of the original. But it's here and here to stay. Once the name was back in place, I was motivated to get this back on the table and featured it at the Granite Game Summit in late 2016. It was still the big massive version, and I considered just making it a con game. I'd run it at cons and it would be a great time, that nobody could afford to reproduce at home. But is that a bad thing? I'm not so sure. I still love the idea of a con only game, and this one is ripe for it. Anyway, Granite Game Summit was awesome, and the game went over very well. I was happy to get it moving again. \nCome along 2017 and roll & writes are everywhere. It's a design space that I love, since you can easily get it to the table with little other than the paper, pencil and some dice. Semifinal Fantasy crossed my mind as a possibility to reduce the component count. When I actually started on it, I realized how much it fit, not only mechanically, but also in theme. Old school fantasy football drafts on paper, and classic roleplaying character sheets were a big inspiration. \nThat brings us to today, Black Friday 2017. What better day is there to release a football-inspired budget conscious game? ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first time making a roll and write game.

Truesdell [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\nBesides his works of cosmic horror, he also wrote a series of poems, short stories and a novella set in a high fantasy world know as the Dreamlands. The Dreamlands was an alternate dimension that could be entered through dreams filled with ancient ruins, monsters, seedy taverns and cats. Unlike the dread of his horror writing, the dreamlands were filled with heroism and adventure.\nHeather and I are tremendous Lovecraft fans, as are many of our friends. And once again we had ideas\u2026 so many ideas\u2026 too many ideas for just one card. So we decided to make nine of them. They are meant to seem like \"normal\" Christmas cards when viewed across the room on the mantle. Its only when you get closer that their true nature becomes apparent. Not only do we have new cards but we are offing the old cards again if you missed our other 2 Kickstarters and we are offering WRAPPING PAPER!\nThe Project\nSince we are making quite a few designs we are breaking them into 2 separate packs. Each pack has 4 unique cards and the Cats of Ulthar card. One reason for this is that Heather just didn't have the time to make a 10th design. The other reason is that Lovecraft LOVED cats (and ghouls apparently), they appear all over the Dreamlands and we love them too. We felt that many single pack backers would feel disappointed if they didn't get the cat card in their pack. There is a stretch goal to alter one of the cat cards if you are backing both packs and don't want a duplicate. The cards will be professionally printed in full color on a thick 130lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope. We have been told that the paper takes ink from a quill pen fantastically. Each card will also come with a matching envelope. The envelopes are square backed and will have a self adhesive strip - so no licking needed.\nHeather is hard at work finishing the cards, she has done color studies for all of them and has started all the paintings but as we launch only 2 of them are \"final\" final. Instead of showing half finished paintings we have posted the sketches of the cards which will be replaced as the paintings are finished. You will be able to see all the final art well before the end of the campaign. \nDreamland Xmas Pack Set 1 (5 cards)\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 1 - Santa Toad\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 2 - Yak Riders of Inganok\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 3 - Moonlight Sledding\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 4 - Love Gugs (Under the Mistletoe)\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 5 - Ulthar Cats Want In\n  Dreamland Xmas Pack Set 2 (5 cards)\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 1 - Sarkomand Starlight\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 2 - Cavern of Flame\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 4 - (Santa vs.) The Black Galley\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 3 - Happy Zoogs of Zoogville\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 5 - Ulthar Cats Want In\nThe Gift Wrap\nThis year we are trying out some gift wrap. Its just a single design printed on a single side (if it proves popular there is a later stretch goal to expand it to one sheet each of five different designs.) The 18\" x 24\" gift wrap comes in five folded sheets. It folds down to 9 x 12 so we can fit it into a standard mailer. It is printed on a 70 lb. high quality matt stock.  A single sheet will wrap a moderately sized box.\nWrapping paper design\nPrevious Year's Cards\nFor those of you that missed the previous year's cards we are offering them again!\nThe Cthulhu Mythos Pack Set (5 cards)\nThe cards will be professionally printed in full color on a thick 130lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope.\nCthulhu Card 1 - The Snows are Right\n  Cthulhu Card 2 - Lovecraft Claus\n  Cthulhu Card 3 - The Yithmas Tree\n  Cthulhu Card 4 - Ho Ho Migo\n  Cthulhu Card 5 - The Innsmouth Carollers\n  Cthulhu cards envelope and seal\nThe King in Yellow Pack Set (5 cards)\nKing in Yellow Card 1 - The Day Has Come\n  King in Yellow Card 2 - Twin Suns\n  King in Yellow Card 3 - No Mask\n  King in Yellow Card 4 - Behind the Moon\n  King in Yellow cards envelope and seal\n  Dragon Wreath (fantasy bonus card)\nReward Levels \n  Stretch Goals\n$4,000 Printed Interior\nAt $4,000 the cards will get color printed phrases and holiday platitudes.\n$5,000 Silver envelopes\nAt $5,000 the lilac envelopes will be replaced by silver metallic envelopes to give your cards that extra bit of class. The envelopes are square backed and will have a self adhesive strip - so no licking.\n$6,000 Printing on envelopes\nAt $6,000 we will add a printed line art holiday illustration onto the silver envelopes.\nPrinted Silver envelopes\n$7,000 Silver key embossed seal\nAt $7,000 we will add a 2.5 x 1.75 inch oval embossed seal printed on a dull silver foil with a hot stamped and embossed shiny silver key. In the several of the stories the Silver Key is used to allow dreamers to enter the Dreamlands.\nThe Silver Key card seal\n$8,000 4 Free Gift tags\nAt $8,000 every physical order will receive 4 free 2\" x 4\" card stock full color gift tags. The gift tags will also be added to the PDFs.\n2\" x 4\" Gift tags\n$10,000 5 different wrapping paper designs\nAt $10,000 the single design for the five sheet pack of wrapping paper will change to 5 different single sheet designs.\nGift wrap designs\n$12,000 Alternate art for cats card.\nAt $12,000 the \"Ulthar Cats Want In\" card in set 2 will have its colors and detailed altered.\nInternational shipping\nWe are shipping to Canada and Europe this year. We would like your support but we ask that you consider getting the PDFs first if you are not in the States. We CANNOT guarantee that your cards will arrive in time for Christmas, so if you plan on using them this year you may be out of luck. Some European countries also have notoriously bad mail systems when receiving things from the states (Spain, Italy, Eastern Europe), we have had personal shipments take months to arrive, have been in poor condition or even lost. The price is also very steep and please be aware that some countries will charge a customs handling fee on items over a certain price / weight, unfortunately we have no control over this. If you are willing to take the risk we will ship to you.\nWe need your help\nThis is where you come in. We need your help to offset around 2/3 of the printing costs. We would like to have enough funding to print cards for both the Kickstarter rewards and to stock them for next year. Timelines are tight but we have printers' assurances that printing will start right after the Kickstarter finishes and we can ship cards out in good time for you to send them for the holidays. We want to get them into your hands early in the first week of December (we\u2019re shooting for the 1st of December). We have been told that we have the fastest turnaround that our supporters have backed. Help us to achieve our vision of making the holidays a little weirder, you will be getting some beautifully printed cards of you own to start you own new holiday tradition.\nWho are we?\nHeather paints the pictures, Daniel handles the rest.\nDaniel Gelon has over 25 years of art experience. He has done illustration, UX, graphic design, production and art direction. He has illustrated Magic cards, created logos for DC comics, art directed Dungeons and Dragons books and has worked on various video games. He is obsessed with machines made of paper. Heather Hudson\nHeather Hudson is a frequently digital fantasy artist with a traditional paint sensibility and a love of early-20th century popular culture. She\u2019s worked on tabletop and hobby games including Hasbro's \u201cMagic; the Gathering\u201d and Pagan Publishing's modern Mythos RPG \u201cDelta Green.\u201d Past Lovecraftian projects she's illustrated include \"Casino R'lyeh, the Lovecraft Poker Deck,\" and \"Mother Hydra's Mythos Rhymes.\" Currently she divides her time between commissioned illustration, personal projects and creating her own fantasy world somewhere between Oz and the Dreamlands. She has a fondness for illuminating monsters.\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe final art is not finished. Heather has done final sketches and color studies for the outstanding pieces and has all of them started in various degrees of finish. She is confident that she has the time finish the work before the campaign's end. Barring some accident or carpel-tunnel syndrome we will be fine. If the art can't be finished, we would cancel the campaign rather than go through with it and collect your money. \n\nWe run extremely fast turnarounds to make the holiday season deadline. There are a lot of moving parts. The final files are in the printers hands before the end of the Kickstarter. The day after the campaign ends surveys go out and the printers get out final count for the jobs and it takes several weeks for the jobs to arrive to us. We do our best at hacking through the rewards to get them out in a timely manner. The process could gum up at any point. We know this and this will be our 3rd time doing this, we know all the timing and have all our systems in place best we can. We also have enough wiggle room to do expedited printing with the same printer or an alternate printer if things really go south. We are confident that we will have product in time to get it into your hands with time to send out for the holidays. \n\nThe only great unknown is the international shipping, this is the first campaign that we are trying it on and don't know yet what if anything can go wrong.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Just helping out", "descp": "Your reward is our THANKS.

Scared!?  \n...You should be.\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for THE DARE a scenario for The Call of Cthulhu\u2122 role-playing game, as licensed by Chaosium.  Originally written by Kevin Ross and published by Triad Entertainments in 1996, we have revised and expanded the scenario for the 7th Edition rules.\nWhat is it about?\n\"Children will always be afraid of the dark.\" - H.P. Lovecraft\nDo you remember what it was like to be a kid?  When in every shadow there might lurk a monster?  When a nightmare might be escaped from by diving under your blankets?  When the morning light brought escape from all your fears... for a little while?\nIn THE DARE, players take the role of a group of average kids who are forced by their neighborhood bully to spend the night in the dreadful (and haunted!) Barnaker house.  This being Call of Cthulhu, there are actually things in the house far more dangerous than even the most terrified child might imagine.  The kids must then work together to explore the nightmarish old Barnaker house and investigate its mysteries if they hope to survive until the morning.\nDraft of cover by Ian MacLean\nWho will enjoy it?\nHopefully you! THE DARE is a scenario ideally suited to a single session of play - for both experienced and novice players.  It can be a fun break from Cthulhian horrors your gaming group regularly faces or as an introduction to the game for newbies.  We're proud that Kevin Ross has given us the opportunity to resurrect and expand on his homage to the horror of Stephen King (among other authors) and are excited to share it with a new generation.\nWho are we?\nSentinel Hill Press is a small press focusing on Lovecraftian Horror with an emphasis on New England's history and folklore; we're also a Chaosium Licensee.  We produce the Arkham Gazette, a magazine for the Lovecraft Country setting for The Call of Cthulhu\u2122... and now this scenario.  More stuff to come, hopefully!\nTHE DARE's Features\nOur revised and expanded version of THE DARE includes the following features:\nGreatly expanded text (about 3 times the length of the original), updated to The Call of Cthulhu\u2122 7th Edition rules.  This includes an expanded description of the old Barnaker house, additional horrors and terrible encounters within, and advice for the Keeper in running the scenario to maximize fun.\nSuggestions for how to run the scenario for players new to the game as well as for younger players - we're including notes on how to run the scenario as if it was an R-rated movie as well as  PG-13 one for younger players.\n10 pre-generated kid-investigators.  We've set the scenario's default era to be the 1980s; it is not just a nostalgia kick (though that helps), it also serve to keep thing simple when it comes to explaining the setting while not having to worry about certain irksome modern technology.\nA simplified skill set, best suited to child investigators (and as an aid to new players).\nNew art by Ian MacLean; at a base level we will have a color cover, 6 \u00bc page black and white illustrations, and 10 investigator portraits.  One stretch goal will double the interior art to 12 pieces!\nNew and improved maps by Richard LeDuc, included in the scenario and as a separate file for your ease of printing.\nThe scenario is about 20,000 words long (including pre-generated characters) and is estimated to be about 40 pages.  Our goal is to get the scenario in your hands as quickly as possible. The text of the revised version has already been written and backers at the $10 level and above will get a PDF copy of the draft of the scenario IMMEDIATELY upon the close of this 10-day Kickstarter.  While the finished product will likely not be ready by Halloween, you should still be able to run THE DARE while eating miniature candy bars and sipping apple cider. \nI've selected stretch goals that are straightforward - no tote bags! - and won't significantly delay this project's completion.  We want to get this out in your hands are rapidly as we can. \nStretch Goals\nSpeaking of stretch goals...\n$3500 - Introduction by Kevin Ross; Kevin will write about his inspiration for THE DARE, give some background for the scenario, and perhaps suggest some instructive viewings for the Keeper before running the scenario.\n$4500 - More illustrations! More money means I can pay Ian to create even more terrifying illustrations.  The base scenario will have 6 \u00bc page illustrations plus cover and investigator portraits; if this stretch goal is reached, we will double the interior art to 12 \u00bc page images!\n$5500 - Modern Day setting notes and Investigators,  While the default era of THE DARE is the 1980s, is we reach this stretch goal we will add notes to the scenario about running it in the modern day and we will create an additional PDF of our ten child-investigators updated to the present day.  Now your kid-investigator can Instagram their terrifying demise!\n$6500 - Haunted House Scenarios in the Call of Cthulhu RPG; I will write a bibliographic essay about every \"haunted house\" scenario ever written for the Call of Cthulhu RPG, totaling about 5000 words.  More than just a list of \"haunted house\" scenarios, I'll dive into the qualities that make certain scenarios unique and, hopefully, inspirational.  Backer at $10 and higher will get a PDF of the essay.\n$7500 - 1920s setting notes and investigators.  Not interested in the 1980s or the modern day?  While not hurtle yourself back to yesteryear and play the scenario as it might have been in the 'Classic era' of Call of Cthulhu, the 1920s.\n$8250 - Archaic Secrets!  If this stretch goal is reached, all backers at \"Halloween Party Goer\" and up (aka $10+) will receive a PDF copy of Kevin Ross' original notes for the scenario.\n$9000 - 'Lovecraft's Circle' and 'Pulp creators' as investigators.  Dive into the meta-textual experience of playing as H.P. Lovecraft, his friends, and other Pulp writers/artists as children trapped in the Barnaker House!  We've found an author just mad enough to transform 10 Pulp authors and artists into kid-investigators, letting you live out your heretofore unknown dream of adventuring as Howie Lovecraft, a 'tween Clark Ashton Smith, or Miss Maggie Brundage tangling with horrors from beyond. \n**$12,000** - \"Horrors Yet to Come\".  If we reach this insane height, all backers at $20 or higher will get a preview of Kevin Ross' (as of yet untitled) sequel to THE DARE, set 30 years after the events of the scenario.  What nightmares does the future hold for THE DARE's survivors?  Timing of this reward is TBA. \nA Note About Shipping\nYou will note that none of the Print On Demand options including shipping.  This was intentional.  We have elected to leave shipping costs to POD buyers; you will get a notice that Sentinel Hill Press has provided you a copy of THE DARE via DriveThruRPG and will, at that point, pay for shipping.\nThe reasons for this are two-fold, which we hope our backers will view as beneficial.  The first is simplicity - the Kickstarter will not have to set up any differing pledge levels for other locations, or have add-on costs you need to calculate.  Most locations in the US, Canada, the UK, and EU will probably have a shipping expense of only a few dollars (my current estimate is around $4 US).  The second benefit is that by excluding these costs, you won't have to pay a premium by paying Kickstarter's fees on your shipping costs, which are roughly 10% of the money we raise. \nSo - you will pay the shipping cost of THE DARE, but you will ultimately pay less.\nImportant Licensing Note and Credits\nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium, Inc. and is used with their permission.

It\u2019s also about embarking on life-changing adventures, battling supernatural horrors, and often, simply surviving life in an unforgiving world fraught with danger, where even the Nemissaries\u2019 great powers won\u2019t necessarily protect them.\nSINS RPG Stretch Goals\nSINS Distribution for the US is supported by BackerKit\n SINS is a Friendly-Shipping Project - No Duties to the US or EU.\n Sins is all at once an exciting, mysterious and terrifying game which crosses several genres, and contains a rich mythos with a great deal to explore and inspire the imagination, all whilst taking familiar genres that you know and love into creative new ground.\nA Dying World  \nSins takes place in our own world, albeit about a century from now. The world as we know it is gone, replaced with a bleak post-apocalyptic wilderness. Some areas of the world have been scorched by nuclear weapons, and others have returned to their natural state, but the one constant is that mankind is no longer the master of the world. Large nations or civilisations are rare, and most contact takes place primarily on a local level between nomadic groups and small settlements. There are exceptions however, and one of the core themes of the game is the re-emergence of civilisations.\nA Monstrous Enemy  \nA major aspect of the setting are the aforementioned Brood, which are best described as a vast horde of highly mobile animated dead who share a dim collective consciousness and have the capacity to evolve into more dangerous, specialised forms. It\u2019s a mistake to view the Brood simply as the walking dead, because as their numbers grow, they begin to hear a strange, unearthly call, which lends a frightening degree of regenerative endurance and cunning coordination to their actions.  \nForgotten Horrors \nA major part of the world\u2019s history, and one of the reasons for the dramatic fall of civilisation was the emergence of seven individual beings with almost god-like destructive capabilities and the capacity to control the Brood. These creatures, now most commonly known as the Reapers, slaughtered their way through the largest concentrations of military might, and personally took a hand in the murder of many of the world\u2019s leaders.\nAt the height of their reign of terror, their victory seemed certain, but after a succession of surprising setbacks, including the death of one of their number in China, they seemed to disappear utterly. The Reapers now represent one of many unsolved mysteries for players to potentially stumble upon.\nDark Heroes \nThe beings which players portray were originally individuals consumed by the Brood, who fought back against their Hive-mind to retain a sense of self-awareness, and as such, regained their human forms and consciousness. Striking out against the Brood, they became known as the Nemissaries, after the ancient Greek goddess of retribution.\nIn a way, the Nemissaries sum up everything about the setting. They are at once monstrous, forced to survive as parasites, feeding on human emotion, but also incredibly powerful, capable of leading the way into a new future, and even opposing the Reapers, should they re-emerge. Nemissaries have many powers at their disposal \u2013 not least of which are the five primal Songs granting control over Blood, Bone, Flesh, Will, and the Brood. Collectively, these Songs of eldritch power, along with their impressive physical abilities, allow Nemissaries to overcome almost any opposition, particularly when they choose to work together. Nemissaries have a dark side as well, however \u2013 a strange wound in their soul, perhaps a side effect from their rebirth, or the lingering power of the Brood. In any case, every Nemissary contains their own worst enemy, and greatest weapon, inside of them - The Hollow. A demonic alter-ego of everything a Nemissary hates about themselves, the Hollow is an internal monster that just wants to watch the world burn.\nThe Judges\nThe downfall of the 21st Century began with a phenomenon known as the Black Rain, where a great number of crystalline objects, most roughly the size of cars, but many much smaller, fell to Earth. These objects have now come to be known as the Shards, and represent one of the deepest mysteries of the 22nd Century. On the one hand, most of the Shards seem to repel the Brood, but on the other, they often also have a damaging effect on the human psyche, forcing people to relive the mistakes of their lives, sometimes driving them to insanity or death. Some of the Shards are also known to be more positive, offering a strange sort of oasis in the wastelands of the world, free from the Brood. It has also become common knowledge that the tiny fragments of the Shards \u2013 also known as Voidglass \u2013 are extremely damaging to the Brood. The Shards themselves are also capable of communication, often giving out cryptic advice to the Nemissaries, along with spiritual guidance, but anyone who spends prolonged time communing with one will soon begin to suspect that the Shards know far more than they are willing to tell...\nGreat Conspiracies \nWe\u2019ve mentioned that in the world of Sins, civilisation as we know it has fallen. The existence of the Nemissaries has offered new hope, but also brought about new conflicts and pain. Across the world, new powers are emerging. Some extol the nearly-forgotten virtues of Democracy and Freedom. Others are authoritarian dictatorships. Behind it all however, are the influences of the First-born \u2013 the eldest of the Nemissaries \u2013 who have begun to use their powers to build their own visions of the future. The Nemissaries themselves, along with mankind as a whole, have often fallen in with the factions these powerful individuals have woven about themselves. Their gathered followers preach their ideals and cooperate with one another, rebuilding human civilisation but also setting the stage for the horrifying conflicts to come.\nHope and Despair\nThe world of SINS is bleak, and even considering everything we\u2019ve just mentioned, it gets worse. The Brood is not defeated, the factions of the Nemissaries are at each other's throats, and the Reapers are still out there somewhere, licking their wounds. Worse still, powers long asleep have begun to take an interest in the mortal world for the first time in millennia.\nThe truth is though, is that SINS is really about hope. The characters you play, for the most part, are those individuals who want to change the world for the better. They are people who aren\u2019t content to let their loved ones die, or to be the pawns of mad gods. \nThey mean to make the world a better place, or die in the attempt. This is the choice each player will make \u2013 the choice each character must make \u2013 to stand and fight when the dawn seems furthest, or to just be one more collaborator in mankind\u2019s demise. \nCaught Your Interest?\nGreat! This is a 357 page, full colour, Core Rulebook, complete with everything needed to play and stunning artwork throughout, all by Will Kirkby (Grenade, Wraithking, Tuk Tuk,and featured in Image Comics, Oni Press, and the upcoming Critical Role Artbook)\nOur plans are for at least another 3 further major expansions which will be released over the next 3 years, along with smaller, intermittent supplements supporting the game's longevity and an active social media presence that provides weekly lore updates and free, supplemental scenarios and game prompts.\nIn other words, once SINS is out, we'll constantly have new content for players to explore - handy for those busy weeks where the GM might not have had time to prepare!\nSINS runs on its own unique engine, the HOPE engine, based on Degrees of Success from small, attribute-based D6 dice pools that average 7 die and never exceed 10 die, even at the top levels of play.\nPlayers gain Successes determined by Skill Ratings, and compare their results against target numbers to gauge if they've scored a Success or not.\nThe GM sets the amount of Successes required to pass an Action, and any more Successes than required become outcome, a unique system that allows for epic, cinematic and co-operative actions. \n\nThe game boasts over 100 unique powers, known as Arietta, and over 75 Skills, Traits and Qualities with which to affect both mechanics and narrative, supported in play with an easy to read, single-page character sheet.\nAnother integral part of the SINS system is the lack of a conventional levelling system. Instead, characters take narrative-based paths towards their goals with Motivations, and as they work towards them, they gain Achievement Points. These in turn can be used to mechanically increase a character's stats, skills and abilities in the more traditional sense.\nCharacters can also call on Motivations they believe to be important to the Session or events in play, and receive appropriated bonuses as a result. We believe this integral combination of narrative and mechanics right at the heart of the system is the perfect balance of progression and achievement, and defines SINS as a truly narrative-driven roleplaying game.\n The SINS system, and in turn the HOPE engine, have now been play-tested by hundreds, including both private groups with varied experience levels, and by open display groups at the 2017 UK Games expo, each to overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n As with any Kickstarter, the amount you choose to pledge will reflect the products and extras you receive. As both avid Kickstarter backers and Roleplayers ourselves, we understand that too much choice and not enough budget can be overwhelming! To that end, we're keeping our tiers simple, affordable - and we believe - worth every cent & penny pledged.\n\nWe also offer a tailored pledge tier exclusively for Brick & Mortar store owners and independent retailers looking to stock SINS, allowing us to bring the game to as wide of an audience as possible, all whilst supporting the local gaming stores that make this RPGs and the tabletop industry possible.\nThe world as we know it is gone, and the undying horde are countless.

It was bounced around amid all the other creative ideas he keeps in there for long enough for it to grow to maturity. From time to time he would bring it out to the table to play in one form or another and then put it back and let it grow some more.  \n It might have stayed a hidden from the world at large if not for a post-game conversation with his local game store owner that moved onto the topic of how there was now enough of SINS in Miquel\u2019s head to fill a book. It\u2019s a little known secret that games store owners are generally very enthusiastic about games and are often very good at sharing that enthusiasm.  \nSome enthusiasm for the idea became the encouragement to take things a step further. And the project to make SINS - the RPG began. One of the really nice things about this book and this project as a whole is the way the game was developed and refined through a network of eager and talented people that all frequent that very same games store. In fact everything from play-testing to proof reading, artwork to layout was done by people, amateur enthusiasts and professionals both - from that very same gaming community. Even the making and printing of the GM Screens has been done by a printer that is a regular to our local gaming store!\nAnother little known secret about games store owners is that they can be very, very patient people and even though this project has been in development for almost 5 years now, with a lot of ups and downs and some major shifts in both the industry and the RPG market, there has always been members of the team carrying the torch and keeping an eye on the light at the end of the tunnel.\nSINS, like many tabletop RPGs, began life as a simple collection of ideas around a kitchen table many years ago. Since then, it has grown into a fully fledged book, and proof-read copies have graced many darkened kitchen tables and game rooms up and down the UK in the last few years. After all this time of tweaking and revision, we believe now is the time to bring the franchise into the wider market, and utilise this Kickstarter to establish ourselves as a small start-up team with a wealth of ideas just waiting to be realised.\nUltimately, we're really all just about having great games with friends. \nSINSwas born from that very act.  \nIt is the sum of a lot of influences poured into a great big melting-pot and stirred thoroughly with the spoon of enthusiasm and left to simmer until it was good and ready. Back in 2014 when we showed SINS to some people over at Chronicle City one of them said of it;\n\u201cit wears its influences on its sleeve\u201d and we believe that it truly does just that.  \n At its heart, Sins is a game that pays influential tributes to lots of things that we love, and all of it served up with a little of our own seasoning.  \nWe hope you get to enjoy it as much as we have.\n- The SINS Team\nAll this looks pretty complete... Why Kickstarter? \nOur Ultimate Goal - is simply to get a book that we love out there and available to gaming groups and to as many people as possible, and we believe that Kickstarter is the best medium to do this as the SINS Project establishes itself in the industry.\nAlongside that, we also value the support of 'Brick and Mortar' stores, who we recognise as being integral in the growth of any roleplaying product and vital to the communal spread of tabletop games. Through Kickstarter's tiered pledge system, we can offer Brick and Mortar stores varying degrees of support for our game in a way that benefits both us, them, and most importantly, players! \nStores that back our Retailer pledge - will be provided with unique covers, rewards and accessories directly from us, providing the much-needed extra support that allow stores to demo and run games without eating into their profits.\nSINS is hoped to be the first of many high-quality tabletop games in our planned repertoire that interact and evolve alongside both their playerbase and the commercial market, and if our feedback from the UK Games Expo is anything to go by, we believe it demonstrates our ability to deliver premium, professional-standard games straight from humble beginnings, all whilst doing service to the local gaming stores that made this project possible in the first place.\n\nI'm really into all this, where are all the stretch goal goodies & accessories?\nWe could, can, and have created a whole bunch!\nAnd these are only proofs, with a whole lot more planned and in development to support our game. \nBut the truth to their availability is that we believe the livelihood of a game is in the quality, and the availability, of its core rulebook - and how many people can get to enjoy it. There's nothing worse than hearing about a cool Kickstarter RPG, only to find out their initial print-run is over and that you have to wait to get to play it...\nTo that end, we're only focusing on getting out core rulebooks - as soon as we possibly can. They're finished, so there's no reason not to!\n\nThe more orders we receive for the core rulebook, the quicker you and your players can get it to your gaming table.  No fuss, no frills, and certainly no delays or waiting around on accessories and extras yet to come. Simply a complete, finished corebook that you and your gaming group can enjoy as soon as possible. If we can deliver that, we can launch a fully-fledged webstore with all of our books, accessories and future releases available at affordable prices, forever.\nSINS RPG Confirmed Accessories\nThese accessories will be available as add-ons, along with additional copies of the book through the BackerKit checkout.\nSINS RPG Prophecy Cover\nSINS RPG Voidglass Cover\n            LINKS: TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | SPOTIFY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNone!

But if you really want one we will do one. But if you are not fussed here's a summary: You play a member of an Elite Special Forces Unit sent to sort out Drug Cartels, Crime Lord, Terrorist Cells and Warlords. Travelling from jungles to deserts, arctic regions to urban sprawls.\nRules for K9 companions that improve as you do. \nRules for Squad Actions (coordinated takedowns etc). \nReal world settings. \nModern and future tech weapons and gear.\n Assault from boats, planes or vehicles. \nIf you like Tom Clancy and computer games like Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell this is the Tabletop RPG for you.\n Ghost Ops is a Tabletop RPG based in the world of Military Special Operations. You will be part of a Black Ops team made up of international Elite Special Forces Operatives sent out to the worst trouble hotspots in the world. The game will cover Eastern European crime organisations, South American Drug Cartels. International Terrorist cells and African warlords to name just a few. In one mission you could be assaulting a Tanker in the Indian ocean the next be in the Jungles of the Congo taking down Guerilla forces.  \nThe game is designed to not only deal with oneshot missions where you and your squad get airdropped in the heart of the action but also campaigns in which you may need to take down a corrupt government or infiltrate a Terror group. We will even include rules for skirmish missions where you can dig out those miniatures and battle against a friend.  \nIf you love computer games like Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon and Call of Duty then this is the Tabletop Game you have been waiting for to immerse you in the world of Special Operations. Join the official Facebook group here and our official G+ Group here\n  The Game itself will come in two flavours Original and Savage Worlds.\nBoth will have a detailed background system where you choose the Special Forces unit you trained and worked with before becoming a member of Ghost Ops. Both will include rules for vehicles and also K9 companions, yes you will be able to have a secondary character of a trained Spec Ops dog, who will level up and learn like you do.  \nThe Original - The Original ruleset is the one we started building a year ago and have been playtesting for 6 months, it is based around the Fate Dice used in the Fate System, but it is not Fate. We use a system of busts and boosts to determine the difficulty of tasks as well as difficulties based on range and other circumstances.  \nThe Original also has a wound system that adds modifiers to rolls and a unique system of breaks that allow you to re-roll dice but each time you use one the GM gains a break for themselves.  \nThe original is a fast, cool system that utilises the Fate Dice perfectly allowing you to really get the sense of tension and drama in every mission.\n Savage Worlds - The Savage Worlds version will include unique Edges and Hindrances and also new Squad Edges that the whole team benefits from as they grow and work together. Players will choose which international Special Forces unit they came from and gain unique benefits from those. They will then choose their Archetypes, from Assault, to Recon and Specialist and so forth.  \nThe Savage Worlds book will also have rules for taking your characters into Showdown the Savage Worlds Skirmish rules, vehicle rules and also K9 companions.  \nWe have not gone with the two book option that many Savage World settings do, instead this will be a huge 150 -200 page book with everything you need to play and GM the game, no spending extra.\n The game will be designed by members of the FGDystopia team, some of whom just finished work on Shelter. We have a great artist and some great writers working to bring the game to life, the rules are mainly done and we have to just clean them up and start work on the backgrounds.  \nMost of the art will be done by Coty Polk who designed the image below.\n With larger environment images by Russell Goh.  \nThe Savage Worlds and the Fate Dice books will be written & designed by Ian F. White and Jay along with a few of our playtesters getting their ideas thrown in.  \nWe also have some more great writers involved like Darren Pearce, August Hahn, Jody J. A. Cummings, Christian Nommay, Alan Bahr and Brandon Williams who will be creating adventures and sourcebooks for the game.  \nWe even have a military advisor to help us at least stick to a bit of realism, though the game will verge on the cutting edge fiction of Tom Clancy more.\n  We have a whole bunch of Stretch Goals planned and we will unleash them as and when we need them.   \nCurrent Value of the Stretch Goals = $180 \n\u00a34000 - Mission Pack 1 - Unlocked - PDF\nMission Pack 1 includes 5 adventures designed by some great writers, each adventure can be used for both Savage Worlds and the Original rule system.  \n'My Brother's Keeper' by August Hahn: One of the Team has gone missing and you have 24 hrs to find them.  \nRed on Red by Jody J.

Basic information gathering. Something kids fresh off The Farm could have handled and not screwed up. Yet here you are, on the run, security services trying to hunt you and your team down, local news painting you as terrorists and saboteurs. Things have officially gone FUBAR. You're in a safe house for the moment, but you're not sure how safe it really is. The last message from HQ wasn't encouraging. A single word: \"CAUTERY\" and the number 48 after it. It's the one scenario no operator likes to consider: one of your own has betrayed you, sold you out to the opposition. And you're up against the clock. You have 48 hours to figure out which of your comrades turned on you and eliminate them. If you can't, then things move from \"cautery\" to \"amputation.\"  \nRansom or Revenge by Jeramy Terry - A Big Oil exec is living in Angola Africa, his Wife and teenager are being held hostage with Ransom demands.

They have attempted to unlock the dormant part of the brain which can do incredible things, perform superhuman, or supernatural feats akin to magic. In 1960 there were experiments that involved remote viewing in Russia, of course the West, not to be outdone activated numerous projects in response \u2014 one of those was called Project Parallel and produced a modicum of success, using prisoners who were transferred from death row and subjected to terrible dark experiments they managed to create highly unstable individuals who could hurl objects around a room. Unfortunately they were all psychotic and many of them had to be terminated. The project was shut down by the lead when a Psi-enhanced soldier ran amok in the installation and turned it into a charnel house.  \nIn 1981, led by Duncan Bright, the Bright Corporation found the old notes of Project Parallel and reactivated the program using cutting-edge science and artifacts rumoured to be pulled from the very depths of Hell itself. No one believed this of course, it was too preposterous for the average mind to comprehend. Duncan knew the truth and Project Lucifer was born that day. The goal, create a special force of men and women who could use psychic and supernatural powers to control the battlefield of the future. Operating from a remote base somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, Bright\u2019s new project was highly successful and soon they began to train soldiers in psychokinesis, telekinesis, mental combat and more.  \nDuncan had opened a door to a new world, a brave one, and a dangerous one.  \nBecause some doors that are opened can never be closed.  \nWhen Duncan died in 1994 the new CO of Project Lucifer, Madeline Cross took over and she took the project to new heights. The daughter of a Project Lucifer soldier, she had been born with incredible powers. Madeline began to push Lucifer\u2019s research into new directions, taking the company toward a PMC (Private Military Contractor) and offering her psychic soldiers to the highest bidder.  \nYou\u2019ll join the cadre of soldiers who have to face down what Project Lucifer has unleashed, fighting the supernatural with your grit, guns and wit. Facing down the soldiers of Madeline Cross who have been corrupted by terrible powers and may have been possessed by demons or worse. \nWelcome to Project Lucifer, Soldier, next stop: Madness!\n\u00a39000 - Mission Pack 3 - Unlocked - PDF\nCarrying on from Project Lucifer Mission Pack 3 includes 2 One sheets and 3 Adventures set in the world of horror and Psychic soldiers.

The player characters are \"Storm Knights,\" heroes from all the cosms who fight against the High Lords. They use magic, technology, miracles, and even super powers against the Reality Raiders and their endless minions.\nThe Storm Knights are agents of the \"Delphi Council,\" an international organization led by Quinn Sebastian to counter the High Lords and their many forces.\nJoin the fight and you can play a....\n...monster hunter from Orrorsh armed with alchemical creations, magical medals, or a \"Slayer's Gun\" loaded with various bullets carved with cryptic runes...\n...heretical cyberwitch, valiant priest, or resistance fighter decked out with stolen cyberware, battling the Anti-Pope in the technologically oppressive world of the Cyberpapacy...\n...knight, wizard, or elf of Aysle, including the fantastic dwarven \"Dragon Warriors\" who wear armor forged with amazing enhancements and steam-powered devices of doom...\n...hard-boiled hero of Pan-Pacifica or an \"Electric Samurai\" armed with high-tech \"Ion Gusoko\" armor and ion-charged katana...\n...psychic survivor or irradiated scavenger of Tharkold, using Occultech against the cruel demon masters who once enslaved you...\n...savage human of the Living Land accompanied by a saber-toothed cat, or a mystical edeinos who can call on the miracles of a fierce and powerful goddess whose interventions are very real...\n...pulp hero of the Nile Empire, racing through the skies with a rocket pack or firing your ray gun at the dastardly shocktroops of Pharoah Mobius...\n...stalwart Core Earther, a realm runner who can negate your enemies' powers or summon phenomenal reality storms to strip foes of their very Possibility Energy!\nAnd so much more!\nCharacters of each realm choose from different \"Perk\" sets generally only available to certain realities. Every character stands out and is just as valuable as any other. Edeinos of the Living Land might have Death Claws, Star Eyes, or Whip Tails, for example, while heroes of Pan-Pacifica can call on Ki Powers such as Unflinching or Focused Strike.\nCheck out our updates for more previews of Perks and how they'll help YOUR Storm Knight resist the High Lords!\n    Shane, Clint, Jodi, and Darrell playtesting.\nD20s and Bonus Dice\nAs with the original Torg, the central mechanic of Torg Eternity is a d20 roll on a \"Bonus Chart.\" Rolls of 10s and 20s \"explode,\" allowing another die to be rolled and added to get a result. Something new for Torg Eternity is that a high enough number on an attack generates extra damage from 6-sided \"Bonus Die.\"\nRolling a 10 or 20 on the d20 causes it to \"explode,\" adding to the total! The infinity symbol on the six-sided Bonus Die adds +5 to your damage and allows you to roll again!\nPossibilities\nStorm Knights (and some villains!) have a resource called Possibilities they can spend to roll extra dice or absorb incoming damage, allowing them to bend reality to their will. More Possibilities can be earned by playing roleplaying, achieving objectives, or playing the all-new Cosm cards (see below!).\n  The Drama Deck\nInitiative is controlled with the Drama Deck. Each card features a Conflict Line that grants benefits or hindrances to either side as the tide of battle ebbs and flows.\nPlayers also have a hand of Destiny cards that help them pull off spectacular maneuvers or add new elements to the game.\nCosm cards are a new addition that help reinforce the World Laws and sometimes grant Possibilities or other advantages--though often with consequences!\n    If you want more detail, watch our Let's Play!\n  If you're a fan of the original Torg like we are, you're probably wondering exactly what's changed. We stayed true to the spirit of both the setting and the rules, but this is a new edition from the ground up so there are definitely some big ideas in this gorgeous, full-color book.\nHere are a few highlights:\nPerks are a system for buying and balancing all those awesome special abilities characters have!\nCharacters from cosms like Core Earth now get their due, with unique Perk sets for everyone! Medals, Occultism, and Alchemy for Orrosh! Electric samurai in Pan-Pacifica! Cyber witches in the Cyberpapacy! Outsiders for Aysle!\nTharkold--right from the start!\nStreamlined reality rules that make some of the strange edge cases a little more clear!\nEdeinos are MUCH more savage and frightening!\nDamage is simpler and doesn't need a chart. The change also fixes the \"glass jaw\" problem!\nInteraction results are much simpler, with no chart needed!\nEvery cosm got an overhaul from the ground up, updating those that were out of date given the 30 years that have passed since the original game was released, refocusing some that had gone a little astray as the original game grew, and generally making each realm tougher! We had the luxury of all the development the original team did on the original cosms, so we consolidated some of the most beloved material and worked it in right from the start. \nCore Earth characters are now as awesome as those from all the other cosms. They own the Reality Perk set!\n  We have two special Pledge Levels for this Kickstarter, the Delphi Council Cargo Box and the Seat on the Delphi Council pledge!\nBoth these pledge levels get the Delphi Council Cargo Box, a sturdy, custom box designed to hold all your Torg accessories, and it comes with EVERYTHING listed below...and more!\nTorg Eternity Rule Book (Hardcover + PDF)\nGM Screen and 16 Character Archetypes (Print + PDF)\nDelphi Council Cargo Box - (Print, see text)\nDrama Deck (Print + PDF)\nDice Pack (Physical)\nStatus, Shock, and Wound Counters (Print + PDF)\n20 Possibilities (High Quality Poker Chips with unique art, Physical)\nPoster Map of the Possibility Wars (Print + PDF)\nA \"tear off\" pad of full-color character sheets (Print)\nALL Original Torg books!

This can be you, your favorite character, a character you made up, or even a friend or relative you want to honor (with their permission). \nWe'll write up a brief description of them in the CORE rule book (the space is already reserved!), and commission a high-resolution illustration from our best artists you can print and frame.\nNOTE! By pledging for this reward you give us permission to become the copyright holder of the character. We'll be able to use them in our stories to deliver missions to Storm Knights in various parts of the world, involve them in fiction, plots, and other intrigue, and they might even make the ultimate sacrifice.

You don't even start as Storm Knights... but you might have your \"Moment of Crisis\" if you prove yourself worthy!\nDesigner's Note: The original Torg had several \"person on the street\" interviews that gave some insight into what it was like to be a normal individual in the world of Torg on the day of the invasion.

These cards are the player's best friend, allowing them to play cards such as Action that adds to their skill tests, Romance that helps them strike up an amorous relationship (and gain Possibilities!), or Seize Initiative to change the Drama Deck when things are bad. And so much more!\nTorg Eternity also introduces Cosm cards, which reinforce the tropes and World Laws of each cosm and grant the heroes an advantage of some sort, though often at a price!

The dice pack also includes additional \"tracker\" cards you can use to track your rerolls.\nDice Pack: Add $10 to your pledge for each additional pack of two d20s, two Bonus Dice, and tracker cards.\nPossibility Chips\nPlayers in Torg Eternity use \"Possibilities\" to affect their die rolls and soak damage.

This allows us to assure that we are US, EU, and Australia-friendly. We also have a partner in Hong Kong (VFI Asia), which means many locations in Asia and the Pacific Rim are cheaper, though not all customs for those countries may be covered.\nOther locations will be more expensive based on how difficult it is to ship from those four centers.

P. Lovecraft.\nThrough investigation, puzzle solving, time travel, knowledge of the Mythos, situational music, timed events and horrible scenes, the players will experience an interactive and unique scenario\u2014an epic mini-campaign playable in one (long!) gaming night.\nThe setting is London 1927, though the investigators will soon discover the need to dig deeper into England's occult past. The scenario may be played as a standalone event or incorporated into an ongoing campaign\u2014preferably its end, as the very world itself may collapse should the investigators fail.\nPuzzle solving: The players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear, but do they have the skills to fit them all together and complete the sigil before the world ends\u2026?\nSituational music: At three key events during the scenario, music plays an important role. Three specific soundtracks heighten the mood and accompany the situation, as well as function as a time limit for the investigators to complete certain tasks. The soundtracks are not provided with this Kickstarter but are easily found on any musical service like Spotify, iTunes, Google Play or YouTube.\nKnowledge of the Mythos: As stated, this is a scenario meant for experienced players. They need to have some scenarios under their belt, as well as some basic knowledge of the Mythos. If they have never heard of R'lyeh before, then this scenario is not for them. Yet.\nCultural knowledge: The players will meet famous and historical persons of the time. They will also dig into England's past to uncover some horrible truths. Any real knowledge of persons like Christopher Wren, Aleister Crowley or a certain J. R. R. Tolkien could prove useful. Though such knowledge is not necessary, it could prove to tip the scale towards saving or ending the world...\nEpic: From a small and seemingly irrelevant situation, the players will soon find themselves facing the horrors of great Cthulhu himself. As they discover more and more of the past and its shocking implications though puzzle solving and investigation, they will soon feel the burden of humanity's future on their shoulders. They have never, and will never again, be this close to total destruction.\nPlaying time: Initial playtesting of the raw material suggests a play time of about six hours. This could easily be expanded, as the scenario will come with optional false leads and expanded situations to suit your needs. This versatility may easily expand the scenario into a mini-campaign.\nTwo endings: In the very last moments of the scenario, it becomes up to the GM to decide how it ends. The \u201cnormal\u201d ending will (hopefully) result in the players as victorious against the dark powers\u2014this is a satisfying option for the players since they have fought hard with brains and skills to achieve their goal; huzzah! The \u201cother\u201d option is something completely different; this is an ending that will turn upside down everything the players have found out and believed throughout the scenario. This is an option that will leave their jaws dropping and produce \u201cI did not see that coming!\u201d reactions. It\u2019s your choice. You're the GM.\nAction-oriented or not?: Some players (or GMs) may want to solve some situations using muscles & guns, though this scenario is meant to be completed without firing a single shot. For those players (or GMs) an \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) is included where relevant.\nSkill use: The purpose of the scenario is to create a special atmosphere where the Mythos feels eerily alive everywhere. As such, rules and skills are less emphasized so as not to \u201cdisturb\u201d this purpose. The scenario may be played almost exclusively using the character's knowledge and ideas; only a few skill rolls are necessary. So how does it work? Let's say you find a strange book entitled The Book of Eibon. You are not meant to do a skill roll to discover what this book is; you're supposed to have heard about it before, both as a player and character. And if you stumble upon a lot of clues in a pile, you're not supposed to roll a Search, Luck or Library Use to find the \u201ccorrect\u201d clue; you're supposed to use your own wits and investigation throughout the scenario to figure out which are the correct ones. The use of skill rolls will be needed from time to time, but only to give alternative approaches to different situations, and never to interfere with the atmosphere.\nContent: In many RPG scenarios, there exists an elaborate description of the NPCs, their history, their minds, plans, surroundings... You will not find much of that in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d We've read too many scenarios where the relevant information is somewhat \u201chidden\u201d in too much description. Don\u2019t get us wrong; it's entertaining to read about the family background, accent, tattoo and shoe size of the local bartender, but if his only appearance is when he gives the investigator a letter, that info is not very relevant for the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d tells you what you need to know; the rest is up to you.\nMature content: What stands the Lovecraftian world apart from many other themes is the atmosphere of fear and horror; if played well, both for the investigators and the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d follows this pattern; the fear is always lingering, but the \u201chorror level\u201d may be adjusted to your taste. The scenario may be enjoyed fully without a single drop of blood spilled, or you may choose to adjust some scenes to incorporate the ultimate horror targeting both your character and your own sanity. As such, it could potentially resemble the \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) mentioned above. Call it AHA if you'd like (please don't).\nFact and fiction: The scenario combines the real world with the Mythos. The characters you meet and their story/surroundings are mostly historically correct, mixed with the occasional Mythos element. A complete Fact & Fiction section at the end of the scenario keeps you up to date, but is yours to bend to your own will...\nQuality: This is in a full-color page layout in US letter format! This scenario is a delight both to read and play.\nAbout the creators\nJarle Haktorson is the writer behind \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d. He bought his first CoC rulebook (5th ed) back in 1993 and was intrigued. This was totally different from his former RPG experiences playing mostly AD&D (2nd ed). During his later studies, he realized he fit the classic CoC investigator, as he studied Latin, Greek, Coptic, history, religion, etc. It also helped that he worked in a mental institution during his studies, and so understood how sanity really works (and doesn\u2019t work). He is currently the general manager of the Epix Haven gaming company (www.facebook.com/epixhaven), the leader of the local gaming club, and plays board games and RPGs as often as he can, at least once a week. He is proud to be a geek.\nEven Vinjor R\u00f8ssland is the creative mind behind the Insight Fantasy RPG and several other publications at drivethruRPG.com. He started playing RPGs back in the late 80s, slaying kobolds in D&D. Taking the GM-role some years later, he has entertained countless people through genres such as fantasy, sci-fi and horror. Even is in the creative advertising market, and has done all the layouts, book binding, advertising etc. for this scenario and campaign. Even is a gamer and a dreamer, and one of his dreams is this game.\nJoseph Diaz has created the heart of this scenario with his superior illustrations. He has previously worked as a concept artist for productions like Game of Thrones, Warcraft, Europa Report and Sleepy Hollow. Never has Cthulhu himself felt so threatening or near as in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d\nTwo Starving Gnolls (TSG): When Jarle and Even sit down to talk, their heads spin with ideas. TSG was created to set those ideas into motion. As such, TSG functions as a development team to convert RPG ideas into playable material. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d is the first such idea made a reality.\nWith help from you, this scenario could become even greater.\nNOK 18.000 (about US/EUR 2000): Scenario map over London\nThe players will travel around London gathering clues, slowly understanding the graveness of their search. This period-accurate map will help both the GM and the players better navigate the world; there is one version for the players and another for the GM.\nNOK 27.000 (about US/EURO 3000): More artwork and quality upgrades for clues\nMost of the cost creating this scenario is related to the artwork. We wanted more, but couldn't risk this project not become a reality. This stretch goal will add more artwork to the scenario and upgrade all the clues, making the horrors come even more alive.\nNOK 45.000 (about USD/EUR 5000): Custom-made soundtrack!\nYou read it right! Unlocking this goal enables us to create a custom-made soundtrack for the scenario! It will be available for ALL backers through download!\nNOK 63.000 (about US/EUR 7000): Art book\nA FREE art book to ALL backers containing all the sketches, images, clues, etc. used in the scenario, complete with discussions, \u201cbehind the scenes,\u201d etc. Sent as PDF via DriveThruRPG.\nNOK 90.000 (about US/EUR 10.000): Physical puzzle option\nThe players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear. This stretch goal will give backers an option to receive a physical puzzle as an add-on. More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 135.000 (about US/EUR 15.000): Another scenario!\nThe world may be saved from destruction this time, but what about the next\u2026?! This Stretch Goal will provide a completely new FREE scenario to all backers! More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 200.000 (about US/EUR 22.000): \u201cCan we make it?!\u201d\nMore on this as the campaign progresses.\nFAQ\nWhat game system works with this scenario?\nThe short version: any (see the \u201cSkill use\u201d section above). Skill rolls play a minor part of the scenario. Where deemed necessary, a percentage system is used, like those found in CoC. It is easily modified to suit any system you'd like. We would also like to mention \"Cthulhu Dark\" by Graham Walmsley, as this is a rules-light system created to play Lovecraftian horror at its most intense.\nMust the scenario be set in exactly 1927?\nNo, you could tweak it some +/- five years or so if you'd like. Some historical characters need to be adjusted somewhat though; the scenario includes relevant information on how to do this.\nWhat does the title actually mean?\nIt's Latin for \u201cThe Cthulian Peace.\u201d You do not want that to occur and neither do the investigators, so help them out!\nIs this a production licensed by Chaosium?\nNo, and we are very aware of that. Hence, we only use our own illustrations and ideas, finding inspiration in H. P. Lovecraft's work available in the Public Domain. We do not use material (signs, symbols, characters, spells, etc.) owned by Chaosium. This scenario is a homage to Lovecraft's dark world.\nHow do you send the PDF files?\nWhen the campaign is finished and the scenario is ready to play, you'll receive an e-mail; this will include a link for your free download of \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d at DriveThruRPG, the largest RPG download store.\nWhat does \u201cPOD\u201d means?\nIt means \u201cPrint on Demand,\u201d so if you pledged for the PDF version only, but decide to have a soft-cover version later, you may POD; that means that DriveThruRPG will print and ship a soft-cover version to you. You will need to cover those costs, though (they are included in Reward #2).\nMay I choose any name/picture in the story?\n(Concerning Reward # 4-5)\nWell, we do not know you personally, so you're free to supply us with the name and picture you want\u2014who are we to judge what people are called or how they look? :) We would hesitate though to supply names like Biggus Dikkus or provide photos of a badger (apologies to all people who look like a badger). Your name will of course also be mentioned in the credits!\nMay I provide any idea for the story?\n(Concerning Reward #6)\nYes, by and large, you may. This scenario is designed using unique storytelling techniques, but the main story may be altered along the way should the right ideas come up. This reward is also the only option to be given the story beforehand\u2014you'll need this knowledge to be able to think out and discuss your ideas with me. Your name will, of course, be mentioned in the credits!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPax Cthuliana is currently in a developing stage.

His temples bulged, and his eyes were bloodshot with concentration as he ranted. \"Take one step toward me, and I will obliterate you with my mind!\u201d  \nHalo kept her martial stance, her eyes never leaving the rat\u2019s. \u201cThen do so,\u201d Halo said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d The rat didn\u2019t seem to have anticipated this.  \n\u201cDestroy me,\u201d Halo pressed. \u201cWith your mind. Go ahead, magician.\u201d\n\u201cI am no magician!\u201d the rat screeched. \u201cI am a scientist! I have studied the ancient records of the Old Ones, and I know the true power of the universe! I have mastered 47 of the 100 Theories!\u201d During his tirade, the rat\u2019s bulbous eyes began to water, and he finally did what Halo was waiting for.  \nHe blinked.  \nWhen the rat opened his eyes a fraction of a second later, Halo had leapt into the air. Her foot glowed with a blue aura as she kicked him in the snout. The pain was intense, and the rat could feel his fur and flesh becoming bitterly cold as the blue energy enveloped him. He tried to speak, to unleash his mental attack, but he couldn\u2019t move. The ice cracked and popped as his eyes froze solid. \nHalo nodded in satisfaction as the frozen rat fell over the side of the roof, and turned away from her opponent. She needed tell the Ruling Council that the cult of Labo Tor had infiltrated the monarchy of Korat.\n  \"Welcome once again to a world of fantasy adventure in the ancient future.

It\u2019s a complete tabletop roleplaying game that acts as a companion game to, and is totally compatible with, my first RPG, Pugmire. The Monarchies of Mau is a nation of cats tenuously comprised of six city-states.\"\n  \"Anyway, they live in the ashes of our world far in the future, seeking danger and mystery. Think Three Musketeers meets Planet of the Apes, but with cats.\"\n\"These cats have been uplifted to use technology and language. Some cats acquire the remnants of human technology, believing them to be literal gifts of magic from ancient, god-like servants. Others seek to create an ideal civilization, using the Precepts of Mau agreed to in the heat of a terrible war.\"\n    \"Enemies of Mau can either be monstrous, like demon-possessed zombies, or simply other misunderstood people, such as the dogs of Pugmire.\"\n\"The world is dangerous and mysterious, but the instincts of a good cat will always be true.\"\n      \"My company, Pugsteady, is working with Rich Thomas at Onyx Path Publishing to expand on our Monarchies of Mau Early Access version (see below).\n\"We\u2019re running this Kickstarter so we can make the best version of Monarchies of Mau that we can, adding more art and writing to make this a complete and amazing product. If funded, we will produce a full-color 7 x 10 hardcover book (about the size of a graphic novel), with around 200+ pages.\n\"One of the highlights of the Monarchies of Mau game include this evocative, mysterious, and family-friendly setting, presented from the perspective of iconic characters like Blayze and Sabian here.\"\n  \"Monarchies of Mau uses a customized version of the 5th Edition rules from the world's most popular fantasy RPG. It's been redesigned for streamlined play, with an emphasis on cooperation and action over competition and violence. Creating heroic and cunning cats is easy, and there are a variety of callings and noble houses that give focus to a cat\u2019s role in society and in the adventuring party. To help you with your decision, I\u2019m providing a copy of Monarchies of Mau Early Access. It\u2019s a playable version of Monarchies of Mau that has over a third of the material you can expect in the final book.\nMonarchies of Mau is totally compatible with Pugmire and uses the same rules system.

We love retailers, but we know that modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores.

This knowledge has been applied to Onyx Path's partnership with Pugsteady as well as the FAQ below:\nhttp://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: Monarchies of Mau isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped fifteen Kickstarter projects, Pugmire is being printed, and several more KS projects are headed to completion as you read this. All those books have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The Early Access PDF is finished and playable and we will be expanding that into the full book\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of Monarchies of Mau.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise dramatically, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges. Both methods allow us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing. Because of Kickstarter adding the option to their tools, we are able to be more specific as to shipping costs based on your country. These costs will be added to your pledge automatically by KS if you are outside the US. As always, local or VAT style taxes will need to be paid by the backer when appropriate and are not included in these costs.\n\nRisk: The project will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for several of our last KS projects several months before the estimate, and recent Kickstarters started shipping in the month or the month before we estimated. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process.\n\nWe've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver regular Updates on progress via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Mau Supporter", "descp": "You or your cat's name will be listed on the credits page as one of our supporters: our Clowder of Mau.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Wallpaper Fancier", "descp": "You'll get digital wallpaper featuring a collage of the evocative and beautiful art from Monarchies of Mau.

Over the next five years it appeared as the engine powering a series of other licensed RPGs, at which point it was rewritten from the ground up as Cortex Plus. Various iterations of this newer system were used in RPGs based on Leverage, Smallville, Firefly, and Marvel Heroic Roleplaying.\nCortex Prime is the newest version of this much-loved set of game rules, refined and redesigned by Cam Banks under license from Margaret Weis Productions. It embraces its roots as a means of adapting your favorite movies, television shows, and comic books, while emerging finally as a truly multi-genre modular roleplaying game in its own right.\nOrc revolutionaries! Giant mecha! Swashbucklers of the far future! Hard-boiled police detectives! Whether you're a fan of genres and genre mash-ups, any of the older Cortex-powered games, or you're just looking for a tabletop game system you can customize to your own specifications, Cortex Prime is primed for you.\nAt its heart, Cortex Prime is a system that starts with engaging characters. \nRank your character's core traits with varying sizes of dice.\nChoose which traits are appropriate for the actions your character takes in the game, pick up their dice, and roll 'em.\nChoose two of the dice that you rolled and add them together, comparing that result to an opposing result or difficulty number.\nDid you beat the opposition? Fantastic, you succeed! If not, you don't get what you want and now you've got to deal with the consequences.\nWant to increase your chances of pulling off those cinematic actions? You've got a pool of plot points you can spend to make that happen, or to activate special abilities.\nWant more? Earn those plot points by having your character express their worst tendencies or making their lives more difficult.\nBecause the game is modular and customizable, your character traits in one game might be different from the next. You could play a high-octane science fiction game that focuses on the raw abilities and expertise of your heroes against impossible odds, or you could play an intrigue-laden courtly romance drama that concerns itself more with your character's desires and motives than skills.\nWant to get started quickly? Cortex Prime offers easy-to-use archetypes to make choosing a character as painless as possible.\nWant more depth? The pathways character creation system not only establishes your character's background and personality, it can even build the setting around them.\nWant to sweat the details? Pick and choose your character's traits and distinctive qualities from a huge array of options.\nRegardless of the genre or the tropes, Cortex Prime provides the means to capture those qualities and provide authenticity to your character and the game itself. And now, with this new edition of the game rules, the tools to play the game any way you want are baked into the system, even the Classic Cortex style.\nCortex Prime promises backward compatibility with an eye toward an exciting future!\nWe're offering Cortex Prime as a set of two closely-related products, the Cortex Prime Game Handbook and the Cortex Prime System Reference. \nThe Game Handbook is a traditional RPG rulebook, fully illustrated and packed with advice, examples, and all the bells and whistles.\nPublished in three formats: a PDF, a 6 x 9 softcover rulebook (intended for distribution later into hobby stores and retailers), and a limited edition hardcover rulebook (only available through this Kickstarter).\nB&W, 152+ pages, MSRP $25 (softcover) /$35 (hardcover)\nIncludes ready-to-play settings Hammerheads (global rescue & recovery agents), Eidolon Alpha (neoclassical fantasy supers), and Trace (grim law & order drama in Cortez City, a classic Cortex setting updated)\nThe System Reference is just the rules, and all of the various dials, switches, and options, organized for easy consultation of the rules\nServes as the reference document for designers looking to create Cortex Prime products of their own through the Cortex Creator Studio\nIt's available as a PDF and a limited softcover print run.\nEach pledge level offers a different assortment of print or PDF versions of each of these products.\nIf you just want everything in PDF, go for the $10 Prime Digital level. This gets you both the Handbook and the Reference in PDF plus all digital stretch goals as they're unlocked.\nIf you want the Handbook in softcover, go for the $25 Prime Softcover level. This is the same as the Prime Digital level but adds the softcover Game Handbook.\nIf you want the Handbook in hardcover, move up to the $35 Prime Hardcover level.\nIf you want a print copy of the System Reference as well, you want the $40 Prime Softcover Plus or the $50 Prime Hardcover Plus. This includes a softcover or limited edition hardcover Game Handbook, a limited edition softcover System Reference, all the digital books, and unlocked stretch goals.\nIf you want the Handbook in hardcover, the System Reference in softcover, and softcover copies of each of the unlocked Prime Spotlight volumes from the stretch goals, you want the $80 Prime Spotlight Hardcover level. This level includes ALL unlocked Prime Spotlights in print format.\nRetailers can pick up the $100 Prime Retailer level which comes with five copies of the limited edition Game Handbook in hardcover, a copy of the System Reference in softcover, and access to digital files for customers.\nWe're offering a limited number of higher pledge levels, too, which are each the same as the Prime Hardcover Plus, but provide something special: a character of your own choosing included in the Handbook, art direction assistance and a copy of the illustration you help to create, and possibly others.\nSHIPPING THE REWARDS\nShipping is not included in the pledge levels. That's because for this Kickstarter campaign, we're going to send out surveys and collect shipping fees through BackerKit once we're ready to ship out all physical rewards. This not only means all funds raised in the Kickstarter are going towards covering the costs of production (writing, design, art, layout, and printing) but it gives us plenty of time to source the best and least expensive international shipping options through fulfillment agents in Europe and Asia.\nAt this time, we estimate domestic shipping throughout the United States to be around $5 for most pledge levels. International shipping could be as much as $50, but based on previous Kickstarter experience we should be able to bring that down considerably to around $20 to Europe and other international destinations.\nThanks for being understanding! We know that for some it's much easier just to take care of the total costs all at once upon pledging, but we hope you'll see that this approach is not only better for the project but affords you the lowest shipping costs when the time comes.\nFor us, the most exciting part of this project is what happens once this project meets its initial funding goal. We've invited a group of enthusiastic and creative talents with a broad range of ideas for taking Cortex Prime to even greater heights to design our stretch goal content.\nWe're grouping this bonus digital content, which includes exciting game worlds, genre sourcebooks, and expanded rules, into distinct volumes under the Prime Spotlight banner. Your support of this Kickstarter goes towards paying each designer a respectable word rate and adds their content to the Cortex Creator Studio, where they can continue to earn royalties from the future sales of their digital offerings!\nHere's what we have lined up for the first two volumes.

Here are the books you can add to your pledge and the amount you should increase your pledge by to account for them.

The Creator Studio provides fans and aspiring designers an exclusive agreement to publish their own Cortex content and earn 50% of all sales. Following the success of the Kickstarter, the Cortex Prime System Reference becomes the central foundation for the Creator Studio, moving beyond its existing Cortex Plus framework.\nAll Prime Spotlight creators will be automatically added to the Creator Studio. Cam Banks and Magic Vacuum Design Studio pledge to continue to provide development advice and consultation not only to the Spotlight creators but future community members as part of a drive to make the Creator Studio and Cortex fandom more welcoming and inclusive to all.\nSo who is behind the Cortex Prime project?\nAfter coming to an agreement with Margaret Weis Productions to license the rights to all Cortex-related publishing and distribution, Cam Banks started Magic Vacuum Design Studio to serve as the publishing house for future Cortex-based games and supplements.\nAs the lead developer and designer of Cortex and Cortex Plus for Margaret Weis Productions from 2010 to 2014, and managing editor before that, Cam knows the system inside and out. He has co-designed the Leverage, Smallville, Marvel Heroic Roleplaying, Dragon Brigade, and Firefly roleplaying games as well as written and developed extensively on earlier product lines such as Serenity, Supernatural, Battlestar Galactica, and the Cortex System RPG \"blue book.\"\nAs part of his regular duties as RPG Director at Atlas Games, Cam has been involved in two highly successful Kickstarter projects: Feng Shui 2 and Unknown Armies 3. He was also part of the Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide Kickstarter project as a developer and designer.\nCortex Prime is a dream project for Cam. Over the years he's invested a lot in Cortex, collaborating with some amazing designers, editors, and artists to bring licensed properties to life. Now, he's going to bring everything he's learned about roleplaying game design and production to make Cortex Prime the best possible edition of these rules he can\u2014but he can only do it with your generous support.\nThank You!\nMagic Vacuum Design Studio can be reached at their website, on Facebook, and Twitter.\nYou can also follow Cam on Twitter.\nKey art for this Kickstarter was provided by Brett Barkley.\nThe video was produced and edited by Jeremy Keller.\nSpecial thanks to Jeff Tidball, Josh Roby, Jeremy Keller, Jess Banks, Stras Acimovic, Brie Sheldon, Tracy Barnett, Fred Hicks, Tim Rodriguez, and Cam's patrons at his Patreon for their tremendous advice and consultation.\nSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any roleplaying game project on Kickstarter, the greatest challenge is time. For Cortex Prime, we are confident that not only will we meet our various milestones and creative goals, we'll do it on time and in regular contact with all backers.\n\nCam's recent experience running the Unknown Armies Kickstarter for Atlas Games has provided ample experience in dealing with a large project with many moving parts, and while the Cortex Prime Game Handbook and System Reference are entirely within his wheelhouse, the added management of many potential Prime Spotlight creators draws upon a decade of experience managing RPG project teams.\n\nIn the event that we become aware of any delays in production of Cortex Prime, we'll keep backers apprised of the roadblocks and work to get around them swiftly. The same is true for the development, production, and release of all unlocked Prime Spotlight volumes and their content.\n\nBackers can expect monthly updates following the campaign, and responses to questions or concerns within no more than 48 hours (and usually much sooner).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Prime Booster", "descp": "You're just in this for the boost.

Heroes and villains from Arthurian myth have been reincarnated, coming back to life in the cinematic present. At first, these individuals don\u2019t remember their former lives, but as they begin to recognize each other, old feuds and tragic affairs resurface. Why has the King returned now?  Does some unseen danger threaten? And if the answer is yes, will these legendary heroes be able to put their old grievances aside long enough to oppose it?\nYou can check out an Actual Play of Arthur Lives for Fate Core here.\nThe 1st edition of the game was published in 2009 by Vigilance Press and used the True20 system. This new 2nd edition is a ground-up redesign of the game, capitalizing on Fate's narrative style of play. It includes:\nCharacter creation for knights, damosels, magicians, and kings, allowing you to create modern reincarnations of (almost) every character from Arthurian myth.\nDetailed character creation advice for ten specific Arthurian incarnations, from the famous (Arthur, Guinevere, and Merlin) to the infamous (Balin, the Knight with Two Swords, or Nimue).\nEnchantment, a complete magic system with 15 different magical talents, from Binding to Weather Control. \nMagical treasures and \"echoes\" of Arthurian objects like the Sword in the Stone and Excalibur, Gawaine's legendary horse Gringolet, or even Camelot itself.\nA large bestiary of dozens of fantasy creatures from across the Faerie Veil, supernatural denizens of our world, rival incarnations, mundane threats, and even angels and demons, all to challenge your characters. \nDetailed GM advice for running Arthur Lives! campaigns, including the secret history that explains why all this is happening now. (Hint: it's got to do with Nazis, John Dee, and William Ashbless.)\nJason Tondro, aka Doctor Comics, is the author of The Deluxe Super Villain Handbook and The Great Game for Fainting Goat, a contributor to Stark City, and the author of the True20 edition of Arthur Lives! He has a PhD in Literature from the University of California Riverside, and is the author of Superheroes of the Round Table: Comics Connections to Medieval and Renaissance Literature, where he got to write about Mage and Camelot 3000, among many other things. Jason is the writer of AL! 2nd edition. He gets to teach Arthurian lit and comics every year, and is basically the luckiest guy in the world.\n  PLAY\n\nMichael Kucharski is a classically trained artist and fan favorite whose gaming work includes the Amber Diceless RPG and its spiritual successor Lords of Gossamer and Shadow, and much work for Palladium over the years. Michael's work will introduce each chapter of Arthur Lives! \nDan Smith describes himself as \"the former 90s art nuisance.\" He illustrated In Nomine for Steve Jackson Games, along with many books in the GURPS line. Dan is bringing his bold, energetic style to the Arthur Lives! adversaries chapter. \nJon Gibbons is the artist and co-creator of Extreme Earth, a dystopian superhero setting, and The After, a post-apocalyptic western. Jon will be illustrating several of the Paths and sample incarnations.\nDionysia Jones is the lead artist on Tianxia, published by Vigilance Press. She provided the cover to Arthur Lives! and contributed character designs for several of the incarnations featured in the book. \nOne of our stretch goals is an adventure anthology written by the best minds in the business. Here they are!\nRichard Bellingham is a long-time Fate author and a contributor to many Fate projects; he created The Secrets of Cats and the SF/fantasy epic Knights of Invasion, in which a feudal fantasy world is invaded by high-tech aliens. \nChuck Rice is the creator of AZ: After Zombies and the author of many, many RPG products, including Blood & Fists for d20 and its sequels. He demonstrated his Arthurian chops with Legends of Excalibur, a d20 adaptation of Arthurian myth. \nWalt Robillard is a prodigious podcaster and the brains behind SUPERS!, the Comic Book RPG. He has written adventures for many game systems, including ICONS, White Star, and Savage Worlds.\nRob Wieland is another established Fate creator, and is the author of another Arthurian Fate game: Camelot Trigger. He's also written Save Game and Kaiju Incorporated: the RPG, and contributed to many other projects.\n  The book is written, and is almost 150,000 words. The basic funding goal for this Kickstarter is to pay for layout and writing, and get the book out there to you, the fans and players. If you back the book at $5 or more, you'll get the raw text for Arthur Lives! 2nd Edition immediately, and you can start playing it right away.\nOur first stretch goals add art from Michael Kucharski and Dan Smith, bringing the book to about 250 pages. \nAt $10,250, Jason will write Drakes on a Plane, an introductory adventure designed to bring a group of PCs together and awaken some of them to their true nature as incarnations of Arthurian myth. \nA couple of the stretch goals add play aides: a custom character sheet for Fate Core and AL!, and a handout that illustrates the complicated relationships between the major characters. \nAt $13,000, the folks at Norse Foundry will produce a set of official Fate dice for Arthur Lives! These are handsome metal dice in Arthur's colors: antique gold, with red + and - signs.\nAt $19,000, we unlock the Special Edition, a highest-quality \"Director's Cut\" of Arthur Lives! which will include handwritten notes from the author on every page, as well as all kinds of other goodies like concept art and other stretch goals. \nOur adventure anthology authors join the Round Table at $24,500: Richard Bellingham, Rob Wieland, Chuck Rice, and Walt Robillard, and Jason will write a second adventure to add to that anthology. \nOur final goal is a fiction anthology of tales of modern knights, magicians and damsels exploiting the world of Arthur Lives! \n  Every backer who contributes $5 or more gets the raw text for Arthur Lives! 2nd Edition, and can start playing right away. No waiting! \nYour further support for the project gets you the PDF ($20) or hardback edition +  PDF edition ($50) of Arthur Lives! 2nd Edition. Books are being printed on demand through DriveThruRPG, and you will pay their shipping costs when you redeem your reward.\nAs stretch goals unlock, we'll be able to offer PDFs and paperback editions of Drakes on a Plane, the adventure anthology, and other goodies. \nWe have some exciting and limited reward tiers for fans of our amazing artists -- Michael Kucharski and Dan Smith -- and for those who would like to have some input on the game itself. \nAt $150 and $200 you can get one of the few remaining signed & numbered prints of Michael's Excalibur and Arthur of the Britons. At $250, Dan will draw your character. And at $450, you can tell Jason which Arthurian character he needs to add to the book with special rules and roleplaying advice -- and we'll illustrate that character according to your description. \nExcalibur by Michael Kucharski\n  Arthur of the Britains by Michael Kucharski\nAll of these special reward tiers include everything at the $50 level, so you're also getting the hardback edition, a PDF edition, and PDFs of any stretch goals we reach. \nWhile every tier has been carefully constructed to maximize what we can offer, sometimes there is that odd bit of kit you absolutely must add to your pledge.  As the campaign rolls on, we hope to unlock more of these to offer to you.\nAdditional PDF -  $20 USD: Need an additional digital copy of the completed book for some one at the table?  Add this to your pledge.\nAdditional Printed Copy - $50 USD: Sometimes you want an extra copy of the book at the table or to send as a gift.

A Modern Arthurian RPG for Fate Core"}}, {"backer": "The Roach", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Several years back we took a stab at making an RPG, in the underdeveloped genre of Sentai. To our knowledge at the time there were very few RPGs in the genre and the few that we could find were either, a section of \"hey this could be used for sentai\" in some anime inspired RPGS, or were games that used other systems like FATE or D20, to apply the sentai rules to. But none of us had seen an actual Sentai RPG build for sentai from the ground up, armed with this and our love of the genre we set about to make a small game (limited print run at Xenocon 3, and PDF at DrivethruRPG.com. It seemed to be a hit, as did the companion supplement we made. Decent sales and reviews made us feel pretty good, but why not go bigger? \nthe red sentai (chibi form)\nAnd that's what this is. adding production value with better artwork, combining the supplement and the core book into one volume (so you no longer have to swap between books!) and adding a few new things (including 36 more monster templates, and a new optional mecha creation and combat system) we figured now was the time to strike!On top of this for the first time we will be selling the game as a P.O.D. through Drivethru RPG. \nOur Chibi version of the Blue Sentai\nThe new material is mostly already added to the core book, and a great deal of the editing is done. And all cards on the table this game WILL be released even if this kickstarter does not meet it's goal, so why do a kickstarter? two reasons! Firstly to promote the game to an audience that may not have known it existed! Second to add to the production value, The money we get can be put into art buy to make the game look less like the (admittedly) limited art skills of yours truly, but to get new art and new talent to turn a rather utilitarian game into something that can sit in your RPG library proudly next to other great games!\nWHAT IS SENTAI-\nThe literal translation of Sentai is \u201cbattle team\u201d and starting back in 1975 with a live action series called Secret Task Force Goranger, Japanese audiences thrilled to a show that was one part Godzilla movie and one part martial arts / stunt display. The plots of most episodes were pretty predictable. Evil overlord sends minions and a monster to menace the city, the heroes retaliate, and even-tually the monster gets really big and our heroes call in the big guns in the form of a mecha, followed by one more big fight where the monster goes down and our heroes relish a bit of victory. This formula has gone on for several decades after Goranger, including most noteably here in the USA a series known as Zy-uranger in 1992, which was translated and called the \u201cMighty Morphin\u2019 Power Rangers.\u201d While the show was radically modified, and was re-cast keeping only the action sequences from the original and the villains to make a more Holly-wood production, it was also relatively cheap as all the huge city sets and big effects were already paid for in the Japanese production. The show was phe-nomenally popular with kids, and despite the many changes between the shows (Zyuranger only lasted 1 season, but Power Rangers would last far more, not to mention that the infamous \u201cgreen ranger\u201d was killed in Zyuranger necessitating them to recycle a very small bit of footage to keep the popular character in the American version) the show was a hit spawning it to continue along using each new Sentai series as a continuation of the singular story line. Sentai has been very popular all over the world, not just in it\u2019s homeland, due to its basic plots, high action and cool robots. Emulating those things that make Sentai cool is what this game is all about! A quick Sentai list Sentai has a long and storied history dating back to the era of bell bottoms and disco, and is still going strong today. It has fans worldwide (and heck some peo-ple don\u2019t even know they are fans of it!) While this list is far from a comprehen-sive list of Sentai series out there, it is a list of the myriad of series that you as players and game masters can draw upon for your own campaigns. This list is broken into a few sections to give you an idea of the varied forms and options you may wish to explore.\nTHE SYSTEM\nIn sentai, heroes are almost always built together as a team (as opposed to American superheros, where more often individual heroes are created and later combined into super teams.) Sentai heroes are each assigned a color. The character's color is much like a class in a traditional RPG, Color determines much about your character's personality and assigns one 'Special Skill\" that can apply a +3 modifier if you can justify your special skill being in line with the task at hand. In the example, the color \"black\" is NINJA! and gains a +3 to any task that seems appropriate for anyone who is a ninja.The player can make a case for anything that he might feasibly attribute to ninja training. In Super Happy Sentai Hour, just as in many RPGs, the action starts with the game master (or GM) setting the scene. Once this is done, it is up to the players to make choices on how to react, and normally it is during this point that the GM will require you to roll to determine if you are capable of succeeding at the action you have decided to take. For the most part this will follow a very simple set of rules, First the GM will set up a difficulty rating from 5-30. This is a base number of how difficult the task is and the higher the number the more difficult the task. A difficulty rating of 5 is fairly easy, while a 30 is near impossible. Once you are asked to roll you will roll 2 six-sided dice (or 2d6) adding the appropriate attribute, and if applicable any special skills or weapon skills. If the total of the dice is equal to or higher than the difficulty, then you succeed, and if it is less you fail. The GM will then describe results of the actions based on your success or failure. You can also use the simple formula below for reference. If Stat + any applicable skills + 2d6 = difficulty (5-30) or higher: Success Example: Phil. Who is the black Sentai of his team, is trying to sneak past a guard, and needs to make a stealth check. The GM decides the difficulty is 15 as the guards are on alert. As stealth is considered a test of agility, Phil starts with a base of agility stat 5. On top of that, Phil is the Black Sentai, who gets NINJA! Skill and this would add a +3 to his stealth check, as stealth is clearly a ninja type skill. Phil picks up his 2 six-sided dice and rolls a 5 and a 2 for a total of 7, thus stat (5)+skill (3) plus total roll (7) = 15, meaning Phil\u2019s character slips past the guards. Color dice and \u201cExploding\u201d As stated earlier in the game, players should have dice with 2 colors, one white and one that shares the color of their character, if possible. The reason for this is that the color die has the potential to \u201cexplode.\u201d If during a test, your color die should roll a six, it \u201cexplodes,\u201d which means you may roll the color die again and add it to your running total. If you roll another six it explodes again and you must roll again adding further to the total until such point as your roll any other number besides six. Example:\n Louise  a pink sentai, is being attacked by a monster and decides to use her special skill GIRL! arguing she would be trained in gymnastics and use that as a roll to dodge out of the way, in hopes of getting her +3 for her GIRL! Skill. The GM Agrees and gives her a difficulty of 12, her agility is only 3 but the +3 for her GIRL! Skill will mean she starts with a 6. Rolling both dice, her white die only gets a 2 but her pink die gets a 6, meaning it explodes. She rolls the pink die again and luckily gets another 6, meaning it explodes again. She rolls the pink die a third time and gets a 1. adding the dice together she gets 2 on the white and a whopping 13 on the pink die due to it exploding twice. Added to her stat+skill of 6 she has a total of 19, and dodges the attack with ease.\nThere is a bit more than that but this gives you a basic idea as to how the task resolution rules work. \nHOW ARE WE GOING TO FULFILL OUR GAME?\nWe also intend to use drivethru RPG to print and distribute both our print and PDF offerings and as they have with many other games they do an amazing job of bringing these kinds of smaller indy projects to life, and making it easier for both the customer and the writer to see this product come to reality.\n STRETCH GOALS!-\nI have added a few stretch goals in hopes this will liven up the game.\n$5500.00- GM SCREEN INSERTS: we will be adding GM screen inserts for both portrait and landscape formats in PDF for all levels of pledge at no additional charge, it is an easy way to have any charts or data handy for you at the table.\n$6000.00- 2 Adventures in PDF: if we reach $6000.00 we will publish two additional modules in PDF for free also like the GM Screen for all Levels. the modules include the adventures GRAND THEFT MECHA, and UNDER THE SEA. both modules include pre gen Sentai to make running them that much easier. \n$6500.00- Dancin' for Dollars- If we reach this level I will shoot and star in a music video dancing publicly in a red ranger costume. Don't believe me? here is a pic of me with the helmet -\n  I am not kidding I am willing to make a goof of myself to make this happen!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is only one major risk/challenge in this project and that is in this being my first time doing this.

The core for this game already exists, and there is a document on my machines right now that is an edited and expanded version as I have talked about it still needs a tweak here or there but We are ready to roll. and as we are using DrivethruRPG for our publishing and distribution this has taken a lot off our plate (no looking for printers, or getting quotes, that part is pretty much done.)

Our cover and interior artist Reuben Dodd of Sorrowking Studio will produce the stunning interior art. The talented Stephanie McAlea will be doing our cartography. The indefensible Mark Shireman is handling layout, cover design, and art direction. Reuben, Mark, and Stephanie are Golden Goblin Press alumni so we are thrilled to have them back again for this project. President Oscar Rios and our new associate editor Tim McGonagle are handling the editing. We are happy to welcome Tim to our production staff.\nThis is a short, one-week Kickstarter campaign with all physical copies being produced as Print on Demand via Lightning Source. Cold Warning is in fantastic shape as the scenario is already written, has undergone some initial editing, and the maps and interior art assignments have already been issued.\nWelcome to Winter Haven!\n\nNor'Easter, Whiteout, Deep Freeze and Hypothermia level backers will also get In From the Cold - a collection of eight pre-generated Call of Cthulhu 7th edition investigators, each with their own personal ties to Cold Warning. Reuben Dodd has drawn individual character portraits of each In From the Cold investigator. Some may look a bit familiar to fans of our previous titles.\nThe cast of In From the Cold\n  Original investigator portraits for In From the Cold\nAbout the Author  \nScott David Aniolowski has been writing scenarios for Call of Cthulhu since 1986. His first scenario was \"Temple of the Moon,\" written with Mike Szymanski, in the collection Terror From the Stars. Since then he has written many classic Call of Cthulhu adventures including, \"Fade to Grey\" from Tales of the Miskatonic Valley (Chaosium), \"The Eyes of a Stranger\" from Sacraments of Evil (Chaosium), and \"Shades of Tomorrow Lost\" from More Adventures in Arkham Country (Miskatonic River Press.)\nHis writing has been featured in The Malleus Monstrorum, Ramsey Campbell's Goatswood and Less Pleasant Places, and the story concept for The Sinking City (a video game coming soon from Frogwares Games.) His fiction work includes \"Ignus Fatuus\" (co-written with T.E. Grau in Where Monsters Lurk, PS Publishing), \"The Night Club,\" \"Mr. Bauble's Bag,\" and \"The Jack O'Lantern\" (all in 365 Scary Stories, Barnes & Noble), \"Mother Blood\" (Undead & Unbound, Chaosium), and \"First Nation\" (Dead but Dreaming 2, Miskatonic River Press.)  He has also edited many roleplaying supplements and fiction collections including Made in Goatswood (Chaosium), Singers of Strange Songs (Chaosium), Horror for the Holidays (Miskatonic River Press), Beneath the Lamplight (Jack O'Lantern Press), Darker Companions (PS Publishing, forthcoming), and others.\nRediscovery Of A Hidden Gem\nFor Golden Goblin Press this all began with a massive clean up of our office during the holiday season of 2016. Going through more than a decade of game and publishing related papers took quite some time. The vast majority of this material was out of date, redundant, or irrelevant and several bags of it ending up in the recycling bin. However, not all of it was worthless. A number of lost treasures emerged with some dating back to the Miskatonic River Press Era. Golden Goblin Press President Oscar Rios had worked closely with Miskatonic River Press President Tom Lynch after the unexpected death of the company's founder Keith \"Doc\" Herber. When MRP closed its doors there were quite a few projects that were in progress, under review, or deemed \"for consideration.\" All of those projects were parceled out to other publishers, with much of that material being bequeathed to Miskatonic River Press' spiritual successor Golden Goblin Press.\nOne of these projects was Tales of the Crescent City that later became Golden Goblin Press' second book. With backer help, another project that will finally see the light of day is Cold Warning, a scenario written by Scott David Aniolowski.  Why this treasure was forgotten is anyone's guess, but for many years it sat collecting dust on a cluttered bookcase in the main office of Golden Goblin Press. If playing Call of Cthulhu has taught us anything, it is that you can't keep eldritch horrors from returning when they are least expected. Cold Warning would not be denied its rightful place in our nightmares.\nFatal end to the overly curious.\nFor years this potent scenario has been on ice (pardon our pun), seemingly without hope for a spring thaw. Now Golden Goblin Press has the established track record and means to finally publish this dark, brutal, and frightening adventure. \nFrom The Author\nSomething is here, I can hear them breathe\u2026  \nI wrote \u201cCold Warning\u201d way back in the early 1990s \u2013 it could have even been in the waning years of the 80s. It was inspired by my favorite song on one of my favorite albums by one of my favorite musicians (who, incidentally, is still going strong close to 40 years after beginning in London\u2019s punk scene of the late 70s!), and by Brian Lumley stories I had recently read. It played well (although I believe one of the investigators saw the Great Old One at the end and went a little mad!) so I decided to write it and send it to Lynn Willis. By then I\u2019d been published regularly by Chaosium and had a great working relationship with Lynn. Anyway, he liked it and accepted it immediately without asking for edits. And that was the last I thought anything of that one. Keith Herber joined Chaosium as Call of Cthulhu Line Editor soon thereafter and I was kept busy with other projects.\nScott David Aniolowski\nA couple years later, Kevin Ross and I visited Chaosium\u2019s offices after doing GenCon and working the Chaosium booth. We were there for a few days, and during that time Lynn Willis told me about a book he was working on called \"Amerikan Gothik\" which consisted of three scenarios \u2013 a scenario involving the KKK, my \u201cCold Warning,\u201d and a third that I have no recollection of whatsoever. This was news to me as I hadn\u2019t heard a word about that scenario since the day Lynn accepted it, but of course I was always thrilled to be in a new book.  \nAnd\u2026 that was the last I ever heard of Amerikan Gothik! I have no idea whatever became of it. Obviously, Chaosium never published it and there was never any more talk of it. Apparently it just vanished into the ether, and so I forgot all about \u201cCold Warning\u201d again.  \nFast-forward to mid-2010s and \u201cCold Warning\u201d resurfaces quite by accident when I stumble across it in a file. I believe at the time there may have been some talk with MRP about using it, but then they closed shop. So back into the files the scenario went until Oscar Rios at Golden Goblin Press mentioned it and I passed it on to him to use as a stretch goal for one of his Kickstarter campaigns. The stretch goal wasn\u2019t unlocked, so \u201cCold Warning\u201d went back into hibernation once again until a few months ago when Papa Goblin discovered it in a file while cleaning his office. He asked if Golden Goblin could use it and I said sure, but with the caveat that I be allowed to give it a serious editing and rewrite, as I knew it was old and sloppy (ah, sweet juvenilia!). He agreed, and for the first time in probably 25 years I gave \u201cCold Warning\u201d a good close read. What began as tidying and tinkering, snowballed into a full-on deep rewrite that ended with a scenario more than double the size of the original! I moved it from Toronto and Quebec to Arkham and Maine because that just made more sense (and would fit much easier into on-going campaigns), restructured the plotline, expanded the lore and Mythos element, and (hopefully) breathed life into the NPCs. Cold Warning now ranks among my personal favorite scenarios and it\u2019s the first Call of Cthulhu scenario I\u2019ve written since 2010 (I co-wrote one in 2013). Its past meets present, and feels like a very satisfying closing of a chapter of my life.  \nSo, I hope you enjoy reading Cold Warning as much as I enjoyed writing it (twice!), and I hope your investigators are chilled but will ultimately triumph. There are some horrible things that could happen to them, but also some potentially great rewards. To the Keeper, I suggest you play up the cold and the isolation and the suspicious lodge guests. And take inspiration from Bigfoot movies - steal some of the classic Bigfoot movie tropes to scare your investigators. Hell, I did! \nNothing in here can help me now, Cold Warning comes for me\u2026. \nSDA The House of Secrets, 2/23/17\nADD-ON ITEMS\nBackers can now add on Print on Demand copies of Riding the Northbound for $15 + Shipping and handling. The shipping and handling charges fall out as follows:  \nThe United States : +$5  (A total of $20)\nCanada, South America, and the EU : +$10  (A total of $$25)\nAsia, Australia, India: +$15 (A total of $30) \nNOTE - Should Riot and Red Plank (Stretch Goal Two) or a Haunting in Kingsport (Stretch Goal Three) be unlocked, the same price and shipping rates apply. Please do not increase your pledges to cover Print on Demand copies of scenarios until their particular stretch goal's are unlocked (it throws off our budgeted production accounting). \nSTRETCH GOAL ONE  / UNLOCKED!\nRiding the Northbound, a Hobo Odyssey ($12,500 / UNLOCKED) - A group of Hobos, Tramps, and Bums leave on an epic journey from New England to Upstate New York, in a snowy late November. A tramp named Bottlecap Bob has invited everyone he ever rode the rails with (which is pretty much hobo, tramp, and bum you can think of) to his home for a party to celebrate his recent marriage to a wealthy and exotic widow. Riding the rails in November is hard, and this route particularly dangerous. However, the journey proves to be the easy part.  \nRiding the Northbound (Hobo slang for having died) is a scenario where the players take on the roles of a band of hobos, tramps, and bums on an epic journey. We have run it for about four years at conventions and it has proved to be one of our most popular scenarios by far. This is the first time it will every be distributed to the public.  \nWe'll be expanding the scenario a bit and converting it and the pre-generated investigators for it to 7th edition. We'll also be converting the article Raggedy Clothes and Worn Out Shoes from our first book Islands of Ignorance - The Third Cthulhu Companion, to 7th edition and including it in Riding the Northbound. This article gives keepers and players the basics of playing a hobo, tramp, or bum. The finished manuscript for this will be at least 20,000 words (equal to our target for Cold Warning).  \nWe'll commission seven investigator portraits and six interior illustrations from Reuben Dodd of Sorrowking Studio, as well as one or two maps from Stephanie McAlea of Stygian Fox. Layout and art design will be handled by Mark Shireman.  \nOnce unlocked, all backers at the Storm level and above will receive a digital download of Riding the Northbound. Physical versions of Riding the Northbound will be available as a Print on Demand Add-On item for an additional $15 + Shipping and handling.\nSTRETCH GOAL TWO  \nRiot at Red Plank, by Phredd Groves ($18,000) - At the beginning of the 20th century in the remote forests of northernmost Michigan; copper miners toiled in the bones of the Earth by the shores of Lake Superior. It was difficult, dirty and dangerous work. Players in this scenario will find themselves working the Hecate mine in Red Plank, Michigan in 1904. What they encounter a half-mile below the surface may not only threaten them, but also their family, friends and their entire community. \nThis scenario will be expanded to at least 20,000 words, include 7 pre-generated investigators, and be updated for 7th edition.  \nWe'll commission seven investigator portraits and six interior illustrations from Reuben Dodd of Sorrowking Studio, as well as one or two maps from Stephanie McAlea of Stygian Fox. Layout and art design will be handled by Mark Shireman.  \nOnce unlocked, all backers at the Storm level and above will receive a digital download of Riot at Red Plank. Physical versions of Riot at Red Plank will be available as a Print on Demand Add-On item for an additional $15 + Shipping and handling.\nSTRETCH GOAL THREE\nA Haunting in Kingsport, by Oscar Rios ($24,000) - On a cold and snowy New Year\u2019s Eve in 1899, Morton and Charlotte Pomroy murdered their three children and several servants. It went down in history as the most shocking and tragic crime the city of Kingsport had ever witnessed. The Pomroy estate quickly gained a dark reputation for being the most haunted house in all of Kingsport (which for Kingsport is saying a lot.) Now, 27 years later, a team from the American Society for Psychic Research, a noted clairvoyant medium, and the estate's new owner are about to conduct the first ever-formal scientific investigation of the Pomroy estate. This is another Golden Goblin Press convention round, seldom run because of its length. In the few times it has been run, we had great results with it (including one particularly epic ending at Philly Gamescon several years ago.) Players will take on the roles of paranormal investigators, ghost hunters, mediums, and a millionaire benefactor trying to solve the mysteries regarding the tragic end of the Pomroy line, as well as the persistent haunting of their family estate. However, each investigator has their own reason for the journey to Kingsport... This scenario will be expanded to at least 20,000 words, include seven pre-generated investigators, and be updated for 7th edition. Seven investigator portraits and six interior illustrations will be commissioned from Reuben Dodd of Sorrowking Studio, as well as one or two maps from Stephanie McAlea of Stygian Fox. Mark Shireman will handle the scenario layout and art design. Once unlocked, all backers at the Storm level and above will receive a digital download of A Haunting in Kingsport. Physical versions of A Haunting in Kingsport will be available as a Print on Demand Add-On item for an additional $15 + Shipping and handling.\nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com The names, descriptions, and depictions applied to this supplement are derived from works copyrighted by and include trademarks owned by Chaosium Inc., and may not be used or reused without its permission.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks and challenges are primarily the project not funding and production delays.

It didn\u2019t have the usual Tolkien-esque trappings of games like D&D; in fact, ads for the game proudly proclaimed, \u201cNo Elves\u201d.\nThe original Talislanta RPG was inspired by the fantasy novels of Jack Vance, and by other sources such as H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s The Dreamlands of Unknown Kadath, Michael Moorcock\u2019s Elric novels, and The Travels of Marco Polo.\nThe game was set in a strange world of twin suns and seven moons that seemed to be practically overflowing with exotic peoples, places, and creatures. The time was the New Age, a Renaissance-like period that started a thousand or more years after The Great Disaster, a cataclysm that marked the fall of the once-great Archaen Age.\nDuring this era, Talislanta was still a dangerous place, especially in the wilderness regions that lay beyond the walled cities. But for many who lived in the New Age, there was also a sense of hope, and the possibility of greater things to come.\nThat Was Now.\nThis Is Then...\nDragon's Graveyard\n   \nTalislanta: the Savage Land is a prequel to the original Talislanta game. It takes place just a short time after The Great Disaster, which the inhabitants of this era refer to as The Fall.\nThis period is like a nightmarish version of our own Dark Ages. All knowledge of spell-casting has been lost; maps are nearly non-existent, and much of the world is unknown. Most of those who survived The Fall are illiterate, and governed by superstition.\nThere are no nations, city states, or even laws. In their place, tribes of warriors, nomads, slavers, and refugees struggle to survive in a hostile wasteland, torn by centuries of warfare and a malevolent magical maelstrom known as the Gyre.\nThis is the world in which Talislanta: the Savage Land (TSL) takes place.\nThe world of TSL is dangerous and largely unexplored. Anything the inhabitants pre-Fall knew of the world is of little value now. The landscape has shifted. The great nations were sundered. Civilization itself has shattered.\nThis new vision of Talislanta is a world awaiting your discovery!\nSteve Sechi's Talislanta: The Savage Land comes to life in the amazing interior illustrations by David Arenas, and cover art by Mario Teodosio.\nLabyrinthe\n  We're delighted to offer FIVE different versions of TSL! Some pledges offer all five versions, but for pledges that reward a version of your choice, you will make that selection after the project in the pledge manager.\nThe print editions are all hardcover.\nThe entire rulebook is presented in Steve Sechi's original, completely reworked Talislanta game system as well as editions converting the characters and creatures to 5e OGL (D&D), Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, Savage Worlds, and Open D6.\nAll five versions of the rulebook are divided into the following chapters:\n1. Rules\n2. Characters & Tribes\n3. Skills & Special Abilities\n4. Territories\n5. Bestiary\n6. Goods & Equipment\nThere is also GM-facing material called \"Encounters\" that we hope to add to the rulebook if we hit stretch goals. (UPDATE: with your support we have added almost this entire chapter!)\nThe rulebook will be about 250 full-color pages. And here full-color really means FULL! This book is packed with amazing artwork! Here is a partial count of the illustrations:\n60+ creatures and plants in the Bestiary\n50+ pieces of equipment and artifacts\n23 playable character races\n20 Landscapes showing the terrain of TSL\nThere's no way to show even a fraction of the artwork on this project page, so I'll post more (a lot more!) in project updates, but watch the project video for glimpses of lots of artwork!\nOpening pages of Chapter Two.\n  The core mechanic of the TSL game system is simple. Determine modifiers based on your and/or your opponent's Attributes and Skills, roll a d20 and consult the Action Table. Here's what the table looks like:\n0 or less = Critical Failure \u2014 the attempted action fails miserably, resulting in negative additional consequences of some sort (GM\u2019s ruling based on the intent of the action and prevailing circumstances).\n1-5 = Failure \u2014 the action fails to achieve the stated intent.\n6-10 = Partial Success \u2014 the action is moderately successful, and achieves some of of the desired intent (such as half-damage from an attack).\n11-19 = Success \u2014 the action achieves the desired result.\n20+ = Critical Success \u2014 the action is even more successful than intended, achieving the stated intent and also yielding additional benefits of some sort. The GM determines the additional results based on the circumstances. Note that in Combat, this result is called a Critical Hit (see the nearby sidebar for details).\nEven though the system has been updated from the original 1980s version (as well as subsequent editions of Talislanta), this remains a purposely retro-gaming experience.\nIf the origin edition of Dungeons & Dragons is the first generation of roleplaying games, then Talislanta is one of the great second-generation games. It presented a vision of fantasy roleplaying very different than that of D&D. Still, there's no denying that D&D remains the world's most popular tabletop roleplaying game, and so players of the latest edition can enjoy the rich world of TSL, we're offering a 5th Edition version.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game is the most successful game birthed by the original 3ed OGL, and as such stands among the games most due TSL treatment. We successfully relaunched the Scarred Lands fantasy setting last year in both 5e and PFRPG and think the combination works great for Talislanta too!\nThe combination of the \u201cFast, Furious, Fun!\u201d of Savage Worlds is a natural for this project. The ruleset and setting are a great fit (they both have Savage in the name!), and we\u2019re excited to bring this wonderful world to the equally wonderful Savage Worlds community. Savage Worlds fans are passionate gamers, and we are happy to count ourselves among the ranks of Savage Worlds publishers!\nNocturnal Media (publisher of TSL) also owns West End Games, the publisher of classic roleplaying game like the original Star Wars RPG as well as Ghostbusters, the RPG that gave birth to the target number rolling mechanic that is now Open D6. We're pleased to offer a version of TSL for this user-friendly game system.\nTalislanta: The Savage Land also focuses on a epic stye of play. You control a single character as in most tabletop RPGs, but in TSL you my also create a Tribe and use your leadership skills to increase its strength, influence, and prosperity. Your Tribe can choose to remain neutral and operate as nomadic traders or tomb raiders. You can follow the path of war, and seek to conquer and control vast territories. Or you can build a stronghold, create a place of safety for your people, and maybe even try to rebuild some semblance of civilization.\nLarge-scale actions for a Tribe are accomplished in the TSL game system by using the Mass Action Table, and similar options are available in both the 5th Edition and Open D6 versions of the game.\nColossus\n  In late 2015 Kickstarter project, we funded Talislanta: Tales of the Savage Land, a webcomic by Talislanta-creator Steve Sechi and illustrator Ben Dennett. The new prequel vision of Talislanta premiered in those pages and the new pages added every week throughout 2016 and every Monday in 2017. There are still around a dozen pages to go (the graphic novel ran many pages longer than anticipated!) and when these pages are complete we'll print the book as promised in that earlier project.\nYou can download the free prologue to Tales of the Savage Land on DTRPG.\nThe graphic novel's completion lines up pretty closely to when the new RPG will be ready for press, so they are likely to print at the same time. Therefore, we're offering the printed graphic novel as an add-on in this project. (If you backed the prior project, then see the recent update for information.)\nTalislanta-creator Steve Sechi (Composer/Sound Designer) is also a composer, and together with Kostas Varotsis (Orchestrator/Conductor/Composer) they have produced a complete album of nine tracks to add another element to your TSL games. Steve has composed and produced over 200 albums of music for production libraries in the US, UK, and Canada and his music has been used on hundreds of TV shows and films. Kostas has won the Beethoven Award (Bonn, Germany) and a Gold Medal for Orchestral Conducting (Reims, France).\nHere are the 9 tracks included in the soundtrack (available as a $5 add-on):\n1 \u2014 Savage Land Theme\n2 \u2014 The Underrealms\n3 \u2014 Archaen Ruins\n4 \u2014 Plains of Armageddon\n5 \u2014 The Umar\n6 \u2014 Nomads\n7 \u2014 War\n8 \u2014 Pursuit\n9 \u2014 Boglins\nThe Savage Land Theme is available as a free download at both DriveThruRPG.com and at the Nocturnal Media website.\nYou can also listen here:\n  Beastmen\n  Several \"add-ons\" are available for an additional pledge that you add to your reward selection.

Specifically designed to focus upon the Heroes, their Adventures and the Moral Dilemmas they face \u2013 rather than spending hours playing out hyper-detailed slugfests. Play it anywhere with just two six-sided dice, pencil and paper. A game can last a couple of hours, a campaign can span a lifetime.\n\u2022 Henshin! \u2022 Mecha! \u2022 Kaijua! \u2022 Five minute character creation! \u2022 Ten minute combat! \u2022 Hours of high-octane Anime Adventure! \u2022 Easy to pick up and play. \u2022 Hard to put down. \u2022 THE lightweight, fast-play Anime Role-playing game.\nI've successfully self published 3 sets of tabletop Role Playing Game rules using this game system:\nTHE COMICS CODE (Superheroes)\n\"...........this is a rules-light game that lets you focus on the fun part of being a superhero. This lets it capture the FEEL of the genre without needing dense mechanics to ensure that it works correctly in true four-coloured style.\"\nTHE CODE OF THE SPACE-LANES (Science Fiction)\n\"A beginner friendly retro sci-fi romp.\"\nTHE CODE OF STEAM AND STEEL (Steampunk)\n'It's Steam Punk. It's simple. It includes theatrical and complete combat rules, interesting and quick character creation, and very theme appropriate and unique rules around Victorian \"form\".....Makes me want to go around saying \"Jolly Good!\" and \"Good show, dear chap!\"...'\nWhat\u2019s so special about these games then?\nThey are simple, only using two six-sided dice. Everything you need to play a game is on the character sheet. They don\u2019t use figures and maps so they\u2019re incredibly portable and you can play them anywhere. Despite the simplicity and the fact that combats are resolved relatively quickly, there\u2019s enough depth in the system to deliver hours of play and complete campaigns.\n There are three attributes each made up of a pair of numbers from 1-6 multiplied. So the attributes range from 2 through to 30. Two dice are rolled, the results multiplied and added to the relevant attribute, giving scores from 3 up to 66. A massively cinematic range from just two dice. This total is either compared to an opponent\u2019s total or a difficulty table. Criticals on a double 1 or a double 6. If you roll any other double though, magical things happen. The player gets to choose from a range of options which include tactical advantages (such as reserving the right to reroll a die) or narrative effects (like changing the emotional state of one of the referee\u2019s characters). It works really well!\n Throw in three different types of hit point \u2013 physical, mental, social, moral (depending upon the particular genre) and you\u2019ve got a flexible, accessible and fun system with enough just enough \u201ccrunch\u201d to stop it being a completely hand-wavey story game.\n  Why do I need THIS version then?\nTo be honest, you don\u2019t. You can play anime such as Super Sentai (Power Rangers) using THE COMICS CODE. You can do Robotech using THE CODE OF THE SPACELANES. You can do Laputa Castle in the Sky* using THE CODE OF STEAM AND STEEL. But wouldn\u2019t you rather see how I do it, than having to hack the system yourself? I\u2019m really very pleased with the rules for Henshin Heroes, Mecha, Kaiju and Super-robots where they all combine in one big ass-kicking machine.\n This game is the next evolution of the system. If you go the full Super Sentai route, the characters start off as ordinary people, then turn into Superheroes, then get their Mecha. It\u2019s like all my previous games rolled into one with a bit of extra crunch on top.\n And, of course, there\u2019s the stonking little introductory scenario in the book - Dark Predators. The characters live in a huge domed city \u2013 the last bastion of Mankind \u2013 surrounded by a wilderness filled with giant monsters and protected by heroic mecha pilots. But there\u2019s something sinister going on behind the scenes\u2026\u2026.\n The rules for THE CODE OF SH\u014cJO AND SH\u014cNEN are finished and have been extensively playtested at numerous conventions across the UK. This Kickstarter is to primarily to raise the money to pay for the exciting artwork the rules require.\nThe book will be a trade paperback (6\" x 9\") with a glossy full colour cover, B&W interior and clocking in at around 150 pages.\nLook at my existing work here: http://www.rpgnow.com/browse/pub/721/Simon-Burley-Productions\nAnd here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Heroes\nPLAY\n\nStretch goals\nAll I want is some great Anime art for the book. So if we raise the \u00a33,000 \u2013 you\u2019ll have my eternal thanks.\n However, if we do go over:\n \u00a33,000 - 6,000\nI\u2019ll spend the excess money on more and better art for the book.\n \u00a36,000 plus\nI\u2019ll revert back to the original budget for The Anime Game. I\u2019ll use the extra funds to write and produce another book in the \u201cCode\u201d series \u2013 and I\u2019ll let you lot on my Kickstarter Community decide which genre you want:\nHorror\nWesterns\nPost Apocalyptic Wasteland\nWW2 Commandos\nFantasy\nSecret Agents\n EVERYONE who pledges will get a free PDF of this book. Yes, even the \u00a31 pledgers. Anyone who buys a printed copy of the Anime book through this Kickstarter will get a voucher allowing them to purchase the book at cost price.\n\u00a39,000 plus\n For each \u00a33,000 above the initial target, I\u2019ll commit to producing another book in the range. These may be core books (as above) or collections of expansions or Scenarios for my existing games written by myself or people I know. Again, my Kickstarter community can tell me what they\u2019d like to see. (But personally I\u2019d love to see \u201cThe Great Martian Tripod Race \u2013 and other stories from the Victorian Colony of Mars\u201d published.)\n If we raise loads and loads of money, I have people who I\u2019d trust to write further \u201cCode\u201d books for me, should I need to spread the workload.  \nThose who pledges more than \u00a31 to get will get free PDFs of these books. Anyone who buys a printed copy of the Anime book through this Kickstarter will receive vouchers allowing them to purchase these books at cost price.\n\n * And, finally, Simon's rant:\nOkay \u2013 it\u2019s my Kickstarter and I can have a rant if I want to. It\u2019s about Laputa: Castle in the Sky. Technically the first film they made as Studio Ghibli and the single best thing they have ever produced. Outside their studios is a sculpture. What of? One of the robots from Laputa: Castle in the Sky. That\u2019s how highly they rate the film themselves. It\u2019s a work of rare beauty, but it\u2019s also full of pulse-pounding action and thought provoking ideas. And the plot is far more accessible to western sensibilities than most Anime. And it\u2019s so rarely shown. Why, oh, why do people bang on about Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed, Spirited Away, Attack on Titan etc. when this little gem sits unloved and forgotten? Do yourself a favour \u2013 if you\u2019ve never seen Laputa: Castle in the Sky, find it - if you can \u2013 and watch it. You won\u2019t regret it.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are three main challenges, as I see it: \n\n1) Fulfilment of the project by the agreed date. This is my first Kickstarter campaign and I understand that many are faced with delays. I don't anticipate an issue here. I've successfully self published rulebooks EXACTLY like this one three times before. The rules and the manuscript are finished. The successful project will be fulfilled through the DRIVETHRURPG/RPGNOW web site. This has been used successfully before and which removes any issues with international shipping etc. There is an extremely conservative fulfilment date and we would expect to ship months in advance.\n\n2) As this is mainly about paying for artwork, the Art will need to be drawn for the project. There is the possibility of issues of quality and delivery time. To address this we are working with a range of artists. Sharing the workload among a number of artists will give us the high quality images you demand delivered in good time to enhance the rulebook.\n\n3) The rule book is an adaptation of the existing rules \"spine\" changed to fit the Anime genre. This allows for adventurous GM's to mix genres. The playtesting has shown that the game is great fun though it may be more suited to General RPG players looking to delve into the worlds of Anime rather than Anime fans looking for their perfect RPG. Since the book is compatible with the CODE system some the text in this book will be identical to that in my earlier books. However there is lots of brand new material and rules adaptations and, of course, there's a great scenario for you to test your SH\u014cJO AND SH\u014cNEN with.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Simon Burley\nFirst created \u00b7 6 backed\nHi!

The book also provides a more detailed look at the three locations than the main rulebook, so its is useful as reference for the Narrator.\nBackers who backed the original Monkey The Roleplaying Game can back the Mandate at a discount using the Returning Backer pledge level. This gets you the pdf with an option of a POD print version.\nBackers who didn't back the original Monkey kickstarter, can pick up the main rule-book and the additional books that funded as stretch goals in that campaign using the, Punky Monkey, Funky Monkey, All the Monkey and Mega Monkey backer Levels.\nThere is One Addon, Dragons Ascending To Heaven, a Wuxia tale of revenge and redemption. This is a self contained standalone book, with a concise version of the rules that power Monkey included. While character generation rules are included, pre-generated characters are also included so you can just pick up and play. Add \u00a35 for a pdf copy or \u00a310 for a POD print copy with a pdf.  \nAbout the Mandate of Heaven\nThis epic adventure takes place in three locations within Chinese Mythology. The Western Heaven, Chang\u2018an capital of the Tang Empire and the Ten Courts of Hell. There numerous plots play out and evil demons try to bring about the downfall of Heaven and Earth by usurping the harmony between them which is called the Mandate of Heaven.\nIt is written for the recently funded Monkey The Roleplaying Game, which is based around the Chinese Epic The Journey to the West. There\u2019s an opportunity to back that game as part of your pledge here and pick up the four books that funded in that campaign. If you backed that campaign there is a special backer level, the Returning Monkey, especially for you so you can pick up the book in pdf/and or print at a large discount as a thank you for backing the original campaign.\nA Detective by Peter Frain\nRecent Campaign Updates\nMore about the Mandate #1 Meet the Immortals - more detail about how the player characters work in Monkey and the Mandate of Heaven.\nMore about the Mandate # 2 The Basic Rules. How Monkey's straightforward card drawing resolution system works.\nDetails of Stretch Goal (PDF Play Aids) added and funding goal reduced to make it more achievable. (see below).\nAdd On Dragons Ascending To Heaven, a self contained adventure/wuxia ruleset using the Monkey RPG rules added to the campaign, details see below.\nThe Mandate of Heaven in detail\nThe Mandate of Heaven takes place in three locations from Chinese Mythology which feature prominently in the Journey to the West.\nFirst is the Western Heaven, ruled by the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother of the Western Heaven (who is pictured in the header image), who represent the forces of Yang (masculine/active) and Yin (feminine/passive) respectively. Their palaces are at the top of the Heaven, in a city made of jade and other precious gems and metals which floats on clouds above the holy mountain of Kunlun. Below them are the various Ministries of Heaven that run various affairs, such as the Ministry of Thunder led by the Bat Winged Lei-Gong Lord of Thunder whose job is to bring to justice criminals that the mortal authorities cannot. The Western Heaven is also home to many deities such as Lao Tzu the Grandfather of Taoism, the Planet Venus and General Le commander of the heavenly hosts and his son the demon Hunter Prince Natha. As well as the Ministries and the palaces of the various Immortals are places like Lao Tzu\u2019s Forge and the Peach Gardens of the Queen Mother of the West. The player immortals who start on this location are Mandarins, Guards and Magistrates of Celestial origin who were born to serve one of the Great Immortals directly or one of the Ministries.\nLei Gong of the Ministry of Thunder by Jon Hodgson\nThe second location linked to its heavenly counterpart is the capital city of the Tang Empire, Chang\u2019an. Here the Tang Emperor rules the teeming masses of Chinese. The city is made up of a grid of city streets and divided into districts; some residential, some commercial (which houses the city\u2019s great market), some dedicated to entertainment (with theatres and brothels) and of course the temple district that houses the wooden temples of Buddhism and Taoism. The Player Immortals from here are made up of Earthly Immortals who report to the local City God and are responsible for Earthly affairs, such as the smooth flow of the local rivers or the fertility of the local rice fields.\nThe final location is the Ten Courts of Hell, where King Yama oversees the judgement and punishment of sinful mortals. This is a dark, dangerous place, with its own order and rules were the Player Immortals are Demon Guards and Judges responsible for keeping the sinners within its boundaries until their allotted time is up and it is time for them to drink the Waters of Forgetfulness, so they may return to earth in their next mortal incarnation.\nEach location has its own collection of places, events and characters, which are involved in various sub plots. The player immortals start in the location of their origin, with all the responsibilities and relationships that that implies but at various places (or during certain events) they can travel to the other locations. For example, the Palace of the Western Queen of Heaven has a magical Cosmic Pillar were not only communications between heaven and earth are possible but also transportation.\nWhile very free form in nature, the wanderings of the Player Immortals and their interactions with the various plot lines build up to a story of a demonic threat to the order of Heaven and Earth. Of course this being Monkey this is all very light hearted with moments of intense action. It\u2019s the most epic Monkey experience produced for the game and its ideal for if you just want to run a memorable one shot or start your Journey to the West with a bang. At the upcoming 7 Hills gaming convention in April I\u2019ll be running it with two tables of four players and a co-Narrator who will run one of the tables while I run the other. Of course, you can also take your time to run it as a multi-session experience, if you are running it at home, with just your home group sitting round your gaming table:  A drawn out TV series rather than a Cinematic Film like the convention game will be.\nThe Basic Goal (\u00a32000)\nPhysically It\u2019s going to be a standalone A5 or 6\u2033 by 9\u2033 book, that will detail dozens of locations, characters and events, as well as explaining how to run this \u2018wandering toy box\u2019 adventure within a framework that gives the players and entertaining and satisfying experience. Art will be by Peter Frain and Dan Barker who will be already running hot from illustrating Monkey the RPG.\nOne Stretch Goal (\u00a32250)\nSince this is an All in One Kickstarter there is only one stretch Goal:\nPlay Aid Pack: This is a collection of pdfs, which are ready to print off on your home printer or at a local print shop.\nThe pack is made up of the following:\nA3 Maps of the three locations the adventure is set in; Western Heaven, The Ten Courts of Hell and the city of Chang'an.  \nCharacter Counters for all 12 Pregens  and important non-player immortals for use on the maps, so you can easily keep track of where the characters are at any one time.  \nWho's Who of Chinese Mythology. A quick run down of the important Immortals in each of the three locations a handy player reference.  \nHell Money. Amongst other rewards Player Immortals get paid in Hell Money when the do jobs for the Celestial Bureaucracy. They can use Hell Money to pay for the release of either themselves or other characters caught in Hell. This will be single double sided sheet, with multiple notes on that you can print off.\nOne Add-On: Dragons Ascending To Heaven (\u00a310 for print/pdf or \u00a35 pdf)\nA complete mini-game of revenge and redemption using a modified version Monkey RPG rules. Set the Tang capital of Chang 'an during the reign of Emperor Wu, a group of Wuxia Heroes attempt seek revenge for the massacre of their clan. A standalone book complete with rules and adventure. The adventure can be set up to be different every time and the rules can be used as a basis for similar Wuxia tales. This add on is delivered as POD printed version with complimentary pdf (\u00a310) or as a pdf only (\u00a35) via DriveThruRPG.com\nSimply add the cost of the add-on to your pledge and I will identify which format you have bought using the Backer's Survey. Note my delivery date of this is the same time as the Mandate itself, so December 2017.\nAbout Monkey The RPG\nMonkey cover by Jon Hodgson\nThis is a story-telling game set in a mythical China, where out of grace Immortals seek redemption by escorting a vulnerable, mortal Monk to distant India. Braving many dangers along the way, to recover scrolls of Buddhist scripture, that are missing from the Chinese canon.The road through the wilderness is dangerous since all of Demon-kind has resolved to stop the pilgrims and the eat the Monk's flesh!\nThe game's simple rules, which use standard playing cards, allow for any sort of action that you can imagine, from fast paced kung-fu to heated debates. The main rule book contains all that you need to play, except two packs of standard playing cards (one for the players and one for the referee) and your imagination.\nAs well as the main rulebook the original campaign funded the following supplemental books:\n1. A set of Quickstart Rules\n2. Ministry of Thunder \u2013 A set of five connected adventures.\n3. The Monkey Companion \u2013 A collection of short adventures and articles to add to your game.\n4. The Golden Register of 101 Immortals and Demons. \u2013 a book of friends and foes to drop into your game.\nYou can read more about it on the Monkey Kickstarter page.\nMissed out on Monkey The Roleplaying Game?\nIf you missed out on the Monkey Kickstarter earlier this year this is a chance to get the main rulebook + all the books funded as stretch goals. The following backer levels are for you if you want to pick up the rest of the books that funded as part of the Monkey RPG Kickstarter.\nPunky Monkey (\u00a315/approx. $18) The Mandate of Heaven + Monkey RPG in pdf\nFunky Monkey (\u00a320/approx. $24) The Mandate of Heaven + Monkey RPG in POD Print\nAll the Monkey (\u00a350/approx. $60) The Mandate of Heaven + Monkey RPG + The Quick Start Rules +The Ministry of Thunder + The Monkey Companion + The Golden Register of 101 Immortals and Demons in pdf and POD print.\nThe Mega Monkey(\u00a3100/approx. $120) As above, with the main rulebook and Mandate signed, and everything sent directly to you at no extra cost.\nAlready a backer of Monkey?\nSince the Mandate of Heaven was be the next stretch goal in the original campaign, I\u2019m offering it at a large discount to backers of that campaign as a thank you. Simply back the Returning Monkey level at \u00a35 (approx. $6 ) for the pdf and the option of picking it up in POD print at cost + P&S. All backers at this level will receive a pdf and a coupon sent via email from DriveThruRPG.com which they can redeem for an at-cost Print on Demand print version. Please note only back at this level if you previously backed Monkey, The RPG back in Jan/Feb earlier this year.\nWhat does POD printing at Cost mean?\nThe printed books will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG.com using their Print on Demand service. When the book is ready you will be sent an at cost coupon linked to your DriveThruRPG.com account email address, and you will then pay the production cost and the postage that you want. I've done this successfully for the last two Kickstarters I've fullfilled. It means that all the money raised is going to meet development costs. Also backers get their books at a slight discount to the final retail price.\nPlease note beause the main rulebook will be available in both Softcover + Hardcover I'll be sending print backers a coupon for both versions.\nPrinted books from the original campaign, such as the main rulebook which has a delivery date of June 2017, will be delivered before the Mandate of Heaven which I'm going to have done by December 2017.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my fourth Kickstarter and has been designed to be quickly deliverable, being in essence an extension of the previous Monkey campaign.

When I sat down to draw up the sketch maps to pass over to my cartographer, I realised I've never used maps as visual aids during any of my playtesting because Monkey is primarily a narrative game, where all the action happens in the imagination of the players. None of the adventures I've produced for Monkey in the main rulebook or the upcoming Ministry of Thunder have maps.  So I sat there stuck for a while until I decided the best way forward was to beef up the overviews of the cities, to give Narrators and players a better sense of their layout.

Profits from these sales will be counted toward reaching any available stretch goals once the main goal is reached!\nAtom Switch, Inc. Web Store\nFarador's Folly Overview\nThe Adventurer\u2019s Tome: Farador\u2019s Folly is an open-world, multi-region, system-neutral campaign world designed for use in InfinitasDM.\nCrafted to work fluidly with any fantasy themed Pen and Paper RPG rule set (such as D&D, Pathfinder, etc) and created from scratch for use in InfinitasDM, this mighty landmass serves as the primary world space (along with 2 additional micro-worlds/planes), featuring 4-6* separate regions, 5-8* major cities, and 9 different peoples, each distinct in their societal structure, native races, history, and problems.\n(*Two regions and their associated cities and quests will be added if their stretch goals are reached)\nAlthough magic use and technology vary from region to region, the upper and lower limits still fall roughly between High Fantasy and Swords and Sorcery. Still, the world could be easily adapted to any setting that can accommodate classic fantasy races.\nWith a plethora of interweaving sub quests and one primary quest for each region that culminates in an epic overarching story there is a massive amount of content to explore.\nDesigned around open-world gameplay, your players can start within any region and discover locations, quests, and NPCs at will. Smaller quests help guide the players toward larger ones, connecting to each other through a web of of both apparent and unexpected events.\nYou can read more about the scope of the Adventurer's Tome content in Backer Update #3.\nWhat's InfinitasDM?\nInfinitasDM is a digital tabletop app designed to bring the power and convenience of tools like digital maps, fog of war, document storage and management, and map-based links to documents and other maps directly to your physical table. \nIt also features a Player's View that casts a curated version of the Map View to a secondary display, allowing players to follow along and enjoy these benefits as well as enabling more natural, visual exploration of your worlds. You can learn more about InfinitasDM on our website here.\nSuccessfully funded on Kickstarter in 2016, our campaign was completed on budget and on time with regular public updates to keep everyone in the loop during and after development. \nRipples of The Past\n(For the complete Farador Lands creation myth see our Backer Update #2!)\nThe first race of evil beings, spread from the Titan Anhkotash's remains at the end of the 1st age, were largely beaten back by the burgeoning races of the Farador Lands, settling in the swamps, caves, and hovels of the Golgolath Wastelands. The greatest of these threats laid dormant however, hidden away. Out of sight and out of mind.\nSlowly, it has gained power and influence and now seeks to use it to claim the lands, restoring the horror and destruction of the Titan's great battle of so many centuries ago.\nWith his rising influence, the demon spawn Tevorrask has begun his assault on the living world. Sending ancient beasts, stoking the flames of past hatred, and seeding the holiest of sites with foul darkness, a plot has been hatched to send the farador lands back into chaos. \nWith danger spreading from all corners of the world, it will take a heroic group to find the connection between these evil deeds, stop the wicked plot, and unite the estranged peoples of the land to stand up and defeat this supreme monster.\nA Tour Of The Lands\nFarador Lands (Click for Full Size Image, artwork not final)\n   Region: The Dry Plains of Angobask\nAngobask, the desert plains of Farador. This wide expanse of arid sands and dusty crags in the South turn to tall grassed plains in the Northern boundaries of the region. The Quiet but welcoming people of Torvall are contrasted by their secretive and mystical Ur-Haavak brethren to the south. \nRecently, strange attacks have been plaguing the outlying homes of both peoples. Always accompanied by a series of tremors, citizens fear for their safety as the attacks grow bolder each day. Some say the attacks come from the great worms of the Kagmar Dunes, long shut off from the plains by the Red Dragon Tepui. Local superstition warns of the hobgoblins and angry spirits of the Underdark, seeping out from the hidden caves of the Tepui themselves, unsealing once closed passages to allow and provoke these attacks.\nRegion: The Great Forest\nThe center of the continent is dominated by an immense band of woodlands known as The Great Forest. Split into thirds by the Darkwater and Elfstear rivers these woods are the ancient home of the Elves.\n\nIn the North are the dark, twisted brambles of Dingurth Eryn. Once a place of worship, these woods have been tainted by an evil air and foul creatures. Too long have the once-holy lands of the Darkwood been enrobed in darkness. The time has come to cleanse the land and restore the ruined temple within, but it will take cooperation from the estranged kin of both great Elvish cities to make it happen.\n\n(Stretch Goal 1) The Golgolath Wastes\nPast the winding range of the Great Serpent Mountains and reaching to the Eastern coast are the Golgolath Wastes. These scorched lands reek of death and decay. From the Lizardfolk\u2019s swamps in the South to the Half-Orc capital Girrushaak Castle, these desolate lands are home to Farador's lesser loved children.\nThe evil force that has risen in the Deadwoods seeks to make war between the U\u2019Ra-Shaak Half Orcs and Za\u2019Rahk Tean Lizardfolk. Through kidnapping, murder, and subterfuge a foul plot has been hatched to goad these two groups into the kind of barbaric behaviors the other lands have long misplaced upon them.\n(Stretch Goal 2) The Frozen Northlands of Fallarhorn\nFor the first time in over 500 years, the Winter Throne sits empty as the heirless King Roetalstaag was found dead at the throne. Having outlived his wife and only child the kingdom is left leaderless.\nIn the wake of this tragedy an ages old conflict, once sparking a brutal civil war, has been rekindled. The evil rising in the woodlands and plains has caused some to re-examine beliefs in the elder gods they once cast away. All the while as people bicker and battle over who should be fit to rule - a believer of the modern ways, or of those long lost - a throng of evil creatures is assembling, ready to march from the bleeding pits and conquer the weakened lands.\nMini World: Grimdagh Underdark\nGrimdagh, the Underdark, a world beneath a world. Tales and rumors of the Underdark date back at least as far as the Second Age. Usually told as bedtime stories to frighten children and keep them from misbehaving, the Underdark is regarded as a place of mischievous gremlins and restless spirits that exists far below the sunlit world above.\nThese hidden lands have their own problems though; for the first time in 500 years a night stalker has emerged in the glowing fields. Unable to match its might, the denizens of the Underdark risk starvation if access cannot be restored to this bountiful place of harvest. \nRealm Of Death\nSal Daudum, the Hall of The Dead, the final resting place for the souls of departed Farador peoples of all races and creeds. Though each one may find it differently, all souls eventually make their way to the same place. This is the home of The Waystation of Hevkorask Bal, and the Lord of Death himself. \nWhat purpose could the land of the dead hold for the living? Some say that the darkness besieging the lands has taken refuge in this shadowed realm. Others cry that only Death can save them from this plight, perhaps more literally than they they even know. \nContent Quality Examples\nA Sample of Existing Campaign Quality\nThe style and execution of this campaign content will be similar to that from The Adventurer's Kit and Teeth of The Bloodwolf. That means plenty of illustrated maps, well laid out reference documents, and a thick web of interconnecting quests, characters, and plot lines.\nRewards\nAt $35 you get the complete Adventurer's Tome content. That includes any additional content that goes with it, like a Quest Guide pdf, any additional illustrations, and all of the map images as .jpgs so you can use them separately in your own campaigns. \nWith a release price of $50, that's a $15 less than retail.\nFor $60 you get all of the above, plus both of the previously created campaigns and all of their related content. That means the Teeth of The Bloodwolf story driven mini-campaign (plus it's game master's guide pdf, and 9 map images) and the Adventurer's Kit, an open world campaign area that includes a complete town, the surrounding woods, and a 2 level dungeon (plus it's quest guide pdf, \"telam map guide\" print-sized image, and all 21 map images).\nAll together, a $90 value.\nFor $80 you get both of the previous tier's content, plus an InfinitasDM T-Shirt. Backers will get to vote between the previous IDM shirt design or a new design! Shipping to USA is included, +$10 for all other countries.\nA $110 value.\nStretch Goals\nRather than reveal the stretch goals as we go along, I'm going to start out with the whole kit and kaboodle. The first two stretch goals expand on the existing content, adding up to two additional complete regions, along with the major quest, minor quests, NPCs, Location maps and everything else that goes with it.\nBeyond that comes the big stuff. InfinitasDM upgrades. If we can go above and beyond the development costs of the campaign content, the rest of the funding will go into new features and upgrades for InfinitasDM!\nDevelopment of these features will be able to run alongside the Adventurer's Tome creation, so it will not add any additional development time to the 5 month timeline we would be at with both region expansion stretch goals.\nBudget\nAs with all Kickstarter projects, 10% will get shaved off the top for Kickstarter and payment processing fees. Unlike our last project, unless the last few stretch goals are reached, this project will not require any additional staff. That means that really unlike the last project, I would actually get paid for my Atom Switch development time!\nSince I'll be able to distribute the campaign contents through our store at https://store.atomswitch.com , the only other campaign cost will be t-shirt printing and shipping.

Wearing the Cape earned a 4.5 Star rating on Amazon and climbed in the rankings to spend most of 2012 in the Top 10 books for its category.\nWearing the Cape came from my love of comics but was also shaped by my lifelong enjoyment of tabletop roleplaying games, especially superhero roleplaying games. Early on, I decided I would eventually pay that enjoyment back by moving the Post-Event world into the games I love.\nOver the past two years I have worked with roleplaying veterans to develop Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game as a complete roleplaying setting and rulebook using the award-winning Fate System created by Evil Hat. Now I am printing a high-quality edition of the rules, for the enjoyment of Wearing the Cape fans and superhero-roleplaying enthusiasts alike.\nTo distinguish between the gamebooks given as rewards in this campaign, and any printed later, each backer's gamebook will be printed with a golden number on the bottom right corner of the cover. It will also have an interior bookplate, signed by me to commemorate the campaign.\n                                  FOR A SAMPLE OF THE GAMEBOOK, GO HERE:           \nProduction Schedule\nWearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game is a finished gamebook ready for printing and distribution. Within 2 weeks of the campaign's end, backers will receive their tickets to download the PDF copy of the game at DriveThru RPG (available there for $24.99 if you miss the Kickstarter), and fully viewable on desktops, laptops, Kindles, iPads, and other e-readers. Assuming you have dice, pencils, etc., you will be ready to begin playing!\nThe hardcover printing will take a little more time, but I have made arrangements with a small publishing company in Las Vegas, Imagined Interprises Inc., to do a beautiful print run if the funding goal is met.\nImagined Interprises Inc. has produced for Kickstarter before, specifically the SnarfQuest 30th Anniversary Remastered Graphic Novel for Larry Elmore. Again, there will be no extended development phase for the edition; the master copy for the print run will be ready and waiting for the end of the campaign. We project a 3-month printing and delivery date!\nCampaign Add-Ons\nWhile the Kickstarter campaign is all about funding the printing of the game, I've been reliably told that pledgers like to see more\u2014and since the gamebook couldn't include everything, I would certainly like to do more!\nThe first Add-Ons will be two companion sourcebooks.\nWearing the Cape: Barlow\u2019s Guide to Superhumans, and Wearing the Cape: The B-Files (Barlow's Guide volume 2), will be world-expanding sourcebooks full of places, capes, and villains from the series, as well as backer-created capes and background! Backer-created capes and teams will become an official part of the background of a wider Post-Event world.\nBarlow\u2019s Guide to Superhumans started as a joke and an homage to Barlowe\u2019s Guide to Extraterrestrials, a formative sci-fi artbook from my youth. It appeared as an informative chapter-header in several of the Wearing the Cape books and is the Post-Event World analogue to the various real-world Jane\u2019s Guides to military craft, weapons, etc. Wearing the Cape: Barlow\u2019s Guide to Superhumans and Wearing the Cape: The B-Files will add more Post-Event history and places to the Post-Event World, more Power-Types, more Power Stunts, and most of all, many more popular capes and villains from the books.\nMore than this, it will be a collaborative effort, with fans of the books able to work up their own superhuman player-characters and place them officially in the Post-Event World. Want to know more about what happened in Europe? Central and South America? The Middle East? Asia and India? So do I.\n\nSentinel and Cape-File level backers will work with me to ensure their chosen heroes fit the rules of play and the canonical background of my stories. Their stories will help illuminate what happened during and after The Event in places far beyond Chicago, and they may even appear in later books!\nAs a final bonus for Sentinel and Cape-File level backers, I have secured the services of two of the gamebook's three main artists. One of them, the cover-artist of the series\u2019 most recent book, Team-Ups and Crossovers will render Sentinels pledger's heroes in her beautiful style for the Barlow's Guide. The other will do the same for The B-Files.\nBarlow's Guide Production Schedule\nWearing the Cape: Barlow\u2019s Guide to Superhumans funds as the first Stretch Goal Add-On, and The B-Files the second, as PDF editions. Since both will partly be collaborative work with the pledgers, real work on the books will not begin until the campaign ends and they have time to receive their electronic copies of Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game.\nThis means that pledgers will be receiving their e-copies of WtC: BGTS and WtC:TBF some months after the end of the campaign, with their hardback copies delivered after that (they will be shipped with the gamebook as a set). I will do everything in my power to expedite this, but experience working with artists and collaborative creators has taught me that promising anything sooner would be insanely optimistic of me and frustrating to campaign backers.\nProduction Plan Update!\nThe initial project envisioned two books, the gamebook and a single sourcebook, for fans of the Wearing the Cape series who wanted to play. $110 seemed a bit pricy, but I was able to reduce the cost of each book by $10, for a $90 investment for the reader who wants every printed word. Now with three books, totaling $130, plus another PDF-Only sourcebook (see The Archon Files, below), I've been looking for ways to cut down the backer cost again. So after speaking with my publisher, a production change has been made.\nThe hardback editions of Wearing the Cape: Barlow's Guide to Superhumans and Wearing the Cape: The B-Files will be merged into a single Wearing the Cape: Barlow's Guide and B-Files. This unified sourcebook will be slightly larger than the gamebook, and will price at $59! Although there is now only one, unified hardback book, the two electronic-edition sourcebooks will remain separate and still available at $19 each. They will be extensively cross referenced (see the unlocked Add-Ons, below).\nThe second Add-On is dice. The Fate System that Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game is built on uses special dice. Fate Dice can be purchased at most game stores and online from Amazon.com, but I thought it would be neat to design a set of Fate Dice just for the game. The Dice Pack that comes as a City Protector pledge reward includes 4 Hero Dice (blue, with Astra\u2019s crest) and 4 Opposition Dice (orange, explosion design), but while I was at it I designed a few more! The additional dice packs will become available as Stretch Goal Add-Ons.\nThe dice will be ready to ship with the gamebooks; they have been one of the easiest and funnest parts of the project.\nIn my most recent book, Team-Ups and Crossovers, Astra did what all superheroes seem to do sooner or later; wander into other worlds and make interesting new friends or meet interesting variations on old ones. One of the stories, Astra Gets Grrl Power, was a collaboration between me and Dave Barrack, writer of the smart and funny Grrl Power online comic. Astra got to meet Halo, Maxima, and other members of Arc-SWAT, the \"superhero\" field team of Archon, at a comic convention. Hilarity and property damage ensued. My fans loved it. Dave's fans loved it.\nContinuing our partnership, Dave and I have decided to create a special sourcebook, PDF only, giving background  and WtC:RPG stats for the Arc-SWAT team and some of the villains of their world. It will feature Maxima, Halo, and the rest of the team, as well as background and stats for Archon as an organization, background on Halo's world (from the point of view of Astra and later agents who \"surveyed\" the alternate reality), entries on every named character, and whatever other goodies Dave and I can think to throw in.\nWearing the Cape: The Archon Files will be a sourcebook using the same format as Barlow's Guide and The B-Files. Its characters will be fully compatible with WtC:RPG rules and the characters given in the gamebook and other sourcebooks, with enough information for players who wish to campaign exclusively in Dave's excellent superhero world or just launch crossover adventures of their own.\nAs a final set of Stretch Goal Add-Ons, there is the Wearing the Cape Special Edition. When I indie-published Wearing the Cape in mid-2011, I did my best to edit it but errors remained in the published draft. To commemorate the five-year run of the series and publication of the gamebook, I\u2019ve decided to release a special edition of my first book. It will be professionally re-edited, and will feature several pages of interior art. If the campaign reaches $50,000 then I will be able to again engage the services of Imagined Interprises Inc. to produce a high-quality hardback edition with beautiful litho-printed covers.Truly a special edition!\n So how do you get the Add-Ons?\nI am using Backerkit for campaign fulfillment, and that makes it easy.\n1. Choose your pledge-level and click on it to select the reward.\n2. When the blue box asks you to fill in the pledge amount, enter the pledge-level amount + the price of any Add-Ons you want. (If it has not yet unlocked, you may wish to wait for the Update which announces it.)\n3. When the campaign ends and you receive your survey, you will re-select the Add-Ons you decided on to verify correct fulfillment and postage.\nAs the campaign progresses, I will be sending out updates showing which Add-Ons have been unlocked. You can add or remove Add-On credit up till the end of the campaign without changing your pledge level.\n  Inside the US, all physical pledge level rewards will be sent via USPS Media or Priority Mail (Kickstarter is charging a flat $15 for Guardian, City Protector, Sentinel, and Big Box pledgers).\nWhen the Kickstarter campaign ends, backers will have the opportunity to select and purchase Add-Ons through the Backerkit Survey. These Add-Ons will include additional postage where necessary, which the backers will be able to add.\nOutside the US, all pledge level rewards will be shipped via USPS. Backerkit will add $10 more to the shipping included in the Guardian, City Protector, and Sentinel pledges. The Big Box pledge has a $65 international shipping fee (included in the Kickstarter pledge cost), which pays for a flat-rate box. Pledgers taking advantage of the Big Box, who wish to add the dice set Add-Ons, will also be given the option through Backerkit.\nWearing the Cape Special Edition will ship separately, through USPS Media Mail domestically ($5), and USPS First Class Mail internationally ($20).\nSee The Big Shipping Update (#20) for more details.\nFulfilling my first dream by indie-publishing Wearing the Cape and its sequels has been one long adventure for me. Successful indie-publishing means building your own private publishing company while continuing to write, and I have been blessed with wonderful editors and reviewers, lucky to find great artists and graphics designers. Even so, the learning curve has often been a steep one.\nWriting and developing Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game has fulfilled my second dream, and has certainly been a new adventure with its own learning curve to climb. I cannot express how excited and proud I am to be finally launching this campaign, and how grateful I am to everyone who has helped me come this far.\nWith this campaign and your help, the adventure is just beginning.\nThank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe PDF edition of the gamebook is complete.

The Sweet Meteor of Death may strike the Earth between now and the expected fulfillment times, and speedy completion of Barlow's Guide to Superhumans will depend upon cooperation from the contributing pledgers (and of course the artist).

Some are helpful, some are oblivious and some are hiding in plain sight. A strange unexplained astronomical event, a stolen statue, a murder of crows, and a cryptic clue lead you and your fellow investigators to a quiet vacation town that is far more sinister and deadly than it appears.\nThe story is a blend of real history and fiction that gives the story a life of its own. The adventure is the result of two years of research, writing and play testing. The real history is fascinating and flows right into the mythos world with very few changes.

It is set on Arth, an alternate Earth at the dawn of the modern age. It is a world of wonder and excitement, and draws on many different historical and fictional sources for inspiration.\nPlayers in Dime Adventures take on the role of cinematic heroes: bold explorers, brilliant scientists, dashing fencers, ineffable mystics, wealthy dilettantes, hardboiled investigators, masked crime fighters and more!\nDime Adventures is inspired by a wide variety of fiction, ranging from the pulp stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs (Tarzan, John Carter), Johnston McCulley (Zorro) and Robert E. Howard (Conan), to Victorian literature such as The Prisoner of Zenda, Dracula and Sherlock Holmes, from the classic science fiction of H. G. Wells (The War of the Worlds, The Island of Doctor Moreau) and Jules Verne (Journey to the Center of the Earth, Around the World in Eighty Days), to more recent works, including Indiana Jones, The Extraordinary Adventures of Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec, The Mummy and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\n  The year is 1904, but in a world that never was! \nDinosaurs still roam forgotten corners of the land. Alien influences operate from the skies. Mystics wield ancient powers. Strange new sciences promise to change the world. The dead rise from the grave. All the while, modern movements sweep the globe, and bold explorers venture deep into the unknown or delve into forgotten ruins.\nThe world stands at a precipice. It is a time when bold men and women of action can reach out and make a lasting change in the world. It is an era when history is made. \nThroughout the past century science has steam-rolled on, making the world a new and better place. Explorers are venturing out to the edges of the map, social institutions are changing and a global system of trade and alliances is emerging. With the rise of airships and the earliest airplanes, humans have now mastered air travel. With the spread of electricity and the telegraph, the world has become just a bit smaller. It is a time of optimism and opportunity.\nThe world is ripe for adventure!\n  Dime Adventures combines the excitement of pulp adventure with rich creativity of the alternate history genre. The core system, Saga Machine, has been in use for almost ten years, including publication in our other roleplaying games, Against the Dark Yogi and Shadows Over Sol. This version of the rules has gone through three public beta tests, as well as numerous internal releases.\nGameplay highlights include:\nA fast and flexible system for cinematic combat, with plenty of room for interesting narrative and tactical options!\nA quick and customizable character creation system, supporting numerous pulp archetypes and larger-than-life abilities!\nAn exciting chase system, leading to plenty of obstacles, narrow escapes and dramatic complications.\nA rich alternate historical world, complete with exciting locales, events and plot hooks on all seven continents!\nWant to know more about the mechanics? \nAll backers can access the complete draft text of Dime Adventures today! Simply follow the link from our first backer-only update for the full rules!\n  Dime Adventures has seen development and play as a homebrew setting since sometime in the early 2000's, and this incarnation of the rules has been in development for almost two years. The game has gone through three public beta tests, and is now ready for production. The writing is complete, the system has been perfected and the text is edited. We have some great art in the works, and we want to share this project with the world.\nMost rewards will be fulfilled through our partners at DriveThruRPG. All backers of THE GAME reward tier and up will receive both a PDF copy of any rewards and a code to order a print copy \"at cost.\" This means backers will be able to order a copy of the book at the minimum price necessary to print it. We expect the \u201cat cost\u201d price of the book to be somewhere in the range of $10 to $14. Shipping is also paid at that time. Rewards shipped to the US, EU or Canada will be printed and shipped from within that region, respectively.\nThe one exception to this fulfillment method is the physical copy provided at THE PRODUCER tier and higher. This is a print version of the core book that we will fulfill directly. This means that for the core book, all of the costs are up front; you won't have to pay any \"at cost\" print charges. Any supplements that are unlocked over the course of the campaign, however, will still use the \"at cost\" fulfillment method described above. These higher tiers will still come with the option of ordering an \"at cost\" print copy, if you so choose. This option may be desirable for international backers looking to minimize shipping expenses.\nAs with our previous projects, we will again be Kicking it Forward!\n  The below description of the pledge tiers reflect the rewards that are currently unlocked.\nOUR THANKS ($1)\nImmediate access to a review copy of the game.\nOur thanks for helping make Dime Adventures a reality.\nTHE GAME ($15)\nImmediate access to a review copy of the game. \nPDF copy of final game.\nPrint version of the game at cost.\nTHE GAME PLUS ($30)\nImmediate access to a review copy of the game. \nPDF copy of final game.\nPrint version of the game at cost.\nBoth at cost print and PDF copies of all supplements and other rewards unlocked by stretch goals.\nTHE PRODUCER ($50)\nEverything in THE GAME PLUS tier.\nWe will directly mail you a print copy of the game, which will be upgraded to an offset print copy if we achieve enough funding.\nEarly access to the game.\nDirect access to the development team.\nTHE CHARACTER ($75)\nEverything in THE GAME PLUS tier.\nWe will directly mail you a print copy of the game, which will be upgraded to an offset print copy if we achieve enough funding.\nEarly access to the game.\nDirect access to the development team.\nYour character appears in the game!\nTHE BOSS ($150)\nEverything in THE GAME PLUS tier.\nWe will directly mail you a print copy of the game, which will be upgraded to an offset print copy if we achieve enough funding.\nEarly access to the game.\nDirect access to the development team.\nYour character appears in the game with full color artwork!\n  The following add-ons are available for any backer of the project: just add the appropriate amount to your pledge.

Braving many dangers along the way, to recover scrolls of Buddhist scripture, that are missing from the Chinese canon.The road through the wilderness is dangerous since all of Demon-kind has resolved to stop the pilgrims and the eat the Monk's flesh!\nThe game's simple rules, which use standard playing cards, allow for any sort of action that you can imagine, from fast paced kung-fu to heated debates.   \nThe main rule book contains all that you need to play, except two packs of standard playing cards (one for the players and one for the referee) and your imagination.\nMonkey the 2nd Incarnation\nThis project is funding development costs for a second edition of the game, or its 2nd Incarnation. The original game was released over five years ago. It was illustrated using appropriate stock art from old books. After numerous games over the years, the rules, though they still make sense, need some tidying up and streamlining. Also, there are ideas which have come to mind since its initial release that I want to include.\nWith the 2nd incarnation I'm looking to replace the stock art with new art from talented artists such as Peter Frain and Daniel Barker. Jon Hodgson who did the original cover has been commissioned to do a cover that features all four of the main characters from the book (Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy and Tripitaka).\nMinistry of Thunder by Jon Hodgson\n    Taoist Priest by Peter Frain\n  Monkey on his cloud by Dan Barker\nI've also revised and streamlined the rules to make it even more easy to get into and play.

Become the Monkey King and learn the basics of the rules in a short tutorial adventure included in the main rulebook.\nStretch Goal 6 (\u00a38000  Unfunded) The Golden Register of 101 Immortals and Demons. Deep within the Ministry of Thunder is an index of foul foes and notable friends that the agents of the Ministry have encountered during its time.

(which is its current working title, although I\u2019m favouring the Mandate of Heaven as the final title). This is an epic adventure that runs over three of the locations in the book: The cloud city of the Western Heaven, The capital city of the earthly Tang Empire, and the 12 Courts of Hell.

I will pay the artists usage rights so I can make available T-shirts and other items through a Monkey Red Bubble Shop.\nStretch Goal 12 (\u00a323,000  Unfunded) Special Preview of next game.  Because fans have been asking for it if when we reach the lofty heights of being \u00a323K funded, I will start on The Water Margin, aka the Outlaws of the Marsh, which will be based off the Monkey rules. Obviously, this will need its own crowdfunding effort in 2018 to pay for all the art and other development costs, but backers will receive the first draft before the Kickstarter.

It\u2019s a GM-less game for 3-5 people that runs in 3-4 hours. The game\u2019s core spark comes from gradually build\u00ading up elements of language among players, who gain fluency in their own dialect over the course of play. Words are built off of the fundamental traits of the community, the pivotal events that have defined their lives, and how they respond to a changing world. Players use the language and explore both their characters and the world by asking what this new language really means to them. A new word is made, the language grows, and the community is tightened.\nFrom age to age, the Isolation changes and we see those changes reflected in the language. In the end, you'll define how the language dies and what happens to the Isolation. Players take away both the story they\u2019ve told together and this new language. \nDialect has been our passionate work for the last 14 months. We\u2019ve played it far and wide with different groups of people to great reception. Now it's time to share this language-building storytelling game with you, playful language-loving human.\nDialect is a role playing game where we define and explore an isolated community through its beginning, rise and end. Language is the lens. \nThe first step of any game is creating our community. At the start, we pick a backdrop which forms the world in which the Isolation exists (more on backdrops below). Next, we make the world our own by defining three aspects for our community. These will be the touchstones of our society, and will be the initial seeds from which our language grows.\nHere are some example aspects for a game set in the Martian colony:\nFinally, we each choose characters to be our voice in the Isolation. Each character has a unique relationship to the aspects, which means each has a unique relationship to the language.\nEach turn in a game of Dialect is divided into three simple stages.\nMAKE A CONNECTION. On every turn, players generate a new piece of language by picking a concept from a hand of cards and tying it to one of the defining aspects of the community.  We describe why this concept and aspect are linked, which tells us a little more about the world and our place in it. Perhaps our word for a BAD OMEN comes from our aspect WE ARE ILL-PREPARED because of a terrible accident in our past that we still haven't been able to explain.\n BUILD A WORD. Now, with the help of the other players at the table we determine what this new word will be based on what we've now learned about the community. In this example, the table decides that the terrible accident was when STATION SIX mysteriously blew up, for reasons that no one still fully understands. With time, we shortened STATION SIX to STAYSIX which has become our new word for any BAD OMEN or related concept.\n HAVE A CONVERSATION. Finally, we have a short conversation where we explore what this language means to two of the characters at the table. Characters aren\u2019t carbon copies, and not everyone identifies with all of the Isolation\u2019s aspects equally - so a word that one character uses casually, may be deeply meaningful to another. We define flavors of language at the level of the world and the individual. Who sees a major STAYSIX on the horizon that the others are ignoring? Let's play to find out.\nPaired with this DNA of forming language and exploring characters, the game takes place over three ages. Pivotal events happen as time passes and the Isolation is faced with hard choices that will change it in deep ways.\nWill our Isolation end because it\u2019s ultimately assimilated, will we be forced to give up who we are in order to survive or does collapse come from within?\n    Making and using new pieces of language is the heart of Dialect. To that end, we're thrilled to be collaborating with the most prolific and prominent creator of languages today, David Peterson. David will be writing a chapter for Dialect that highlights his experience in constructed language and how he tries to bring out a culture's unique aspects while inventing his own languages.\nDavid's chapter will help enhance your game of Dialect by giving you new insight into how language is invented and creative inspiration for a richer and and more evocative experience. If you aren\u2019t already an avid conlanger, you'll get a taste of a beautiful sciency art form. If you are, then you totally know what's up. We\u2019re stoked to be working with him!\n  Backdrops are the world from which the Isolation emerges. They are the starting line, the playset, the point where we grow apart and begin distinguishing ourselves. They are an ideal way to shape your game to explore different themes and experience a different world. The game comes with a set of core backdrops: The Martian Outpost, The Compound, Archipelago, and The Network.\nOutside of the core settings, we have a set of incredible contributing writers -- world-class game designers, linguists, language creators, and generally-formidable humans -- who will be making additional backdrops for the game. Here is a taste of what you can expect from these fine minds.\n    Backdrop ideas are subject to change according to whim and inspiration.\nDialect comes as a book and language generating deck, both gorgeously printed with professional layout and beautiful art. To play Dialect, all that is required is the rulebook, the language generating deck and some index cards. With these three ingredients and a friendly gaming circle, you are set for a storytelling, language-building good time.\nPlay takes place in a space lovingly referred to as the the Language Tableau. The Language Tableau is the home to aspects that define the community, the events that happen to shape the Isolation, and most importantly, the language that evolves from them.\nA Language Tableau can be clean and simple or optionally more adorned. We enjoy the adornment ritual: dividing ages with strings, stones or any other creative options you have available. You're welcome to customize your playspace or keep it au naturel.\nDialect has been being playtested regularly for the last 14 months: at conventions around the US, home gatherings, festivals, bars, classrooms, forests, even in a chapel. It\u2019s been a blast. Here are a smattering of publicly-accessible reviews and play reports.\n    From Linky to Linker: Dialect Play Report\nNarrative Control Podcast: Language in Games\nGen Con Play Report: Dialect, Language Coming out of Isolation\nBackstory Podcast: Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyalioglu\nThe Gauntlet Podcast (video)\nJank Cast: Language in Games\nLegal Moves Podcast\nRewards, oh, the rewards. We believe in a simple-but-spectacular reward structure. Spoiler: it's linguistic play all the way down. On tap at Thorny Games are the following:\n    For the keen lover of play and language, we have a second offering. To mark the occasion of Dialect\u2019s debut, we're making a first print-run of our game Sign: a game about being understood.\nSign is an award-winning live-action game about the incredible story of Nicaraguan Sign Language: a language born in modern times from the hands of children. Pro-tip: if you are having a doubtful day about humanity, this story is worth knowing. Pass it on!\nSign has been played the world over and featured at many conventions around the US. It\u2019s also been the kind recipient of heaps of praise (Indie RPG Awards, Indie Groundbreaker awards, The Golden Cobra). Sign is freely available as a PDF right here from our website, and will always be free online. But a special game deserves a special touch, and for that, we\u2019ve got some amazing collaborators to make this game shine.\n  For this Kickstarter, we\u2019ve worked with the prodigiously-talented artist Miranda Meeks to illustrate the spark of emergent language. She's done a spectacular job. The game will be lovingly and gorgeously crafted as a boxed-set of tarot-sized cards, so you, too, can live out emergent language through play. We're so looking forward to sharing it with you!\nAny and all profits from Sign will be donated to the Nicaraguan Sign Language Project - the organization devoted to increasing resources for Sign Language education in Nicaragua.\n Dialect is a collaboration of some very passionate folks. \nThorny Games. An indie game studio out of San Francisco specializing in quirky and thoughtful games about language and cryptography - Thorny Games is the work of Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyalioglu. \nKathryn specializes in teaching robots about human language so we can all be friends some day (in other words, a computational linguist). She owns a theremin and plays it badly. Hakan helps computers keep secrets and crack codes (a genuine cryptographer). He really enjoys breakfast. In the past, they both did a lot of math.

We can't say enough wonderful things about our backdrop writers. They are consummate game designers, language creators, academics, and humans. Many of them are among the first players of Dialect, and we're especially excited to have so many different perspectives represented. Please stay in touch as we reveal more of our backdrops. \n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDialect is currently in the final stages of design refinement and we have a few upcoming playtests to tie it up. We're pretty thrilled with the current version but when it\u2019s your pride and joy, you do whatever you can to deliver the best game possible.\n\nWe have printers, distributors, shipping and additional writers lined up and ready to go. We plan to run a very transparent project with regular updates to backers at every stage.\n\nThis is our first Kickstarter, but we\u2019re not new to shipping products. Combined, we\u2019ve spent the better part of a decade making software for billions (yep, with a B) of people around the world in the beating artificial heart of Silicon Valley. Software and physical games aren\u2019t the same, so there are still things to learn, but the accountability is familiar.

Our goal is to make the awesome art and products that embrace the magical and the fantastic.\nWe love giving and receiving holiday cards, but best of all we love giving and receiving cards that reflect our special view of the universe. For several years we've made our own cards, by hand, but last year decided to do more. We Kickstarted a set of Christmas cards inspired by the cosmic horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and his Cthulhu Mythos.\nLast year's Lovecraft Christmas cards\nIt was a great success and we asked our backers what they wanted to see next and the response was \"The King in Yellow.\"\n\"The King in Yellow\" is from the story cycle by Robert W. Chambers published in a book of the same name in 1895. Four of the stories are united by the common thread of a mysterious French play, \"The King in Yellow,\" which induces madness and despair in those who read it. The idea of a book within a book that destroys the reader is one that Lovecraft embraced in writing the Cthulhu Mythos.\nChambers studied art in Paris and worked as a young illustrator in New York. He was a friend of and worked for the same magazine as William Gibson, and the Chambers Girl was an established motif before the Gibson Girl, which replaced it after he left illustration. Chambers was the most popular romance writer of his day. He wrote just a few weird fiction stories however he is only remembered today for his King in Yellow stories.\nLovecraft read Chamber's \"The King in Yellow\" in early 1927, and borrowed elements and writing conventions from it in writing the Mythos. Chambers himself was a confirmed borrower -- he took the names Carcosa, Hali and Hastur from Ambrose Bierce, in particular the story \"An Inhabitant of Carcosa. The King in Yellow still makes appearances in pop culture like HBO's True Detective series.\nThe Project\nWe have 4 cards planned. The card paintings are finished or will be by the time this posts. We have chosen a printer and costed materials. Each of the 5 by 7 inch cards will come with its own King in Yellow Holiday yellow envelope. Heather has been hard at work making the cards beautiful, she's been highly influenced by J. C. Leyendecker's advertising art of the 1930's and 40's and the cards have a nice classic illustration feel to them. They will be printed on a heavy 15pt (130 lb) velvet cover stock (same as last years cards). Just like last years cards they are meant to seem like \"normal\" Christmas cards when viewed across the room on the mantle. Its only when you get closer that their true nature becomes apparent.\nCard 1 The Day Has Come\n  Card 2 Twin Suns\n  Card 3 No Mask\n  Card 4 Behind the Moon\nLast Year's Cards\nFor those of you that missed last year's cards we are offering them again! This is a pack of 6 cards with a H. P. Lovecraft Cthulhu Mythos take. They are available coupled with either a single card, single pack or double pack. This year is about the King in Yellow so we won't be offering last year's cards without King in Yellow cards in tow.\nCthulhu Card 1 - The Snows are Right\n  Cthulhu Card 2 - Lovecraft Claus\n  Cthulhu Card 3 - The Yithmas Tree\n  Cthulhu Card 2 - Ho Ho Migo\n  Cthulhu Card 5 - The Innsmouth Carollers\n  Cthulhu card 6 - Dragon Wreath (bonus card)\n  Cthulhu cards envelope and seal\nWe need your help\nThis is where you come in. We need your help to offset printing costs. We would like to have enough funding to print cards for both the Kickstarter rewards and to stock them for next year. Timelines are tight but we have printers' assurances that printing will start right after the Kickstarter finishes and we can ship cards out in good time for you to send them for the holidays. We want to get them into your hands early in the first week of December (we\u2019re shooting for the 1st of December). Because of the tight timing we are only going to be offering physical cards to patrons in the United States. If you live in Europe or even Canada, we can offer you a downloadable PDF so you can print your own cards. We found that shipping outside of the USA would cost more than the cards themselves and that there was little guarantee that those cards would reach our supporters before Christmas.\nStretch Goals\nWe will be adding images in the next few days.\n$6,000 Golden envelopes\nAt $6,000 the yellow envelopes will be replaced by gold metallic envelopes to give your cards that extra bit of class. The envelopes are square backed and will have a self adhesive strip - so no licking.\n$8,000 The Yellow Sign Seal\nAt $8,000 we will add a 2 inch round embossed seal printed in metallic gold. We will be creating our own yellow sign and not the one Kevin Ross designed for Chaosium.\n$10,000 Printing on the envelopes\nJust like last year's Cthulhu cards we are going to have a printed design on the envelopes.\nWho are we?\nHeather paints the pictures, Daniel handles the rest. Daniel Gelon\nDaniel has over 25 years of art experience. He has done illustration, UX, graphic design, production and art direction. He has illustrated Magic cards, created logos for DC comics, art directed Dungeons and Dragons books and has worked on various video games. He is obsessed with machines made of paper. Heather Hudson\nHeather Hudson is a frequently digital fantasy artist with a traditional paint sensibility and a love of early-20th century popular culture. She\u2019s worked on tabletop and hobby games including Hasbro's \u201cMagic; the Gathering\u201d and Pagan Publishing's modern Mythos RPG \u201cDelta Green.\u201d Past Lovecraftian projects she's illustrated include \"Casino R'lyeh, the Lovecraft Poker Deck,\" and \"Mother Hydra's Mythos Rhymes.\" Currently she divides her time between commissioned illustration, personal projects and creating her own fantasy world somewhere between Oz and the Dreamlands. She has a fondness for illuminating monsters.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a tremendous amount from the similar campaign we ran last year and have adjusted our exceptions to the amount of work it takes and are much better prepared this time.

You'll know their work from other places such as Vampire: The Masquerade, the new Conan RPG, 7th Sea and many more (as well as the other Era Games in many cases, of course!).\nTogether, we've prepared no less than 18 expansions to the Consortium universe.\n(And don't worry, if we meet that many Stretch Goals, Ed has quite a few more ideas...!)\nEach brings a new dimension to gameplay: from psionic abilities to rules for trading cargo, from information on sub-factions within the Resistance to an explanation of what really happened to the Orion's crew in the Albiorix system and from memory sharing through cybernetics to the ability to construct a support system for growing forces.\nWe are also offering source books for each race, which will bring not only a history for that race and how they reached the Consortium, but new and unique equipment for each!\nWe're going to bring you more expansions as we achieve Stretch Goals - the initial funded goal will bring you 3 expansions, but the further we get, the more expansions you receive!\nWe have a few tiers of special note:\nClaymore Unit (\u00a325)\nFor those of you who want to complete your collection of Consortium books in Digital format, this is the right choice.\nIt offers the Core Rulebook and Rulebook Primer, along with all the unlocked expansions, all on Digital format!\nOperative (\u00a340)\nThis tier is ideal for people who want to start out in the Consortium universe.\nIt offers the Core Rulebook in Physical Format and every unlocked expansion in Digital Format.\nCompany Representative (\u00a380)\nThis tier offers the Hardback Core Rulebook, along with the chance to get your favourite 3 expansions in Paperback! You get the remaining ones in Digital format as well, of course.\nSenator (\u00a3160)\nFor people who love their RPGs to be in Hardbacks, there's nothing that will measure up to this!\nThis Tier gives you the first chance to get hold of the brand new Definitive Edition Rulebook along with all of the expansions in Digital Format. \nIt also gives you the chance to get the special set of Hardback expansion books alongside the Definitive Edition Rulebook!\n              If you want to take a look at the game, anyone can download the Quickstart! It\u2019s got everything you need to try out the game, including pregen characters, mechanics, and a starter adventure!\n  Era: The Consortium is a Hard Sci-Fi tabletop roleplaying game of adventure in space, where you can play as Human or Alien in a universe filled with possibilities.\nPLAY\n\n The Consortium is a huge, interplanetary society, comprising of multiple alien races who populate three star systems. The government of the Consortium is one where financial power gives one direct political power. As a result, the eight most powerful companies effectively rule over the Consortium, defending their monopolies and manipulating each other and the population in an unending struggle for power.\nThe Resistance has responded to this by attempting to overthrow the Big Eight. Although they are labelled terrorists, many fight for the good of the people.\nYou can join either faction as a member of any of 5 playable sentient species who inhabit the Consortium, choosing from huge numbers of backgrounds and decide where in the 500 years of history you wish to play. You might...\n...be one of the first colonists on a new world, far from Earth.\n...explore strange, new worlds.\n...make first contact with an alien race no-one has encountered before.\n...fight in a war where the very existence of the Consortium hangs in the balance.\n...join a Resistance movement and fight to save 14 billion lives from a plot by powerful individuals.\nFor example, you may begin as a terrified civilian, forced into combat, but you'll have abilities that will keep you alive and ahead of the Smertios Security soldiers who are pursuing you. \nYou'll have your chance to become a trusted member of the Resistance, or to join another company within the Consortium for protection... You won't be worrying about equipment - you'll be given whatever it is you need or desire to complete your mission.\nThis game gives you a universe of choices. Fight with a faction or choose your own path.\nThis is Era: The Consortium.\nWant to know more about the Backstory? Check out the website page!\n  Want to know what a session sounds like? Check out the \"Dice and Stuff\" podcast of their game as the Resistance's \"Claymore Unit\" here!\nReviews\n\"Era: The Consortium is a truly unique SF. The mechanics [\u2026] certainly work really well and complement a game that distinguishes itself through a rich history, the opportunity to play in different time periods and a multitude of genre and style options a GM can choose from.\"\n- RPG.Net\n\"It is literally the best sci-fi Role Playing Game I have ever seen and hence Era The Consortium is the game that I have been looking for.\"\n- RPG Knights Review, Game Running Review\n\u201cThere are a number of other books being launched for this and given the work that\u2019s gone into this, I can see them going far.\u201d\n- Million Word Man\n\u201cIt is powered by a solid rule set, and is elevated by entertaining setting vignettes and great artwork that really conveys the game. All provided in a great looking PDF.\u201d\n- Wild Musings\n\"Reading over this game has made me want to start GMing again!\"\nTalking About Games did a detailed review of v0.7 of The Fifth Race expansion, offered with this Kickstarter. It includes comments on everything that you can find inside:\n \"The only game I have ever played that got grapple rules right - they were simple and easy to follow.\"\n\"An absolute beginner to tabletop games, I picked up the rules quickly and was having fun within half an hour on my first session!\"\n\"I find one of the strongest points of your game to be the massive amount of story and options for your character to take when customising them.\"\nPodcasts\nEd talks to longtime fans and podcasters Dice and Stuff about Era: The Consortium and other games!\nEd talks about Era: The Consortium, Shades of Vengeance and games in general with Willem from Ice Cream for Everyone: Part 1, Part 2\n              The Era d10 ruleset is designed to allow you to experience this universe in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible without being misrepresentative. By choosing your skills carefully, your character can dominate in any of 5 forms of combat, talk their way out of any situation or protect their teammates from harm.\nThe rules could be described as \"A Success-counting dice pool system where you roll Attribute + Skill in d10s and the difficulty of the task determines which numbers count as Successes.\"\nIn case that was a bit too brief or jargony, here's a bit more detail:\nThe system is based around multiple dice - the more skilled you are, the more dice you have - and a variable goal based on activity difficulty.\nUsing an Attribute and Skill system, which each define their own areas of influence, you roll your dice depending on what you're attempting - whether Dexterity + Engineering for a precision piece of work, Intelligence + Engineering for a more theoretical problem or Luck + Engineering for a complete long shot, you'll be able to adapt to your circumstances and focus on your strengths.\nAlthough you roll more dice the more skilled you are, the number you are attempting to reach varies depending on the difficulty of the action - if shooting someone in clear conditions, the GM would ask for a 7. If someone was laying a mine, more likely a 6. Firing over your shoulder at someone 30 metres away, while crouching behind a low wall would definitely be a 10!\nRules-in-Action Videos\nYou can download a character sheet from our website.\nCharacter Creation - In this video, I create a Smertios Security Guard called John Smith to give you an idea of how it works!\nGrapple Rules - In this video, John Smith faces off against the famous Ximian Worker Styxtirian in a grapple to the death!\nRanged Combat Rules - In this video, John Smith goes up against drunken sniper Alex Gyter and proves that not every shot he fires is lethal!\nPersuasion Rules - In this video, John Smith faces his greatest challenge yet, a persuasion attempt from Steve Adams, the Voice of the Resistance!\n    Each of these Expansions bring a new dimension to gameplay for Era: The Consortium - we feel it is important for an expansion to truly add something new and different to a session!\nPLAY\n\nWhile some bring new rules, others bring unique equipment or new portions of history.\n  (Requires Rulebook Primer or Core Rulebook to play)\nThe destruction of the Orion brought with it the revelation that, for centuries, Hayden Bank had been using operatives who were given advanced technology and training to manipulate the Consortium. Whatever means are required, from blackmail to data theft, from clandestine negotiation to planting evidence, are placed in the hands of the Shades.\nPLAY\n\nThe Secret War brings players the opportunity to take on the mantle of a Shade or, on the Resistance side, a Phantom (operatives trained to defeat Shades) in addition to their other roles. Gain access to new implants, weapons and ships and fulfil your own mission alongside your party!\n  (Requires Rulebook Primer or Core Rulebook to play)\nThe arrival of a new species in the Consortium is met with typical brutality by Smertios Security; they are shot down on Lugus. First Contact proceeds amazingly well, under the circumstances. Shortly afterwards, a group of convicts on Sirona make a discovery under the ice which will change the Consortium for ever...\nPLAY\n\nThe Fifth Race brings not only the Pliangrathilon as a playable race, but a new range of equipment, weapons and armour to the players, almost 50% as much again as was in the Core Rulebook! It also provides rules for weapon and armour enhancement through crafting.\n  (Requires Rulebook Primer or Core Rulebook to play)\nNeither the Consortium nor the Resistance can operate without information. Rapier Unit is the central point where all of that information is processed, but it also carries out its own missions.\nPLAY\n\nRapier offers a new approach to hacking in Era: The Consortium. Within a computer's virtual environment, an experienced hacker can be as good at Combat as any of their soldier teammates! This expansion includes the rules for \"immersive hacking\", examples of the programs found within the systems and multiple programs that can be used to defeat them!\n  (Requires Rulebook Primer or Core Rulebook to play)\nThe Consortium faces a cataclysm, one which cannot be prevented in this time. You have been trained from birth for a singular mission - to travel back to the beginning of the Consortium and reshape it.\nPLAY\n\nThe newly re-edited Campaign includes a brand new prologue, pre-made characters and currently 30 sessions, along with a list of equipment, armour and weapons to help you on your mission.\nFor The Future!\n  (Requires Rulebook Primer or Core Rulebook to play)\n\"I will never forgive myself for my role in these events.\" - Gueya, CEO of Gaia Adaptation and Adjustment.\nTheft of an experimental compound from the Gaia Adaptation and Adjustment laboratories on Belisama results in both the Resistance and the Consortium setting up their own test facilities... this accidental discovery provides Consortium races with Psionic powers!\nPLAY\n\nA New Dawn offers players the chance to gain psionic abilities such as mind control, memory draining, telepathic linking and mind lash! It contains all the relevant rules for this, along with describing the inevitable decline into madness characters with these abilities undergo.\n  (Requires Rulebook Primer or Core Rulebook to play)\nRevival gives you the chance to bring Survival Horror rules into Era: The Consortium, a crossover we've been asked for quite a few times since Era: Survival came out!\nPLAY\n\nRevival's campaign is an intricately-woven set of mysteries in the best traditions of the Survival Horror genre, with brand new weapons and equipment not seen in the Core Rulebook, along with detailed maps of every level of the mining vessel Sadoko!\nAnd many more under construction!\n                      We're offering our other games to anyone who wishes to pick them up!\n          40% Creation of the Expansions!\nEvery penny that isn't used for getting the rewards to you will be used for development of the expansions! This will include artwork, writing, layout, editing, proofreading... everything we need to get the expansions made, short of printing (see below!)\n10% Kickstarter Fees\nKickstarter takes its usual 8-10% cut. We'll transfer anything that doesn't get taken for that straight into creation!\n50% Printing and Shipping\nExperience has taught us that the majority of the costs relating to any Kickstarter are getting the rewards out to you guys, safely and in a timely manner. We've had a fair bit of experience now (this is actually our company's 15th Kickstarter!), so we're confident we'll be able to fulfil in a way you'll be satisfied.\n  Ed Jowett is the creator, project manager and insomniac behind Era: The Consortium. He's overseeing all of the expansions, along with writing the majority of them himself. He loves the Consortium universe and says he's never going to let it stop growing!\nSteffie de Vaan has been working on a few of the expansions, and has taken the lead writing role on the Resistance Handbook, working with Ed. Steffie's previous experience in the RPG industry is extensive, including Vampire: the Masquerade, 7th Sea and Conan!\nSally Christensen has lent her extensive experience in editing (gathered from all kinds of projects, not the least of which are 7th Sea and Conan!) to the expansions, making sure that they come out at the top-notch level of quality you guys have come to expect!\nDarren Watts has joined the team to work on the exploration aspect of Era: The Consortium, taking the lead post on the New Worlds expansion. His previous experience is extensive, including much of the Hero Games output and Champions!\nJohnathan Lewis was the co-writer on Era: The Consortium and the book wouldn't have looked the same without his input. He's taken the lead story writing role for Revival, along with comics and various bits of writing on all of the expansions!\nAmy Allworden has been a staff writer for Shades of Vengeance since Era: The Consortium's development started. You might know her as The Oracle, or as the writer for the stories in Era: Lyres, but anything you've read has passed in front of her eyes at some point. We're pleased to welcome her back!\nJennifer Martin has been working with us since Era: The Consortium started. She wrote some of the more memorable stories in the Core Rulebook, and we are delighted to invite her back to add her talent to the expansions we have ahead of us!\nSophia Michailidou is an experienced artist whose style has shaped the artwork of Era: The Consortium since the Rulebook Primer! She's returned to the team to do work on all of the expansions!\nVictor Adame Minguez has lent his amazing talent to Era: The Consortium's Core Rulebook. He's brought the universe to life in a way that we believe will captivate your imagination as much as it does ours!\nJohnathan Chong is an extremely talented artist who's joined the Era: The Consortium team to help illustrate many of the expansions. From avatars inside a computer to mental powers to alien artifacts to pirates boarding ships, Johnathan has never failed to impress!\nCalyie Martin is the last line of defence between Ed's predictive text and your eyes. The proofreader extraordinaire has been reading over the Era books for some time, providing suggestions and catching all the things Ed missed!\nLeo Cosh is the Sound Designer behind much of what you hear in the audio content on this Kickstarter. He's a self-confessed \"cyberpunk guy\", and so he and Ed are working on an Expansion focusing on that aspect of Era: The Consortium!\nFreddie Rawlins has been working with Ed as a playtest GM on Era: The Consortium for some time. They are now working together on the Predictive Genetics Expansion, which will allow you to create your own alien races!\nGraeme Penman has recently taken over responsibility for writing campaigns in our new format, and is working with Ed on the Time Travel Campaign!\nJonas Spokas is the lead artist on Revival. Working with him on bringing the Survival Horror aspect of Era: The Consortium to life has been great fun!\nMartin Popovski has worked with us on several Kickstarters now, doing the video editing for our main videos (at the top!). He's done the same here, and we think it came out great!\n  Every unlocked book is given to all backers in Digital Format!\n                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Shades of Vengeance's 13th crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, including multiple Core Rulebooks.\n\nWhile we haven't been mistake-free, we've always delivered on or ahead of time (except for Lyres where a delay was agreed with Backers to give them more content!). Each successive Kickstarter builds on the lessons learned from the previous, and we learn fast. At this point we're confident in our ability to deliver the rewards we're committing to and to keep you informed if there are any delays.\n\nThe biggest individual challenge for this Kickstarter is managing a team of artists and writers from all over the world. We all live in different timezones, so coordinating is a huge logistical challenge. Although the initial books are mostly finalised, we have a lot more work to do on many of the further expansions.

Want an RPG system that new players can learn in a couple minutes?  Then check out Inspiration!\n\nInspiration is a fantasy deck building tabletop RPG.  It combines the strategic fun of building a deck and uses it as the core character building mechanic. This isn't a CCG or TCG; all the cards needed to play are in this package.  This download comes with the core rules, all 8 core classes, and all 500 power cards for the classes.  It also comes with weapons, magic items, and pre-made monsters.\n\nThis is the complete package of a tabletop RPG; the only thing you'll need is a set of standard RPG dice, grid paper for battles, and optional miniatures for each character.\n\nThis system is meant to be simple enough that anyone could learn to play, making it a great introduction RPG.  The deck-building system also adds a layer of strategy for veteran RPG players!  The system for roleplaying uses part of the D20 mechanic, with some major simplifications/alterations, making the game accessible for new players.\nThis fundraiser is an attempt do a lot of things!  I want to see if there's enough interest in the game for me to expand it to make more classes, spread awareness of the game, and spread a lot of fun to a lot of people!  I'd also like to hire an artist(s) someday to add color drawings to each power card.\nIf you're interested in a one on one strategic TCG, check out my other project, Extraction!\nUpdate 1:\nI've been designing some battle maps (1 inch square maps to use with miniatures) that I think will work well for Inspiration fight scenes as well as highly usable for any other Tabletop RPGs you might play. They make great maps for DnD and Pathfinder as well!\nBy the time this kickstarter ends, I should have 12 Full Color battle maps.\nThey'll come with the core Inspiration set that you'll get with backing!\nUpdate 2:\nDue to the awesome interest shown here on Kickstarter, I'm looking into ways to get hard copies of Inspiration published.

Thanks to all my backers for your support, it means so much to me!\nWeird Detective is the game of investigative roleplaying in a modern and near future world of horror, weird events, and cosmic terrors!\nBy funding this project you will allow the completion of Weird Detective's Corebook, as well as three adventure supplements and four rules expansions!\nRules Easy Roleplaying \nWeird Detective operates using a simple dice mechanic to quickly determine outcomes and let you stay focused on the roleplaying. When attempting to complete a difficult action the player rolls a die for every point in the relevant attribute they have and total the successes they roll. The GM rolls two difficulty die and subtracts a success for every challenge he rolls. If there is still one success left over when everything is tallied, the character succeeds!\nThe game uses good ole d6s, though optional print and stick graphics for your dice are included with the PDF!\nIn-Depth Character Creation\nEvery PC has a basic statline of attributes which represent their physical, mental, and social capabilities, along with possible skills they can use to add to boost their attributes and make success easier. But along with these basic stats every PC has a deeper personality, a reason and drive for being a detective, along with the dramatic flaws and sources of difficulty which make them interesting heroes.\nWhen you create a character in Weird Detective you are given the choice of selecting or randomly deciding your character's Reason for Adventuring, Flaw, and Foundations of Sanity. These things don't just provide flavor to your character sheet, but are integrated into gameplay. Every session a GM will decide to bring one or more of the characters' flaws to the forefront of the story to provide dramatic complications, and can use your reason for being a detective to compel your character to strongly consider actions in line with who they are, without concern for what's best from their player's point of view.\nWhat Will You Investigate?\nWhile Weird Detectives fast and easy to learn rules make it worth playing all on their own, the real strength of this game is its modern, weird-horror setting that allows players to circle the globe uncovering and challenging strange monstrosities, devilish sorcerers, and ruthless murderers. The Weird Detective Corebook contains over 100 pages of world background material covering eight different chapters of blood thirsty cults, rotting undead creatures, unknowable cosmic entities, and more!\nSample of Page Design\nEach page of Weird Detective is thoughtfully inscribed with over two dozen versions of the Elder Sign to ensure no evil leaks off the page and into your gaming group!\nEpic Weird Horror Adventure Add-Ons!\nThree adventure supplements are offered along with the Corebook in this project, all of which can be had in the Inspector Level or higher. These are no small, one session mysteries, but large, multipart adventures, promising many, many hours of sleuthing for your group!\nThe mysterious death of occultist and eccentric Ella Norris in her Boston home leads a group of courageous investigators into an unwinding mystery of murder, disappearances, and black magic. Set across the coast of Massachusetts, players will be collect clues and hunt criminals across six different locations, each one providing them a challenging mystery and dangerous villain who must be stopped before they can move on step closer to putting a permanent end to the Black Elm Witch Ring.\nSupposed \"vampire clubs\" exist in many large cities across the world, a place where the young, eccentric, and macabre-obsessed can engage in their strange fantasies among people like them. But when a series of deaths are linked back a shadowy Parisian figure rumored to be centuries old, detectives will uncover a world spanning plot run by an elite group claiming to be the living dead, with a blood line running straight back to one of the most powerful, legendary vampires in all of Europe.\nWhen the well known, and famously crazed, billionaire Roger Astonmeyer held a press conference to announce he had uncovered evidence of a secret and ancient land hidden in the Himalayan Mountains he was roundly mocked by all but the most credulous conspiracy theorists. But when he offered a hand picked team of scientists and field researchers a small fortune to join his expedition, his outlandish claims at least earned the legitimate curiosity of the academic world. Join the famed Astonmeyer Expedition as a world renowned researcher, in search of the fabled Plateau of Leng, where time is said to have stood still for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years... though beware unknown dangers beyond human comprehension which are also said to reside there by long-ago recorded fables.\nWeird Horror Game Expansions!\nWhile the rules contained within the Weird Detective Corebook are all that you need to run a complete game, four expansions are also available which will provide option in-depth rules which GMs may choose to add to their games if they wish, along with additional background material, villains, NPCs, occult groups, alien races, and more!\nTerrible Gods\nTwisted rites, ageless sorcerers, blood curdling acts of depravity all in the name of...Terrible Gods! The Terrible Gods supplement comes with expanded combat and wound rules, as well as alternate options for handling larger fights between many adversaries. The background section covers over 20 different cult organizations and strange cosmic gods that can be used to oppose your players, along with adventure seeds with each to help inspire your writing.\nIn the Grave\nMany have dreamed over the ages of cheating death and become master over mortality... and now some have! In the Grave expands rules for magic, including specific spells and rituals that can be used by villains, and even rules for allowing the PCs to become magic users themselves. The expanded background adds depth to necromantic villains such as vampires, necromancers, and other related crypt horrors.\nFrom the Stars\nLook up at the night sky and behold, more horrors than mankind can know. Adding new rules for desires, motivations, and meta-play between PCs, From the Stars provides new opportunities for character depth and inter-player drama. The background covers dozens of alien races, plots, government conspiracies, infiltrations and more!\nSecrets of the Ancients\nFormerly lost to the records of man, the sacred and occult knowledge of long dead civilizations return in... Secrets of the Ancients! Expanding rules for social interactions, battles of status, and resolving disagreements realistically, Secrets of the Ancients also provides new plotlines and adventure seeds for archeological related mysteries.\nOf course we all know that summoning Gods, learning ancient secrets, and meddling in forces you cannot comprehend never actually ends well. That's why there's Cthulhu Catastrophes, a quick-start, one session game where you take on the role of a cultist, sorcerer, or foolhardy hero and watch as minds are shattered, bodies devoured, and terror reigns supreme.\nCthulhu Catastrophes is a booklet containing all the rules and print out sheets you need to run this short form RPG.\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n STRETCH GOALS", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no special risks or challenges involved in this project.

One Mission.\nDracula is not a novel. It's the censored version of Bram Stoker's after-action report of the failed British Intelligence attempt to recruit a vampire in 1894. Kenneth Hite has restored the deleted sections, inserting annotations and clues left by three generations of MI6 analysts. This is Dracula Unredacted.\nFollow those clues to The Director\u2019s Handbook, containing hundreds of encounters: shady NPCs, dangerous locations, conspiratorial nodes, and mysterious objects. Together they comprise The Dracula Dossier -- an epic improvised, collaborative campaign for Night\u2019s Black Agents, our award-winning vampire spy thriller RPG.\nThe mission: Hunt and kill Dracula now, once and for all, before Britain falls to him forever.\n\"For spending an evening of suspense and glimpses from the grave, today the instrument of choice is Kenneth Hite\u2019s The Dracula Dossier.\"\n                                                          -- Dracula scholar Hans C. de Roos\nThe wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the demon shall cry to his fellow; Lilith also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. -- Isaiah 34:14, a prophecy concerning Edom.\nIn 1893, a visionary spymaster in the British Naval Intelligence Department launched a plan to recruit the perfect asset: a vampire.\nOperation Edom began promisingly. The NID made contact with Count Dracula, deep in Transylvania. A meet was set and made. A safe house and a headquarters in England were prepared.Then it all went wrong.\nDracula betrayed his minder and double-crossed NID. Outsiders \u2013 possibly with their own ties to foreign espionage -- became involved. British intelligence ordered a sanction: They barred Dracula from England, and hunted him down on his home earth, where \u2013 during the great eruption and earthquake of 31 August 1894 \u2013 they terminated him, with extreme prejudice and two knives.\nOr so they thought.\nDracula lives. Now it\u2019s up to you to finish the job.\nDracula Unredacted: We fill in the blanks in Bram Stoker\u2019s original novel, reveal Edom\u2019s sources and methods, and tell the true story! Dracula Unredacted brings you all the weirdness that Stoker was forced to conceal from the public: mysterious volcanoes, missing (yet vitally important) characters, Dracula\u2019s Guest, details on the Count\u2019s Brides and servants, and more. We\u2019ll also include marginal annotations from three generations of intelligence analysts that describe Edom\u2019s three subsequent espionage operations involving Dracula. \nBut Dracula Unredacted is more than an entertaining new take on a great novel\u2014it\u2019s the biggest, most in-depth player handout in the history of gaming. We\u2019ve changed enough of the plot so that even veteran Dracula fans will find surprising new information. And even if your players don\u2019t read the whole thing, they already know the outline of the story, making it easy to introduce at your game table.\nHere\u2019s how it works: The characters (themselves highly trained spies, seasoned criminals, and other shady freelance operatives) come into possession of MI6\u2019s annotated, unredacted edition of Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula at the start of the campaign. They choose which leads to follow, which operations to infiltrate, and which horrors to face. No matter where they choose to go, the Director is one step ahead and ready to throw new challenges and terrors at them\u2014thanks to the other book in this project, the Director\u2019s Handbook.\nThe Director\u2019s Handbook: This turns Dracula Unredacted into a full campaign for Night\u2019s Black Agents, based on the revolutionary Armitage Files improvised campaign for Trail of Cthulhu. Inside you\u2019ll find hundreds of characters, locations, items, and conspiratorial nodes, any of which might be a potential asset for the player characters\u2014or part of Edom\u2019s century-long conspiracy, or even a minion of the immortal Dracula.\nThe book contains full write-ups of the Edom network, Dracula, the original band of vampire hunters who faced him in 1893, and their present-day descendants. It\u2019s got plot threads and mysteries for your players to investigate, and monsters for them to slay.\nTake your players on the greatest vampire hunt in history\u2014more than a hundred years in the making.

All these maps and plans will go into the Director\u2019s Handbook.\n13. CAMPAIGN FRAME: UNTO THE FOURTH\nYou want an epic? You\u2019ve got it! In this appendix to the bulging Director\u2019s Handbook, we\u2019ll provide rules, advice and notes on running a generational campaign. Start in 1894 playing one of the original hunters, or create your own hero who got redacted out of the novel. Continue to 1940, and take part in the SOE raid in Romania! Find (or become!) the mole in \u201977, and watch Edom fall to madness and obsession behind the War on Terror. Play those four generations of Edom analysts and spies \u2013 then finish what you started, all those years ago.\n14. SCENARIO: BLOOD CODA (RUTH TILLMAN)\nFor this goal, we\u2019ll bring in one of our co-conspirators at Pelgrane to write an adventure that explores another part of the Dracula Dossier. Contributor to the Ennie-winning website The Illuminerdy and eldritch enthusiast, Ruth Tillman (TimeWatch) presents Blood Coda. In 1971, the director of the Royal Opera House in London announces a coup. He has smuggled the Ballet Bra\u0219ov through the Iron Curtain and engaged them to perform a new work, \"Strigoii.\" The London art scene buzzes with excitement over rumors of the dancers' superhuman strength and grace and of the edginess of their choreographer's work. Your agents hear a darker story of stability-shattering performances and strange disappearances. The company performs before Her Majesty in one week's time. What will you do?\n15. ENCOUNTER: MIDDLE EAST\nThis goal expands the scope of the Dracula Dossier east o\u2019Suez \u2013 to Afghanistan, to Turkey, to Iraq and other places where Edom might dispatch their vampire assassins \u2013 and where your agents might unearth vital clues needed to bring down Dracula. These new locations and nodes \u2013 including Sayeret Aluka, the Mossad\u2019s vampire hunters -- will be added to the Director\u2019s Handbook.\n16. UNREDACTION: COTFORD\nVan Helsing and his fellow hunters weren\u2019t the only people on Dracula\u2019s trail \u2013 according to Stoker\u2019s Notes, Scotland Yard\u2019s Inspector Cotford tackled the mystery from another angle. Before his grisly and untimely death, he discovered\u2026 well, it\u2019s all in his police notebook. And we\u2019ll add it to the Unredacted Dracula.\n17. ENCOUNTER: IRELAND\nBram Stoker's brother George was one of the architects of Operation Edom. Bram himself drew on Irish myths - and, perhaps, the truths behind those myths - when assembling the Dossier. The British secret state's entanglement with Ireland goes back long before the Troubles, long before 1916. Join us as we unearth the secrets of Stoker's home town.\n18. SCENARIO: THE SLAYER ELITE (JOHN ADAMUS)\nFor this goal, we\u2019ll bring in another writer to craft a second tale of Edom\u2019s duplicity and Dracula\u2019s depravity. Again, this adventure won\u2019t be part of either the Unredacted Dracula or the accompanying Director\u2019s Handbook \u2013 it\u2019ll be a standalone PDF. John Adamus, editor of many Ennie-winning products and contributor to Night's Black Agents and Double Tap, presents THE SLAYER ELITE: In 1980 a team of operatives is convened with the single purpose of eliminating an off-the-books MI6 action, Operation Edom. The mastermind behind this has his own motives, and the assignment looks cut-and-dry from the outset, but the ramifications big and small are felt decades later.\n19. UNREDACTION: KATE REED\nKate Reed was Mina Murray\u2019s best friend and closest confidante. She was also a plucky young journalist, and when she started investigating the mysterious Count de Ville, she soon realized she\u2019d discovered the story of a lifetime - a very short lifetime. With this stretch goal, we add Kate Reed\u2019s diaries and newspaper articles to the Unredacted Dracula.\n20. ENCOUNTER: CHINA\nContinuing our trek around the globe, we expand the conspiracy into the Far East. From Chinese Triads muscling in on the heroin trade through Romania, to Chinese MSS agents on the prowl, to the secrets of earth power and Dracula\u2019s jin-gui allies, to Edom operations in Hong Kong, this addition to the Director\u2019s Handbook adds more international peril to your campaign!\n21. PRODUCTION: FULL COLOUR DIRECTOR'S HANDBOOK\nExperience the Director's Handbook in full technicolour glory, with a full palette of rich crimsons and reds. If we hit this stretch goal, we'll upgrade the Director's Handbook to a full color book at no extra charge.\n22. CAMPAIGN FRAME: A TIME OF COFFINS\nThis stretch goal adapts the Dracula Dossier for TimeWatch, the upcoming roleplaying game of time travel and temporal investigation. In TimeWatch you play an elite agent from the past or future whose job is tracking down and eliminating chronal sabotage. Designer Kevin Kulp contributes A Time of Coffins, where you're more than a little surprised to learn that in the future you will go up against Dracula's forces... and lose badly. Now you must risk paradox and face down your future vampiric self, or risk Dracula gaining access to TimeWatch technology. Because if you think a master vampire is bad, just imagine one who can time travel.\n23. ENCOUNTER: OCCULT SECRETS\nBram Stoker attended meetings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Van Helsing consulted the restricted archives in the British Library. The Nazi occult apparat known as the Ahnenerbe delved into the secrets of blood magic and Romanian archaeology alike. Unlock this stretch goal, and we open up the Scholomance where Dracula learned sorcery from the Devil himself, reveal more secrets from Dracula\u2019s grimoire Le Dragon Noir, and add occult conspiracy nodes and eldritch encounters to the Director\u2019s Handbook!\n24. CAPSTONE: ZALMOXIS\nOlder than Dracula, older than history, there is Zalmoxis, the Undying Dead One. The ancient Getae believed that he held the secrets of immortality, and that he dwelt in a vast underground labyrinth beneath the Carpathian mountains. To die was to join Zalmoxis. Now, Dracula\u2019s minions have unearthed the entrance to the labyrinth. Can you bring down Dracula before Zalmoxis rises? Hit this goal, and we\u2019ll add the Zalmoxis capstone as an optional finale in the Director\u2019s Handbook.\n25. MORE EBOOKS\nWe'll compile ePub and Mobi versions of Dracula Unredacted & the Director's Handbook, perfect for the burned spy on the go who needs to travel light. All backers at ASSET level or higher get access to these ebooks when they're done.\n26. ENCOUNTER: LILITH\nLilith was Dracula\u2019s first Bride \u2013 or perhaps he was her consort. Hit this stretch goal, and we\u2019ll add the Queen of the Vampires into the mix \u2013 and into the Director\u2019s Handbook. And you thought Dracula was tough?\n27. SCENARIO: STEPHANIE BRYANT\nNext up, a scenario from the wonderful Stephanie Bryant - Day of the Wehrwolf! In 1981 an unkillable terrorist plans an unstoppable attack somewhere in Munich. As agents of Edom, you must kill the unkillable and stop the unstoppable -- without revealing the truth about Edom or the secret world it patrols.\nStephanie is a writer and blogger living in Las Vegas, Nevada. She is best known for Handknit Heroes, a superhero comic book for knitters. Most recently, she has contributed to Timewatch's Book of Changing Years as well as a couple of games scheduled to release in 2015. \n28. CAMPAIGN FRAME: DRAMASYSTEM\nIn PERVENIET CALIX, the main cast are the Dukes of Edom, tasked with the impossible -- harness a medieval vampire for the 21st century's shadow wars. Now rogue agents -- and your fellow Dukes -- are making the impossible even worse.\nThis DramaSystem Series Pitch will be a separate PDF. It can be played as a standalone game, or in between sessions of your Dracula Dossier campaign, setting your Night's Black Agents player-character heroes as the GM's screw-tighteners par excellence.\nThe Series Pitch will be written by Ryan Macklin, a man about town when it comes to games. He's worked on several award-winning games - including Fate Core System, The Dresden Files, and Mythender - and has worked with numerous game companies. Ryan loves his wife and two cats, bourbon, cigars, and spouting random gaming and production thoughts on his blog at RyanMacklin.com.\n29. MUSIC - JAMES SEMPLE THEME\nWe\u2019ll work with award-winning composer James Semple and his team of musical geniuses to create a theme tunes for the different eras of the Dracula Dossier. James already wrote Dust and Mirrors, the Night\u2019s Black Agents soundtrack, along with the Eternal Lies soundtrack suite, so you know the sort of thrills that will fill your ears when we hit this stretch goal.\n30. ENCOUNTER: MORE MONSTERS!\nWhat\u2019s that? You really enjoy putting your agents through hell? You want more werewolves, ghosts, vampire bats and other meaner things that serve Count Dracula? You want Hanns Heinz Ewers\u2019 alluring Mandrake Woman, right? And of course, you want us to explain why Stoker\u2019s notes on \u2018electro-biology\u2019 are missing from his notebook. We\u2019ll do all that and more! If we unlock this stretch goal, F. Wesley Schneider will take the lead on stuffing yet more monsters into the Director\u2019s Handbook.\nEditor-in-chief at Paizo Inc. and co-creator of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, F. Wesley Schneider is the architect behind many of the Pathfinder RPG\u2019s creepier offerings, such as the award-winning Carrion Crown Adventure Path and the Book of the Damned series. You can find more from Wes on Twitter at @FWesSchneider and on Tumblr at WesSchneider.\n31. SCENARIO: DENNIS DETWILLER\nNext up, a scenario from the master of madness himself, Dennis Detwiller - FOUR DAYS OF THE BAT! In 1989, a mysterious man defects with a briefcase full of classified Romanian documents, and after turning himself in to a secret Berlin checkpoint, Listening Station ED13 \u2026 the station is razed, a bloody shambles. As agents of Edom, you must bring in the sole survivor of ED13, a mild-mannered clerk who has proven himself far beyond his clearance, before the unknown force which destroyed his colleagues finishes the job.\n32. PRODUCTION: HAWKINS PAPERS PDF\nThe original 1894 Operation Edom brief, key memos, secret military maps of Transylvania, pr\u00e9cis of reports from Balkan battlefronts and German academies alike, surveillance photographs, and plans for the next century's battle for control of the Un-Dead -- these are the Hawkins Papers. Hidden away for 120 years, once they're unlocked, you have eyes-only access to them! If we unlock this stretch goal, every backer gets the evocative, enigmatic -- dare I say revelatory? -- Hawkins Papers in PDF when we unlock a certain safe in Exeter ...\n33. CAMPAIGN FRAME: THE TRAIL OF DRACTHULHU\nYou didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have Kenneth Hite write tens of thousands of words on a project and never mention Cthulhu, did you? Lovecraft himself showed us the way here, with his cryptic \u201cBaron Ferenczy\u201d in The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward. With this goal, we\u2019ll add another campaign frame to the Director\u2019s Handbook appendix, setting you up to run the Dracula Dossier as a Trail of Cthulhu campaign \u2013 or to add the horrors of the Mythos to the great vampire hunt.\n34. ENCOUNTER: ELIZABETH BATHORY\nHungary\u2019s most famous vampire, the blood-bathing sorceress Elizabeth Bathory, gets added to the Director\u2019s Handbook. Is she another of Dracula\u2019s Brides, or a rival with her own faction, who your players can recruit as a ghastly ally against the Count? Find out when we hit this goal!\n35. CAPSTONE: TOMB OF DRACULA\nFor this stretch goal, we\u2019ll add another optional campaign-ending capstone to the Director\u2019s Handbook. Do what the first hunters failed to do \u2013 track down Dracula\u2019s very last hiding place, his ultimate box of earth, and drive a stake through his heart! The final confrontation with the vampire ends here at the Tomb of Dracula!\n36. PRODUCTION: COLOURED ANNOTATIONS\nWith this big production upgrade, we\u2019ll print the annotations in the Unredacted Dracula in colored ink, just like the Varo edition of The Case for the UFO that inspired this whole crazy project.Easier to read by tactical Maglite while on the run from an Edom kill squad!\n37. SCENARIO: STOKER: FIRST BLOOD\nIn Bill White's STOKER: FIRST BLOOD, you play George Stoker, Armin Vambery, and other servants of the Crown on the front lines of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. War is hell, and in this war, George Stoker has found hell's servants -- the Un-Dead. Your mission is simple: escape, warning, and \u2026 surgical examination? Discover the bloody roots of Edom in the war torn Balkans.\n38. CAMPAIGN FRAME: THE ESOTERROR OF DRACULA\nWith this stretch goal, the Dracula Dossier crosses over with the award-winning The Esoterrorists roleplaying game. In The Esoterrorists, a cabal of sinister would-be sorcerers and visionaries try to undermine humanity\u2019s collective sanity in order to bring the forces of the Outer Black into our reality. If we come to believe in the monsters, they really can hurt us. A century ago, Dracula was a work of fiction. Now, through the machinations of Edom, he\u2019s becoming real. Legendary designer Robin D Laws comes on board to reveal the Esoterrorists of Edom conjuring the Dracula tulpa from the Outer Black!\n39. ENCOUNTER: SECRETS OF THE SECURITATE\nWhat really happened in the Pitesti Prison mind-control experiments? What triggered Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s vendetta against the Romanian branch of Radio Free Europe? What was the Radu weapon? Who killed the University of Chicago magic expert Ioan Culianu? This stretch goal cracks open the Romanian secret police\u2019s darkest secrets and adds them to the Director\u2019s Handbook.\n40. SCENARIO: THE CARMILLA SANCTION\nKenneth Hite presents THE CARMILLA SANCTION, another case file taken from the vaults of Operation Edom. In 1955, as British occupation of Austria comes to an end, your team arrives in the remote province of Styria with a simple mission: terminate the Countess Carmilla Karnstein. If you can find her. If she hasn't already made powerful friends. If that's really your mission...\n41. ART: NPC ILLUSTRATIONS \n Many of the key character of the Dracula Dossier will be illustrated no matter what, but if we hit this goal, we\u2019ll illustrate every single NPC in the book. That\u2019s more than a hundred portraits, now in full colour!\n42. CAMPAIGN FRAME: THEY SAVED HITLER\u2019S BLOOD!\nThat noise you hear may be Bram Stoker rolling in his grave, but never mind that now \u2013 we\u2019ve got to stop Nazi cultists in Argentina from using Hitler\u2019s blood to resurrect him as a vampire! Join us in this appendix to the Director\u2019s Handbook as we pulp it up in full-blown airport thriller style!\n43. ENCOUNTER: TURKEY\nVampires on the Orient Express? Intrigue and murder on the streets of Istanbul? Terror and treachery in the catacombs under Tokat castle? All this and more awaits your agents as we follow Dracula\u2019s battles against the Turks and add yet more people, locations, and nodes to the Director\u2019s Handbook.\n44. PRODUCTION: NPC DECK OF CARDS\nDeal yourself into danger with the DRACULA DOSSIER Deck! NPCs, Nodes, Locations, Objects, and Opponents get cards, illustrated as lushly as our stretch goals will reach. Pass them out as handouts, pin them to the Adversary Map! Spread them like tarots, shuffle up random encounters, deal out a full Conspyramid, or draw for wandering Dukes -- the DRACULA DOSSIER Deck adds still more improvisation to your game!\n45. ENCOUNTER: LOOKING GLASS BUCHAREST\nHit this stretch goal, and we\u2019ll write up Bucharest using the same expanded format we used for Marseilles in the Night\u2019s Black Agents rulebook \u2013 with a full faction work-up, detailed maps, scenario hooks, and everything you need to run dozens of ops in the Paris of the Balkans!\n46. THE MOLDAVIAN CANDIDATE\nThe title says it all. There is a sleeper in Edom, turned by Dracula, and an important life on the line. Can the PCs find the sleeper agent before the activation protocol? Written by Emma Marlow (Mythos Expeditions, TimeWatch).\n47. THE THRILL OF DRACULA\nIn THE THRILL OF DRACULA, Kenneth Hite takes apart Dracula -- the novel, the movies, the myth, even the history -- into his component pieces: characters, tropes, symbols, story beats, effects. With those pieces, Ken shows you how to build new yet mythic stories about the King of the Vampires or about your own creatures of the night, tuned for thriller adventure, cosmic horror, or even intense personal drama. This standalone book suitable for all fans of games, storytelling, and Dracula will be delivered in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats, after Ken is finished with the rest of the DRACULA DOSSIER. Our commitment to THE THRILL OF DRACULA will not delay the release of this core item.\nWhen you become a backer, you help shape part of the Unredacted storyline. One of the original team of hunters who defeated Dracula left a secret message that has remained undiscovered until now. Your pledges determine who left the message\u2014was it Mina Harker, or Abraham Van Helsing? When you pledge, leave a comment telling us which legendary Hunter left one last, desperate message across the decades!\nTo add something else to your pledge, keep your backer level the same, and increase the amount of money you're pledging by the cost of the add-on and the shipping price below. For example, if you've pledged at the \u00a350 CASE OFFICER level and you want to add on a Night's Black Agents PDF (\u00a310), increase your pledge level from \u00a350 to \u00a360. If your shipping address is in the UK and you've pledged at the \u00a350 CASE OFFICER level and you want to add on a Night's Black Agents print book (\u00a325), increase your pledge level from \u00a350 to \u00a380 (\u00a350+\u00a325+\u00a35). When the campaign is over, we'll send you through a survey sorting out all the details.\nYou can only add on a physical item if you have backed at the \u00a350 CASE OFFICER level or above. You can add PDFs at any level.\nFor shipping to the UK or USA, please add an extra \u00a35 per physical add-on.\nFor shipping to the European Union, please add an extra \u00a37 per physical add-on.\nFor shipping outside these locations, please add an extra \u00a310 per physical add-on.\nWHAT CAN YOU ADD-ON?\nYou can find out more details about all of the add-ons in this update.\nTo pull of a risky operation like this, you need a team with a very specialized set of skills and experience. We\u2019ve pulled the following operatives in from the cold:\nKenneth Hite: The scholar who reveals the terrible secrets of Dracula Unredacted\u2014but at what cost?\nGareth Ryder-Hanrahan: The devious designer of elaborate plans, dangerous strangers, and complex schemes, nestled within the Director\u2019s Handbook.\nCat Tobin: With her sharp wits, steely resolve and skill with firearms, Tobin will make sure her team gets through this alive. And if they don\u2019t\u2026well, the package will get delivered, one way or another.\nSimon Rogers: A shadow glimpsed in the fog, a voice over a staticky phone line\u2014you sought the puppet master, only to find that you were his marionette all along.\nWade Rockett: Delicate operations require skillful handling of information...and disinformation. The team's \"public relations\" man dwells in a world of smoke and mirrors, where perception is reality.\nSidney Bishopgate: To get the job done, sometimes things need to be broken. People, too. Pray that you never have to meet him.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game text is already a complete, post-playtest draft, pending only the inclusion of any additional material created as pledge benefits or stretch goals.

Do anything and everything to entertain your players. Stop at nothing. Pay any price.\nThe advice was both the highest and lowest rated column in the magazine's history, creating division among its readership. But most importantly, it made everyone think about how they ran their games.\nI collected those articles in a book and it has simultaneously become one of the most famous and notorious GM advice books in gaming history. Now, fifteen years later, it's time for a sequel.\nPlay Dirty 2: Even Dirtier continues the trend its predecessor began. PD2 presents even more nasty, underhanded and deceitful tricks to get your players emotionally involved in your characters and your world. John pulls no punches, using everything from new technologies and old conman tricks to give you all the tools you need to get your players to care.\nExamples\nIf you're unfamiliar with the Play Dirty philosophy, let me sum it up in one sentence:\nYou should stop at nothing to make sure your players are having fun.\nI advocated cheating. Misreading dice. Taking away character sheets. Conspiring with players to act against other players. In short, taking the old advice of \"be fair and arbitrary\" and throwing it out the window.\nDire Peril Jessica\nIn the chapter Killing Characters, I talk about the example of \"Dire Peril,\" a mechanic I use in most of my games, introduced to me by the amazing Jess Heinig. The idea is simple: in my games, player characters cannot die unless their death is meaningful. It's just that simple. Conan doesn't get killed by a stray slingshot bolt from a kobold. That's the very definition of absurd. So, generally, I say characters can't die without their players' consent.\nBut if I invoke \"DIre Peril,\" that means \"Your character is about to take an action that can kill her without your consent.\"\nAt my local Houses of the Blooded live action event, Jessica Kauspedas decided she was going for revenge against another. So, when she showed up, I walked behind her with a \"Dire Peril!\" sign held over her head. Everyone knew that if they messed with Jessica's character, there was a chance their own character would die without permission.\nJessica told me she had no intention of killing anyone at the game, but the other players didn't know that. Adding the threat added a unique tension to the game. The threat was all she needed.\nIf you want to see more examples of what Play Dirty looks like, check out the Play Dirty playlist on my Youtube channel. Here are a couple of examples.\nIn the chapter The Kobold and the Beautiful, I took a standard dungeon adventure published by my friends at Super Genius Games and turned it on its head. Instead of playing the adventurers, I had my players take the roles of the kobolds in the \"dungeon.\" They knew the adventurers were coming and had to figure out a way to stop the dirty humans, dwarves and elves from stealing their well-earned goods.\nIn The Dirty Dungeon, I introduced the idea that the players can make their own adventures, complete with a map, history and everything else. It's a system that rewards their creativity and takes all the work off the GM's hands. Its a system that works with any game.\nChapters!\nIntroduction: The Magician\nThe GM and the magician have the same goal: getting people to believe in things they know aren't real. Can we GMs learn from the skills and tricks magicians use? Of course we can!\n\nThe Friendly Game\nMy friend Matt introduced the concept of the \"friendly game\" to me as a rule for table top strategy and board games. I've brought it into RPGs and it has since changed everything about how I GM.\n\nThe Social Meat Grinder\nA phrase coined by Jess Heinig (\"John's games are social meat grinders\"), I show you how to apply social pressures to characters that attack them in ways that have nothing to do with their armor class, hit points or saving throws.\n\nPower to the Players\nA response to the question, \"How do I keep my characters from becoming too powerful?\" The answer: Let them be as powerful as they want.\n\nExploitation for Fun and Profit\nRunning a Mage: the Ascension game gave me an opportunity to turn the whole world against one character. Literally.\n\nKilling Characters\nDon't. But if you have to, do it with style and purpose.\n\nHappy Halloween\nA revamp of an old essay I wrote for Flames Rising website about how to use haunted house techniques to scare the living lights out of your players.\n\nSylvie Hates the Bye-Bye Box (including a Follow-Up with Chris Colbath) \nWhen my friend Chris asked my advice on how to write a story that would challenge his young daughter's \"attack first, never ask questions\" behavior, I came up with a scenario that was one of the meanest things I've ever thought up for a character. This version of the essay includes a \"follow up\" with Chris, how he used the advice, what he changed and how it all worked out.\n\nThe Kobold and the Beautiful\nTake any published dungeon crawl. Any dungeon crawl. Then, have your players take the roles of the monsters while you take the roles of their characters, hacking their way through the dungeon. See what happens.\n\nKick in Your Heels\nYou don't want villains, you want antagonists.

If we hit this stretch goal, each chapter will have an illustration by Inga Indra\u0161i\u016bt\u0117.

You'll want a copy of the book on the table at all times. Why?\nBecause in the margins of each page, our beautiful and talented layout artist, Jessica Kauspedas, has suggested we have two things: dice and NPC traits.\nFlip to a random page and you get a random roll. We'll have a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20 on each page, set in the margin. You pick a d-type, flip to a page and you've got a roll.\nAlso, in each margin, we'll have an adjective: \"loyal,\" \"friendly,\" \"deceitful,\" \"envious,\" \"courageous,\" etc. When your players meet an NPC, just flip to three random pages and you've got three adjectives to describe that NPC.\nRandom dice rolls and an NPC generator RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.\nWhat's more, WE'RE DOING IT FOR BOTH BOOKS!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks for this Kickstarter are simple: writing the book, printing the book and shipping the book.\n\nThe book has already been written, so we have that covered.

You play a mortal servant of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse (or other interested parties) trying to avert the End of Days, all while Heaven and Hell want you dead. Through the use of the Rite of Ea, an ancient ritual, the events which will cause Doomsday are revealed to you before they happen; fix what will happen and the Metatron, God\u2019s scribe, will not notice your meddling. Do this enough and the Horsemen, reading the Metatron\u2019s altered view of the world, will retreat, confident that it is not yet time to ride.\nJust a quick bite before we save the world...\nOur resolution mechanic, The Element Engine, isn't just a matter of deciding what to do or what \u2018skill\u2019 or \u2018attribute\u2019 is appropriate, but what\u2019s motivating you to do it. Why are you taking a swing at someone?\nIs it because you are a Martial Artist and you are confident in your prowess?\nIs your Pride not going to let some angel think he is better than you?\nDo you regret Not Stopping A Homeless Person\u2019s Beating Death and have vowed to never let such a thing happen again?\nEach of these indicates an important Element of your being and can inform any number of actions, from a footrace to talking down someone in a hostage situation. Each Element has a modifier to indicate how central it is to your character as well as Element Dice, a resource for dramatically increasing the chance of succeeding in actions you believe are important. Spend your Element Dice before or after a Task roll, roll the dice and determine your success based on a Target Number.\nEach character has access to Unearthly power. Tapping into this Unearthly Element of their being means they can accomplish feats few mortals can hope to achieve. Meanwhile, unique Gifts grant each character a variety of powers. From supernatural motorcycles to the ability to conjure hellfire, each character type possesses fantastic abilities which they will need to survive.\nThe Doomsday Clock, a very real metaphysical presence, tries to move ever forward to the End of Days. Actions you take and the Unearthly powers you command have the potential to doom the world. Due to the Rite of Ea, this is not set in stone; you will have a chance to fight the Doomsday Clock itself and maybe even push it backwards precious seconds. This framing device at the end of every chapter of play will give you a battle with an adversary as powerful as you let it be. Abusing your powers potentially strengthens the Clock, while taking actions which reaffirm humanity and the reasons for the world to exist give you strength to oppose the Doomsday Clock. Don\u2019t be afraid to call upon your Unearthly Gifts when you need them; you won\u2019t stop Doomsday if you are dead!\nAnd for good reason: they think you want to end the world and they aren\u2019t sure who is winning. You\u2019ve got a big target on you. Sure, you could tell them what you are really doing\u2026 but they probably won\u2019t believe you, and what if the Horsemen find out?\nIn addition to Riders of Conquest, War, Famine and Death, there are some interested parties who also want the world to keep on going. From a love of humanity to just being sick of The War between Heaven and Hell driving them, these playable characters include: \nShepherd - the classic guardian angel, you get to protect others, strike fear into your enemies and swing a flaming sword.\nUnderstudy - so someone died, and your demon self slipped right into their job, their family, their existence. You've gotten used to the sweet life on Earth and don\u2019t want it to end.\nNephilim - a child born from a mortal and an angel, you've only recently realized you are more than human.\nCambion - a child born from a mortal and an demon, hellfire burns in you, driving you to save the only world you know,\nTrue Chronicler - what happens when an ordinary person finds one of the Metatron\u2019s notebooks and absorbs the wisdom within?\nWith the four Riders, there are nine playable character sets in total, all ready to save the world.\nRiders will be a 6\"x9\" color book printed through OneBookShelf, approximately 150 pages in length. The base book will be softcover using their high quality standard printing option. There will be a higher pledge level which will include an option for a hardcover book in addition to the extras provided by the pledge level.\nAs you can see by the sample layout, this is not a traditional game book with orderly columns and sidebars but an experiment in design. It is a combination of art project and fully playable game, with easy breakout of sidebars to go along with readable text, all to represent an in-game notebook left to the characters. \nClick for a 6-page layout sample!\nShould we significantly pass our funding goal, we have a number of additional goals to encourage people to keep on riding:\n$3500 - The Oathbreaker Character Set\nA former Sworn of the Fallen or The Host, you have broken your oath yet managed to claw power from your defiance. The Oathbreaker adds a tenth character set to Riders.\n$3750 - Form-Fillable Character Sets\nAll the character sheets in a form-fillable PDF format, suitable for printing.\n$4000 - Digital Goals Open to Everyone\nWhen we hit $4000, all PDF backers will also get access to the Oathbreaker Character Set and the form-fillable character sheets. From this point forward, they will get access to all the rest of our digital stretch goals as well!\n$5000 - 'Will Be Played By...' Fiction by Caias Ward\nCaias Ward will write \"Will Be Played By...\", a short story set in the Riders universe, where a suburban guy notices his next-door neighbor is acting strangely just as he finds a half-filled notebook at a local coffee shop....\n$6500 - To be Announced\nWe have a few more goals planned out but those revelations will come out as we approach them...\nDelivery of certain stretch goals may take longer than the estimates in the pledge levels. We'll be sure to add more stretch goals as we ride along...\nCaias Ward\nCaias Ward has contributed to over a dozen RPG projects as diverse as Continuum: roleplaying in the Yet; PEG\u2019s Path of Kane, Pyramid Magazine, Strike Force 7 and his latest work Trigger Happy which was successful Kickstarted in 2013. He is also the author of two novels.\nKeith Olexa\nKeith Olexa started his career chasing fantasy, science fiction and horror stories in STARLOG and FANGORIA magazine, and he\u2019s been nose-deep in the genre ever since. He\u2019s currently editing for Kevin J. Anderson\u2019s WordFire Press, when not developing his own fictional worlds.\nChris McMahon\nSome of you might recognize Chris from his work on Trigger Happy; we got a hold of him again to focus on mechanics editing and review.\nAlida Saxon\nAlida is a Canadian artist living in New England. She has been working for decades as a freelance artist, with over 10 years in the RPG industry, producing illustrations and cartography for a number of titles.\nWilliam Wiklund\nWilliam, an artist located in Sweden, is a designer for The Artivist Collective. Some of his previous work includes pieces for the Trigger Happy RPG.\nJennifer Hutnick\nJennifer is an artist from New Jersey. Although this is her first RPG project, she has extensive experience in working in different mediums, from sketches to oil painting.\nWe've learned a great deal about fulfillment from our last Kickstarter. Even though we did a pretty good job printing books and sending them out ourselves, we've realized that using OneBookShelf (OBS, the folks behind DriveThruRPG and RPGNow) is a better option for printing and shipping at this scale. It will allow for a much less expensive proofing process and will mean we won\u2019t have to double up on prepping files for OBS after we do our initial run for backers.\nBy pledging at $20 level or higher, you will have access to Print on Demand at cost. When the book is completed you will get a link to the print on demand copy of Riders at cost, then you pay OBS (most likely through DriveThruRPG) about $5 (softcover) or $11 (hardcover) + shipping based on the projected size of the book (this might change a bit depending on final layout, but not by much). They will print and ship to you. This has several benefits, including improved turnaround times once the book is approved for printing and helping to insulating both of us from shipping increases since we\u2019ll never have as good an arrangement as OBS. This especially holds true for international shipping as people will be able to take advantage of OBS' multiple printing locations, as well as consolidating their shipping of Riders with other books.\nSome of the higher pledge levels will have us ordering and shipping books due to special requirements. Those pledge levels will be clearly marked.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOther than the end of the world?\n\nIn the interest of due diligence, we\u2019ve identified some possible areas of risk as well as how we are mitigating them.\n\nProduction: a major portion of the game is already written and playtested. We may make some minor adjustments as some stragglers come in with playtesting, but we\u2019ve had excellent results with our rounds of playtesting, including the blind playtesting groups. We still need to add backer contributions, but will be sure to have a set schedule for getting them to give their ideas so we can develop them. The art is nearly complete, which leaves layout in my hands. The book will need to go through editing, then to layout, then back to the editor. Should there be a major issue with my involvement in the project, my wife is skilled in layout and would be able to, with my direction, continue the project.\n\nHigher Pledge Level Fulfillment: Fulfilling some of the higher pledge levels, including the alternate layouts, may have certain considerations to make. I've got a good handle on how long layout will take me. Some of the specialty levels may take longer due to possible errors and the hand-crafted nature of some of them.\n\nThis is the second print product for TaleSpinner Holdings in the RPG area (the first being Trigger Happy, a Kickstarter-funded project now available on DriveThruRPG), and would be the fifth product in total as we have one card accessory and two electronic releases. Beyond RPGs, we have experience in dealing with vendors, sourcing print on a B2B basis and wrangling artists and other contributors to complete projects successfully. As well, I have written or contributed to over a dozen RPG products for such companies as Super Genius Games, Pyramid Magazine, Abstract Nova and Pinnacle and I personally released the game DreamSide at GenCon back in 1999, selling out the short print run in three days.\n\nMy personal background is both as a stationary engineer in a data center and as a partner in a private equity company. Both have given me the resources to put out fires (in some cases, literal fires) which come up in a project.

To help commemorate this historic event, I've decided to produce a series of old school adventures in that game system, starting with part one, False Promises.  It's designed for 3 to 5 characters of levels 1-3.\nDo you like old school roleplaying games of the 1980's?  Do you like a good mystery?  Then False Promises is for you.  It is the first book in a three book series, taking place in the province of Sivona.  The entire series will take adventurers through Sivona and into the wild North of Darkhome, the land of giants and dragons.  Here is the adventure hook:\n\"For two weeks, shipments of ore and gold from Principal Mine 127 have not arrived in Bordovia.  All messengers sent to the mine to investigate, including Sivonan soldiers, have not returned.  Baron Ungur Wyrmbul demands to know what has happened to his top producing mine.  He cannot send any more troops to investigate the mine and nearby town of Kwaltist, with his border forts near Darkhome already insufficiently supported.  Who will investigate the missing shipments and solve the mystery at Kwaltist?\"\nWhen this Project Ends, What Needs to be Done?\nPrinting and shipping the rewards.  The writing, editing, and artwork is already done!  I like to complete everything *before* I start a Kickstarter project, so you get your rewards after payments process and the books are printed.  No waiting.  No excuses. \nPrint Details\nFalse Promises will be a 16 page, saddle-stitched 8.5\" x 11\" book.  It will have a color exterior and a black and white interior.  If met, stretch goals may change the the text headings and images to color, but all maps will remain black and white. \nWait, only 16 pages?  Yes, but those 16 pages are jammed full of detail, maps and tables.  I use a size 8 font (with Book Antiqua) and use all available space (smaller margins).  Plus, I wanted the first book of the series to play in 1-3 sessions, depending on the player's speed.\nThe initial goal of $1500 roughly equates to 75 to 100 printed books.  Electronic rewards will adjust the number of printed books in the end.\nAdditional stretch goals may add one or two page encounters - these will be inserts and will not change the book itself (I do not want to upset the editing and image layout of the book, it's already done.  Although the \"insert\" encounters are already written, they aren't essential to the story line in False Promises, but are side activities for the adventurers).\nArtwork\nLucas Pandolfelli returns to a ThrowiGames project again, adding his amazing work to False Promises.  His color cover is spectacular:\nFalse Promises Cover\nHe has also drawn all the images for the interior as well. \nStretch Goals\nA few stretch goals have been added to enhance the book but not drastically change it in any way.  Again, it's important to me to have the finished product ready before this project started - I'd hate to change the book layout or remove pictures to make room for new content - it's better to add additional content (\"optional encounters\") as inserts.\nAll backer levels receive any stretch goal rewards met.\nBook Cost Breakdown\nThe target goal of $1500 ensures that all expenses are paid and/or reimbursed, with a little extra to put toward artwork in part two.  The graph below shows the breakdown of costs for each book:\nBook Cost Breakdown\nSigned and Numbered Copies\nThe first 51 copies out of the printer's box will be signed and numbered, with #2 - #51 going to the Collector, International Collector, and Collector/Player levels.  #1 is offered as a single reward option for one dedicated backer (Super Collector).\nNote that the assignment of numbers is based on the order in which supporters backed the project.  For example, the first person to back any of the Collector levels will get #2, the next will get #3, and so on.\nSpecial Note on PDFs\nAny backer of a print level can request a PDF copy as well - I am not automatically sending the PDF to ALL backers.  Many print backers from my last project did not want the PDF.  I'll ask you in the survey if you want the PDF.  If you don't want it, you won't get it.\nPart One of Three?\nYes, False Promises will be the first book in a three part series celebrating the 40th anniversary of D&D.  The second and third books will release via Kickstarter sometime in January 2015 and April 2015 respectively.  Part two, the \"Fury of Thringalesh\" is close to completion but lacks play testing, editing and artwork.  Look for news about part two at the end of the year!\nFalse Promises Creator/Author\nI'm the sole creator of False Promises, including the content and maps.  Only the artwork was created by someone other than myself.  All supporting content including world names and references are part of the ThrowiGames line of products found at my website.\nFalse Promises is the first adventure published by ThrowiGames LLC in an old school rule set.  All previous adventures found at the company website were created for the Throwigames Simple Roleplaying System (TSRS) which was nominated for a 2013 Ennie.  False Promises will also be available for TSRS in 2015 via the throwigames.com website.  Note that the World Guide for TSRS is freely available at the website and can be used for any game system.\nPrevious Project(s)\nThe Throwigames Simple Roleplaying System (TSRS) All-in-One Guide, successfully launched and completed in March 2014 ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1801954192/throwigames-simple-roleplaying-system-all-in-one-g ).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith print projects, we are often at the mercy of the printing company; their delays become ours.

Additionally, if we reach the initial funding goal early, I may submit the project to my printer before the end just to expedite the process (with revised counts post end date).\n\nIf the final count of books far surpasses my expectations, delivery of the books by the end of December will be challenging. I'll update backers with new expectations if we go over and above the reasonable number of books I would be able to ship in December.\n\nThis isn't my first Kickstarter project - my last project was successful and delivered early.

Now on to stretch goals!\n\"Ssh,\" whispered BB. \"Just follow me.\"\nRory pulled his hat down lower to try and protect his eyes from errant branches. He couldn't see a thing anyway. Jennifer pulled her phone out of her pocket to use as a flashlight, but Tom caught her wrist and shook his head. Maria followed BB closely, moving just as silently as he did, slipping through the underbrush. \nRory glanced up. He cocked his head. Something was wrong with the branches of the tree ahead of them. He tugged on Tom's sleeve and pointed. Tom glanced up and shrugged, and whispered \"tree house\" to Rory. \nRory shut his eyes and focused, trying to center himself and feel for the Unknown, the way his father had taught him. When he'd done it before, the feeling had been subtle, easy to mistake for a chill in the air. This time it washed over him like a bucket of ice water. \n\"Guys!\" he tried to cry out, but his voice was gone. The night was completely silent, and the creature landed in their midst without a sound, holding a bloody claw hammer; staring at Rory with gleeful, murderous eyes.\nChill is a horror roleplaying game in which the characters belong to a secret organization called SAVE - Societas Argenti Viae Eternitata, the Eternal Society of the Silver Way. This organization is dedicated to protecting humanity from the Unknown - the forces of the supernatural, the monsters, ghosts, and creatures from beyond human understanding. Its weapons against the Unknown? Knowledge, bravery, skill, the resources of its members, and the Art - the strange, quasi-psychic powers that SAVE has codified and studied over the years.\nSAVE was founded in 1844 by a man named Charles O'Boylan, and over the years, it grew to a global organization, with members (called \"envoys\") all over the world. SAVE has seen its share of setbacks - in 1989, the Central Archives in Dublin were destroyed by the forces of the Unknown. The creatures burned the archives, killed many of the envoys present, and drove SAVE underground. \nOver the next 25 years, SAVE teetered on the brink of extinction. The forces of the Unknown infiltrated SAVE, turning regional headquarters against one another. But recently, a new leader emerged, and showed the organization how to prosper even with the adversity it faced. The price of her methods, though, was decentralization. SAVE doesn't have the global network of support it once did, and requesting aid from another chapter of SAVE is a calculated risk. \nNow, the organization survives, learning more about the Unknown and the best ways to fight it. Some chapters are well-equipped and staffed, others make do with a handful of envoys and some out-of-date intelligence. Joining SAVE is a commitment with a great deal of danger...but many SAVE envoys feel that it is a sacred duty. \n\"If all else fails,\" an envoy once wrote, \"remember that God and SAVE are on your side.\"\nChill 3rd Edition uses a percentile system, much like previous editions. Players make rolls against a target number (T#). Players make two kinds of checks, general checks and specific checks. A general check either succeeds (the roll is lower than or equal to the T#) or fails (the roll is the higher than the T#). \nA specific check has five possible results: \nBotch: The roll is a failure (higher than the T#) and the dice come up doubles. If your T# is 60 and you roll 88, for instance, that's a botch.\nFailure: The roll is higher than the T#, but not a botch. \nLow Success: The roll is equal to or lower than the T#, but higher than half the T#. If your T# is 60, and you roll anything from 60 to 30, it's a low success. \nHigh Success: You roll less than half your T#. If your T# is 60, anything lower than 30 is a high success. \nColossal Success: You roll any success and the dice come up doubles. So, if your T# is 60 and you roll 55, 44, 33, 22, or 11, it's a colossal success!\nIn addition to the dice, we've added a system of Chill tokens. These are simple chips or coins that have two different facings (coins work; heads is \"light,\" tails is \"dark\").\n\nPlayers can \"flip a chip dark\" (turning a light chip to the dark facing) to add to their target numbers (before or after a roll!), to sense the Unknown, to use their training in the Art, and, in truly dire straits, to save a character's life. \n\nOf course, once a chip's dark facing is showing, the Chill Master can flip the chip light to activate a creature's Disciplines of the Evil Way, to hinder the characters in minor in-genre ways (\"I'm not getting any reception!\"), or to add to a NPC's target number. \nWhen you back Chill 3rd Edition, you'll have access to a pdf of Good Fences Make Good Neighbors, our playtest quickstart (it's in the first update of this Kickstarter). We would love for you to run it with a group of friends, and then follow the link to the feedback form and give us your thoughts. While we think our system works, we also know from years of game design experience that the best way to test a system is to get it in front of a lot of eyes. Once this Kickstarter successfully concludes, we'll put the playtest packet up on DriveThru RPG for free download. \nIn 1990, Mayfair Games released the second edition of the horror roleplaying game, Chill. I found that book in my friendly local game store (Mind Games, in Toledo, Ohio). Chill, with its sleek black cover and the face of Rax leering out at me, was my first introduction to horror roleplaying.  \nI think it's fair to say that Chill had a profound influence on my tastes in literature, movies, and, of course, roleplaying games. I ran Chill four nights a week for two years in college, and I used it as the vector to bring a lot of people into the hobby. Some of them stuck with it, others didn't, but I can't tell you the number of times in the early 90s when a friend would call me up the day after a game and tell me, \"I dreamed about that game last night. It was really freaky.\" Chill taught me about establishing atmosphere in a game, about tension and pacing, about showing just enough gore to get a reaction but not so much that the scene becomes gross or cartoonish.\nChill also taught me some things I didn't realize I was learning. Looking back now, I can see that some of the things I loved about the game had nothing to do with the monsters or the horror. Chill underlined the necessity for teamwork and trust. It showed me that making assumptions about the nature of a problem can carry terrible consequences (a werewolf and a barghest are both dog-like, but they are not the same beast!). And it showed me that the only way to win the face of a predatory, overwhelming, insatiable enemy is when good people stand up and say, \"enough.\"  \nIn 2013, I idly mentioned to my wife (Michelle Lyons-McFarland) that I wondered who owned the rights to Chill these days - after all, there had been talk of a third edition some time back, but it never materialized. She did some digging, and found out that a man named Martin Caron now owned the RPG. A few emails later, and we had secured an agreement to produce a new edition of a roleplaying game that is, in many ways, responsible for making me the game designer I am today. To say I'm excited is a massive understatement, and I'm hoping you'll back our project and help Chill 3rd Edition come to fruition.\nPrevious Kickstarter experience has taught me that including supplementary books as stretch goals can bloom out of control very quickly. That said, we still have some exciting stretch goals planned for when we surpass our initial funding goal (think positive!). \n$29,000 - Full Color Printing - UNLOCKED!: The pdf of Chill 3rd Edition is going to be in full color; we've budgeted to contract all the art in color already. Printing in color, however, is more expensive, so our first stretch goal is to do our print run in color. \n$31,000 - Midnight Syndicate (digital) - UNLOCKED!: We are amazingly pleased to partner with Midnight Syndicate for this stretch goal! The good folks at Midnight Syndicate will produce a module for Chill 3rd Edition and a soundtrack to go with it. This module and soundtrack will be available as a digital download to any back at the SAVE scholar level or higher. \n$38,000 - The Limited Edition Boxed Set: Boxed sets for RPGs aren't as common these days as they were when I started roleplaying, but there's definitely a thrill to having a box containing everything you need to play a game. We did something called a \"Kit\" with curse the darkness, and for our this stretch goal, we'd like to make 500 Limited Edition Boxed Sets. These Sets will contain: 1 copy of the hardcover Chill book, 10 tokens in a stamped muslin bag, and 2 custom dice (one of which will have the indalo in the \"0\" place). If we meet this stretch goal, we will add a backer level to reflect it, and anyone who wants it will just need to alter their pledge. Note that shipping for the Boxed Sets, for international backers, will be handled at the time of shipping through BackerKit.   \nValid question, especially since our ask is so high. Here's where your money goes:\nPaying authors. We have a bunch of very talented people writing this book; you can meet them here. I need to be able to pay them for their talents. \nPaying artists. Same comment. When you back this project, you'll be able to see (via the playtest packet) some of the amazing art that's going into this project, and we have other artists lined up to do interior illustration. \nPaying for layout. Layout is a mystery to me; as far as I know it's done by magic. My wife informs me that's not the case, but in any event, it's probably better that we have someone talented to lay out our book. Enter Thomas Deeny, the same wizard who laid out the playtest packet. \nPaying for materials. Books cost money. Part of the money raised with this Kickstarter will go toward a print run, both to fulfill the rewards for backers and to send to retailers. \nPaying for the license. Growling Door doesn't own the Chill IP, and part of the funds from this Kickstarter are going to satisfy our contract with Martin Caron. \nAnd a reminder: This book is big. We get away with smaller asks for our other projects because the books were smaller and softcover. We estimate Chill at 232 pages (which is still less than 2nd Edition), and that means our costs go up. \nWell, you knew it was coming. \nShipping is a nightmare. It's expensive, and worse, it's unpredictable. Shipping prices fluctuate (or rather, increase), and since we've got the better part of a year between funding and shipping, it's hard to know what the costs will actually be. \nShipping costs are figured in for the physical rewards we're currently offering (that is, the hardcover book). International backers are asked to pay an addition $10 to offset the shipping and handling charges. If we make our Limited Edition Boxed Set stretch goal, we will add reward levels and instructions for shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPutting together a project of this size and scope always carries a risk, one that I like to call \"the flammable cat.\" When I worked for White Wolf Game Studio as the developer for the Dark Ages line, we would occasionally say, when a book was delayed, that somewhere along the way a cat caught fire. \n\nObviously, no actual felines were ever combusted (not to my knowledge, anyway!), but the point was that with an endeavor like an RPG book, any number of things can go wrong. They're not anyone's fault - people get sick, have car accidents, relatives pass away, babies are born, and so forth - but they do slow things down. The trick to keeping things on track isn't to safeguard against the flammable cat. That cat is GOING to catch fire at some point. \n\nNo, the best plan is to have a fire extinguisher handy. To break the metaphor, what I mean by all this is that I'm sure something's going to go wrong or get delayed. As such, I've built a lot of extra time into the schedule. The writers are already writing on this project - the first draft of *Chill* is due on October 13, and I'll be posting excerpts as updates as they come in. We don't have art contracted yet, but I have a number of artists lined up to work on the book, I know how fast they work, and we'll have plenty of time work with them even if something does go wrong in the interim. \n\nThe boxed set stretch goal is a potential source of risk - it has a lot of different components, but provided that we make the stretch goal, we should have plenty of time to assemble everything in time for our GenCon 2015 debut. We did something similar with *curse the darkness*, and that project was delivered on time. \n\nFinally, it's worth noting that we've licensed *Chill* from Martin Caron, and as with any licensed property we'll have a round of approvals. The terms of our contract, however, state that approvals have to be conducted in a timely manner, and I know from my interactions with Martin that he's just as keen to see this project realized as I am.\n\nI don't anticipate everything going smooth, because as a certain space captain once said, it never goes smooth. I *do* anticipate that my team of professionals - writers, editors, layout folks, designers - can handle whatever cats catch fire. Growling Door Games has already delivered two roleplaying games, funded through Kickstarter, successfully, and I hope that you will join us for this one!\n\nOne other thing: Backers will receive the pdf of *Chill 3rd Edition* before it goes on sale, and we hope to have the books shipped before GenCon 2015. However, if something gets delayed, we reserve the right to sell the game at GenCon. It's not economically feasible for us to turn down the opportunity to debut *Chill* at GenCon, even if the books haven't shipped to backers. We can promise that the game will not go into distribution until the books have shipped, and that backers will be able to pick up their books at GenCon, if they so desire.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "New Game: Jack's Trick!

We (that is, Martin and I) felt that was a bad idea; for one thing, Growling Door Games isn't going to hold the license for Chill forever, and it becomes a rights issue if we publish something under Chill 3rd Edition that includes characters or IP that need to remain with the creator.

ALL SLOTS TAKEN!\nTo put together the explosive work of roleplaying design that is Feng Shui 2, Atlas Games has backed Robin D. Laws with an experienced team of design and development professionals. Here's who's involved with the production of Feng Shui 2.\nRobin D. Laws, Creator & System Designer\nCreator of the original Feng Shui, writer and game designer Robin D. Laws comes roaring back for more action movie thrills. His last Kickstarter project, Hillfolk, just won additional glory for its backers by bringing home the crazy-prestigious Diana Jones Award, and twin Indie RPG Awards for Best Game and Best Support. Other RPG designs include The Esoterrorists, Ashen Stars, HeroQuest, and The Gaean Reach. Fiction projects include eight novels, the short story collection New Tales of the Yellow Sign, and creative direction duties for Stone Skin Press. He comprises one-half of the ENnie-winning podcast Ken and Robin Talk About Stuff, and can be found online at robindlaws.com.\nCam Banks, Development and Editing\nCam Banks is Atlas Games' Brand Manager. He was born in the antipodean paradise of New Zealand, a nation whose geography doubles for such fictional landscapes as Mythic Greece and Middle Earth. Despite his uneventful education in history, philosophy, and psychology at NZ's Waikato University he learned his true passion was in playing games and making things up. Forsaking his homeland, he emigrated to the USA to marry his soul mate and pursue such diverse careers as retail manager, cafe manager, client engagement manager, and library annex manager. He spent the last decade working for Margaret Weis Productions and helped create, develop, and manage over fifty roleplaying games and sourcebooks, including award-winning RPGs based on Marvel Comics and Leverage. Now living in Saint Paul with his wife and two sons, Cam is thrilled to add \"brands\" to things he can manage.\nHal Mangold, Production and Art Direction\nHal Mangold is a award-winning graphic designer, art director, and writer who's been active in the hobby games industry for almost two decades. He's a partner in Green Ronin Publishing LLC, El Jefe at Atomic Overmind Press, and freelances extensively. Hal's first ever published game work was in the Feng Shui supplement Back For Seconds, and he's extremely pleased to be involved with the reboot of this classic RPG. \nJeff Tidball, Project Management and Video Editing\nJeff Tidball is an award-winning writer, game designer, and creative executive with a breadth of experience ranging from the Ars Magica RPG to the Horus Heresy board game. He's one of Gameplaywright's co-founders and currently serves as Atlas Games' Chief Operating Officer.\nJohn Nephew, Publisher\nJohn Nephew is the president of Atlas Games. He got his start in the gaming industry by writing articles for Dragon Magazine while he was still in high school. His writing paid his way through college, and he started Atlas Games in 1990 while he was still pursuing his BA in Philosophy at Carleton College, as a way to publish his own work. John manages the business side of Atlas Games, handling distributor and retailer orders and queries, fulfillment (i.e., packing boxes), accounts payable and receivable, translation queries, and even a little layout and proofreading once in a while. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAtlas Games is a well-established publisher with a 24-year track record. Each member of the team is a seasoned professional with years of experience in game creation and production.\n\nAtlas Games\u2019 finances are stable, our delivery date is conservative, the game\u2019s manuscript is complete, and art direction has already begun. Robin\u2019s work on the manuscript is all but complete, and none of the remaining members of the production team are irreplaceable in the event of a serious illness or similar misfortune.\n\nThe greatest risks involved in this project lie in the uncontrollable schedules of our production partners. Although we intend to print the physical editions of the rulebook at a domestic factory with whom we have a decade-long relationship, other add-ons and stretch goals involve newer suppliers. It is possible but not likely that delays at those factories could delay some deliveries. As mentioned above, though, our timeline has been estimated with great conservatism, and we do not anticipate delays (Circumstances like inter-dimensional incursions by heavily armed cybernetic primates, or death curses from ancient eunuch sorcerers obviously can't be planned for in advance.)\n\nPlease do note that in the unlikely event that we aren\u2019t able to ship rewards to backers before Gen Con 2015, we reserve the right to sell the game at that convention only. However, in no case will Feng Shui 2 be released to the hobby distribution channel until all backer copies have been fulfilled.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #62", "update_userinfo": "An Update on the Feng Shui 2 Supplement Subscription - We're Over Halfway There!", "update_content": "We've been surprised and delighted by the overwhelmingly positive response to our recently-announced Feng Shui 2 subscription program.

It takes inspiration from multiple sources: cosmic horror RPGs and board games, Danganronpa, Megami Tensei, Soul Eater, and more!\nYou play students of a near-future occult high school as they\u2019re thrust into the middle of a mystery that threatens to destroy everything. To survive, you\u2019ll have to discover which of your classmates is to blame and stop the awakening of an Ancient One before it\u2019s too late\u2014all while advancing your own secret agenda.\nFor fans of cosmic horror, the setting of Breakfast Cult offers a new take on the concept. Its tools can be taken and used to build new cosmic horror settings, if this one doesn\u2019t do it for you; if you\u2019re a Lovecraft fan, Breakfast Cult\u2019s tools can be used to run other Cthulhu Mythos games, and stretch goals will do most of the work for you!\nBreakfast Cult is powered by the Fate Accelerated roleplaying system\u2014character creation takes minutes, and the rules are simple and easy to understand. If you\u2019re a Fate veteran, the game offers you new stuff to spice things up, from new character mechanics to new kinds of enemies!\nWhat Breakfast Cult needs is some professional art and layout. That\u2019s where you come in\u2014the goal of this Kickstarter is to get it published looking as awesome as possible.\nBreakfast Cult is set in Occultar Academy, an affiliated high school of Miskatonic University that takes only the best, brighest and richest. Students with occult potential are \u201cencouraged\u201d to enroll in special schools like this one, where they can learn magic out of the public eye.\nBehind the scenes, Occultar is also a research facility. In the basement of the school library lie the Forbidden Sections, where only Miskatonic professors may tread. The tomes and relics down there contain tantalising knowledge and apocalyptic dangers, and only an idiot would mess around there.\nLast night, some idiot did. When a Breakfast Cult adventure starts, players are thrown into detention with some other characters until one of you confesses to the Headmaster. If you want out, you\u2019re going to have to break out and unravel the mystery.\nTwo problems: One, half of you have your own hidden agendas which could interfere with the investigation. You might be one of them! Two, the culprit\u2019s tampering has set off a chain of events that will lead to an Ancient One awakening and ending you.\nIf you want to survive long enough to worry about your university exams, you'll have to work together to find clues, face the things lurking in the shadows, save the school, and figure out which of your classmates you can trust, all before it's too late.\nI\u2019m Ettin/Paul Matijevic, author of Inverse World Accelerated and Retrocausality. I originally wrote Breakfast Cult for a game design contest, which it won. Now I want to publish it!\nThe final product will be released in PDF and Print On Demand format. With your help it\u2019ll come with a nice layout and full-color artwork, as fun to read as it is to play.\nThis project is being assisted by:\n\u2022 Jacob Randolph (Inverse World, a whole lot of Dungeon World playbooks) is helping out with publishing expertise, Kickstarter experience, and a fantastic sense of style and flair.\n\u2022 Artwork will be provided by Kaitlynn Peavler (Conquering Corsairs, Deck of Legends) and obfuscobble (Inverse World). More artists will be recruited as necessary to help handle stretch goals and keep workloads manageable.\n\u2022 Layout will be handled by Chris Lee (100 Deluxe Dungeons). I am told he also bakes a mean casserole but they can\u2019t fit it in the post, so layout it is.\n\u2022 Stretch goals will include writing contributions from Bruce Baugh, Ewen Cluney, Andri Erlingsson, David Hill and Filamena Young.\nPrint On Demand copies will be self-service: You\u2019ll get a discount code to buy a print copy from DriveThruRPG/RPGNow at cost, and they\u2019ll ship it out to you. This means you save on the retail price and shipping, and you\u2019ll have a professional outfit handle printing and shipping for you. Details can be found in the FAQ.\nSo what do you get? The game comes with:\nRules. We\u2019ve taken the Fate Accelerated system as a base and built upon it, adding new mechanics for players, new rules for monsters and the Ancient Ones, and new ways to run cosmic horror and mystery games.\nSetting. The world of Occultar Academy is presented in enough detail to help you make characters and adventures, but open-ended enough to let you do what you want in it. What lies outside the walls of Occultar and what brings you to the school is up to your group!\nCharacters. To flesh out the world of Occultar and help you put together a mystery without having to start from scratch, 20+ characters will be provided for you. They can be dropped in as NPCs as needed, or adapted into player characters for a quick-start game.\nAncient Ones. The very influence of these strange gods plagues the players, and sets each mystery in motion. They come in different Avatars, which change the nature of the adventures they star in. Each one gets some fancy art and a sample adventure for you to run!\nMonsters. The Ancient Ones can\u2019t fight you directly, but they\u2019ll have plenty of agents to do their dark work for them. You\u2019ll get stats, writeups and art for a bunch of monsters to face off against. Monsters come with unique rules that can be stolen for use in other Fate horror games, too.\nTools. The above tools, advice for running mystery games in the Fate system, sample adventures and some tables for randomly generating your own mysteries will help any group get started in the world of Breakfast Cult, or make their own cosmic horror game.\nBreakfast Cult is an original setting, but it\u2019s partly inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. You might have picked up a few subtle hints and homages.\nOur first priority is an original setting. Dozens of Mythos-themed games have come and gone already, and stapling the setting to a new system and announcing we\u2019ve got a sanity mechanic (hint: it\u2019s a stress track) just isn\u2019t as rewarding as coming up with something entirely new.\nThat said, if you want a new take on the Mythos, we can help! Most of Breakfast Cult can be integrated into the Mythos with minimal work, and if we meet our stretch goals, we\u2019ll do it for you anyway, with writeups of Mythos beings as Ancient Ones and some new spins on popular Mythos monsters.\nSo if you\u2019re after a new cosmic horror setting, come on in. If you want to live your ordinary high school life in the shadow of Yog-Sothoth, come in too! We\u2019ve got you covered.\nPrint tiers are self-service POD. This means that backing gets you a code coupon to buy your physical copy from DriveThruRPG/RPGNow at cost, and you'll pay them reduced shipping/printing costs. You save money, and you\u2019ll have a professional outfit handling printing and shipping for you. It also means you don\u2019t add shipping here. Details in the FAQ.\nWith these stretch goals, we\u2019re aiming to offer some cool things without tanking the whole project under unreasonable extras that don\u2019t directly translate to more Breakfast Cult content. Each goal will also unlock some extra Art Tiers.\nFAQ\nMore questions will be added as they come up. If you\u2019ve got one, send it in!\nSelf Service: What\u2019s up with that?\n Here\u2019s how self-service works:\n1) When you back for a physical copy, you get it via OneBookShelf (DriveThruRPG/RPGNow).\n2) Backing gets you a coupon, which gives you a discount for the product down to the printing costs.\n3) You pay OneBookShelf for printing plus shipping.\n4) They ship you your book.\nWhy self-serve? Here\u2019s why:\n\u2022 Cheaper for you: OneBookShelf\u2019s international print centers mean that in addition to the discount on the retail price you get for backing, you get a reduced rate on shipping, and you get more freedom of choice in how it\u2019s shipped. International buyers also have to jump through less Kickstarter hoops to get their book.\n\u2022 Cheaper for me: I don\u2019t have to deal with a pile of books sprawling across my floor and coiling their shipping-problem tentacles around my Kickstarter like a giant paper shoggoth.\n\u2022 Faster for everyone: You'll get the PDF immediately as soon as it's available, and you don't have to wait for me to tangle with the shipping shoggoth.\n\u2022 Professional shipping: Making it OneBookShelf\u2019s problem means you\u2019re relying on experts who get paid to deal with it, like a publishing Delta Green. You can also be sure Kickstarter fees and other costs won\u2019t eat your shipping and printing money, because it stays in your pocket until you order your book.\nWhat are the print costs?\nThe print costs will depend on the size of the final book. Costs are based on OneBookShelf\u2019s prices at the time this was posted. We\u2019re going for Standard Color, Large size.\nThe final page count will depend on the art, and we\u2019ll let you know in advance. For now, generously assume the book will end up at 150 pages\u2014it\u2019s a nice round number to estimate with, and the difference shouldn\u2019t be more than a few cents.\nFor example, if you back at the Softcover Tier and the book comes out to 150 pages, you\u2019d pay an additional $6.10 to OneBookShelf for printing, plus whatever shipping method you choose.\nSee OneBookShelf's Estimated Shipping Costs for shipping details for your country. Prices subject to change, currency fluctuation, etc.\nWhat happens if your computer dies?\nI think we can all agree that hard drive failure is one of the major causes of sanity loss in the modern era. We\u2019ve made sure to keep multiple backups, so there\u2019s no chance computer failure will erase everything.\nI would like to contact the author!\nRight now I can be reached in the following ways:\n\u2022 In the comments of this very Kickstarter!\n\u2022 Email: ettin.productions at gmail\n\u2022 I post on the RPGnet forums as Ettin\n\u2022 I have a business tumblr, found here\nWith permission, further frequently asked questions will also be posted here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery kickstarter has risks, and we\u2019ve identified a few that needed to be addressed. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got:\n\nArt: Artists can have real-life problems, schedule conflicts, etc. Whatever happens, we\u2019ll try to work with them, but the product could still be delayed. If something happens, we\u2019ll let you know. Pickman\u2019s/Gimmick Tier backers will be contacted once the Kickstarter ends and given time to make their requests, but keep in mind there will be a hard deadline. If you back an art tier, work out what you want before the Kickstarter closes.\n\nWriting: Most of the writing is done, but some backer tiers and stretch goals will add more writing work, so there\u2019s a chance this could cause delays too. If that happens, you\u2019ll be kept posted.\n\nDelivery: With self-service POD eliminating the big risk with delivery, the next risk is that a future accident could prevent me from delivering. I\u2019ve made arrangements for others to take over in that case, though it would probably cause delays. To reduce the risk I will refrain from running with scissors, rolling down stairs, or sticking parts of my body in electrical sockets.\n\nPrinting: Our printers are solid, but we can\u2019t control what happens\u2014supply shortages, industry events, human error, meteor strikes, and other unexpected problems could still happen. This shouldn\u2019t delay shipping much unless it\u2019s the meteor, and either way we\u2019ll keep you updated. If you get a defective product, we\u2019ll send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Shipping errors happen. If your package gets lost, we\u2019ll arrange a replacement. To help reduce the load, backers will get a few days to order their print copy before it\u2019s released to the public.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #84", "update_userinfo": "Update + Announcement", "update_content": "Hey there!

You\u2019re a supervillain. As the other player\u2019s demon, you tempt that supervillain with more power in exchange for greater and greater acts of evil. But beware! If you\u2019re TOO evil, your demon can drag you kicking and screaming right to Hell. It\u2019s sort of like the Legion of Doom crossed with the Lucifer-centric parts of Sandman. (And maybe The Exorcist if you're not careful.)\nBetter Angels was published in 2013 after a great Kickstarter campaign. A standalone adventure is available, too, plus a ton of free online resources. \nNow we have the first full-size campaign book for it: No Soul Left Behind.\nEEEEVIL for a Cause\nWritten by Caleb Stokes (No Security), No Soul Left Behind features ten adventures covering an action-packed (and demon-packed) year at a charter school in a troubled neighborhood. The player characters start off as ordinary teachers or students just trying to get by. When things go really wrong for the previous batch of supervillains, these non-villainous normals inherit their demons.\nTime for a thought exercise. Let's say you\u2019re a more-or-less good sort who suddenly has superpowers \u2014 and you have a demon that constantly demands ridiculous acts of crime. What do you do? How about you commit those over-the-top superpowered crimes \u2014 and you try to save the world along the way. Or at least the city. Or maybe just the school. I mean, you do what you can, right? \nNo Soul Left Behind works as a perfect introduction to Better Angels, because it lets you introduce everything to the players at the same time as their characters. And if you\u2019re a Better Angels veteran looking for new adventures and villainy, how do you like the sound of TWO HUNDRED PAGES of new adventures and villainy? Yeah. We like the sound of it, too.\nNo Soul Left Behind is completely written and playtested but it needs cash for art, page design, and printing. We thought about invoking our own patron demon, Capitalos the Endlessly Demanding, for aid, but first we\u2019re turning to you. \nIf we hit our main goal, we\u2019ll produce No Soul Left Behind as a 200-page black-and-white paperback book, loaded with art by Brett Barkley and Kurt Komoda (the illustrators of Better Angels itself).\nBeyond the main goal, we\u2019ll have stretch goals for new chapters in the book covering supervillain powers, devilish devices, printable tools to help with play, bonus characters, and so on.\nAnd if we get enough stretch goals, we go FULL COLOR HARDBACK.\nAnd then we start adding conversion kits for Fate and Wild Talents and Mutants & Masterminds and Savage Worlds and \u2014 and who knows what!\nThe Power of Dice Compels You!\nStill not convinced?\nHow about you listen to ALL of No Soul Left Behind run by the author, Caleb Stokes, in 13 episodes.\nOr listen to the Better Angels scenario \u201cThe Good, the Bad, and the Hunky.\u201d\nOr listen to a Better Angels game run by the author, Greg Stolze.\nOr \u2014 no! You need no further tempting. Capitalos the Endlessly Demanding has already insinuated himself into your heart. Your mind burns to read this book. Your fingers itch to hold it, paperback or hardback.

But that's still just the beginning. \nGenji will need to memorize over 1,000 characters before he graduates from elementary school. Too many students of Japanese simply give up after the first year or two.\nKanjilicious is going to change all that\u2014for any beginner. We are going to turn rote memorization into a game\u2014many games\u2014so learning the basics isn't so intimidating. Learning games are fun, efficient, and ultimately more effective. \nFlash Cards from the Future\n5-Sided Flash Cards\nKanjilicious starts with mobile flash cards, divided into sets by grade, textbook, or JLPT level. Each individual card has 5 screens of data illustrating each character's meaning, and as well as examples of usage. \nBeginners can quickly review:\npronunciation and reading\nstroke order\nvocabulary\nconjugations\nWe're also taking advantage of the best of the iOS interface by keeping everything clean, simple and intuitive. \ngesture controls\nnative animations\na rhythmic taiko soundtrack\nGame Your Japanese\nOne-on-one in real-time\nOur first game is a simple one-on-one practice test against a challenger, in which she who answers the most prompts correctly, in the shortest amount of time, wins\u2014QuizUp meets Duolingo for Japanese.\nGameplay Animation\nYou can:\nChallenge friends and classmates\nTrack your won-loss record\nSet personal bests\nJoin leaderboards\nResearch shows that the use of gamification in education improves retention, increases motivation, and raises performance. We are raising a nation of gamers, why not take advantage of the grammar of games and put it to use here, as a tool for learning.\nAbout Saren and Genji \nI'm Saren. I am not a developer. Genji and I have all these crazy ideas and we need help making them happen. I will be the Producer and I can rally a team to make all the little things happen. But we need professional help with design and development.\nI have spent the last 12 years working in digital agencies like AKQA, JUXT and Perficient, project managing the creation of digital experiences for brands like Nike, Sprite, Red Bull and Sony Pictures. I know what needs to be done, and I know people who can do it. \nI lived in Japan for two years and studied as hard as I possibly could, and I still only managed to achieve a 3rd grade level of literacy. A couple of months ago, when my 6 year-old started Japanese school, he began to study his written characters in earnest. We realized that we had a lot of app ideas we couldn't find anywhere else that could really help him ramp up his study more quickly\u2014and frankly help me review what I'd previously learned in Japan.\nThis is why we started Kanjilicious, but we know there are lot of students, here and in Japan, that could play these games and learn along the way. So we want to invite you to help do this together.\nThe Funding\nWith a budget of $15,000 raised here on Kickstarter, I will initiate a 30/60/90 day plan to get version 1.0 into the app store. It will take 30 days to finalize the UI and Design, 60 days to build a beta and begin testing, and 90 days to come out of testing and into the app store.\nVersion 1.0 will have the full set of hiragana, katakana and the first 6 grade levels of kanji - covering the first 1,300 characters.  The kana and Grade 1 kanji will always be free. In time, additional grade levels and special sets will be available as an in-app purchases. Revenue will sustain growth and more features.\nThis is a passion project first and foremost. We're not really in it to make money. We just want to have and share an awesome app.\nStretch Goals\nGenji and I have a roadmap of additional features we would love to include should we be able to raise funds beyond the initial $15k. \nThe three primary elements of our stretch goals are simple: \nadditional mobile platforms\nadditional games\nadditional languages. \nKanjilicious is a gaming platform and it's cool games that will make this work. We will launch with a simple memory game, but we have ideas for a number of other smaller, more casual and social games. \nIf we can raise over $30,000 we would be able to build out our next game idea, as well as get started on a public API for community built games.\nWe also want to be cross-platform as quickly as possible. If we can rise above $40k we will also be able to launch an Android version later in the fall.\nPlease give whatever you can.

You can listen to it, or dance to it if you are so inclined. Laugh, cry, or feel just about any other type of emotion. Most importantly here, you can create an atmosphere with it.\nI am quite the avid gamer, and I happen to know that creating an atmosphere for your roleplaying games is important for both you and your players to have an even better experience. This project is about making music to fit that goal. Not just your generic music however. The goal for this project is to write music for fantasy style roleplaying games, but with a more eastern feel to it; Think Japan and China.\nSo what am I making exactly?\nI am making a background soundtrack that will excite any group of tabletop samurai!\nI will be writing 6 tracks. Each track will be of a particular theme that will be 10 minutes long and fully loopable. Having it be loopable means that you can keep looping the track for longer scenes in the story (like fight scenes).\nYou can check out my concepts on this page. they are right below the video in case you missed them.\nImagine an epic fight scene with thundering drums behind it, or a mysterious string instrument playing arpeggios slowly as you enter a forest filled with tiny spirits. The game masters job is to tell a compelling story that draws their players in. This can be done without music, but with music the story that you tell intensifies significantly. Imagine a movie without any music. Sure, it might still tell a good story, but once you add in the music, that is when people start sitting at the edge of their seats. Music can do the same thing for the atmosphere of your roleplaying games.\nWhy eastern themes?\nI have a thing for ancient Japanese culture and if I could, I would totally be a samurai. On top of that, I love the instruments and the themes that tend to originate from these areas, especially what can be done with a Koto. One of my most favorite past projects was an alternative soundtrack for the second season trailer for \"The Legend of Korra.\" After having finished that I knew that I wanted to write more, which eventually culminated in to this project.\nWhat am I using?\nUnfortunately I don't own a Koto (although it is definitely on my to-purchase list) but I do own and have the licenses for several sound libraries and programs.\nThis music is all being written in Sonar X2 using East/Wests Quantum Leap sound libraries which is where I get all of my eastern (and not so eastern) instruments. I will also be using Motu's Mach Five software and iZotope's Iris software for sound design and synthesizers.\nI have also been toying around with an electric drum that I have which also has some of the sounds I have been using.\nWhat are the rewards?\nNo matter what level you back me at, you will at least get some music. Everything is going to be available as a digital download through dropbox. When the rewards are finished I will email everyone a download link with their rewards.\nThe Audio downloads will be of your choice of audio formats including .wav, .mp3, and .flac.\nThere will also be cover artwork for those backing $10 or more, and exclusive artwork for those backing $20 or more. These files will be in .png or .jpeg format. As an add-on, there is a third work of art that can be added on to any backer level as well.\nCommercial Use?\nIn the case of any rewards that include\" commercial use\" this means that you will have the right to use those tracks for anything commercially. Any tracks you have commercial use for can be used for anything that might potentially make you money or otherwise as long as you are not selling the track on its own. Just make sure to mention where you got the music.\nThere is also an add-on that allows you to get commercial use for one track of your choice. This can be taken multiple times to get commercial use for more tracks.\nCustom Tracks?\nFor rewards that involve me writing tracks for you, it will be best if you start messaging me immediately before or after you pledge so that I can begin working on concepts as soon as possible.\nThe Rewards!\n$2: You will get one Eastern themes track of your choice. You will make this decision when the reward surveys are sent out.\n$10: You will get all 6 tracks from the Eastern themes soundtrack plus the cover art as a digital download.\n$20: Full soundtrack of 6 tracks plus the cover art and exclusive art as digital download.\n$50: The full soundtrack plus both pieces of art as a digital download, plus commercial use for 1 track of your choice.\n$450: Have a 10 minute long track written specifically for you. Plus full soundtrack, cover art and exclusive art plus commercial use of the track written for you.\n$3000: Have a full soundtrack of between 55 and 60 minutes written specifically for you with full commercial use of of both this soundtrack and the primary soundtrack.\nAdd-ons\n$25: commercial use for a track of your choice.\n$15: Second exclusive art download.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am extremely confident that I can get this project finished by the time I have set to deliver.

He would shout that the world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago.\n--The Dunwich Horror, by H. P. Lovecraft \nThe Game\nThis is not your typical murder mystery.\nYou've probably been to a murder mystery dinner party before, and if you haven't you probably know how they work. First, the host sends each guest an invitation with the description of a character; a week or two later, the guests show up in costume to a dinner party. At some point in the evening there is a \"murder\", and the characters work together to find out which member of the group is the killer. The games involve an interesting blend of detective work and improvisational theater.\nHow is The Lurker in the Library different from these other murder mystery games? For starters, in this game there is nothing as insignificant as a murder--instead of searching for a killer, the eight guests try to find out which of the group has been possessed by an alien intelligence bent on dragging the Earth to a non-Euclidean plane populated by gibbering horrors. Meanwhile, another guest is secretly a member of an eldritch cult seeking to hasten the planet's invasion by nameless blasphemies. The cultist will actively mislead and confuse the other characters as they try to prevent the destruction of all life on Earth.\nSecond, this game has some unique and innovative gameplay features not seen in any other game of its type. This is a social game, and successfully finding the cultist and exorcising the alien intelligence will tax your ability to interrogate and find discrepancies in testimony. All characters will have free reign to lie at will; the outcome of the game will depend on each player's abilities to deceive and detect deception. And one special secret feature will turn the entire game on its head... \nThe Project\nFunding this project will allow me to finish producing the game and print and ship the first 50 copies. The $1500 budget includes $400 for artwork, voice acting, and other production costs, $720 for printing and shipping of 50 units, $150 for Amazon and Kickstarter fees, and $230 of margin for anything unexpected.\nThe components of the game are typical of the murder mystery dinner game genre:\nA host's guide with all the information needed to run the game\n8 character guides with instructions that players will follow while playing the game\nAn audio CD with a game introduction, soundtrack, in-game instructions, and endings\nThe following is the project timeline. This is a nearly-best-case-scenario timeline; it is possible that delays will push this schedule back, but I'm optimistic that I'll be able to finish even sooner than outlined here!\nJuly 18th: The Kickstarter funding period ends; I'll make final revisions and tweaks to the script as pledges are collected.\nAugust 1st: I'll receive the funds from Kickstarter and get my illustrators and voice artists started. Meanwhile, I will begin the design and layout of the documents.\nAugust 29th: I will add the artwork to the project documents and edit the project audio.\nSeptember 5th: I will send orders to my printer and CD manufacturer and deliver the digital copies of the game!\nSeptember 26th: The documents and CDs will begin to arrive; I will assemble the printed games and begin mailing them.\nOctober 3rd: All printed games will be in the mail.\nOctober 17th: All printed games should arrive in US homes, well in time for a Halloween event! International copies will arrive a week or two later.\nReach Goals\nIf funding exceeds my minimum goal, I have several reach goals that will add more awesomeness:\n$2500 Goal: Improved Art\nIf I can exceed the minimum funding goal by $1000 I will be able to commission higher-quality art for the game.\n$4500 Goal: Invitation Postcards\nIf I can exceed the minimum funding goal by $3000 I will be able to include invitations. Each printed version of the game will have 8 postcards, each with a character's image and background story.\n$9000 Goal: Additional Game!\nIf I can exceed the minimum funding goal by $7500 I will write and distribute a second murder mystery dinner party game! The second game will only be available for digital download, but it will have the same high standards of production as the original game. Everyone who receives a copy of the original game will also receive the additional game.\nI'm completely open to suggestions of other ways to make this game as awesome as possible.

The printers that I will be working with have excellent track records, and I am confident that they will meet my expectations, both for quality and timeliness.

It is an age of heroic legends and valiant sagas. And this is one of them...\u201d\nSimon Washbourne, creator of Barbarians of Lemuria, says:\n\"I always thought Barbarians of Lemuria (or BoL as it has since become known) was pretty good when I designed it, but it wasn\u2019t until much later that others were given the opportunity to see whether I was right to think that. Thankfully, by and large they did.\nIt started in about 1992 or thereabouts. I\u2019d just re-read Lin Carter\u2019s Thongor books and decided to run a campaign set in his land of Lemuria. I wrote the rules on a few sheets of paper, drew a couple of maps and away we went. Whilst we were playing the game, my players commented that this was probably as good, if not better than other games out there and that I should publish it. But then every gaming group says the same about their own homebrews \u2013 very few go on to publish and even fewer succeed. The campaign eventually ended and I put the rules away and we moved onto other games.\nThings changed by the early 2000\u2019s. Designers were beginning to find a growing market for their own niche games, so I decided to showoff BoL to the world. Some time in 2003 I re-wrote it, threw in a few pieces of art I\u2019d done for some UK fanzines years before and still had lying around at let it loose. It\u2019s still there on 1KM1KT. \nIt took a while, but feedback started to come in. People were reading BoL\u2026people were playing BoL\u2026and, even better, people enjoyed playing BoL. There were even suggestions I should publish it commercially. So, in 2007, I did.\nI published the first edition of BoL in print through LULU and in pdf via RPGNow. It sold very well in both formats, even though the artwork wasn\u2019t great. So well in fact that a French publisher proposed a deal whereby he would publish a French translation and I would receive all the artwork that would be in the French edition. I jumped at the chance and BoL: Legendary Edition was born. All it needed was wider distribution; this was where Cubicle 7 stepped in.\nThrough Cubicle 7, BoL: LE got the exposure it needed and hasn\u2019t looked back. It has inspired people to run it in genres other than sword and sorcery and it has been translated into German, Portuguese, Catalan, Japanese as well as French, as mentioned above. Other genres for BoL, include Dogs of W*A*R (men\u2019s action/adventure), Barbarians of the Aftermath (post apocalyptic), Honor & Intrigue (swashbuckling derring-do) as well as other spin-offs, such as Jeff Mejia\u2019s Legends of Steel: BoL Edition. Others are in the works.\"\nNow it\u2019s time to update BoL! The Mythic Edition is the best version yet - it takes all the ideas from the fans that have made BoL into the finest sword-and-sorcery system there is and makes it even better. Mainly it\u2019s just more of everything: more creatures, more adventures, more background and setting, mass warfare, sea battles and so on. There are some rule changes, but these just make the game even more straightforward so you can just get on with the action! \nAll in all, we're excited to bring Barbarians of Lemuria: Mythic Edition to you, and hope you are just as pleased with this fabulous game. \nThe draft manuscript of Barbarians of Lemuria: Mythic Edition is 99% complete, and for a \u00a31 pledge you will receive a full copy of the draft pdf.

Think of BoL Everwhen as the BoL core rules, with such options as fear, firearms and vehicle combat (to name a few), for all your pulp setting needs. Included in the book will be hints and tips for using BoL in just about any pulp-type genre, including several sample settings such as \"Barbarians of the Forgotten Suns\", \"Warriors of Callisto\" and \"Guns of Laredo\".\nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to produce both a pdf and physical book of Barbarians of Lemuria: Mythic Edition.

Eventually, our dog, cat, or rabbit got old, sick, or hurt.  They never stopped loving us, though, just like we never stopped loving them. \nWhen the time came, they went to a big farm in the country, where a nice old couple took care of them, and they had plenty of room to play with other animals just like them.  Dogs had big fields to sniff and scamper though, rabbits laughed and raced their friends, and cats got to climb all the trees they wanted and hide in cool dark shadows.  They were all happy and warm, and they got just a little bit chubby from all the table scraps they got to eat.\nTheir stories didn't end there, though.  They were just getting started!\nSanta Claus himself -- the protector of kids and their dreams -- needed their help, after they got better.  Sent deep undercover, far from their old homes, their mission was simple:  live a happy life, love the humans around you, protect the Nice from the Naughty...\n...and never, ever, trust a squirrel!\nMittens the Destroyer, Ranger, and Vixen are looking forward to meeting you! Well, okay, not Mittens, he's kind of crabby sometimes, you know how cats can be. But the girls are!\nStrays are the thin furry line that protects our children and their dreams.  It's dangerous and vital work because the Naughty have agents, too!   Every kid knows, there's all kinds of bad stuff out there.  Mean people, spooky haunted houses, thieving animals who search through trash and make big messes, unstoppable metal juggernauts who honk real loud, and terrible black-and-white monsters who stink up everything around them!  There's a lot of scary stuff when you're a kid!\nLuckily, Strays will always be there to protect us. Young and healthy forever, beloved by the new families they touch as they move from home to home, Strays will do whatever it takes.  They'll bark and growl and bite if they have to, but they're also great at just watching and listening, giving kisses and snuggles, and soaking up all the belly rubs and treats we can give them! \nSTRAYS RPG: THE PITCH\nStrays is a kid-friendly role-playing game, powered by the fantastic Fate Accelerated Edition game engine.  \nFrom The Fox and the Hound to Watership Down, Homeward Bound to Heathcliff, Lady and the Tramp to Oliver and Company, many of us grew up on great movies, tv shows, and books, full of lovable, brave, animal characters being heroic and adorable in equal measure.  We shivered in the cold with Balto, we watched Benji escape from the bad guys, we all knew Lassie would somehow save the day, and we sang along with the Aristocats. These classics have been joined more recently by plenty of neat animals in modern films, too, so there's a new generation of kiddos that love the same types of stories.\nStrays wants to combine the timeless appeal of those great stories with role-playing games.  With Strays, you can introduce children (or adults!) to the RPG hobby with a fun, light-hearted, game focused on the cutest heroes ever, your pets!\nGet your kids into gaming with an RPG based on pets, it's way easier than trying to get your pets into gaming with an RPG based on kids!\nBoudicca, here, is actually a great DM (Dogmaster)! She runs games all the time, mostly 'cause she likes being bossy.\n STRAYS RPG:  THE--HEY, WAIT, WHAT'S AN RPG?! \nRPGs, \"role playing games,\" are sit-down games where you and a couple other players gather around a table and tell neat stories together.  Most of you get to run one character -- a Stray in this game, one of these cool critters! -- and one of you runs the whole entire rest of the world (kind of like a movie director, when everyone else is playing one character in the story).\nStrays is mostly using an existing RPG game's rules, Fate Accelerated Edition, which is handy because that way Wordsmith Games didn't have to make up a whole new game from scratch!  The rules of an RPG tell you when a character succeeds or fails at something tricky (like fighting a mean dog, or jumping really far), almost always by rolling some dice and doing a little bit of easy math. \nEvery character has their own sheet to say what they're good at, what they struggle with, and what they need their buddies to help them with.\nThat adorable blonde puppy in our cover artwork?  That's Ranger!  She's new to being a Stray, which means she's built just like a normal starting character (you can even play her yourself, if you want to!).  This is a look at Ranger's character sheet, to show you what a finished Strays character looks like.  \nWe're also gonna interrupt the character sheet with lots of stuff in [brackets], to try and explain what a few of these things mean.  Normally, a Strays character sheet is really pretty short and quick to read.  Don't worry, we explain all this stuff waaaaay better in the actual book (that's what it's for!).\nRANGER\nHigh Concept: Good-Natured Puppy Dog\nTrouble: Easily Excitable\nOther Aspects: I Love Playing; Pick On Someone Your Own Size!; We\u2019re A Pack \n[A Stray's Concept, Trouble, and Aspects are all the key things that describe that character, and that give you some bonuses or hindrances in gameplay.  Your High Concept should say what kind of animal you're making, because that also says a lot about your character and tells folks kind of what to expect.  A Trouble is a downside, and in this case it's that Ranger is still pretty young and eager, and she can go a little crazy.  Her other Aspects round out her character, showing you how energetic she is (which can help with all kinds of running, jumping, and catching), how she knows she's way bigger than Vixen or Mittens, and describes her protective, loyal, nature.]\nAPPROACHES\n[Approaches are how a Strays character tries to do stuff!  Are they being Forceful and trying to bash a gate open by ramming into it, Quick by trying to nimbly hop over it like a free-running doggie, or Clever by figuring out how to work a latch?  Every character has the same Approaches, but they assign the numbers however they want to, to show what their character is good at!]\nCareful: Average (+1)\nClever: Fair (+2)\nFlashy: Average (+1)\nForceful: Good (+3)\nQuick: Fair (+2)\nSneaky: Mediocre (+0) \n[So here, we can see that Ranger's a big lovable mutt, as graceless and tough as a retriever, as smart as a border collie, as eager as a puppy, and as loud as an elephant.]\nSTUNTS\n[Stunts are neat things that your Stray is extra good at, or tricks they know, that help them do things better than their buddies.]\nI Know Who\u2019s A Good Girl!: Because I Know Who\u2019s A Good Girl, once per session I may declare that I clearly understand what a human is trying to say.\nBig Loud Barker: Because I am a Big Loud Barker, I gain a +2 bonus to Forceful attacks when I\u2019m being loud and intimidating.\n[Who's a Good Girl?  Ranger is!  She's really good at figuring out what humans are trying to say, and she can do all kinds of tricks.  Most Strays don't understand most humans very well, but Ranger's got a real knack for it.  Also, she's super loud and enthusiastic when she's warning her friends about danger, or trying to scare away a nasty squirrel or something!  She gets a bonus when she barks her fuzzy head off, and most of the time she can even win a fight that way instead of having to bite anything.]\nTANGLES\n[Tangles are one of the new things we're adding to Fate Accelerated Edition, some optional rules that make it a little more complicated, but add some unique Strays flavor.  Most of them offer a situational bonus and a situational penalty, kind of like a Stunt but with a downside.]\nFamily Stray: Because I was a Family Stray, I suffer a -1 penalty on scavenging rolls on my own, but gain a +1 bonus on begging rolls towards friendly humans. \n[If you want to take a Tangle to show it, your background can affect your character in lots of different ways.  Right now we're just showing off one Tangle for Ranger, and it's a pretty straightforward one.  She's used to having a family of humans look after her (and vice versa!), so she's still not that used to having to pick through trash or anything gross like that.  She's really good at looking adorable, sitting, and shaking paws, though, so she gets a bonus at trying to get most humans to give her a treat.  Bacon's her favorite!]\nSTRAYS RPG: THE PLEDGE REWARD TIERS\nLITTLE HELPER: Our purest reward is a heartfelt thank you, and us adding you to Santa's official Nice List for the year (right there in the book, letting everyone know you helped us out).  No matter how little you're able to contribute, every penny helps, and we really appreciate your interest in the project. \nELECTRONIC HELPER: Our first product-based reward is going to be the PDF copy of the Strays RPG book.  You'll get the full Fate Accelerated Edition rules-set we're using (with a few tweaks), along with plenty of awesome artwork, the fluff and background of the halfway-magical Strays world, and info on how to build a character, get a campaign going, design your own Strays neighborhood, and all that fun stuff.\nADOPTION PAPERS: Next up is a physical copy of the Strays book.  It's just like the PDF, but real enough you can smoosh a spider with it if you really have to.  It's gonna be a \"digest\" sized text, 6\" by 9\", featuring a gorgeous full-color cover, gloss film laminated on, and #60 paper for all the juicy interior goodness.\nHIGH ROLLER:  This tier gets you everything included so far -- our thanks, a pdf, and a print copy -- and also folds in our custom Fate dice!  You'll get a set of four blue Fate dice (minus sign, blank, pawprint-for-plus-sign) in the mail along with your print copy of the book!\nAlso, from any reward tier from ADOPTION PAPERS on up, you can add a set of custom Strays Fate Dice for just $12.  The HIGH ROLLER tier just adds the dice on for you, badda-bing-badda-boom! \nRETAIL HELPER: This tier provides multiple print copies of Strays, all in one deal.  It's intended for brick-and-mortar stores who might want to dedicate a little shelf space to the game, because brick-and-mortar stores are awesome and a brick-and-mortar store that wants to sell Strays is even awesome-er.  Nothing fancy here, just five copies of the book, all bundled up and offered at a discount!\nNow, on to the fancy options!  Some of that artwork I've mentioned?  It's gonna come from you guys and gals, the pledgers!  You can immortalize one of your pets (or a neighborhood critter, or your buddy's pet, or whatever) as a Stray right here in the official book!  If you pledge at the appropriate tier, send us in a photograph of your pet, and we'll add it to the book.  Be sure to tell us their name, too!\nPHOTO ADOPTION PAPERS:  At this tier, we'll take your pet photo and run it through some manipulation/filter programs in order to give it a black and white illustrated look.  This is a little easier, so it's a little cheaper, and is the affordable option to get your furry friend into the book.\nILLUSTRATED ADOPTION PAPERS: This one's our deluxe option, where one of our professional illustrators will use your submitted photo as inspiration, and then will draw up your furry friend doing something adorable, awesome, or both at the same time.  It'll be sketched up, inked, finished, captioned, and slipped into the text (and the lore!) in order to immortalize your pet as a Stray, and let everyone know how awesome they are. \nYou can see some samples of these pieces -- along with the photographs that inspired the illustrator, Jason Kerr -- right here on this Kickstarter page (psst, the finished products won't include the photograph the way these sample pieces do, we just wanted to show you how the inspiration piece translated to the final picture)!\nPET PORTRAIT:  Alternatively, we've got an extra option for folks who might not want their pet to take on airs and start acting like snooty models, but who still want some neat artwork.  Instead of submitting your pet's photo for illustration and being added to the text, you can shoot us a picture and we'll have it drawn up as a PET PORTRAIT by Chelsea!  She'll draw up a sweet 5\" by 7\" piece of full-color pencil artwork, and we'll just tuck that mamajama right into your print-copy book before we mail it to you.  This one won't be on the pages of every Strays book out there, but instead you'll get to keep a gorgeous piece of artwork (perfect for framing). \nThe PET PORTRAIT tier will get you something a big like this. So regal! So amused! So full of feline superiority! Ain't it adorable?\nICONIC HELPER: our last, but certainly not least, tier.  There's some space on the back cover of our book, and we've got a fourth \"iconic\" sample character to build!  Right now you can see our cover trio, Ranger, Vixen, and Mittens the Destroyer (you'll learn more about them later in the Kickstarter).  But if you're really excited about Strays, and you really want your pet to be a rock star, we've got an option for that.  With our top tier reward selection, you can sit down with Wordsmith Games and help us design our fourth iconic, who'll be in full color on the back cover of the book, and scattered in several pieces of artwork on the inside.  Submit a few photos of your pet, or make up your perfect pet-buddy and talk us into it!  Either way, this one's the deluxe model of our interior-art rewards, and anyone picking this pledge also makes it to the top of our Nice List and basically gets everything else we can possibly give 'em, the print copy, pdf, and a set of Strays Fate dice.\nSo whether you want your pet added to the rolls of Strays or would prefer your very own private portrait to hold onto, we've got you covered with our team of professional illustrators!  And remember, any tier with a physical copy of the book included, you've got the add-on option to also order a set of custom Strays Fate dice for $12 (see below, under \"add ons\").\nThere's a reward tier just for you, so take your pick and click away!\nVenus McWeenus is ready to help out Santa by going on adventures!\nSTRAYS RPG: THE GOAL/BUDGET\nRight now almost all our initial artwork is in, we've got about 2/3 of the text written up and done (though writing it is on hold while we all panic and run around in circles for the Kickstarter month), and we're eager to really move on to the next steps.  That's where you guys and gals come in!\nSome of the main expenses we've faced and/or are facing soon are:\n$300, misc legal fees (LLC creation, legal mumbo-jumbo, bank paperwork stuff to keep it all professional).\n$1200, initial artwork (including the cover and logo, just a minimal amount of interior stuff)\n$600, layout, editing, proofing (this is super cheap right now, but we'd really like to be able to spend more)\n$400, start-up print run, add-on dice manufacturing, shipping (to HERE, shipping to YOU is part of your reward tier)\n???, Kickstarter and assorted payment fees (variable amount, since they're a percentage)\nNow, this won't all TOTALLY be paid for by this initial budget, but it's the part that Wordsmith Games LLC -- Russell Zimmerman and his gracious and lovely and enormously supportive and long-suffering wife -- can't afford to pay out-of-pocket.  We've gotten the ball rolling already, but $2,500 would let us get this book out there for folks to have fun and tell stories with. \nSTRAYS RPG: THE STRETCH GOALS\nSo what happens if we get over that initial $2,500 hump?  Well, things just get even cooler!\n$3,250: More Art!  If we hit this stretch goal, we're pouring it back into the book by doubling our initial interior art allotment per illustrator (not counting fan-submitted options from rewards).  More pictures for you, more money for illustrators.  Win/win!\n$4,000: More Better-er!  The next $750 brick is gonna increase our editing and layout budget.  We'll bring in some old pros at this sort of thing, buy some software upgrades, and get additional sets of hands and eyes working on making this the best book it can be.\n$4,750: More Money! We've got some great artists lined up, and, having been a freelancer ourselves, we want to \"give back.\" This will mean bonuses for all our great illustrators.\n$5,000: More Helping!  If we can double our initial goal, Wordsmith Games wants to help the real \"Strays\" out there, the animals who haven't quite made it out to a magical farm.  Our donation might go to the ASPCA, it might go to a local no-kill shelter, it might go to K9s For Warriors -- we'll take suggestions from pledgers when the time comes -- but if we get here, we'll give 5% of our Kickstarter profits to a worthy cause, helping animals somewhere, somehow.\n...and maybe more to come!\nDommie wants to help, and she has THREE bones to donate!\n STRAYS RPG: THE ADD-ON\nWho'd like an awesome set of custom Fate dice for just $12?\nFour dice per set! You're ready to play!\nMade by the master craftsmen of www.customdice.com, these 16 mm dice are high-quality, available in an easy-to-read blue and white color scheme.  Fate dice (sometimes called Fudge dice) are six-sided dice made with two plus signs, two minus signs, and two blank sides (more on the dice in the book, honest!).  Finely etched, these dice replace the \"plus\" sign for Fate gameplay with a big pawprint, the Strays mark (so it's like your character is giving you a high five every time you roll well)!\nThese dice are available for $12 per four dice, and/or as part of our HIGH ROLLER reward tier.  You can include these dice as an add-on to any reward tier with a physical/printed copy of the book, with no additional shipping cost (just increase you pledge amount by $12 for every set you want and you're good to go!).\nI know they look delicious, but they are NOT candy.

This it the first time we've done this! That said, we're going to make this whole process as transparent as we can, to help account for that (including, for instance, sharing our stretch goals up front).\n\nThe risks we're facing are those every new would-be RPG company does, especially here on Kickstarter. Missed deadlines, unreal expectations, getting carried away with hype, and overlooking all the little things that trip up a new game. \n\nHowever, we've run the numbers and we're confident we'll be able to power through those difficulties. We're using the awesome Fate Accelerated Edition game engine, with just a few tweaks, in order to leap one big hurdle. We're confident that Fate Accelerated Edition is a game engine we can trust, and that leaves us to focus our attention elsewhere with this initial foray into Kickstarting. \n\nWe've got solid estimates on production and distribution costs and timetables. Furthermore, we're doing our best to keep stretch goals and add-ons to a minimum, to keep from cluttering up our Kickstarter with extra stuff. All too often, that often gets first-timers in over their heads or cuts into production quality by adding production quantity. We've established a very conservative basic goal, and we're trying to maintain realistic expectations on our end.\n\nLayout, proofing, and editing have built-in failsafes with other freelancers who are ready to step in and fill the gap if extra work is needed, when the size of the project and the Kickstarter budget demand it. \n\nFinally, our delivery estimates are pretty conservative. They were reached through the utterly scientific method of writing up our actual estimates, then doubling them (to account for things going wrong), and then rounding up to the end of the academic semester. \n\nKickstarters can miss deadlines and be disappointing, or they can rock your socks off by putting together a finished product and getting it to you earlier than you expect it.\n\nWe want to be sock-rockers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Bonus Update: New Project I'm Working On!", "update_content": "Howdy all,\nI hope everyone has been enjoying their Strays books (and a few bonus sets of dice!), and please holler if y'all have any more ultra-last-minute concerns or questions.

Details below!\nThis is an aggregated list of upgrades I made via Update posts:\n1. Probably sooner than planned! I decided to build 8 extra months in to the creation time of the base deck in case something goes wrong; I hope this hasn't scared away too many backers, but I would rather be safe than sorry. I'm hoping to have the final base deck by between December and January, just FYI!\n2 An art upgrade: At 250 backers, I will upgrade the art in the core instructions and make a short Demon Hunters-themed video. We ride!\n3. Free app if ever made! For backers of $25 and more, even if I don't make the app as part of the campaign, I will make sure you get it for free on as many platforms as I can arrange it. I do intend to make it, since I want it!\nNEW! 4. Adventure planning! At $50 or more, you will receive invites to 4 private Google+ video Hangout sessions of approximately half an hour each, where I will help you prep a custom campaign guide (like an Adventure Guide for your home campaign)! Dates and times TBD (partially by Backer vote). Each session will work through different parts of the process.\nNEW! 5. Custom adventure! At $75 or more, you receive the adventure planning invites as above, plus I will work with you individually via email and Google+ Hangout (one hour video time, when convenient for both of us) on your custom campaign guide! If you have a specific game world, or want help prepping a guide for an IP I don't have the license for, I can still help you this way! \nWhat is The GameMaster\u2019s Apprentice?\nUPDATE: Check out these video demos of the story generator and the game engine!\nHow to build a story seed from scratch:\nHow to run an RPG with no GM required:\nThis is a deck of 60 double-sided cards (so, 120 unique card faces) meant to help design and run adventures for role playing games of all kinds.\nIt is...\n1. A source of idea-sparking suggestions, snippets, and randomizers!\n2. System-neutral: Crunchy and roll-heavy to narrative and diceless!\n3. Setting-neutral: Modern, fantasy, high science, pulp...\n4. Multi-purpose. Plan adventures or generate complex NPCs ahead of time, or fill in the gaps during play!\n5. For groups of any size, including solo-games with no GM!\nWhat is on each card, and what will I use the deck for?\nThere are essentially 14 randomizers on each card, and all of them have more than one use. I demonstrate a few in the Kickstarter video, and you can check out the updates for more detail, but here are a few of the things you can use the cards for:\n1. Generate story seeds, encounters, or random events. You can instantly create random encounters or plot twists on the fly--or if you prefer to plan ahead, you can use the cards to spark ideas before game night, giving you more time to work the results into your story.\n2. Create fleshed-out NPCs. Even just a new name you aren\u2019t recycling can be handy (and that\u2019s what I started this whole project to help me with), but the GameMaster\u2019s Apprentice can also supply NPCs with details for their background and personality.\n3. Run complete RPGs with the solo-game engine. I have always been a huge fan of adventure game books. However, they have one key problem: eventually, you run out of book! The GameMaster\u2019s Apprentice solves that problem by supplying such a vast array of possible random events and characters that you can actually use it to run entire role playing campaigns. \nWhy a deck of cards? And why 60 of them?\nI love random tables, and I love games with deck-based game engines (especially some of the better-known ones based on Lovecraftian and Arthurian mythologies). Drawing one card is easier and faster than rolling on random tables, and since I play many collectable card games, a deck of 60 cards feels just right in my hands.\nAnd, fortunately, doubling the sides gives us 120 card faces. So what? Check out the early updates for info on the math behind the cards!\nWhat do I get for backing?\nYou get DRM-free PDFs (for both digital and print-and-play use) of:\n~The deck! 120 card faces; the print-on-demand version has one card per slide, but I hope to include several versions that would be friendlier to home-printing.\n~The instructions, which include descriptions of all the card elements and general usage guidelines for both story planning and solo-game running. This will ONLY be available as a PDF, even if you get the printed deck as well.\n~A High Fantasy Adventure Guide; like the exclusive and stretch-goal Adventure Guides, this is a series of adventure seeds and explanations of how to use the cards to generate and run a story in a particular genre (in this case, high fantasy), about 15 pages long, depending on the amount of art I can afford and how the formatting shakes out. This will ONLY be available as a PDF, even if you get the printed deck as well.\nYou also get the Kickstarter-exclusive content (see below) and, if you want, access to order the physical deck for the production cost (approximately $7+ shipping, paid at the time you order the deck from DriveThruCards).\nIf you want to support the project beyond the lowest levels, you also get beta access (digital and/or physical), and can optionally add names or other creative elements to the cards, sponsor a genre-specific adventure guide, or even get your very own completely customized, personal version of the GameMaster\u2019s Apprentice for your home campaign!\nWhat is the point of beta access?\nUnlike many digital beta access products, this beta is more like early access; the beta deck is already complete and has been test-printed. It is a fully usable version of the deck available NOW, but I want the final product to be the best version possible.\nNames, belongings, and sensory snippets may be in need of tweaking to be as useful as possible. There might be technical glitches with the process that result in typos, overfilled or mysteriously empty text fields, and so on. If you get digital or physical beta access, your feedback and error-checking will be greatly appreciated! With your help, the GameMaster's Apprentice can be completed even more quickly, and will achieve an even higher standard of quality.\nThe instructions, adventure guides and, of course, stretch goal content are not yet complete, but beta access allows you to get these as soon as they are finished, and even if they don't require heavy editing, you will still have the opportunity to start using them sooner, and your feedback will shape them as well!\nKickstarter Exclusive Content\nBecause I want to ensure that backing the project here provides real, tangible (and yet digital. So intangible?) benefits over simply waiting to buy it later, I will include the following with all reward levels:\n1. A modern-horror adventure guide. This quick-start guidebook to generating modern terror will be made available to backers ASAP, and will NOT be bundled with the core product when it is sold commercially in finished form. It WILL eventually be sold as part of an \u201cexpansion\u201d to the GameMaster\u2019s Apprentice, but that won\u2019t be for over a year.\n2. A tavern and ship name generator. This was cut from the cards a while back, but is amusing enough that I\u2019ve kept it around as a set of tables. This will never be made available anywhere else!\n3. Thanks! Your name (if you wish) will be included in a special section of the credits, so your support will never be forgotten!\nStretch Goals!\nThe Demon Hunters by Dead Gentlemen Productions, LLC\nMost stretch goals will be genre-specific Adventure Guides (suggestions, story seeds, and rules for using the base deck of to emulate the chosen genre) or decks (new art and tailored text to match the genre), and anyone who backs at the $10 level or higher will receive PDFs of all stretch goals we achieve (when they are complete, or when they reach beta, depending on backer level).\nSo here is a partial schedule of what goals will be reached at what funding levels. If we hit the initial funding goal, I will update this with more detail, but I'm thrilled to announce our first major stretch goals right away!\nAnyone already familiar with the Dead Gentlemen and their properties The Gamers and the Demon Hunters needs little explanation. Everyone else: if you are looking at gaming Kickstarters, you should check these guys out! The first two stretch goals for this campaign will be an Adventure Guide and a deck of cards for the world of the Demon Hunters. A world much like our own, but populated with demons, werewolves, sentient fir trees, syphilitic vampire ninjas... and the Demon Hunters who keep them in check! Take a look at the Orientation Video for more information on this brave group of almost-certainly-going-to-die individuals.\n$5500: Horror Deck\nI left this one out earlier because the base deck can be used for many kinds of things, but a genuine Horror Deck to go with the Kickstarter Exclusive Horror Adventure Guide is in the works!\n$6500: Age of Sail Deck (working title/era)\nOne of the requests I've received that can't be readily covered elsewhere! I'll have to do some research to be sure I cover the right things here, but I'm looking forward to the challenge!\n$7500: Age of Sail Adventure Guide (working title/era)\nTo go with the deck!\n$8500: Major art upgrade!\nMore art! Specifics as we approach this goal.\nAnd then, of course, at $10000 we hit the app!\nAn app?!? A long-term goal of mine is to investigate creating a phone and tablet app to do the same things these cards do. However, since I do not have the resources to even begin that process yet, this Stretch Goal would allow me to get started! I cannot guarantee a particular method of fulfillment at this time, but I would look into making it available on as many platforms as possible!\nUpdate bonus! For those who back this project at $25+ (Master level and above), the App will be free on as many platforms as possible, even if it is created at a future date and not as part of this project!\nFulfilled by DriveThruCards!\nAny level with a physical reward provides you with access to purchase the deck of cards at production-cost (see \"What do I get for backing?\" above) from DriveThruCards and DriveThruRPG; beta physical decks are delivered the same way. There are (at least) three very good reasons to do it this way:\n1. This is fastest and least expensive for backers. You only pay for shipping once, rather than paying to have your deck shipped to me, and THEN to you, which takes both time and money, and risks human error on my part.\n2. This is least likely to get lost. You can have the deck shipped wherever you want it, even if you move, without needing to worry about my record-keeping abilities.\n3. DriveThruCards and DriveThruRPG have the facilities and experience necessary to fulfill Kickstarter campaigns of any size, and the successful test-print they ran for me shows they can produce the GameMaster's Apprentice at a high level of quality.\nWho are you, and why are you on Kickstarter?\nI\u2019m Nathan Rockwood, a long-time gamer who has been freelancing as a game writer and designer for almost a decade. I\u2019ve written and designed for several role playing games, such as Serenity, Battlestar Galactica, Demon Hunters, and the Cortex Classic Core Book, as well as a few other small projects. I also teach both English and Video Game Design at the high school level in the state of Maryland.\nTeaching is an absolute blast, but I\u2019ve never given up my love for tabletop gaming. I\u2019ve been working on The GameMaster\u2019s Apprentice as a side project since 2006, when I started it as a much simpler deck of cards to help me name NPCs in my own games; I've changed and modified it more times than I can count, and now I've finally decided to take the plunge and see if anyone else likes the concept!\nWhile I would love to make money from my game design, I am explicitly NOT budgeting this Kickstarter with payment for the time I\u2019ve spent working on the deck. Instead, I\u2019m hoping to use the funds from this project to cover the financial obligations that come with publishing The GameMaster\u2019s Apprentice. I need to pay my graphic designer and the artists who have helped me make the project presentable--as a freelancer myself, I absolutely refuse to make any money off the project until AFTER my freelancers are paid for their work.\nThe rest of the funding-goal money goes to the fees and taxes associated with any Kickstarter project, with a small margin built in because I am told by those who have already run Kickstarters that it is impossible to avoid forgetting something. And that\u2019s it--there is no profit built into the goal, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to wind up spending even that \u201cextra\u201d on art, because art is expensive but SO IMPORTANT to building the right atmosphere in a game!\nAlso, I love the Kicking it Forward campaign (as detailed at http://kickingitforward.org/), so I pledge to follow their example! If this project funds, 5% of profits made by the finished deck will be continually circulated back into other peoples\u2019 Kickstarter projects.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDespite ample freelancing and writing experience, I am new to the realm of publishing my own work. I have done my best to ensure smooth delivery of rewards, including paying for a test-print completed by DriveThruCards so that I can be assured of their quality, speed, and cost. \n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t yet command space and time. Any surprise issue that delays their printing or shipping system-wide would obviously delay the shipment of rewards; however, I have been working with their customer service and publisher support reps for over a year to make sure I understand the way their system works, and they have been amazingly responsive. They also have experience working with Kickstarter projects, so I feel that the only things likely to delay them would be the sorts of problems that we can\u2019t predict: Aliens, zombies, or that super-volcano everyone is worried about.\n\nOn the other hand, if I am not careful to budget my time, I may take longer than expected to finish the final edit of the deck (which I am hoping you backers will help me playtest as quickly as possible!). In order to avoid this, I have already done two rounds of editing with the help of three other people, so there will be less to catch and fix. \n\nI have also reached out to, and will continue to seek the advice of, those more experienced with Kickstarter than me, in order to ensure that I meet production goals in as timely a manner as possible.

The wielder inherits his meaning from our testament.\"\nOrthodoxy is a roleplaying game about the politics of rewriting a religion and reconstructing a city. Throughout the course of the game, players will contribute to writing a text that will unify the land under a single religious ideology. Each player roleplays the upper echelons of a religious sect consisting of up to 5 people, including the sect's Lector and his closest followers. Over the course of the game each sect will narrate chapters of the text in order to make their virtues the most prominent in the newly-written text, cementing their power in the reformed religion. To do this, they'll need to engage in intrigue, bribery, compromise, and maybe even murder.\nWhile Orthodoxy's default setting is a pseudo-Roman Christian city, the system is designed to be entirely portable to another setting. Since the core system of Orthodoxy is designed to simulate intrigue and debate, the potential settings are limitless. It isn't even necessary for your game to have a religious focus. The first Stretch Goal will likely be a sample Cyberpunk setting in which a hacker (the scribe) needs to compose a new code (the text) out of a set of contradictory programs (the players). The more that we raise- the more sample settings will be included!\n\"The Gods gave us intrigue so that we may feint the irreligious.\" \nDUELLIST\n Each player adopts the role of a religious sect, a deviation from the central religion which, in the past, governed over the city. Each sect is composed of two virtues, a Primary Virtue and a Secondary Virtue,which are selected during Sect Creation. Through the course of play, each sect will attempt to insert their virtues into the text by narrating a story or offering a law which supports their ideology. The players' goal is to ensure that their virtues dominate the creed of the new orthodoxy, and thus, the reformed city. Each sect will likely only share a virtue with another sect, encouraging both collaboration and competition.\nPUBLISHER\nThe GM assumes the role of the scribe, an emissary of the central government, who is responsible for writing the official text and keeping the city from slipping into revolution. As each day passes, the situation in the city becomes worse. The scribe will need to barter the city's influence for the sect's wealth and power in order to keep the central government in power. If the city falls into revolution, the game is over. However, the Scribe has the most individually powerful role- the opportunity to craft the city's future. He walks a fine line, but as a shrewd negotiator, a proficient scribe can reunite the city and make the secular state stronger than ever.\nAGITATOR\nThe final role is the Governor, a 3rd party who is absent for the entirety of the Campaign. However, at the end of the campaign, the Governor reviews this newly-written text and judges the level of influence each virtue has upon the reconstruction of the city. After completing his review of the new orthodoxy, the Governor will return the text to the players, who will then take turns narrating the city's future from the perspective of their Primary Virtue.\nASSASSIN\nThere are optional rules for playing a campaign without a Governor, although it is highly recommended to include one in the game. Anybody with a half-hour on their hands will suffice to play the Governor.\n\"In the eyes of the scribe, ink and blood are only a shade apart.\"\nThe game uses a d6 dice pool system to streamline the flow of debate, inspired by games like Fiasco, Houses of the Blooded, and Beyond. Play proceeds around the table, giving each sect the opportunity to propose a chapter, oppose a chapter, and barter their influence for the inclusion of their virtues in a chapter. While luck and dice are used to control the process of debate,only crafty politicking, brute negotiation, and clever storytelling will ensure your immortality in the city. To facilitate this, each sect has an 8.5\" x 14\" screen, allowing the player to pass notes in secret, conceal their wealth, and reference the rules with ease. \n\"The only difference between a stain and a precedent is the dignity it is awarded.\"\nThe Liber Veritas is a blank book designed to record your newly created religious text with helpful information for the Scribe and the Governor throughout its pages. Two copies of the Liber Veritas may be added to any Patron or Sponsor order for $10. \n\"Conviction without writ makes a hollow sound.\"\nIn addition, if Orthodoxy RPG achieves 25 Likes on our Facebook page or 25 tagged Tweets on Twitter, I will include rules for playing as a Heretical Sect!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OrthodoxyRPG\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OrthodoxyRPG\nBacker credits will be listed in the PDF of Orthodoxy in order to conserve space in the print edition*.

This is the 21st century and no one wants to admit they\u2019ve helplessly watched a classmate get sucked into the pages of a library book, come face-to-face with an angry ghost, or glimpsed a creature prowling the campus by the light of the full moon.\nCollege is where you make your own choices and find out who you really are. You can keep your head down, hoping to avoid the twisted horrors you sometimes catch out of the corner of your eye, or you can face your fears, fight the darkness, and protect your campus. Everyone starts out as a wide-eyed freshman, but if you survive four years at ETU you\u2019ll be a hero.\nThe Books\nThe ETU line debuts with two, 96-page, full-color books in our graphic novel format. We expect to deliver the PDFs in July. Assuming the Kickstarter is successful, the physical products should ship no later than November.\nThe core book, East Texas University, offers a well-rounded syllabus of character creation, new Edges & Hindrances, gear, Setting Rules, and tours of campus and nearby Pinebox, Texas. For advanced credit, read the section on rituals and talismans. Finally, the Adventure Generator and encyclopedia of miscreants is sure to light a creative spark in even the most humorless campus parking enforcement officer.\nWelcome to ETU. Classes start this Fall. Register now.\nThe second book, Degrees of Horror, includes a full-length Plot Point Campaign designed to take your class from Freshmen to graduation\u2014if they survive! We can't say much about the plot, but suffice to say it's a Big Deal for Pinebox...and maybe beyond. Degrees of Horror also features a full course-load of Savage Tales that work equally well with the Plot Point Campaign or your own epic saga.\nA Plot Point Campaign and additional Savage Tales for ETU!\nThe Game Master's Screen\nThis tri-fold screen features a scene of chaos on campus on the player's side, and all the important charts and tables for the game on the GM's side. It also includes a full-length 32-page adventure by Ed Wetterman\u2014we'll give you details and show you the cover in one of our first updates.\nWhen students at East Texas University talk about surviving college, they mean it\u2026literally!\nAll pledge levels include unlocked digital rewards and free domestic shipping!\nAdd Ons!\nWe have four Add Ons for everyone who pledges at the Junior level Reward or higher (if you order an Add On and only pledged for PDFs we'll refund your Add On pledge since this doesn't cover the shipping).\nThese items will be available as Add Ons after the Kickstarter closes, but at a higher retail price. To get the lower prices reflected below, include them in your pledge (you can tell us exactly what the extra funds are for when we mail out the Final Survey).\nNote that you must pledge at the Junior level or higher to order any of these items as Add Ons.

Interested yet? Check out why we think P3 is going to rock your world\u2026\nP3 is a fast, narrative and easy to learn roleplaying game; designed to be perfect for younger players, busy Game Masters and newcomers to the hobby!\n The game system is packed away within a short and sweet 65 page full color perfect bound Core Rulebook!\n Features a flexible magic system that encourages creative thought rather than memorization of a spell list.\n Boasts a character creation process designed for better roleplaying and a unique Prophecy mechanic for a fresh take on character development.\nA young sorceress loving the P3 magic system! Art by Tom Kyster\nThe emphasis of P3 is story, story and even more story. The rules and mechanics revolve around this pillar of the game, so players can walk away from the table every game session with stories and memories to share for years to come.\nAs a rules light game system, P3 makes strides in its design so that the fun of roleplaying games is easier to get into for a wider range of people! With an extremely short but concise Core Rulebook, P3 allows new players to quickly jump into the game without an endless amount of rules to have memorized.\nDice: Beyond having the Core Rulebook all players need to play are a handful of dice. In fact it can be any kind of dice! P3 has been purposely designed so players can play with any dice readily available; be they six sided, twenty sided or even a pocket full of coins. On top of that Game Masters in P3 have no need for rolling dice, making their job easier.\nMagic: Too many spells is not always a good thing because too many choices can overwhelm any sort of player! To counteract this, P3 uses a simple and unique magic system that hosts 13 different spell schools for players to choose from. When a player character has knowledge in one of these 13 types of magic they can attempt to cast whatever sort of spell they can imagine that fits within the parameters of the spell schools they are familiar with. Imaginative players can even combine these schools for some pretty darn spectacular results! Altogether the magic system is fluid, fun and allows for spontaneous creativity at the table. Personally I\u2019ve had a blast witnessing players use magic in P3 to influence the environments around them. A great example of this is when an innovative player using the Water School of magic, cast a spell to turn a pond of water into a stairway of ice in order to reach enemies above!\nPLAY\n\nCombat: Without a game board or grid to play on, combat in P3 is described in broad strokes. This way game sessions can run smoothly and the fun can keep on going! With players limited to having only one action per turn, combat moves fast with a success and failure system that allows for interesting events to occur in the heat of battle! In a nut shell P3 allows for martial characters to feel like the heroes within an 80\u2032s action movie!\nA dwarven cleric burns undead with holy magic! Art by Tom Kyster\nPlay How You Want: Although combat is refined to be smooth, quick and awesome: combat is not the definition of P3! Players within P3 are granted talent points to improve their characters not by killing enemies, but by completing game sessions! If by either sneaking, lying, cheating, fighting or talking your way through an adventure, all are justifiable ways to play P3!\nHeroes battle the demon that lairs at the heart of the forest. Art by Tom Kyster\nBecause action follows the heroic characters the players portray, much of P3 is dedicated to the Character Creation System! Designed to be easy-to-learn, the creation process is packed within a single chapter and is classless in nature, allowing players to play the way they want! As a whole the creation process subtly forces players to create characters with detailed backgrounds and personalities that aren't just fluff, but impact their stats in a major way! When determining character choices, players affect a character\u2019s\u2026\nPast and who the character once was. This incorporates where a character comes from, their past social status and what they were skilled in\u2026\nPersona and who the character is. This category of choices includes a character\u2019s mentality, flaw, desire, love and hate\u2026\nPLAY\n\nProphecy: Character customization doesn't end after the player creates their character for play. With the Prophecy mechanic there is no such thing as a static character whose personal story remains the same throughout a campaign! With a simple but fun semi-random mechanic, a character\u2019s prophecy adds story driven ingredients that create group determined destinies for characters that promote change, character development and consequences!\nPLAY\n\nWith the philosophy that gaming is supposed to be a fun activity, P3 is designed to wholeheartedly accommodate Game Masters by making their jobs easy!\nP3 alleviates the juggling act that Game Mastering calls for with a system that prevents the Game Master from rolling dice so his focus can always remain on the story and the fun of the game!\nOn top of that  P3 implements a system for easy NPC(Non-Player Characters) and Threat creation so prepping for a game session is a total breeze and can be done on the fly!\nA party of heroes at audience with a wise ruler. Art by Will Fenholt\nOther than a handful of great board games and RPGs as inspiration, major influences for P3 are primarily the people I have attempted to teach RPGs to. But because the mechanics of my favorite games were difficult to teach to younger siblings and friends alike, I figured RPGs would be more widely accepted if one were to ever be streamlined for ease of use and instant fun.\nAnd although not a game itself, I tend to listen to a great deal of podcasts which eventually led me to listen to an audio segment called \u201cThe Questions Three\u201d from the guys over at the Order 66 Podcast. The segment included three questions for Game Masters to ask their players for better roleplaying during game sessions. These questions included, \u201cwhat does your character love, what do they hate, and for what reason are they adventuring\u201d. Afterwards I sought to have better roleplaying within my own gaming group, but I had a horrible time getting my players to answer these three simple questions. Eventually this desire to have these questions answered led me down a road of events that became the foundation for P3, a game system that implemented these questions in its design.\nDespite the fact that all the work is done creating the game system and writing the Core Rulebook, a lot is still needed to get  P3 going! Ambitious as I am, I lack the ability to create awesome pieces of artwork for the game and require money to compile illustrations needed to make the P3 Core Rulebook really come alive with truly awesome artwork! And heck, I'm pretty young, hard working and well...a student, this doesn't really translate into a rich and comfortable lifestyle. As such, I need some help funding this awesome project and that is why I have come to Kickstarter!\nAs a kid, I was sold into the whole D&D concept immediately after I left the theaters having seen the Lord of the Rings. The next day I recall getting my hands on the 3.5 Dungeons and Dragons Player\u2019s Handbook in some dirty old game store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Throughout the remainder of my childhood I remember pouring hours of time simply looking through various rule books, captivated by all of the radical artwork within!\nFor this reason, I believe that artwork is a powerful force that can potentially allure newcomers into gaming and can inspire existing gamers. For this reason the greatest portion of the Kickstarter funds are to be dedicated for the sole purpose of commissioning additional artwork for the Core Rulebook itself.\n Beyond acquiring artwork necessary for filling the Core Rulebook with really cool illustrations, funding is required to print the initial books provided by the rewards levels during the Kickstarter campaign and to constitute the shipping prices to deliver the books themselves. Heck on top of that the funding goal has been set at its level to additionally necessitate the 5% of the total funding that Kickstarter withdraws as part of their fee and the extra 3-5% that is given to Amazon Payments as part of their transaction service.\n$9,000- Chapter Images: At this stretch goal the P3 Core Rulebook will feature seven new pen & ink illustrations for each chapter cover page in the book.\n$9,100- Kindle Conversion: The P3 Core Rulebook will be converted and formatted for the Kindle device.\nSo you like what you see, but want more?

The art will be available on our website so you can design your own custom mods, expansions, and house rules for Dungeon Dice and the icons on your custom dice will match those on the originals!\n\nWe've also teamed up with Common Man Games to create a custom dice pack for their award winning game Police Precinct. And if enough people are interested in that pack, they'll receive a mystery die for SNITCH Free of charge! That die will also become available for others to claim with their pledge rewards once it's unlocked. More details on Update #8. Both Police Precinct and SNITCH are available through their current KS project.\nWith the announcement of full-color printing, we also announced a collaboration with Nick Hayes to bring his game Chunky Fighters to the masses.\nTesh of Project Khopesh ran a successful Kickstarter project several months ago for metal Tinker Dice and would like to see those designs made reality in plastic as well. So he has shared with us the designs for d6 Tinker Dice as well as Fudge Tinker Dice.

Magnus is working with us to produce dice featuring the suits of his award winning six suit deck of cards, the Decktet.\nCheck out Update #11 for a much fuller list of collaborations.\nThese are just a handful of those that have shown us their designs. And there are many more of our 1,000+ backers with design ideas they haven't shown us.\nThese designs will all be available when the project gets funded, but what should be even more exciting is not the designs I've created, but the opportunity for ANYONE to create their own custom design and make it available to the world. There are literally infinite possibilities.

One of the most critical aspects of making this project a success is getting the word out to everyone that might be interested. But we need your help to do it.\n\nIf you help us out by sharing the project URL on Facebook or including it in one of your Tweets, we'll reward all of our backers by unlocking new colors of paint to fill the designs with. We figure this is better than paying for advertising because it allows us to reward even more for your support!\n\nWhile you're at it, feel free to follow us on Twitter @CustomGameLab and like our fanpage on Facebook:\nJust for clarification, these are not new colors of dice, but new colors of paint to fill the engraved designs with. New colors of dice will be unlocked through monetary stretch goals.\nDesigns we can promise to be available upon success of this project, include the following themes: Promo dice, Elvish script, weapons, winner's dice, loser's dice, tetrominoes, moon phases, standard d6, dragon dice, chess dice, ninja dice, card suit dice, crown and anchor dice, fudge dice (standard and outline), text based dice, cheater's dice, binary dice, weather dice, Mayan dice, Emoticon dice, Chinese dice, Roman numeral dice, hexadecimal color choosing dice, RGB color choosing dice, and math constants dice. The Myst based D'ni numeral dice have also received approval for commercial licensing from Cyan Worlds Inc and will be available.\n\nWe also fully expect hundreds if not thousands of other designs to be made available soon after our website launches as our backers begin to create their own designs and make them available for others to order. Rest assured you will have plenty of great options to choose from!\nIn fact during the course of this project, we have already begun working with some designers to announce designs they will be making available on our site. We've been sharing these in our updates, but also plan to add some of them to our main project page. There's some exciting new partnerships forming - go check out the updates to see some of the cool designs you'll be able to choose from!\n\nCredits: Music for the video, \"Please Listen Carefully\" by Jahzaar available on FreeMusicArchive.org under Creative Commons licensing, and some of the graphics on this page came from various contributors on Game-Icons.net There will be more specific attributions for the graphics on our site once it is launched, if you would like more info feel free to contact me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will be working with multiple manufacturers to source all of our equipment and supplies from lasers to dice to paints. There's always a potential risk of delay or other issues when working with companies you have no control over. However, I have already been in contact with each of these companies to ask questions and receive samples. Each of them is a reputable company and has been very responsive so far.\n\nI've been asked what I will do if this project is wildly successful - will I still be able to deliver? Not only will I still be able to create your dice, but the process get's streamlined even further the more it scales. If it does well enough, I will be able to buy an even faster laser with a larger engraving area allowing me to engrave more dice at once. If necessary, I have room in my shop to add more than one laser as well (plus available help as necessary).\n\nIn short: Overfunding is a good thing, it would allow us to get better equipment, potentially more equipment (which will both speed things up), and more dice options for you!\n\nAs with any Kickstarter, this will be a large time investment not only in creating dice but also in delivering them.\n\nI have worked from home for the past couple of years, and am prepared to dedicate the time needed to deliver your rewards for this project!

This isn't about history, mummies, or aliens building pyramids. This is about kicking badguys in the face. This is not a historical game. Its Egyptian setting is that of cursory knowledge gleaned from museums, comics, and the occasional action movie. You don't need to know about 25th Dynasty Egypt, you merely need to be excited about kicking a bad-guy in the nuts so he doubles over and you use him as a step to get you high enough to drive your knee into another bad-guy's face.\nEgyptian style.\nYou can hear me talk about Nefertiti Overdrive - among other topics - on the Tell Me Another podcast.\nYou can read a little more about Nefertiti Overdrive in my interview at Dorkland!\nYou can see (well, mostly hear) a game of Nefertiti Overdrivehere or view it at the bottom of this page. You can download the audio of the fight example here and the audio of the non-combat challenge here.\nAn example of a fight using Nefertiti Overdrive.\n An example of a non-combat challenge.\nThe Princess by Kieron O'Gorman\nNefertiti Overdrive will include a simple system intended to speed through play while encouraging lots of crazy antics. Like the systems from Centurion: Legionaries of Rome and Sword Noir: A Roleplaying Game of Hard-Boiled Sword & Sorcery, Nefertiti Overdrive will allow for character customization in a rules-light context that focuses on player characters succeeding within their niche. \nThe book should be between 110 and 130 pages in length, and will be presented as a 6X9 softcover.\nAlong with these rules, Nefertiti Overdrive will provide seven pre-generated characters with an alternate version of each and two adventures designed specifically for them. These adventures are designed to introduce your group to legendary Egypt. Maybe you are the Princess, the God's Hand in 25th Dynasty Ancient Egypt seeking her niece, lost in the chaos of the Assyrian invasion, or her loyal bodyguard, the Etruscan, who will give his life for her but would rather take the lives of any who threaten. Could you be the Spartan, haggard veteran and perfect warrior, commander of a group of mercenaries? Perhaps you are the Amazon, his lieutenant and archer beyond compare. Then there is the Monk, who has travelled here from the East, opposing the suffering of innocents with his lightning-fast fists and razor-sharp spear, and his friend and comrade the Serpent, a doomed assassin haunted by the Devourer of Souls. Finally, there is the General, who has failed to halt the Assyrian advance but refuses to fail again.\nThese characters cannot be threatened by mere Assyrian soldiers. They are the heroes of this story, and heroes can do the extraordinary. From the Spartan bursting through a wall of mud bricks to attack an unsuspecting squad of Lower Egyptian collaborators to the Amazon putting an arrow into the eye of the Assyrian commander the others can only barely identify in the distance to the Etruscan leaping from rooftop to tower in pursuit of an Assyrian spy, the heroes get to do amazing feats that defy physics and possibly common sense.\nFurther ideas and hooks for continuing campaigns are provided to help the GM craft a story beyond the two included adventures. Nefertiti Overdrive also includes rules for the players to create the kind of adventures they want the GM to run, providing the GM with a skeleton of description and ideas on which to build a campaign. The process mechanics allow the players to bid and therefore prioritize what kind of information they want to contribute.\nThe book will also include an appendix called Shadows of Wang Zhi, adapting the Nefertiti Overdrive system to Ming Dynasty China as a setting in the same ahistorical vein as Ancient Egypt. This section will provide a backdrop for adventures closer to the roots of literary wuxia, though with plenty of wire-fu action thrown in. The characters play virtuous agents of the secretive North Depot (entirely fictional), a police organization aimed at ferreting out corruption and criminality within the Eastern Depot, the law enforcement department oppressing the people of Beijing. The characters come into conflict with the eunuch Wang Zhi, a creature of the powerful consort Lady Wan pretending to be a loyal agent of the emperor.\nYou can find more information on the Sword's Edge Publishing website.\nThe Etruscan by Kieron O'Gorman\nGraphic designer extraordinaire Rob Wakefield has designed some covers from which we can choose, and each backer at the Acolyte of the Scarab and above will have the chance to vote for their preferred cover.

My fiction writing has been presented in Forgotten Worlds, On Spec, and Black Gate.\nThe Amazon by Kieron O'Gorman\nShould our Kickstarter reach $7,000, all backers at the Acolyte of the Scarab level and above will receive Daredevils of the Water Wastes as a PDF. This is an alternate setting for Nefertiti Overdrive, with slightly different character Attributes but the same focus on detailed narratives and intense action. It will be a minimum of 2,000 words and will include art. A print version will be available to all backers at cost.\nThe late 19th Century sees cataclysms and inundations. Plague tears through the survivors, bringing with it the terrifying undead. Humanity is merely collateral damage as the mindless Ghouls and the cunning Wraiths vie for dominance.

As the name implies, Sword Noir is inspired by the novels and stories of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Robert E Howard, and Fritz Leiber. It's Conan seeking for the Maltese Falcon, it's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser in the Big Sleep, set in Lankhmar, it's hardboiled crime fiction in the worlds of sword & sorcery. You can learn more about Sword Noir here.  \nKiss My Axe: Thirteen Warriors and an Angel of Death. $3.00 PDF. $12.00 Print. Kiss My Axe is the grandfather of Nefertiti Overdrive. This was the first game in which high octane, cinematic action was hardcoded into the system. Kiss My Axe is a role-playing game of Viking adventure, focused more on the heroics of the sagas than the violence inflicted upon innocents. You can learn more about Kiss My Axe here.  \nCenturion: Legionaries of Rome. $5.50 PDF. $19.50 Print. This was my first Kickstarter. In Centurion, players play scouts, spies, or special troops marching under the eagle of Rome. The book supports games in the Late Republic (from the Second Punic War to the rise of Gaius Marius), the Civil Wars (from Marius to Augustus), the Principate (from Augustus to the Crisis of the Third Century) and the Third Century, when order collapsed, warlords rose, and the Empire divided, providing ideas for characters and adventures. You can learn more about Centurion here or at the Kickstarter page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest risk of any Kickstarter \u2013 as any backer of Kickstarter is bound to learn \u2013 is delay. Delays can easily happen, especially when one is reliant upon others to provide parts of or support for one's project. I cannot promise that I can deliver on time, however the dates provided are based on my experiences with my successful Centurion: Legionaries of Rome Kickstarter. If I can get rewards to you sooner, I will, but I am confident that the target date is practical, and delays will be minimal. I will be communicating with you as milestones are met or missed so you will have visibility on the onward movement of the project.\n\nCertain key parts of the project \u2013 art, maps, editing \u2013 are being undertaken by third parties, so there is always the possibility of failure at some point. Failure of any of these will result in delays, possibly substantial delays. I promise to be open about problems I encounter, letting you know if we have a problem, how it is being addressed, and updating the due date.\n\nInternational shipping is always an issue. International orders will be printed and shipped by Lightning Source, the print provider for Drive Thru RPG, which has an international presence and can ship internationally more efficiently than other providers. This does not mean that shipping will be without a hiccup.

Fresh from his success with Bigfoot and Tiny Epic Kingdoms, we are delighted to present his latest title: Of Mice And Lemmings.\nA beautifully designed game for between five and eight players, Of Mice And Lemmings is set at the end of the Great Depression. A time of struggle for humans, you can only imagine how hard life could be for the rodent population of the United States. Our story focuses on a small group of Mice and Lemmings who live near each other on a reasonably comfortable riverbank, opposite a newly built cheese factory...\nEvery day the Mice gaze hungrily across the river, dreaming of reaching the factory and filling their hungry bellies with delicious cheese. Soon, they decide on a plan: bridges will be built from one side of the river to the other, and they convince the Lemmings to assist! Cheese will be plentiful and life will be great again! The Lemmings, however, have other ideas. Their love of water means that they want to sabotage any bridge building that might be happening...\nAt the start of each round, players are given a single role card that they must keep secret. This will put them on either the Mice team, meaning that they will want to build the bridge, or the Lemming team who want the bridge to fail. Players are also give a handful of bridge cards, numbered from zero to ten, that they will use to try and reach the other side of the river... or not, depending on your secret role.\nLemmy likes the water so much, he brings his own snorkel. Meanwhile, George is ready to go at a moment's notice...\nEvery round, you must do one of two things: either play a Bridge card from your hand or flip your secret role card, revealing yourself to the rest of the players. However, once one player has shown their true colours, no other players may do so for that round - only bridge cards may be played! \nThe higher the card value, the more sturdy the bridge section!\nOnce all players have played a single card, the total value of the bridge is worked out. Depending on how many people are playing, a certain target must be reached - 35 in an eight-player game, for example. If the target has been reached or beaten, the player who revealed themselves that round successfully gets across the bridge, scoring a point if they are a Mouse but nothing if they flipped a Lemming! However, if the bridge was a failure, a Lemming will score a point while a Mouse gets nothing. You show whether you made it across the bridge or not using a flippy card with cheese on one side, and a big splash on the other!\nIt doesn't matter whether you're a Mouse or a Lemming - success always nets you a cheese, failure sees you in the water!\nPlay continues until all Mice and Lemmings have been revealed, then end-of-round scoring takes place, where the team with the majority of successes each score a further point! More rounds take place (the amount dependent on how many people are playing) until a winner is found... and that's about it!\nScott's game becomes surprisingly tricky once you get to grips with it - and we promise that won't take you long! Working out when the ideal time to reveal yourself requires perfect timing, as you don't wish to show yourself too early - members of the other team will take advantage and ruin your plans! However, as play continues and you know the identities of more and more people, things get simpler - but then they have less cards in their hands, so will they be able to play the right ones for your role? You'll have to work hard to be successful!\nIt may sound tricky, so we've put together a helpful video to explain it all...\n At the moment, the game contains 56 bridge cards, 15 role cards and 8 flippy cards (showing Cheese and Splashes), plus the rules you'll need to play. Cards will be poker sized, with \"full bleed\" art - in other words, no borders! \nKeep Running in the now traditional Sprocket Games bag! Thanks to the excellent Stephen Candy for the great photo!\nWe've had a few people get in touch with us to see if they can add copies of our previous games to their pledge... and who are we to refuse?

Michael's own Keep Running! is another game that's ideal for big groups where a terrifying bear won't stop until everyone is eaten bar one survivor! \nFox & Chicken though... well, that's not available, sadly. Not from us, anyway, as we're delighted to say that the lovely folks over at HUCH & Friends will be releasing a multi-language version of our farmyard favourite later in the Spring! \nIf you'd like copies of either FrogFlip or Keep Running! as well as Of Mice And Lemmings, simply add the amount shown above for each copy. When the campaign is complete, we'll ask if you've put in for any extras on the pledge manager!\nWe know that you're going to love playing Of Mice And Lemmings - we've had the prototype here at Sprocket Towers for some time and everyone we've got around the table with has thoroughly enjoyed this surprisingly duplicitous game. In fact, we are so sure that your gaming group will like the game, we guarantee it - when you get your copy of the game, if you don't like it, we'll refund your money, no questions asked. Sure, Sprocket Games may be a small company but we stand by the quality of our games. If you have any questions, ask in the comments or catch Michael on Twitter.\nWe're keeping this one very simple - just two pledge levels mean that we can focus on getting the game made and delivered to you as quickly as possible. Everything you need to play can be found at the lower level - you'll just need to provide a way to keep track of scores yourself - but if you feel like splashing out (sorry!) you can always go for the more luxurious set that comes in the now traditional Sprocket Games bag, complete with thirty glass water drop tokens for scoring.\nAs with all three previous Sprocket Games titles - Fox & Chicken, FrogFlip and Keep Running! - the incredibly talented Stephanie Burrows Fox is on art duties. Each Mouse and Lemming has their own individual card where their characters truly shine through and we're very grateful indeed to have her on board once again!\nSo, will your Mouse make it to the other side? Will your Lemming plunge into the river? And will you be on the team who reigns supreme?

After Essen I was told I have an inoperable condition that will likely see me in a wheelchair in a few years which has basically hurled me into a tailspin that I'm only starting to pull out of now.

We were originally assured by our printers that wouldn't be an issue, that they'd be able to pack the cards themselves and would send the lot to us.

No. Could we find anyone else who'd do it within budget? No. So, we've made an executive decision and are going back to our tried and true solution - drawstring bags.

4-5 years ago I and several friends realized that the game systems we were using just didn\u2019t cut it anymore so we started to develop Sigurd\u2019s Guide To The Galaxy [called Merc.NET at the time];

Originally built on the Fate 3.0 version, we then made additional adjustments to keep it current with the most recent Core version.\nThe game comes with over 100 pre-built powers, and over 100 Special Effects and Limits to customize each power. But we didn't stop there, just as you can expect to see rules for building your own Stunts, we also provide you with the rules for building your own powers, special effects, and limits using the same basic Fate rules. \nDaring Comics RPG does not use the \"Strange Fate\" powers system. All powers and special effects are constructed using the same basic foundation as creating stunts, with some obvious expansions to cover the myriad effects powers can have. \nWe've taken the eight (8) Dev Journals and condensed them into a free PDF that talks about some powers and rules examples\u2014 things we've been posting bi-weekly over the past 4 months.

This one, based on manuscript size, is expected to be approximately 180 pages. \nInside this book you'll find: \nA full super-hero setting with a detailed history. \nAn overview of the United States and numerous foreign nations, and how the existence of super-beings has affected thier life and government. \nAn introduction to various organizations, including: Vanguard, SECT.

Keep in mind, a Kickstarter is not a product pre-order. You are pledging money that will go into actual book production so that we can get it into your hands and into retail. Which means that each Backer Level has to be balanced to not only get you whatever rewards are due, but to also make sure production can be funded. \nIn addition, keep in mind we also lose upward of 10% of all funding between Kickstarter and Amazon Payments, and then more to State and Federal taxes. We actually bring in less from a Kickstarter than the numbers show on the screen.\nProduction funding goes toward full-color artwork, additional writers, editing, covers, and graphic design.\nVanguardian, world-renowned hero, now semi-retired.\nWho is Daring Entertainment?\nDaring Entertainment has been a role-playing and fiction publisher for over 8 years, and has published close to 70 products.  \nOriginally known as Arbor Productions, our Autumn Arbor Campaign Setting for the old M&M Superlink license was a full-color hardcover that went on to become a semi-finalist in the 2008 Origins Awards (to allay suspense, we haven't submitted to any industry awards since then).  \nAs Daring Entertainment, we've been known in the Savage Worlds license for our popular War of the Dead and World of the Dead product lines.   \nWe can be found at our company website or the Google+ Group\nMeet Some of the Team \nThere are a lot of people on the team here at Daring Entertainment, and although we'd like to spotlight everyone, it would just be way too long a list. \nDave Blewer (writer): A man who needs little introduction, Dave Blewer is well-known in the RPG industry for his work on Sundered Skies, World of the Dead, Achtung!

No more than four books (in total) can be added. Remember: shipping is already included.\nTimeframe \nWe're planning to have the two main PDF books and exclusive adventures to you within roughly 6 months of this thing ending, with the print books ready to ship not long after that (depending on how long the proofing takes). Of course, when dealing with so much artwork, such a large staff, and not to mention printing and proofing, delays can happen (and likely will, somewhere). Naturally, we'll post updates in the event of any delay. \nThe Stretch Goals, as stated below, will take time to produce depending upon the title. They are designed to be product releases after the rulebook and universe setting book, so we expect them to be mainly the 2015 product schedule. \nThe original Super-National testifies before the HUAC, Washington D.C., 1947.\nStretch Goals \nEach time a Stretch Goal is unlocked, every Backer of $15 and more (the very minimum non $1 pledge) gets  it. The PDF is automatically added to your rewards. There's nothing else you have to do. \nUnfortunately, because we have no idea how many Backers the project will get, it's impossible to offer print editions of the Stretch Goals as part of the Kickstarter. However, for each unlocked goal, all Backers will receive a code to purchase the print book (where there is one) from RPGNow and DriveThruRPG for only the cost of printing and shipping. \nIt is important to note that the Stretch Goals are support for the product line, and will take time to produce and make available. The Stretch Goals are designed to serve as more than a year's worth of product releases, and will be released throughout 2015. \nAll Backers will receive the PDF edition no less than 30-days before it becomes available to the public. We're going to try to get you the print edition code to you at least 14 days before it become available for retail sale, but whether or not that is possible will depend on the RPGNow and DriveThruRPG capabilities. Worse case, you'll get the code as soon as it releases. \nAll sourcebook Stretch Goals are full-color, come with plenty of plot hooks and GM secrets to help you build your own series, and will average approximately 128 pages. \n$17,000: The Sentinel City sourcebook finishes production. This book is already in the works, and this guarantees it can get done. This book is a detailed setting sourcebook for Sentinel City, the premier location of super-human activity in the world, and covers each district, locations, lifestyle, and leaves necessary Setting Aspect slots open for your group to customize it. Plenty of NPC villains are included (the bulk of the NPCs), and GMs are provided with dozens of plot hooks to help build their own comic book series. \n$25,000: Whether you're a hero fighting crime or a villain trying to stay one-step ahead, Inside Solitaire takes you deep inside Solitaire Island, the maximum security super-villain prison. Written by John Polojac (who's worked on both Wild Cards and DC Adventures from Green Ronin Publishing), Inside Solitaire includes details on life inside the prison, the Null Therapy program where a villain can undergo experimentation to remove his powers in exchange for a shorter sentence, dark conspiracies, secret organizations, and detailed maps. The book is chocked full of villain NPCs to toss at your heroes, whether the heroes are inside investigating one of the conspriacies, or the villains have done the near impossible and escaped! John Polojac already has an initial draft done, and once this is unlocked he starts going through the book to finalize writing, characters, and prison design.\n$35,000: This goal unlocks the Daring Comics Digital Soundtrack. It includes 10 tracks plus two bonus tracks (a new remix of the two from this site), and is composed by the renowned James Semple (http://www.jamessemple.com/). This soundtrack is an excellent addition to your gaming table, with ready to play theme music, fight music, and role-playing scene tracks.\nFor a taste of the music, check out the embedded players at the top, and near the bottom, of the Kickstarter.\n$45,000: At this level, we put the Books of the Arcane into the production queue. Yep, as the title suggests, this book covers the mystic community, other dimensions, the unseen horrors, and the things that man was not meant to know\u2014 but that are waiting for you just around the corner. It also details how to build a series focused on magic and the supernatural, and includes plenty of mystic threats to help populate your series. \n$55,000: Once this level is unlocked, Galactic Guardians enters the production queue. This sourcebook takes us beyond Earth and gives more details on the Lunarians and Martians. From there, we go beyond the solar system and to distant planets as we explore the various alien races, hero organizations, galactic threats, and cosmic entities. GMs are given tips on running a galactic style campaign. \n$75,000: This level unlocks the first Daring Comics Graphic Novel (yes, an actual graphic novel). The book will be made available for all major tablet readers, and is an 88-page (four issue) story which tells the origin of Kill-Joy, one of the most dangerous and deranged villains in the Daring Comics Universe, and how the failure of the super-hero community to see the smaller issues within the bigger picture lead to the creation of one of their most powerful enemies. Kill-Joy will also feature prominently in the first Daring Comics mosaic novel\u2014 but you get to learn his full history here. Something even the super-heroes of the setting don't know! \n$85,000: This level unlocks the first Mega-Event Book for the Daring Comics RPG. Mega-Event books are ready-to-play adventures (usually 120 to 144 pages) that encompass a storyline similar to what you would expect from . . . well . . . a mega-event or crossover-event from your favorite comic book company. The adventure runs in three-acts, and will take you from its beginning all the way to a Major Milestone for your characters. It's written as a series of detailed scenes that can typically be run in any order. GMs are provided with plenty of advice, tips, and alternate subplots to use, making each play-through a little different from the others depending on the actions of the player-characters. \n$100,000: At this level, the Daring Comics Role-Playing Game gets accelerated! That's right, once this level is unlocked, we'll produce and release an edition of the Daring Comics RPG that uses the foundations of the Fate Accelerated system! Just like the other rulebook, this one will be full-color, includes everything you need to play, and will include some new features all its own.\nDetective Robert MacIntyre, Forensic Specialist in Superhuman Genetics, trapped in the Sentinel City subway.\nSpecial Backer Level Instructions \nIf you choose to back the Earth's Strongest, Unstoppable, Paragon, Mastermind, or Global Threat levels, please read the following: \nEarth's Strongest: You will be given a contract that states you retain copyright of your character (except artwork), but Daring Entertainment gets exclusive global publishing rights to the character for three (3) years, and the character will only appear within that NPC Compendium (title to be determined).

I soon realized that Fate wasn't any different from the systems we'd already been playing for the past 20-plus years.

With technology failing due to the insidious effects of the Dark Symmetry humankind must fight back against the Dark Legion hordes whilst dealing with in-fighting and conspiracy from within.\nThe Solar System is a roaring mayhem of death and war. The surfaces of the inner planets have been swept clean by the violent onslaught of the dark legions storming hordes of Nepharites, Razides, Pretorian Stalkers and Undead Legionaries. In the enormous cities of the far and distant future, heretics devoted to the destruction of humankind stalk the dark backstreets and gloomy alleys spreading their teachings of greed, jealously and war [From the 2nd Edition Back Cover]\nIn the late 21st century a growing madness of plagues, wars, terrorism and environmental collapse led to the rushed terraforming of the colonies by the major corporations, an exodus from Earth and the final cataclysmic nuclear war. It takes hundreds of years to re-establish life as we know it on the inner worlds of our solar system. Imperial, Capitol, Bauhaus and Mishima now rule from their homes in the steaming jungles of Venus, the caverns of Mercury, the deserts of Mars and the many orbitals and asteroid homes of the solar system. Luna City is a vast neutral sprawl, many hundreds of years old, built up and over the first colony and mines. \nA fateful exploratory mission to Pluto unleashes an ancient evil force 'The Dark Symmetry' upon the thinking machines of man. As technology fails (and even fights back), mankind is beset with conspiracy and corporate intrigue from within.

They were defeated long ago, they will not be defeated this time...\nAs the Dark Symmetry's malign influence on humanity grows, the Brotherhood with their strange powers, arise to unite the corporate armies as one and fight back. \nWe filled in the gaps in the original storyline, expanded the backstory and plotted secret events that will carry your adventures through a 1000 years of future history. Now you can play during the early days of the Dark Symmetry with investigations of foul cults and technology turning on mankind, through to the brutal Corporate Wars and then fight the Dark Legion as they pour forth from their citadels across the colonies. \nMUTANT CHRONICLES and related logos, characters, names, and distinctive likenesses thereof are trademarks or registered trademarks of Mutant Chronicles International Inc.

You'll receive access to a PDF copy of the Jurassic Edition playtest rules immediately as part of your pledge. As soon as you've pledged, click on \"Updates\" at the top of the page and head down to Update #1 (or just click here.) Everything you need is there!\nOnce you've done that, head to the Kickstarter comments and tell us who you prefer for the game's primary adversaries; more details on that down at the bottom of this Kickstarter page under the \"Battle Report\" heading.\nHOW DO YOU ADD-ON? Super-easy; keep your pledge backer level (such as \"FULL AGENT\" or \"TIME TRAVELER\") the same as it is now, and increase the amount of money you're pledging by the cost of the add-ons. For example, if you've pledged at $40 and want to add-on a +$7 Owl Hoot Trail PDF, you'd stay at FULL AGENT but increase your pledge from $40 to $47. When the campaign is over, we'll send you a survey sorting out all the details.\nWHAT CAN YOU ADD-ON?\n1. Deluxe Limited Edition. We're delighted to offer a deluxe, limited edition of the TimeWatch rules with a gorgeous embossed faux leather cover and a signed color book plate. I may even doodle a dinosaur on the book plate, you can never be sure. If you like, you can easily get this add-on by pledging for the Utopian Edition at the $95 tier.\nBut what, you ask, if I don't need the postcards or if I've already committed to one of the other nifty pledge levels? No problem. As long as you're already getting a physical book (at $40 tiers and above), replacing it with the deluxe limited edition is as simple as increasing your current pledge amount by $40. That's it! We'll confirm by survey at the end of the Kickstarter that you'd like the deluxe edition instead of the standard rulebook, and we'll go from there. Tah-dah!\nOne book copy in pledge levels of $500 and up will be automatically upgraded to the deluxe limited edition, unless you prefer otherwise.\n2. Additional Copies of the Main Book. Already getting a physical book, but want more than one copy of the book? Sure thing! It's usually possible to save money by going in with friends. Just add these amounts on to your pledges; when the Kickstarter is over, we'll ask you what you ordered and make sure we have it right. To add on one or more books, you must already be getting a physical book (pledges at the $40 FULL AGENT! level and higher.)\nUS/UK backers: please add +$35 per additional book. Includes shipping. (You save $5/book on your second or greater book.)\nNon-US/UK backers: $35 for any additional copies, with $35 additional shipping for up to five books. (You save $35/book on your 3rd-5th book.)\nYep, international shipping is still ridiculously expensive, and we wish we could change it; for instance, it costs us $89 to ship 2 books to Switzerland. If you're an international customer, we won't mind at all if you pick a PDF or decide to go through your local game store instead. See Shipping Details below for more information.\n3. Owl Hoot Trail PDF. Go rope yourself an owlbear! It's not GUMSHOE, but Kevin's recent Pelgrane Press game (with the inestimable Clinton R. Nixon) Owl Hoot Trail is a fantasy/old west crossover that's a ridiculous amount of fun. Pledgers at the $25 level and higher can add this PDF to their pledge for +$7, which is 30% off the normal price.\n4. Owl Hoot Trail print copy. Prefer a book you can hold in your hand? Pledgers at the $40 FULL AGENT! level and higher (ie, pledgers already getting a physical book) can add on a beautiful print copy of Kevin's and Clinton R. Nixon's game Owl Hoot Trail for an additional +$20. The OHT PDF is included in that price, as is shipping to the US and UK. International shipping is +$5.\n5. \"Stakes & Stars\" GUMSHOE PDF Bundle, up to 35% off. Want to know more about the rule system powering TimeWatch? If you back at the $25 level or higher you can save 35% and add on four great books in PDF for +$50:\nKen Hite's RPG Night's Black Agents (super-spies vs. vampires!)\nThe superb Night's Black Agent's supplement Double Tap (which includes Kevin's work)\nRobin D. Laws' space opera RPG Ashen Stars\nThe Ashen Stars adventure supplement The Justice Trade (which includes Kevin's adventure Stowaways) \nIf you prefer, you can add on just the two Night's Black Agents books in PDF for +$30, or just the two Ashen Stars books in PDF for +$25.\nIf you just want the supplements Double Tap and The Justice Trade, you can add just those two PDFs on for +$22.\n6. 96-page Campaign Supplement. Now UNLOCKED! Everyone at the $25 and higher pledge level will get a PDF copy of this 96-page campaign supplement stretch goal for free. Backers at the $40 FULL AGENT level and higher will be able to add-on a physical copy for +$20 (shipping included in US/UK, +$5 shipping internationally.)\n7. Guide to the Annotated Timeline. Now UNLOCKED! Everyone at the $25 and higher pledge level will get a PDF copy of the supplement for free. Backers at the $40 FULL AGENT level and higher will be able to add-on a physical copy for +$13 (shipping included in US/UK, +$5 shipping internationally.)\nWe've hit plenty of stretch goals, including having guest designers pitch TimeWatch missions and full campaign styles. One such designer? Kenneth Hite, author of Trail of Cthulhu and Night's Black Agents, the alt-history mastermind behind the \"Ken's Time Machine\" segment of the podcast \"Ken and Robin Talk About Stuff.\"\nYou'll find already unlocked stretch goals listed beneath these locked ones.\nLOCKED: $1,000,000,000: Time Machine! When we reach this level we'll set about arranging for the invention of an actual time machine. Once invented, we'll give chronal tours to all pledgers at the $25 level and up. Pet dinosaur thrown in for free. We're awesome like that.\nHere's the stretch goals that have already been unlocked. So much goodness!\nUNLOCKED: $105,000: NPC-a-Palooza!  You've asked for more ready-made, grab-and go characters, especially ones with a real foothold in history. As a thank you for hitting $100K, you've got it! Reach $105K, and we'll supplement the character creation spreadsheets with a number of new ready-made PCs for you to take, tweak, and play with no prep whatsoever.\nUNLOCKED: $100,000: Full Color Rulebook. Turning the black & white art of TimeWatch into full color is expensive, sure, but that's what time machines and compound interest are for. We're upgrading TimeWatch to a full color book for free!\nUNLOCKED: $97,000: Campaign style expansion 11: Chronal Horror! Monstrosities throughout history are penetrating the thin veil between worlds, from 16th century vampires to sanity-rending cyberspirits driven by hard data and cold hatred, and are destroying everything we thought we knew. You need to use time travel to help stop them... a shame, really, since it may be time travel that's weakening the veil in the first place. A horror setting of hard choices and terrible foes, crossing over with Robin D. Laws' Esoterrorists.\nUNLOCKED: $90,000: Campaign style expansion 10: A Rising Hymn! In this campaign expansion we jettison sci-fi entirely. Best described as \"It's a Wonderful Life, With Demons,\" fiends do their best to corrupt humanity into making catastrophic decisions, slowly bringing about literal hell on Earth. You play immortal time-traveling angels who work to save humanity one soul at a time, by showing mortals what was, what is, and what could be if they choose poorly. And believe me, those demons are going to try and stop you...\nUNLOCKED: $87,000: Campaign style expansion 9: The Wild Times! Inspired by backer Nanouk Harper, this campaign expansion details the early days of time travel, back when no one knew a damn thing about the timestream and equipment never worked the way it was supposed to. Join the founding members of TimeWatch as a pioneer of chronal exploration!\nUNLOCKED: $85,000: Guide to the Annotated Timeline! This standalone guide will follow a player-facing format similar to that of the award-winning Trail of Cthulhu supplement The Investigators Guide to Occult London, presented as a collection of TimeWatch agents' notes on resources, dangers, excitement and mystery up and down the timeline. Plot hooks and player resources aplenty! 30-40K words, free PDF to all backers of $25 and up, and available as an add-on for $13 (+$5 international shipping).\nUNLOCKED: $80,000: Adversary Spotlight: Sophosaurs! Explore the mysterious background of the time-raptors, including their clan structure, hunting habits and nefarious goals in taking down the human race. Can they be allies, or even reasoned with? How do they treat the rare sophosaur TimeWatch agent? Find out!\nUNLOCKED: $78,000: Mission Hook 7: Matthew Breen's \"Time Will Tell!\" This mission goes deep within the intricate workings of TimeWatch itself, with an adventure that twists the organization's methods into a deadly plot.\nUNLOCKED: $75,000: Adversary Spotlight: Ezeru! Curious for more detail about the shapeshifting, giant radioactive mutant cockroaches from the future? Their hideous chittering behind the ticks of the clock say you are. This fills in the gaps of their motives, their methods, and their monstrous brood queen.\nUNLOCKED: $73,000: Campaign style expansion 8: Time-Crime! You're a world-class con-artist and thief... with a time machine. Written by Paul Stefko and inspired by your favorite crime- and con-based TV shows, you'll steal famous artifacts, run really long cons on tyrants, and be the reason that art disappears from the world. Just don't be surprised when TimeWatch tries to stop you...\nUNLOCKED: $70,000: 96-page Campaign Supplement! You asked for more content, and you've got it. This supplement will be full of loosely-linked adventures by a variety of fantastic authors, with adventures that are playable in any order (by definition). All Kickstarter backers of $25 or more get the PDF for free, and backers at the $40 FULL AGENT level and higher can purchase a softcover physical version (color cover, B&W interior) as a +$20 add-on (+$5 shipping for backers outside of the US/UK.) See Add-ons above for more detail.\nUNLOCKED: $69,000: TimeWatch Rules Become Open Content! At $69K, we'll take many of the new rules changes for TimeWatch and make them open content, allowing you to use them in your own GUMSHOE games. This will let you freely add stitches, stun tests, and more to your own GUMSHOE games.\nUNLOCKED: $68,000: Mission Hook 6: Anise Strong-Morse! Roman historian and longtime game designer Anise Strong-Morse, in conjunction with game designer and Choice of Games co-founder Adam Strong-Morse, present a TimeWatch mission hook that speaks to their specialties of skulduggery, classical history, and possibly even romance.\nUNLOCKED: $54.5K, $56K, $57K, $58K, $59K, $61K, $63K, $64K, $66K and $67K: Time Seeds 3-12! You'll never lack for great ideas; here are short \"time seed\" adventure hooks that you can grab and use for inspiration, one unlocking roughly every $1000 in pledges. These will be compiled in a PDF (or possibly the main rules book) once the campaign is over.\nUNLOCKED: $65,000: Campaign Style Expansion 7: Parallel Worlds! Forget time travel. Instead, you'll step from one parallel universe to another in this world-shifting campaign expansion inspired by Jack L. Chalker's G.O.D. Inc. series and the classic TV show Sliders. Veteran designer Dave Chalker is taking the helm on this one, creating a society where corporations use parallel universes for their own gain and you'll never know what to expect next.\nUNLOCKED: $62,000: Expanded Bestiary! Forget long-term plotting, sometimes you need random encounters and chronal horrors. We'll expand the book's bestiary of animals and monsters from throughout time.\nUNLOCKED: $60,000: Campaign Style Expansion 6: MYTHOS! This chronomythic setting incorporates elements of Trail of Cthulhu into TimeWatch (in particular Stability and Sanity), and details Mythos time-travel-related adventures featuring the Hounds of Tinadalos, the Great Race, Yithians and \u201cbeetle folk\u201d The fact that Yithians body-jump, and yet feel the need to preserve the minds of the bodies makes them interesting villains. You'll never know who the Yithian is... Veteran Lovecraft designer and co-host of the HP Lovecraft Literary Podcast Chris Lackey is taking the shadowy and cyclopean helm for this campaign style.\nUNLOCKED: $55.000: A Voice From the Past! Mind you, the voice is mine and it's only the recent past; at this level we record and make available an edited, actual-play TimeWatch mission podcast of Kevin running the adventure \"Hatchet and Axe,\" wherein the Cuban Missile Crisis expands into nuclear war due to 50-year-old ezeru subterfuge. Meant as a handy play reference and idea generator, we'll make this available free for downloading.\nUNLOCKED: $54,000: Time Seed 2, by Jim Groves! We'll immediately publish another short \"time seed\" adventure hook that you can grab and use for inspiration. These will be compiled in a PDF (or possibly the main rules book) once the campaign is over. Jim is a long-time freelancer and author for Paizo's Pathfinder adventures.\nUNLOCKED: $53,000: Sound Effects! TimeWatch Backer and sound designer Wes Otis of Plate Mail Games is providing a collection of superb weapon sound effects for use in your TimeWatch games. Toss them on your phone or laptop for easy access, and you'll no longer need to make \"pew pew pew!\" noises when firing a beam weapon!\nAhem. Not that there's anything wrong with that.\nUNLOCKED: $52,500: Time Seed 1, by Jason Morningstar! No waiting involved, we'll publish a short \"time seed\" adventure hook that you can immediately grab and use for inspiration. These will be compiled in a PDF (or possibly the main rules book) once the campaign is over. You can find more of Jason's work in the remarkable games Fiasco and Durance.\nUNLOCKED: $52,000: Postcards From The Future! A 5th deluxe TimeWatch postcard featuring full-color TimeWatch art gets added to the Time Traveler package and above, at no additional cost to pledgers.\nUNLOCKED: $49,000: GM Screen Inserts! At this point we're unlikely to create a GM Screen as part of this Kickstarter, but that doesn't mean we can't give you the tables you need in a form you can use. At this funding level, we'll have TimeWatch PDF-only screen inserts for customizable screens designed and made available for free download.\nUNLOCKED: $46,000: Mission Hook 5: Kennon \"The Universe\" Bauman! Secret mastermind behind the Ennie-winning website The Illuminerdy, Kennon Bauman is a professional analyst and lapsed historian who has written about dark pyramids under Alaska and the secret occult conspiracies of King Ludwig of Bavaria. Here, he'll take on the paranoid machinations of a Conspiracy-style TimeWatch mission.\nUNLOCKED: $43,000: Campaign Style Expansion 5: Conspiracy. This is time travel meets X-Files, where you never know whom to trust and the biggest threat to your mission's success could be from someone you already know. Comparable to the Mirror mode of Night's Black Agents, Conspiracy predicates that human society is already infiltrated by aliens who don't have humanity's best interests in mind, that your own friends and superiors within TimeWatch may (or may not) be corrupted double agents, and that TimeWatch itself may have complex and sinister goals. A serious setting of shadowy intrigue and flawed heroes.\nUNLOCKED: $41,000: Hey, I Know You! It's easier to adventure in time when you know to whom you're talking. We'll add a new section of actual historical NPCs, memorable characters from across history who you can easily meet in play. Each entry will have a brief history, appearance, personality, reason why they matter, and game stats. Don't be surprised if this section is peppered with plot hooks as well.\nUNLOCKED: $39,000: TimeWatch Musical Theme! We'll commission composer James Semple to write a theme for TimeWatch. We get our own theme music! You should go right now and check out his theme to 13th Age, along with his other work; it's superb.\nUNLOCKED: $37,000: GUMSHOE Cross-over-palooza! Want to combine TimeWatch with your other GUMSHOE books such as Night's Black Agents, Esoterrorists, Ashen Stars or Mutant City Blues? Of course you do. We'll write rules and guidelines for combining time travel rules with your other favorite GUMSHOE settings. Better yet, we'll discuss bringing aspects of those games into TimeWatch.\nUNLOCKED: $35,000: Hardcover Rulebooks! We hit this level, so we'll print the TimeWatch rulebook as casebound (hardcover) instead of perfectbound (softcover). All pledgers at the $40 level and above have their copies upgraded for free.\nUNLOCKED: $33,000: Mission Hook 4: John Adamus. An expert editor, prolific writer and excellent game designer, John is an old hand at GUMSHOE who may secretly be a cyborg plot idea generator -- he's that good. He'll be writing a mission hook for the newly-unlocked Tourist-style TimeWatch campaign.\nUNLOCKED: $31,000: Campaign Style Expansion 4: Tourist! If you like your time travel to come with a long scarf, good companions and stylish extradimensional transport, this stretch goal is for you. Embracing the themes of some of our favorite TV shows, rapid time travel takes a back seat while you explore Earth's past and future, including the histories of other alien planets across the galaxy. This Campaign Style provides new rules, setting, and GM guidelines for a Tourist-style campaign.\nUNLOCKED: $28,000: Campaign Style Expansion 3: Rebellion! Ever wondered what it's like to be on the other side of the coin, to be the people changing history in order to bring about a better world? Opposed by both TimeWatch and chronal saboteurs who are trying to warp history to their own nefarious ends, you're a freedom fighter for a better tomorrow. You just have to survive long enough to arrange it. This Campaign Style provides new rules, setting, and GM guidelines for a Rebellion-style campaign.\nUNLOCKED: $23,000: Mission Hook 3: Heather Albano. As an author, Heather Albano (www.heatheralbano.com) has written the novels TIMEPIECE and TIMEKEEPER. As a game designer, she's the author of the top-selling iOS game Codename:Cygnus and multiple award-winning, text-based games for Choice of Games. She'll take a more personal touch with her mission hook, showcasing a Patrol-style TimeWatch mission that's perfect when you don't necessarily need your agents to save the world -- just a few good people in it.\nUNLOCKED: $20,000: Mission Hook 2: Corey Reid. Considering that we've unlocked TimeWatch's Pulp campaign style, we should ensure there's a spectacular mission for it. Corey Reid, author of the game Dino-Pirates of Ninja Island (dino-pirates.com), is the perfect match. When last we saw him, he was muttering \"Cleopatra\" over and over and rubbing his hands with glee.\nUNLOCKED: $16,000: Campaign Style Expansion 2: A Single Leap. Your group only have one or two players? This is for you! The Single Leap campaign style echoes the TV show Quantum Leap, wherein you possess someone else's body every time you time travel. You'll always keep the same investigative abilities in a Single Leap game, but your general abilities and physical characteristics change every time you jump into a new person. Designed for solo play or for just a few players, this campaign style and its accompanying rules will be included with the main TimeWatch book.\nUNLOCKED: $14,000: Mission Hook 1: Kenneth Hite! The mastermind behind Time Incorporated will write a 5000+ word TimeWatch mission that will be included in the main TimeWatch rulebook, propelling your agents into mayhem and alternate history as only he can.\nUNLOCKED: $11,000: Postcards From The Past. A 4th deluxe TimeWatch postcard gets added to the Time Traveler package and above, at no additional cost to pledgers.\nUNLOCKED: $9000: Campaign Style Expansion 1: Pulp Action. Rayguns a-blazing, this two-fisted TimeWatch section gets added to the book. It gives customized rules, guidelines and plot elements for embracing pulp-style play. If you like super-scientist gorillas and dinosaur-riding Nazis, you're going to want to see this written.\nUNLOCKED: Stretch goal: $7000: Expanded Races. We'll add expanded background details and rules to the templates for non-human player character races. Want to play a fully developed alternate-timeline intelligent dinosaur as your TimeWatch agent, or something even more unique? We've got you covered.\nUNLOCKED: $6000. Character-Building Made Easy. We'll work with designer Matthew Breen to create fully self-calculating PDF character sheets for TimeWatch, similar to the sheets he created for Night's Black Agents found here.These will be made free for download.\nUNLOCKED: $5000. TimeWatch Tablet edition. PDF rules are fantastic, but not when art and long books slow down your device. When we make this stretch goal, any PDF book we create will include a separate PDF version with minimal art for those times when all you need is access to the rules on your tablet. Included at the Digital Recruit pledge level and above.\nA typical TimeWatch team: Mace Hunter (19th c. big game hunter), Uurrk (neanderthal), Altani (13th c. Mongol princess), and Kelfala (24th c. starship pilot) get photo-bombed by Skegg the time-raptor\nTimeWatch will be published by Pelgrane Press in digital and physical form, with an additional digital-only Player Guide available to all pledgers. The book will be a casebound hardback (upgraded from softcover; thanks, successful stretch goals!) with a black & white interior; should stretch goals allow, upgrading from a b&w interior to a color interior will be added with no additional cost to pledgers. We're also offering a deluxe, faux leather-bound, limited edition of the game. You can upgrade an existing pledge level (see Add-Ons above), or pledge for it separately (The Utopian Edition).\nSample layout for TimeWatch\nTimeWatch's page count will be increased by stretch goals, with superb designers contributing mission pitches and additional campaign styles for extended play. The physical product will live up to the reputation for excellence established by such games as Hillfolk, Trail of Cthulhu, Ashen Stars, and Night\u2019s Black Agents.\nThe game is designed, playtested, and over 80% written. We need funds for art, layout and printing to get it off to the printers and into your hands. Cover and interior art comes from 13th Age Bestiary's and Owl Hoot Trail's Rich Longmore, whose art style perfectly fits the sci-fi action of the world we're creating. Michael Chaney, the person responsible for making Owl Hoot Trail look gorgeous, continues his masterful work with TimeWatch's layout and graphic design.\nAs you've probably heard from other publishers, international shipping prices are currently out of control. Shipping a book the size of TimeWatch from the US to Canada now costs significantly more than $30 in shipping alone. Yeah, we didn't believe it either. It gets even worse if you add anything that isn't printed. That's why we aren't currently offering official TimeWatch dice; add a single d6 to a domestic shipping order and you can no longer send it media mail, causing the price to skyrocket.\nWe include shipping in pledge costs for all US and UK orders, as Pelgrane Press is located in London, and the books are being printed in the US. To (almost) cover our shipping costs, we need to charge an additional $30 shipping for customers elsewhere in the world -- Canada, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. We're as aware as you are that that's almost as much as the cost of the book itself! If you're an international customer, you have a couple of options for avoiding the shipping charge:\nPledge for the PDF instead of a physical copy\nAsk your local gaming store to order the book for you through their distribution channels once it is printed\nThere's a shipping discount on international orders of 3-5 books at once (and for US/UK orders as well.) See Add-Ons above for details.\nWe've added a pledge level to take advantage of this: the $145 FULL AGENT INTERNATIONAL BUNDLE. This will ship anywhere in the world outside of the US/UK, give you four copies of the base book, and save you $70 in shipping. Not ideal, but a decent solution if you're ordering with friends.\nNone of those is perfect, and we're sorry for that, but hopefully you'll find a solution that works for you. Believe us, we're even crankier about high shipping costs than you are.\nWho do you want to win?\nTwo psychic sophosaurs (or time-raptors) tackle a single ezeru. It's roughly a fair fight. Just feel badly for any nearby humans.\nNo crowdfunding campaign is complete without a built-in competition, so your pledge lets you decide which horrific Pulp adversary will take center stage against TimeWatch in the struggle for our timeline. Your choice is between the ezeru, giant radioactive mutant cockroaches from the future who can steal human forms in their quest to trigger nuclear war, and sophosaurs, or time-raptors, psychic time-traveling velociraptors who come from an alternate timeline where the meteor never struck the Earth and dinosaurs never went extinct.\nWhen you pledge, leave a comment declaring your support of either the ezeru or the time-raptors. Every dollar you pledge earns your chosen adversaries a point in the Battle Report. Who will dominate history and become a primary adversary for TimeWatch? You get to decide. Check back regularly to see who's winning, the roaches or the raptors, and cheer on your favorite!\nEzeru are down $3,106 -- they can catch up with many smaller pledges or a few huge ones.

Character abilities, archetypes and a host of worthy foes are drawn directly from the Vedas, the Ramayana and other Indian sources. Attain the mystic perfection of the eight primary siddhis, speak the feared Om-syllable or fight with astras, the weapons of the gods themselves! \nWe at Tab Creations are pleased to present, this, our flagship roleplaying game. \nAgainst the Dark Yogi takes place in the world of Bhurloka. It is a world that closely mirrors the Vedic depiction of our own world, with many direct parallels between locations, gods, artifacts and events. However it is also a fantasy world: with room intentionally left for creative interpretation, and for the GM to frame her own campaign.\nBhurloka is a world of myth, and at its center is the great subcontinent, which stretches from the burning Dhar Desert in the west to the sweltering Wenga Jungle in the east, from the snow-capped Wolaya Mountains in the north to the Endless Ocean of the south.\nThis world stands at the precipice of disaster. In the east a sinister figure\u2014the Dark Yogi\u2014has risen to power. It is whispered that his forbidden sutra (written lore) gives him the power to directly attack dharma, the very order of the universe, itself.\nDharma, however, does not sit idly by. Just as the balance of the world is under attack, so dharma seeks to correct the balance. Towards this end it has reached out and selected but a few to champion its cause. These Chosen of Dharma may be devout ascetics, peerless archers, cunning charioteers, fierce wildmen, charismatic rajas or they may come from any other number of paths in life. They are all foremost, however, heroes. They have been given the enlightenment to see through their many incarnations, and to do what must be done to restore the balance of the universe.  \nNow is a time of legend!\nAgainst the Dark Yogi blends mythic Indian flavor with intuitive and tactical mechanics. The core system, Saga Machine, has been in use for six years, while Against the Dark Yogi itself has gone through four public beta test releases, as well as numerous internal releases.\nGameplay highlights include:  \nPower levels and game play are designed to scale up, so players can be the big damn mythic heroes they always wanted to be!  \nThe combat system is designed to handle everything from epic duels to pitched battles, where the heroes lead or defeat armies.  \nGMs have the option to run a campaign spanning multiple generations, with in-depth rules for creating and playing new incarnations of past heroes.  \nOptional rules allow the use of traditional Ganjifa Indian playing cards, bringing to the game a touch more Indian flavor.  \nThere is a system where player characters can accrue both good or bad karma, bringing about consequences for their actions.  \nAbilities and archetypes are drawn directly from Indian myth!  \nWhat's best, all backers can access the draft text of Against the Dark Yogi today! Simply follow the link from our first backer-only update.\nAgainst the Dark Yogi has been in the works now for almost two years and, having gone through four public beta tests, is now ready for production. The writing is complete, the system has been perfected and the text is edited.

The game was created as part of the very first 24-Hour RPG Day and was a mad rush of creativity and insanity that quickly led to the idea that -- just maybe -- the basic idea could be expanded.\nDownload the original free vs. Monsters PDF.\nvs. Monsters Deluxe Edition, 2004\nTaking the rough framework introduced in vs. Monsters, Philip Reed ripped everything apart and rebuilt it, expanding the game into an 80-page digest-sized beast. (Available in print from lulu.com.) The game turned out wonderfully, with reviewers positively reacting to the work:\n\"Meant for fast and loose gameplay, embracing the legacy of horror while not turning a blind eye to its camp, VS Monsters is an elegant little game that\u2019s well deserving of its cult following.\" -Tommy Brownell, RPG.net review\n\"If you like simple games, whether for one-shots or long-term games, this is for you. If you like horror and monster-mysteries and aren't dead-set on a game that has a different skill for everything, this is for you. If you like killing monsters, friend, this game is for you.\" -Peter Schaefer, RPG.net review\nvs. Monsters Addition, 2004\nAlso released in 2004, Michael Hammes' vs. Monsters Addition (available in PDF) offered optional and expanded rules for the game, providing players with more and bringing the entire package closer to being what is traditionally known as a \"complete\" roleplaying game. Between vs. Monsters Deluxe Edition and vs. Monsters Addition the game had a feel of an old RPG box set . . . never a bad thing.\nvs. Outlaws, 2007\nDesigned as a six-panel, micro GM screen, the vs. Outlaws RPG took the system hiding inside vs. Monsters and offered a fast, simple, easy-to-use one-shot roleplaying game of adventure in the American old west. Michael and Philip collaborated on the design of the game and the results were fantastic, with a lot of potential hiding inside a little package.\n(Want a physical copy? See the $10 reward level.)\nDownload vs. Outlaws free!\nIn his review at RPG.net, Sophie Lagace writes:\n\"This is a great game for experienced groups and story gamers, people looking for an afternoon of fun with little or no preparation.\"\nvs. Pirates, 2006?\nThe very first words for vs. Pirates were written in 2006, but work on the game stalled and was soon set to the side as other projects took over. As with vs. Monsters, the intended tone of the rules was not at all serious . . . as this fragment demonstrates:\nEdge of the World: For player characters living in the world of vs. Pirates, which would be any of you players who are reading this section right now, the ancient sailors were right: sail too far across the ocean and you\u2019ll sail over the edge of the world. What is frustrating (for the players; the gamemaster can actually have a lot of fun with this) is to watch a prize sail away and then, just as the player characters\u2019 ship draws near, the sea opens up and the horizon vanishes. Turn back before you fall off of the face of the Earth!\nIllustration by Howard Pyle, from \"Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates,\" 1921.\nClearly, the idea was to closely follow the style of vs. Monsters. Unfortunately, though, the project fell by the wayside. Life and times change, and now it is time to return to vs. Pirates, to restart and rebuild what was worked on before. \nAnd here we find the reason for this Kickstarter project:\nIt is time, me mateys, for the seas to tremble in fear. It is time, with your support, for Michael Hammes and Philip Reed to design and publish the vs. Pirates roleplaying game. A completely stand-alone game -- you provide the players and tools -- vs. Pirates is planned to follow in the footsteps of vs. Monsters and vs. Outlaws and provide players and gamemasters with fast, simple piracy.\nDesign. No design work is done at this time . . . we are truly kickstarting this project. All design will be handled by both Michael and Philip, though if history is any indication most of Philip's contribution will be in the broad strokes, the layout and graphic work, and in running around. Michael will (very likely) handle the heavy workload and flesh out Philip's vague nonsense.\nArtwork. As with vs. Monsters and vs. Outlaws all of the interior artwork will come from stock art and/or the public domain. Older, classic illustrations will give the game a strong feel of the age of sail.\nFormat. The PDF will follow the exact same format as vs. Outlaws: 5.5\" square, tri-fold GM screen-like design.\nDelivery. We will try as hard as we can to meet the June, 2014 delivery date . . . but this is Kickstarter and life happens. We think we set the delivery date far enough out. Fingers crossed!\nIllustration by N.C. Wyeth from \"Treasure Island,\" 1911.\n$3,000 - Printed! If we meet this goal then everyone who pledges at the $6 reward level or higher gets a copy of vs. Pirates in print; see the rewards for details. (We suggest that international backers add $3 for shipping if the $3,000 stretch goal is met, but this is not a requirement.)\n$4,000 - The paper stock for the printed game gets better!\n$5,750 - Micro expansion! A small expansion -- same size and format as the vs. Pirates roleplaying game -- is added to the project. PDF only at this point.\n$7,500 - Printed micro expansion! Everyone who pledges at the $6 reward level or higher receives one copy of the micro expansion (see the $5,500 stretch goal) in print for each printed copy of vs. Pirates they are receiving.\n$12,500 - Hidden treasure! This stretch goal will be revealed if all of the earlier stretch goals are unlocked.\nThere are no stretch goals past this point. Kickstarter can be dangerous to creatives if things go too well, so rather than commit to headaches and potential pain we are locking down the project and making no promises past this point. \nWith your support vs. Pirates will go from an incomplete and unpublished idea to a finished roleplaying game. Thanks for reading, and we hope you will join us on this new adventure.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith only two weeks days for funding there's a chance the game will not reach its goal.

From the ground up, it is specifically engineered to meet the demands of tabletop role-playing gamers, and give you the materials and tools you need to help create the perfect ambience, intensify dramatic impact, enhance player immersion, and ultimately enrich the cinematic feel of your unfolding collaborative storytelling experience.\nQuantum Minstrel is a collection of music that\u2019s conceived and put together in a very particular way, along with specialised software to play this (and other) music in a flexible, expressive and convenient fashion. The most important concept to understand here is that you can mix and match the music you want by blending multiple streams of audio together. This software will be available for a wide variety of devices, including desktop computers, laptops and smartphones running a host of different operating systems.\nYou've got your fancy dice sets in your special custom bag, and you've got your drawers groaning with the premium minis that you spent last summer painting while the rest of the world was at the beach. You've got your fancy screen with all those useless, outdated charts on the back, and of course you've got your indescribably gorgeous 3D dungeon terrain that cost you an arm, a leg, your good kidney and five sessions of couples counselling*. You've got the visuals sorted, and you know it. Now you can get what you need, what you DESERVE, to bring your audio up to the next level, so your games can finally sound as awesome as they look!\n* unless you've picked up some sweet deals in the stunning new Game Tiles range from Dwarven Forge, funded by Kickstarter. In fact, Quantum Minstrel is trying to do in sound what Dwarven Forge has done so amazingly well: throwing the visceral feeling of adventure directly onto your gaming table, one beautiful, hand-crafted piece at a time.\nHere's yet another tool you can use to immerse your players in the story, and it's something they're already bringing to the table (unless you're gaming with Tycho Brahe): their noses! Your olfactory system has particularly strong ties to emotion and memory, so why not harness the power of smell to give your players an experience they'll never forget. Just for a second, imagine filling your lungs with the magical sweetness of an elven forest, or breathing in the tangy ocean spray as your battered galleon makes haste to the nearest port. But before we get too excited, does anyone actually make any scents that are suitable for tabletop gaming? The answer is a resounding yes! Whatever your genre, Sarawen Perfume Art produces an incredible range of captivating perfume oils, from fantasy and sci-fi to Victorian and Gothic. With the right perfume and a simple oil burner you'll be whipping up a world of wonder in no time, and covering up any stray GamerFunk while you're at it!\nNow let's talk some more about the music.\nHow is this even possible?\nAs the children sleep soundly in their beds, deep in my lair (Treasure Type Q x 2, for those of you with an old-school raiding party at the ready) I have been spending a lot of time planning and composing a series of seamless music loops, each approximately two minutes long, that sound great in isolation and even better when combined with one another. To get a wee bit technical, these loops can be said to have compatible harmonic and rhythmic structures, in addition to other more esoteric considerations pertaining to aspects of musical counterpoint.\nThe end result is that these loops can be played together in any combination; you can think of them as layers of audio that provide emotional and/or environmental contributions to the overall soundscape. The key is that these layers can be gently faded in and out independently through the use of sliders on your screen, which puts you in charge of the music mix at all times. For those of you familiar with graphics software, it is perhaps helpful to think of these sliders as controlling the musical \u2018opacity\u2019, ranging from 0% (silent) to 100% (maximum presence), allowing you to find the optimal blend of colours and textures for a given gaming scenario.\nBut as we\u2019ll see, it goes a step deeper than that.\nThese flexible audio layers are themselves comprised of sub-layers. This added complexity is fairly subtle and may not be obvious at a glance. When you move a slider, you are not merely changing the volume of the associated music: the volume does indeed rise and fall, but at the same time you are also manipulating many other parameters, such as the audio clarity, apparent distance and even the numbers and types of musical instruments and other sounds that are playing. These slight and gradual shifts are achieved through the application of techniques like audio filters, reverberation (or \u2018reverb\u2019) and crossfading, and are all handled for you automatically behind the scenes. However, you may be interested to know what it is going on under the hood.\nWhere did you get the idea?\nThe musical inspiration behind Quantum Minstrel stems from two major sources.\nThe first is that other great play-elephant in the room: video games. Many video games offer a sophisticated audio experience that responds to player activity, and I am attempting to channel this aspect into the tabletop realm.\nThe second is the art of sound installation. I don\u2019t mean Darren in the overalls who comes to hook up your home theatre system, but rather an artistic work based in sound that unfolds over time in a particular space, often for long periods. From my time in the deep waters of music academia I have experienced a number of these, and some have left quite an impression (while others have left me scarred for life).\nWhat\u2019s in a name?\nBefore we continue the guided tour, let\u2019s spend a little bit of time exploring the wondrous realms of nomenclature and terminology.\nWhy is this project called Quantum Minstrel? This name was deliberately chosen for a variety of important reasons:\nAs an amalgam of concepts highly modern and truly archaic, it reflects both a flexibility to cover a broad spectrum of time periods, genres and game settings, as well as a happy marriage of modern technology to the ancient arts of music and storytelling.\nIt represents (to my mind) a quantum leap forward in the technical and musical development of interactive audio for the gaming table.\nI thought it sounded totally badass.\nA screenshot of Quantum Minstrel in action, showing a set of four multi-layered tracks (also called strings) loaded up as a single instrument. Each string represents a different mood and/or locale.\nIn Quantum Minstrel parlance, an instrument is built with a number of strings, and each of these strings contains many strands.\nWe\u2019ll continue the present discussion by introducing some new terms. In the Quantum Minstrel universe, our individual tracks (that blend together as a unit and are controlled by sliders) are called strings, while their cunningly concealed sub-layers are called strands. A set of strings together is collectively referred to as an instrument. This hierarchy is demonstrated in the diagram above. Additionally, as we\u2019ll soon discover in the tutorial below, each string slider has specific points at which it stops during its travels, and we\u2019ll call these frets, to continue the lute motif.\nThese particular metaphors were chosen out of dedication to the wandering bards of long ago, fictitious or otherwise. In addition, the concept of harmonious integration of interrelated musical loops was inspired by the warm resonance of sympathetically vibrating strings, whereas the software side of Quantum Minstrel is far more than a simple audio player: it is a fully responsive, playable instrument \u201ctuned to the key of RPG\u201d.\nAnd very soon this instrument will be at your beck and call. A Minstrel is You!\nHow does it work?\nHere is a quick tutorial on how to use the basic functions of Quantum Minstrel:\nRun the application (always a good move).\nFrom the menu at the top-left, load up your desired instrument. Fields of Glory is the default, so that\u2019s a good place to begin your musical adventures. The interface will then display a row of sliders representing the various strings, in conjunction with corresponding rows of up and down arrows.\nWhen you click or tap on an arrow, it gently raises or lowers the corresponding slider to the next position (or fret) in a smooth and flowing fashion.\nNow that you\u2019re getting the hang of it, it\u2019s time to set your preferred starting position. For example, if your game session begins in a city temple, set the Bringer of Light (temple) slider fairly high up, and for fun, you can include a bit of the Market Day (town) slider as well, if you\u2019re after a headier, more complex brew.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can press the large play button at the top-right and listen in awe and wonder as the magic unfolds.\nAt any stage, you can pause or resume playback using this same button. It\u2019s not necessarily recommended to do this regularly during games as the sudden stopping or starting can sound rather abrupt, but it could perhaps be useful if the party becomes deafened (although a nice underwater-style filter could be just what the doctor ordered in this circumstance), or if there\u2019s an important phone call or emergency evacuation, or if it\u2019s simply time to take a break for whatever reason.\nThe sliders are your friends. When the party leaves the temple, try queueing up some downward taps on Bringer of Light and while we\u2019re at it let\u2019s hear some more from the town, or maybe even a hint of forest when you bump into that lost wood elf down a side street. You can really let your imagination guide you.\nAnd here are a few supplementary notes:\nDepending on your device resolution and other settings, you may have some strings loaded off the edges of the screen. To get to these strings, you can scroll over to them using side arrows that will appear to the right and left.\nI chose a system of frets and arrows so that the music never has awkward bumps or dips that could easily occur from direct manipulation of the sliders. These frets have all been carefully calibrated using psychoacoustic principles so that all changes are as seamless and transparent as possible.\nYou can press play before increasing any sliders, which will tell Quantum Minstrel to start looping silently, resulting in a gradual fading in of music when you later do decide to introduce some sounds. This can be quite a lovely effect.\nCan we hear it in action?\nYou bet! Imagine you are running a fantasy game, perhaps something along the lines of\nand we join the action in the Grove of Secrets, where your well-groomed adventuring party has just defeated their vile foe, an orc champion by the name of Ghrokbarhr Thranggis Jr. Here the battle music fades out, and the forest music takes over.\nNB: All of the background music in these excerpts is out-of-the-box, unedited output from Quantum Minstrel.\nAfter more miscellaneous adventuring, the party reaches the peaceful village of Summerton, where we introduce the sounds of the town as the forest music dissipates.\nAnd of course, ye olde tavern-e is juste downe the roade. The eponymous V. Craghammer tries his luck, but for him it\u2019s a swyngge and a miss!\nThis final track features an additional layer of background sounds from Wes Otis's popular Plate Mail Games audio collection, as an example of the two working in tandem.\nAnd there we have it. As you can hear, these scene and mood transitions happen seamlessly without ever missing a beat.\nOnly TWO minutes?\nNo doubt some eagle-eyed potential backers amongst you may have observed that I described my music loops as being about two minutes in length. At this point you may be feeling worried that two minutes doesn\u2019t sound like a long time, especially given the length of some gaming sessions, and under normal circumstances I would say that you would be quite justified in your misgivings. However, please bear a few things in mind:\nEach loop (or string) has been painstakingly composed to repeat seamlessly and organically with a playful, aloof and often mercurial air, which helps to minimise any sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu whether it be a hectic, thrilling soundtrack, a poignant underscore, or a tranquil, meditative backdrop.\nEach string is only a part of a larger matching set (or instrument), and there is a huge amount of musical variety inherent in the available combinations.\nUsing the software sliders, you are in direct control of these layers, and even small changes can make a big difference.\nIf we reach a total of $5,750 then you\u2019ll be able to use the Auto-Pilot feature to transition automatically between various soundscapes, increasing the diversity in a subtle or fairly substantial way without requiring constant user input.\nThere are many layers (or strands) within each individual string, so at any one time you are really hearing a complex fusion of sounds drawn from roughly 8-12 minutes of audio. My personal feeling is that making the strings any longer would take a great deal more time and effort without contributing very much to the end result.\nIf we reach the $50,000 mark, this two minute limit will start to dissolve.\nFurthermore, if you would like some purely anecdotal evidence (and who doesn\u2019t?), during product testing we tried using just a single string for a whole evening of gaming. Afterwards, everyone at the table commented on how well the music worked to set the scene while not taking away player focus (after the initial excited glee), and how it didn\u2019t get at all tiresome, or drive us to commit multiple heinous acts, despite having looped well over 100 times!\nAnd if you\u2019re still not convinced, soon you\u2019ll be able to try it out for yourself without leaving the comfort of your favourite web browser. Being decidedly of the demo pursuasion, it will have audible watermarks (but we\u2019ll do our best to make them entertaining for you). I\u2019ll post an update when the online demo is up and running.\nWhat choice of rewards are you offering?\nAt launch time we are offering 12 different levels of rewards, which you can read about in detail over on the right side of this page. The following list features the ones that may be of the most interest, although I encourage you to check out all of them to find what best suits. And hey, remember you can always change your pledge before the end of the campaign.\nNB: All prices are listed in NZ Dollars, which should make most of you happy.\nFor $1 you get my heartfelt thanks for your interest and support, and regular updates on our progress.\nFor $3 you also get a copy of the Quantum Minstrel player, and all subsequent software updates as they come out, but no additional audio.\nFor $5 and above you will receive my thanks, the software and a certain amount of music, depending on the level of your pledge.\nIf you would like to receive all of the music that will be produced as the result of this campaign, you\u2019ll want to aim for Level 7: \u2018Tachyonic Troubadour\u2019 (Master Set) or higher, which is in the $40+ region.\nAll adventurous backers at Level 8: \u2018Mesoscopic Minstrel\u2019 (Collector\u2019s Edition) and higher, at a pledge of $60 or greater, automatically qualify as beta testers. Beta testers are granted early access to all software updates and new music coming down the pike and/or halberd, and are invited to give feedback to refine the product. Once each testing cycle is complete, updates will be rolled out to the rest of the user base.\nAt the prestigious Limited Edition end of the reward rainbow, Level 9: \u2018Mass-Energy Muse\u2019 (BRONZE Backer) and up (for pledges of $250+), we get into some pretty serious business, which is usually the case when precious metals come into play. This is yet another great backing option, this time for those of you who would like something unique, original, and a little special. For this level of financial support, I\u2019ll be composing music to your personal specifications, which you can then keep for your own private use, or if you\u2019re feeling particularly generous you may like to share it with your fellow backers; naturally, this decision is entirely yours. Either way, I am extremely grateful for your contribution.\nTo kick off the New Year and escape the holiday season doldrums, what could be better than a veritable treasure-trove of interactive music for you or the gamer(s) in your life? If you would like to grab MULTIPLE COPIES for FRIENDS and FAMILY, please simply select the highest of your intended reward categories, then over-pledge the total sum of all additional desired rewards. I\u2019ll be sure to follow up all over-pledging as quickly as possible to make sure all y\u2019all get what you want.\nOne more thing: please do contact me in the extreme event that you would like multiple Limited Edition copies. Of course, I am happy to oblige, but this may require an appearance from the fabled Cap of Thinking to keep the quantities aligned.\nWhat if I have a wealth of RPG audio already?\nNo worries, Quantum Minstrel is still for you. In fact, everything just keeps getting better!\nIf you\u2019ve been building your gaming audio library, and especially if you\u2019ve been following the RPG circles on Kickstarter for a while, you may already have a large collection of background music and environmental effects in your gaming library, such as those from the very successful Plate Mail Games Kickstarters #1 and #2.\nQuantum Minstrel has been designed with all of this in mind, and will enhance and build upon any collections you may already possess, especially those tracks that are more ambient, less intrusive and targeted towards the sound effect end of the continuum. Exactly how well everything works together will depend to a certain extent on the final funding level, as stretch goals (see the main section below) will unlock features to make this symbiotic relationship even more attractive.\nNow is the perfect time to discuss these particular stretch goals and how they can improve our lives in a meaningful way.\nWhile the finer levels of layered control that the official Quantum Minstrel strings and instruments offer within their musical strands generally won\u2019t be available when it comes to other background music in your library, nothing will go to waste. Quantum Minstrel will quite happily load these up for you, where you can organise, categorise and combine your audio tracks into columns for ease of access. If we unlock the Superposition stretch goal at a funding total of $3,750 you will have the option of organising tracks by rows as well.\nNext comes the Quantum String Builder feature (unlocked at $4,250), with which you\u2019ll be able to make your own multi-layered strings from any combination of the official Quantum Minstrel strings and your own audio files. I would strongly suggest adding a well-matched background sound effect track behind each built-in string, as this will only deepen the sense of richness, realism and immersion. These added layers will also loop naturally within their own internal rhythms quite independently of the music, to produce a pleasing kind of auditory parallax as time unfolds. I'll include a tutorial on how to do this and how it all fits together if and when stretch goal updates start coming into play.\nIf we reach the $5,250 level, the Particle Emitter soundboard feature will be unlocked, meaning that one-shot sounds can be fired off quickly and easily over and above any background music that may be playing. You will also have control over each sound\u2019s volume, filtering and positioning in 3D space. Again, I'll include details on how you can do all this when the time comes.\nThen between $9,250 and $10,750 we are adding support for playing a multitude of lossless audio formats, which may be useful for the audiophiles amongst us who favour these types of compression. Quantum Minstrel reads mp3, ogg, wav and aiff files natively, but I plan to expand this to include flac, ape, wavpack and m4a Apple lossless files.\nSo there you have it. Quantum Minstrel will work wonders with any suitable gaming audio you already own and enjoy, so it\u2019s a win-win!\nJust how \u201ccross-platform\u201d are we talking?\nIt is my firm intention to bring Quantum Minstrel to the people in a big way: therefore it will be made available on as many platforms as I can afford to license and maintain.\nUpon initial release, desktop and laptop computers running Windows\u00ae (Windows XP to Windows 8), OS X\u00ae (10.6 \u201cSnow Leopard\u201d to 10.9 \u201cMavericks\u201d) and Linux\u00ae (x86 and x64) operating systems will be supported.\nSupport for a plethora of portable devices powered by Android\u2122 (2.3 \u201cGingerbread\u201d and ARMv7 or later), iOS\u00ae (including iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae and iPod touch\u00ae), Windows RT and Windows Phone\u00ae 8 operating systems will be unlocked as a stretch goal at $9,000.\nWill there be any DRM? What about licensing?\nThere is not, and never will be, any DRM in Quantum Minstrel. I neither want nor need any of that funny-business getting in the way of your use and enjoyment of my labour of love. Besides, I have faith in our close-knit community: anyone running Quantum Minstrel for tabletop games is a real champion in my book, or at the very least has dipped into paladin for a level or two if you\u2019re one of those shifty multi-classers out there. Whatever the case, and whoever you are, I can\u2019t wait for you to lay your hands on it.\nIf some roguish characters do happen to find a \u2018second-hand\u2019 copy in a barrel or tree stump around the place, I\u2019ll try to think of it as free advertising for the real deal that offers superior integration and ongoing support within the Quantum Minstrel microcosm. To give you some backstory, here\u2019s an example of an encounter I\u2019ve had with copyright infringement in the past: I was tickled pink to discover that the sheet music for a commercially available tango I had written had been uploaded to a free file sharing site by a user from Portugal. That, my friends, is when you know you\u2019ve hit the big time.\nHaving said all this, registered users will receive a unique serial number, which will be used exclusively to simplify your Quantum Minstrel experience: to download copies of your licensed music and software from the website, inform you of relevant updates, and things of that nature. One serial number will allow you to install and run Quantum Minstrel for your personal use on any and all compatible devices that you own, so you won\u2019t need to juggle activations or anything like that.\nIf you plan to use Quantum Minstrel for anything that\u2019s oriented more towards the public or commercial spheres, please do get in touch and between us we can almost certainly work something out. For something like a bona fide, free-to-air, actual play podcast, an appropriate attribution would be sufficient. Whatever the scenario, my people will talk to your people, and then things will happen.\nWhat will you do with the proceeds?\nQuantum Minstrel is being built using the Unity3d framework, as it provides a 3D audio processing engine and is a powerful and convenient tool for deploying applications to multiple platforms fairly automatically. I have been using the free version of Unity3d for prototyping, but we\u2019ll be requiring the (very expensive) professional version to implement all of the features necessary to make this an efficient and viable solution for all platforms, and really put the icing on the cake. Therefore a large portion of the funds received will go directly towards various categories of professional licensing for Unity3d.\nThe next major expense in this process will be the acquisition of virtual instruments and effects plugins, on which I will be relying heavily to compose and record the various musical items. I have already amassed a large collection of virtual instruments and effects throughout my professional composing career. However, paid updates do often become available, and as with so many things, there are always new and exciting products on one\u2019s proverbial wishlist. Being a growth industry in the throes of some truly fascinating transformations, the quality, breadth and playability of virtual instruments and the breathtaking capabilities of effect plugins are improving all the time, which means that keeping up with the latest and greatest offerings is the best way to ensure the finest-sounding audio.\nFrom here, a significant amount of money will go towards keeping my composition and programming studio running, and for hiring experts who specialise in highly technical tasks on an as-needed basis.\nFinally, the remainder will help to determine my ability to devote large chunks of time to this project. Ideally I would love to work full-time on development and maintenance aspects of Quantum Minstrel, and depending on the level of funding, this could become a reality. In any case, I\u2019ll dedicate as much time to the project as I possibly can until all expected goals have been met, and then look to see where we can go from there.\nWhat\u2019s your timeline for all this?\nFor a quick overview, the estimated deliveries associated with each reward level are an excellent guide as to when each of these particular goals will be complete. For clarification, here are some more details.\nJanuary 2014: All copies of the first release of Quantum Minstrel audio player software will go out, including music up to the Fields of Glory starter set.\nFebruary\u2013October 2014: Various software features will be worked on, and new music tracks will be composed during this time, roughly in the order in which they were unlocked (see the Stretch Goals section below). The software updates and new music will be tested by high level backers and subsequently released into the wild as soon as each one is completed. I aim to have all Fantasy music done by September.\nNovember 2014: Software development will be ongoing. I anticipate to have all Sci-Fi and Bonus flexi-string music finished at this stage.\nDecember 2014\u2013February 2015: By this time I intend to have implemented all of the software features and composed all of the music, including any personal requests from high level backers.\nDo you have any Stretch Goals planned?\nAbsolutely! If we get to our minimum funding goal, Quantum Minstrel comes out of the gate strong with a set of six mix-and-match fantasy loops and many of the basic software features needed to run fabulous audio at the gaming table, along with support for most desktop and laptop computers.\nI recognise that many of you must have journeyed far and suffered extensively to take part. Some will have endured the public ridicule and social isolation of being the squeaky fifth wheel that gets the kick, while others amongst you will have padded your resumes, grappled through five to seven levels of fighter, slummed it with the thieves\u2019 guild for a while and then taken druidic orders just to get to this point. But now that we\u2019re here, good news! The Vancian magic of stretch goals enables us to take Quantum Minstrel even further, onward and upward into new and exciting territory.\nHere\u2019s a quick overview.\nAt $3,000 we launch. At $9,000, tablet and smartphone versions come online.\nFor every additional $250 reached between $3,000 and $12,000, something extra will be added to the pot. This will typically be something like a new piece of music or a software feature upgrade. From $12,000 to $50,000 there will be a major focus on expanding the available music library to cover a broader spectrum of gaming situations. If we are fortunate enough to find ourselves heading north of $50,000, then we have some very special plans for you that I\u2019ll reveal later in the campaign.\nYou may notice that amongst the stretch goals is a scattering of bonus music items called flexi-strings. These are one-off, single-string instruments that have especially pronounced layering. To give you some idea of what this could mean, Imperial Blossom changes in musical intensity from a quintessentially sparse, peaceful Japanese texture all the way through to a dark, demonic uproar, whereas 20\u00a2 Jukebox morphs between different styles of popular songs with surreal, wordless singing. While I do plan to offer most of the music you see here separately in bundles at a later date for those who missed out or pledged cautiously, these flexi-strings will be a Kickstarter exclusive, only available as part of this campaign.\nAnd I\u2019m flexi-ble too, so let me know if there is a particular feature you would like to see. Based on any discussions that occur over the next couple of weeks, there could well be any number of additional stretch goals for even more software features. I\u2019d say that these new goals would most likely slot somewhere into the $12,000 to $50,000 range. So keep in touch and stay tuned to this station!\nA note of thanks\nThe following lovely persons have each contributed to Quantum Minstrel in some way. I would like to thank you all for your patience, kindness and generosity.\nOur regular gaming group: Hamish, Megan, Olly and Richard\nOur not-so-regular gaming group: Emily, Gerald and Richard (this poor guy gets to suffer me twice)\nFriends and family: Alwyn, Cheuky, Chris, Hugo, Ichen, Iris, Joan, Kees, Marissa, Matt, Michael, Sara and Bertie of the Vigilant Watch\nThe lovely Sara from Sarawen Perfume Art for her amazing contributions to the campaign and for filling my house with such sweet-smelling delights!\nJeff Martin and Stefan Pokorny of Dwarven Forge fame for their phenomenal support and for making the most glorious (and surprisingly inexpensive) 3D dungeon tiles.

The \u20181.0\u2019 release of the starter set (instrument) of six fantasy multi-layered music loops (strings) called \u201cFields of Glory\u201d will also be available at this time. Everything else will take a little while to get together.\n\nLuckily we have relatively few variables at play compared to what some campaigns need to deal with. We aren\u2019t relying on third-party printers or postal services, as everything will be delivered electronically. I\u2019ll monitor the server load for any problems and take steps to improve performance if and when needed.\n\nFor the most part, I\u2019ll record the music using virtual instruments, synthesizers and what-have-you, so we won\u2019t need to worry about other musicians\u2019 schedules to get things happening. That keeps it nice and simple.\n\nI\u2019ll be keeping multiple backups, including versioning and cloud storage, of all aspects of Quantum Minstrel\u2019s development to minimise the risk of data loss.\n\nPretty much everything will be done in-house. My house, to be precise. As long as we don\u2019t have serious flooding or major earthquakes, everything should be smooth sailing. As I\u2019ll be doing most of the heavy lifting, the responsibility will be primarily on me to keep the plates spinning and the wheels turning.\n\nAfter the initial launch, I\u2019ll be dividing up my Quantum Minstrel time between software design, musical composition, and transparent communication and updates for backers. I\u2019ll need to stay on the ball to make sure I don\u2019t get behind in any of these departments, but as a veteran freelance task juggler I look forward to the challenge.\n\nWe\u2019re all human; we have our creative ups and downs. However, from my experience over many years as an active composer and composition teacher with many hard (and often insane) deadlines, one aspect where I excel is in overcoming writer\u2019s block and getting the job done. I have tried to be realistic with my time frame and have factored a small amount of Life into the equation, but in the event of things going wrong, a modicum of flexibility for unforeseen events would be most appreciated. Conversely, there\u2019s also the distinct possibility of getting a little ahead of schedule.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, if there is one area where I can get a little hung up it is in perfectionistic tweaking. However, this is where you as backers come in. You can tell me what works and what most needs fixing for you and I\u2019ll do my very best to cater to your needs.\n\nTo this end, I\u2019ll be putting up a Trello board where you can simply follow or actively engage in the project\u2019s development. For those of you who may be unfamiliar with Trello, here is a description from their website at trello.com: \u201cTrello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what\u2019s being worked on, who\u2019s working on what, and where something is in a process.\u201d\n\nI hope that by instigating this visible Trello roadmap, it\u2019ll help keep me on task and let you know where we are at all times. Naturally, I\u2019ll also include regular Kickstarter updates so that everyone involved stays in the loop.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly excited about the prospect of making Quantum Minstrel a reality and sincerely hope you can join us on this amazing journey.\n\nIain\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Iain Brandram-Adams\nFirst created \u00b7 10 backed\nHi!

It is set in a world where the \"NPCs\" of the village--the bakers, minstrels, farmers, shopkeepers and healers--set off on a wonderful adventure exploring a fantasy world together. Some people colloquially call it \"Hayao Miyazaki's Oregon Trail\", because of its heartwarming (in Japanese \"honobono\") feel of family anime, and its focus on traveling and wonder over combat and treasure.\nThe game has been out in Japan for years, and is widely loved by the people who play it. Even today long campaigns and short stories are being played in homes and cafes around the country.\nThe Original Ryuutama Japanese Book Cover. Click for a larger view!\nPlease see the website for more in-depth information about Ryuutama.\nRyuutama means \"Dragon's Egg\". It is set in a western fantasy world where the four Seasonal Dragons create and maintain reality. The characters go on an adventure, which is watched from afar by a Ryuujin, or \"Dragon-Person\". This Ryuujin watches their struggles, and records the events of the characters' journey. The Ryuujin then tells those tales to the Season Dragons, which gives them strength, and helps them bear the eggs of future dragons which will protect the world.\nThe background is that every person in the setting, at some point in their lives, feels an intense need to go on a long journey. Their family, friends, and co-workers understand, and help them prepare for their journey. The characters are not powerful warriors and wizards, but rather just normal village people. \nThe character classes are Minstrel, Merchant, Healer, Hunter, Artisan, Farmer and Noble. Each class has a few simple abilities that reflect their backgrounds. Each character can be a fighting, technical, or magic-using character depending on the player's choice.\nThe players play the roles of the characters, and one Game Master (GM) creates and navigates the characters through a scenario. Together, they create the details of the World and the Towns that the characters visit. The GM also has a special character with its own sheet called the \"Ryuujin\", which is a character that remains offscreen most of the time, but watches over the characters: The Ryuujin can cast some limited spells or abilities to help out or guide the characters. The GM creates the adversity that the players have to overcome, but the Ryuujin is out to protect and nurture the characters to some degree.\nTravel and people form the core of the game: While there is a unique console RPG-style combat system that's quite exciting, a majority of the focus of the game is on travel and problem-solving. Hit Point loss and gain mostly happens due to travel, and the unique Seasonal Magical Spells focus on solving interesting problems in unique ways.\nYou just need paper, pencils, a set of polyhedral dice (4, 6, 8, and 10-sided dice), a place to play, and friends with an open heart to play Ryuutama. Record your journeys. Create a tale that you will remember for years to come. Enjoy the time spent with your friends and family. This is what Ryuutama is all about.\nYou can find more about the game, including pictures, at the Ryuutama website. If you're familiar with Tabletop RPGs and want to know how Ryuutama is different, we have a page for that, too.\nYou can peruse some sample English character sheets and the like as well.\nFinally, you can legally download the full original Japanese version of the game from the 100% legit (the author listed it) free Japanese manga download site \"j-comi\" (click on the green \"PDF\" button on the left). The English version will look very similar to that book, but with some extra text and pictures (and of course Be In English!). One day, in a few years, we too hope to make the game available free to all in English as well.\nThe PDF Rulebook - This is a copy of the Ryuutama book in English, running at about 7x10 inches (almost B5 size), 200+ pages, and unlike the original, the English edition will be in full color! It will be gorgeously laid out by layout genius Daniel Solis, using the original Japanese book as inspiration. It will be in PDF format, and distributed exclusively to all backers through DriveThruRPG.\nEveryone at the PDF backer level and above will have their name added into the book as a supporter. When we finish the first editing pass, everyone at this level will get access to the raw \"pre-layout\" text as well, so folks can begin playing before the end of the year holidays.\nWe will also bundle some extras with this as well: New rules, new content, and play aids for the table like Terrain and Weather tracking cards. So it's going to be more than \"just a book\"!\nElectronic Supplemental Material - Matt and Andy are working on translating a bunch of other supplemental material that came out for the original Japanese and translated French editions of the game. We are also having the author write some more material for the game! This includes new character classes, a travelogue of new places and events, and more. We will also eventually be releasing the supplemental Seafaring rules and Navigator character class. It will be released piecemeal in electronic format.\nYou really only need the core rulebook PDF to enjoy the game, This package just gives you a little more for the future!\nThe Physical Book - We're producing a hardcover copy of Ryuutama. It will be black and white, 7 x 10 inches (intl B5 size), all full-color pages, 200+ total pages, all of the contents of the original Japanese book plus some extra materials, information, notes and clarification. \nOriginal Character Art - Miss Toyuki Mizusaka, one of the two original artists of the Ryuutama game (she did most of the art for the supplements), has volunteered her time and energy to do your Ryuutama character sketches! They will be black and white (you can add $40 for full color if you wish), and be delivered electronically in high quality formats. There's only so much art Mizusaka-sensei can produce, so these are in limited quantities.\nWe will send out a survey where you tell us some things about your character, and she will design a manga-style sketch fitting a Ryuutama game. See the sample sketch of \"Ruru\", below: This is the kind of sketch she will be doing for you.\nOriginal Scene Art - Again, Toyuki Mizusaka has volunteered her time and energy to do a limited number of scene sketches for you or your group. The \"Ryuutama Marketplace\" illustration at the top of this Kickstarter campaign was one such picture. They will be black and white (you can add $40 for full color if you wish), and be delivered electronically in high quality formats. These, too, are in limited quantities.\nWe will send out a survey where you describe the scene and the characters in it, and she will design your scene for you. Some of these sketches may appear in the rulebook!\nScenario Design - Atsuhiro Okada has volunteered to craft original Ryuutama scenarios for you and your group! After the Kickstarter ends, you'll give us some details about what you want to see: He will write the scenario (a few pages), we will translate it from Japanese to English, and we'll also have Mizusaka-sensei contribute two pictures of scenes from the scenario (including of your characters, if you wish) to go with it. \nADD ONS\n* An extra physical copy of the book: $40, no additional shipping cost anywhere! If you live outside of the US, please feel free to gather friends and get books together to save money on shipping! Each additional copy you purchase for a friend, we will send one additional electronic PDF to that person, plus add their name as a Backer in the book! If two or more people each want a \"PLUS PLUS\" level, simply add an additional $10 per person who wants the \"PLUS PLUS\" rewards!\nRuru the Healer, the first Ryuutama character Toyuki Mizusaka played!\nOur goals are simple:\n* We want to develop an English PDF version of Ryuutama that will last forever.\n* We want to produce 1,000 physical copies of Ryuutama in English, and put them into distribution around the world.\n* We want to translate and publish some of the supplemental material for the game, if interest warrants it: More text, limited art, and table aids like cards and printouts that help ease into play faster or make it more fun.\n* We want to do all the above at an easy pace for all of us: No races here: We're in this project for the long haul, and plan to develop for it for years to come.\n* Finally, we want to get more people interested in Ryuutama: It's a wonderful tabletop RPG that deserves attention. We're opening the system, allowing fans to write, produce, distribute and sell their own material for this game.\nAtsuhiro Okada 's motto is \"No Gaming, No Life\": He lives in Tokyo and works at the first tabletop gaming cafe ever created in Japan, Tabletop Cafe Daydream in Kanda ward. His job is to run and play games almost every day of the year, and focuses on getting new men and women interested in tabletop gaming.\nYuki Mizusaka is one of the two original artists of the game, having worked primarily on the art for the original Ryuutama supplements. She's a wonderful person and an avid gamer (player and GM).\nMatt Sanchez is the primary translator of the game. His Japanese-fu is epic and love for gaming strong, almost as strong as his love of the \"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\" manga series. He lives and works near Atlanta, GA.\nAndy Kitkowski is the other translator, and the producer of the game. This is the third Japanese translation/publishing project he's worked on, after Tenra Bansho Zero and Maid: The Role-Playing Game. He lives and works near Durham, NC.\nDaniel Solis is a layout expert and professional tabletop game designer, and he will be doing the layout of the game. He lives and works near Durham, NC.\nWe're doing something new, called \"Milestones\". Instead of drumming up higher levels of money to aim for, we're instead taking our time (so that things don't get out of hand) and announcing goals achieved afterwards. Here's the current list of all Milestone Rewards, together. If the item says \"++\" after, that means it is available to the backers of the \"PLUS PLUS\" levels.\nSee MILESTONE ONE and MILESTONE TWO updates for details on the below.\nSpecial extras:\n* We are funding the creation of a Ryuutama gaming/assistant app, for Apple IOS and Android. It will come out within the next year and be reasonably priced.\nAll level extras:\n* Ryuutama will be in FULL COLOR for all Kickstarter backers: PDF and Physical Book!\n* Random NPC Generation Tables\n* New Rules for Herbalism/Healer Class\n* Topography and Weather cards, downloadable/print-and-play\n* We will be making a free downloadable guide to beginner character creation.\n\nPLUS PLUS level extras:\n* The content of the original Japanese Ryuutama supplements, which includes the following:\n* Wagon Travel Rules ++\n* Road Campaign Creation Rules ++\n* Ocean Travel Rules ++\n* New Class: Navigator ++\n* Konekogoblin PCs ++\n* Random Events for Weather/Topography ++\n* Ad-Lib Style Scenario Hooks ++\n* Additional Character Classes from the French edition of the book ++\n* New Air Travel rules, including skyships! ++\n* And with it, a new Air Pilot character class. ++\nCanadian/Japanese Friends: Shipping to Canada, Japan is $28: See the $68, $78 levels. This is a careful estimate at a 3 lb weight for a 220-page, hardcover book at 7x10 inches plus packaging. However, this puts the book right on the line of 3 to 4 lbs. If it crosses over to 4lbs (because of page count, add-ons) or prices go up on intl shipping again, I may later require an additional $8 USD ($36 total) for shipping at a later date. I'm taking a risk by setting Canadian and Japanese shipping at a lower price, so please bear with us.\nThe Character Sketch, Scene Sketch and Adventure Creation levels have to be set to $40 for now for all intl backers.\nInternational Friends: Shipping is $40. This, too, is at current cost estimates and rates, and seeing that there are no international rate hikes coming in the next 6 months. However, if prices do go up on intl shipping again unexpectedly, I may later require an additional $10 USD. However, this is not very likely. This cost is a one-time cost: If you order 1, 2, or 4 books at $40 each, the $40 shipping fee is a one-time fee applied to the entire total.\nSince international shipping rates skyrocketed in January 2013, it's been hard to easily accommodate our international supporters with reasonable shipping rates for the physical book. We are putting a flat $40 fee on all outside-US shipping (except Canada), even though we know that shipping to Canada and Japan is estimated to be $28; Europe $45-55, and Asia $45-60. We're willing to take a small hit on the books in order to get them to you. Extra donations are always welcome!\nIn any case, shipping within the US will be free. I would highly recommend international backers to look into reshipper/reshipping services (also called \"mail forwarders\" who will work with your country to bring you goods from the US. In most cases you'll receive a US address for us to ship to, and you will pay them about $25-35 (and no cost of shipping from us to the forwarding address) rather than $40; furthermore, the book will get there just as fast as if we had sent it direct.\nAlso, if it's easier, you can always just back the electronic copy of the book: We'll of course grant you full rights to print the book yourself or with a local Print on Demand service; we will also allow everyone to print their copies from DriveThruRPG: For international physical backers, printing a softcover copy locally and having it shipped that way will save you some money.\nAgain, here's how to make international shipping slightly less horrible:\n* Get your friends to buy their copies together: Each additional copy of the book is $40 per book, with no extra shipping costs: Just the one-time $40 shipping fee. You will also get one \"PDF Download Link\" per extra book copy you buy, so your friends will be able to get a download of the game as well.\n\n* Look into a reshipper/mail forwarder that services your country. Using the dimensions above, you may be able to turn a $40 shipping (from USPS) into a $25 or less deal.\n\n* Stick to the PDF version for now. You can then print that version locally at a Print on Demand or other printer if you want. \nThank you so much for your understanding, this really hurt us but we don't want to cause problems in production because of lack of funds.\nNekogoblins (Cat Goblins) and Konekogoblins (Kitten Goblins)\nThe game is done, we just need to tighten and edit. So there is no development time needed, and we'll be avoiding all those potholes. All backers will get access to the \"plaintext only\" copy shortly after the Kickstarter project finishes (or before, if we can complete the first editing pass by then).\nWe support all types of gaming and playstyles: Atsuhiro-sensei plays everything from Warhammer minis (he will roll over you with his Skaven army) to Honobono-themed family games. We all love Ryuutama, and none of us consider it the Final Word of tabletop roleplaying; it's just another great, fun, well-designed game to put in your toolchest and play with your friends.\nFinally, I want to give a big shout out to Andi from Germany of the band Gillicuddy: You can visit his Bandcamp page here. His album \"...Plays Guitar\" is a perfect accompaniment to a Ryuutama game table. When I first heard the tune \"Travelling Made-up Continents\" (the one we used in our video, after asking Andi for permission), I knew that this was the perfect track to accompany this project. The entire album is wonderful: If you're a fan of fingerstyle classical guitar (Will Ackerman etc) it's definitely worth a listen/purchase. Please check it out!\nThank you all for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's not really a lot that could go wrong in a Kickstarter like this. However, I've done one in the past and have learned a lot from the experience. Here's some potential problems and planned workarounds:\n\n* Overall product delay - Not likely. The game is translated from front to back, with the current exception of a few hand-written captions. We just have to edit it, and add two pages of explanatory text. We're not starting the project; rather we're a few meters from the finishing line.\n\n* PDF delay - The layout person, Daniel Solis, is noteworthy for his professionalism and speed. No issue here.\n\n* Book delay - Instead of overseas, we are printing in the US this time with a reputable printer. No unexpected cultural or freight delays. The distributor/warehouse is two states away, and are as well very reputable (we've worked with them for years), so no major problems/\"several months delay\" expected there.\n\n* Overall burnout/Fatigue - We're keeping this Kickstarter simple. We have more in the pipes for it, stuff that will be available to you all, but that will come in time. But me and Matt have day jobs, and want to make sure that we're not going to promise more than we can deliver, and burn ourselves out.

Never was this proven more fully than in the year 2196. With certain doom hurtling toward our planet, the free countries of the world united and prepared for a mass exodus aboard a score of gargantuan transports. But our escape was just the beginning of the adventure. By some freak occurrence, our ship, the Dawning Star, was sent shooting across the galaxy. We found ourselves alone, cut off from the fleet, in alien territory. It was not in our nature to give up. We found a habitable planet and began our new life. In the intervening years, we have encountered strange new species, overcome dire threats, and taken the first few steps in building a new life.\nWe wrote those words in 2005 when we released the first full-scale sci-fi setting using the d20 Future rules from Wizards of the Coast. We followed this up with the largest sci-fi setting book ever published, Helios Rising. Dawning Star enjoyed both critical and commercial success. More importantly, people were having fun with it, creating amazing stories at the table with their friends. Freedom League scrappers plumbing the depths of mysterious ruins for alien artifacts; saurian monks beating back the emperor\u2019s Blood Guard at the gates of the monastery; heart-stopping space battles with the merciless vaasi horde.\n\u201cAs a setting, it\u2019s utterly fascinating \u2013 once I started reading it I was glued to it until I finished.\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Reaban\nWhen the d20 era faded out, we began looking for the perfect way to bring the setting back, and we think we found it in Fate\u2122 Core. We\u2019ve always been fans of this versatile system. When they recently revamped it with a wildly successful Kickstarter of their own, we knew we had a good match. This new version of Fate\u2122, in its own words, is about \u201cproactive, capable people who lead dramatic lives.\u201d That\u2019s Dawning Star in a nutshell.\nNow, when we say \u201cre-launch\u201d, we mean it literally. For this new version of Dawning Star, we\u2019re not merely swapping out statblocks. We\u2019re keeping the core but rebuilding the setting with the new system in mind. We\u2019re advancing the timeline and unleashing some shockwave-inducing events. Fans of the original setting will be thrilled to know that Dawning Star: Fate of Eos will see the first maneuvers of the vaasi invasion and the sudden appearance of one of Earth\u2019s other evacuation ships. Just when the settlers of the Dawning Star seemed to have a handle on things, we decided to ramp up the threats--both domestic and alien.\nDawning Star is a sandbox sci-fi setting that supports a variety of sub-genres. If your tastes bend to the pulpish end of the spectrum, explore the ancient ruins on Eos in search of alien artifacts. Want something political? The Saurian Courts of C\u2019thalk are dripping with intrigue. Space Opera? The Helios System is teeming with strange ships and natural hazards. Military? You could run an entire campaign on the vaasi conflict.\nDespite its flexibility, we\u2019ve taken great pains to ensure that the Helios system is a cohesive place. Each component has a purpose. The high concept for the setting is grounded in firm science. And the book will be brimming with ideas to launch an exciting campaign.\n\u201cAncient artifacts, strange alien races, warring political factions, and the raw struggle for survival that many colonists face every day create a setting filled with adventure opportunities.\u201d \u2013 Christopher W. Richeson\nWe are thrilled to finally find a system suited for the setting. Our friends at Evil Hat Productions have done some astounding work on Fate\u2122 in the past few years, culminating in one of the most successful RPG Kickstarters of all time. Beyond its success, Fate\u2122 is a system years in the making, honed and polished to a finely-tuned engine.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Fate, . You can check out the game by downloading directly from their website on a \u201cpay what you like\u201d model, so you can \u201ctry before you buy\u201d, or you can look at the Fate SRD website online. Short version: It\u2019s a quick system, using four Fate dice to resolve conflicts and a unique economy that encourages players to get their characters into trouble and to be awesome getting out of it. (Fate dice are readily available at most game stores and on the Internet.)\nIf you are familiar with Fate\u2122, you\u2019ll be interested to know that we\u2019re making a few tweaks to tailor it perfectly to Dawning Star. In particular, we\u2019re focusing on four primary components of the setting to get special attention in the rules. For the numerous xenomorphs that populate the Helios system, we\u2019re tweaking the skill system. Navigating a coqui gravelmaker isn\u2019t the same as tooling around in your EDF APV\u2013unless you\u2019re coqui of course. Dawning Star incorporates a host of tech, and we\u2019re amping up its significance in the rules. The difference between a haimedian thorn cannon and a Star Confed nanite sprayer isn\u2019t merely a matter of narration. Similarly, we'll have expanded rules for starship creation and combat, so you can take the helm of a Republic frigate or a yaom star rider. Red Truth is our scientific take on psionics, something along the lines of peeking behind reality to see the raw code. It gets the full extra treatment with detailed powers along with the significant risk posed by exposure to raw information. Yes, you might be able to identify the molecular structure of that door just by looking at it, but you also might be stunned as you absorb the memories of every being that ever touched it.\nAt Gen Con this year, we ran a sneak peek scenario: \u201cFreight with Peril\u201d. A train carrying an alien artifact is ambushed by Freedom League operatives. As EDF special forces escorting the shipment, it\u2019s your job to fend off the attackers and protect the shipment, but things get hairy when the artifact spontaneously activates. If you back this project at any level, you will immediately receive a link to download a copy of the scenario and characters and give it a try for yourself.\n\"Very fun. Great use of Fate for a riveting, fast-paced scenario.\" - Ben Plopper, \"Freight with Peril\" player, GenCon 2013\nThe Eos Defense Force and Offworlder backer levels (and higher) get you a copy of the final book. As we've hit our first two stretch goals, our current plans for Fate of Eos are for a 320-page, 8.5\u201dx11\u201d, hardcover book with a full color interior. We\u2019re using a US printer, which we believe in for ethical reasons and will also reduce the risk of shipping snags found with foreign printers. If we reach our next stretch goal at $25,000, we'll include a DS-branded flash drive card with every physical book. The more backers we get, the better everyone\u2019s reward gets. So get the word out!\nMock-up of the Book\nBut that\u2019s not all! If you get the book, you also get all the digital goodies available at lower levels. This includes: an electronic copy of the book, desktop and phone wallpapers, a fillable pdf character sheet, pdfs of all of the existing Dawning Star setting material, and \u201cFreight with Peril\u201d, our Gen Con scenario using the Fate\u2122 Core rules, so you can get started right away.\nFor our Super-Backers, we\u2019ve got a few unique bennies.\nWe've created some custom Fate tokens. These are casino-quality, ceramic poker chips, with the image infused into the material. Each side represents the different ways to use Fate points, invoking and compelling.\nWe've created these sturdy, dry-erase cards to handle situation aspects. You can write on them, note whether it is a boost or has free invocations, modify them as needed, and erase and reuse them when done.\nWe've created these slim, credit-card sized, 2gb flash drives to hold all of the digital material.\nAt the RELIC HUNTER level, you get the book, a set of 30 of our custom Fate tokens, and 10 dry-erase aspect cards.(International backers, please choose OFFWORLD RELIC HUNTER.)\nAt the ALIEN ARTIFACT level, you get a full kit for your whole game group. This will include two copies of the book (one for you and one to pass around), a flash drive with all of the digital material, a complete set of 24 Fate\u2122 dice for your group, 30 of the custom Fate tokens, and 10 dry-erase aspect cards. It all fits neatly in a spiffy carrying case. We will also work with you to create a unique character or xenomorph that will be featured in the final book with a custom illustration and your name, recognizing your unique contribution to the finished product. This backer level includes shipping anywhere in the world.\nMock-Up of the Game Kit\nAnd for one of you, the ultimate: As Clan Lord Oraton, you will get ALL THE STUFF: two copies of the book, 24 Fate dice, 30 custom tokens, 10 dry-erase aspect cards, the flash drive card with all of the digital content, and the carrying case. Plus, your books will be personalized and signed by Lee Hammock and myself. Plus, we will work with you to create a unique character or xenomorph that will grace the back cover of the book along with your name on a credit line. Plus, you will have the pleasure of a personal session run for you and up to four of your friends by the incomparable Lee Hammock in person either in the Seattle area, at Gen Con, or via Skype or G+. Dawning Star fans everywhere will speak your name in hushed reverence. Who wants to step us as the ultimate force in the Helios system?\n\u201cFor players and GMs looking to run a planet-hopping sci-fi campaign, you never need look anywhere else again: The Helios system is where you want to be.\u201d \u2013 Shane O.\nThanks to our great backers, we've hit our initial goal, which allows us to pay the talented crew for their hard work and to print a top-quality book in the USA.\nWe are happy to announce some stretch goals, and if we can hit these, we've got some more lined up. Our approach to stretch goals is not to offer different items to buy, but to add value to our existing tiers. So, the more money we raise, the better everyone's deal gets.\nUNLOCKED! Well, we got to $15,000, so we're adding 40% more awesomeness to the book. Most of this material will be dedicated to bringing you more of what makes Dawning Star unique. So, more xenomorphs, more tech, more spaceships, and more of the people, places, and secret history that bring the setting to life. For the visually inclined:\n208 pages vs. 320 pages\nI've had the pleasure of working with Danilo Moretti since Dawning Star's inception, and he is one of the most talented artists I've ever worked with. Since we hit this stretch goal, we'll have enough funds to cover a full color interior to show off Danilo's incomparable work. \nImperial Vaasi Soldier\nWe think it's only appropriate that a setting that features such advanced tech, shows off some advanced tech in our rewards. If we get to $25,000, we're going to push the boundaries. For starters, we will deck out the pdf  version of the final book with every amazing feature a pdf can have: a separate layout optimized for landscape view, internal and external hyperlinks, and an interactive character sheet. Remember: Everyone who backs at $10 or above gets the VIRTUAL REALITY awards, including the pdf.\nNow, here's the exciting news: If we hit this mark, we've decided to add a physical flash drive to all physical book rewards, that's $35 and up. I was concerned about what adding a physical item would do to the shipping profile. But one of our crew came up with the neat idea of using slim card flash drives like these:\nI can stick the card inside the book and still ship it as a standard book.\nBut this stretch goal can be so much more. It's really a catchall for whatever we can think up. Scratch that. Whatever you can think up. We've already had requests for token sheets for the various xenomorphs and NPCs. Sounds good. Custom, fillable character sheets, alternate ebook versions, pimped out pdfs. All doable. We've got a couple of gbs of memory on those flash drives, and we intend to use up every last electron. So tell us what you want to see.\nWell, this is never going to happen, right? We'll never get this thing this high, right? Right? Let's just say we do. Let's just say these last 24 hours are nuts, and we hit $30,000. What then?\nIn our original run, we undertook a periodic, recurring supplement called TERRAFORMER, in which we offered additional setting and game material--everything from aquatic xenomorphs to invisibility tech to an entire encounter featuring nanite \"zombies\". We also announced but were never able to publish our massive event supplemental called Shadow War, which was to introduce the Helios System to the full terror of the vaasi invasion. We had big plans for this product, all of the materials to run an engrossing, epic campaign in which the PCs' actions made a difference between winning and losing, between victory and annihilation.  Linked scenarios, where the results of one directly impacted the ones that followed. Fail to hold Thres one session, and the vaasi gain a tactical advantage in the next one. All combined in a stunning boxed set.\nIf we hit $30,000, we will reintroduce TERRAFORMER for regular publication and also commit to publishing Shadow War next year. What's in it for you? Every backer at the EOS DEFENSE FORCE level and above will get the first three issues of TERRAFORMER  and a digital copy of Shadow War when it is released. Absolutely free. A special thank you to everyone who made this relaunch such a huge success.\nBut that will never happen. Right?\nThe most exciting part of this endeavor is that we managed to get the old gang back together. Lee Hammock is the lead designer and writer, bringing the same imagination and technical chops that made the original Dawning Star a hit. Danilo Moretti provides the Art Direction, crafting an amazing array of graphics from maps to technical schematics to character portraits to the so-good-they\u2019ll-blind-you cover pieces. RJ Grady is back as our technical advisor. Sean Masters is assisting with the design and generally serving as an awesome idea generator. And yours truly will steer the ship.\nKurt Wiegel did a thorough review of Dawning Star for Game Geeks:\nLegal\n\"Underclocked (underunderclocked mix)\" by Eric Skiff (http://glitchnyc.com/).

What we have sourced has been unbelievable and has transformed the way we game, but don\u2019t take our word for it\u2026.. \nMusic Location - Dwarf Temple - Actual\nThere was no better way to highlight the awe of walking into a grand dwarven temple than using this track. These are dwarves the way they are portrayed in some of the most iconic gaming environments out there and here, we can hear their reverence for their god, their connection to the smithing arts, and that resiliency that comes from those born of the stone.\nThe details are what counts and we nitpick the heck out of everything we source. We have split music into two categories, \u201cActual\u201d and \u201cAmbiance\u201d. Actual means that the music is meant to be actually performed by characters in the game and heard by the player\u2019s characters. Ambiance is just that, music the GM needs to set the mood.With that said, here are some more dwarf tracks with a religious or ceremonial theme.\nMusic Location - Dwarf Temple - Ambiance\nMusic Racial - Dwarf Ceremony - Actual\nMusic Racial - Dwarf Ceremony - Ambiance\nWe want to create tons of scores that are custom written for races, locations, events, and themes, those that are often used in most tabletop games in order to provide the GM an arsenal of ways to enhance the role-playing experience.

The first player to collect 11 points over a series of rounds wins the game.\nClick here for a complete look at the rules of Scopa (pdf).\nNOTE: this is a draft version of the rules and not the final formatting.\nScopa is played with a 40 card deck, 10 cards in four different suits. The suits in a traditional Scopa deck are swords, cups, clubs (literal clubs), and coins. Each suit has cards ranked from ace to seven and three face cards: The King, The Knight, and The Squire (or in some decks, The Lady).\nThis Gamer's Edition of Scopa replaces the traditional suits with game components: dice, dominoes, clubs (the card suit), and meeples. Here are some examples of the new suit designs and artwork.\nInstead of a flimsy tuck box, each Scopa deck comes packed in a mini-game box with a proper heavy duty cardboard box lid and bottom. The box will look like this.\nLocated in Germany, Ludo Fact has one of the finest card printing facilities in the world.  If you're interested in learning more about Ludo Fact, check out Made For Play: Board Games & Modern Industry.\nScopa: Gamer's Edition will be printed at Ludo Fact, using the highest quality card stock and linen finish. The cards will be bridge width: 56mm by 87mm.\nGame Salute, one of the fine sponsors of The Spiel, will be providing publisher support for Scopa. This support includes promotion and marketing as well as assistance with distribution and sales once the project is funded.\nWe promise that Scopa will be produced with quality components and that you will enjoy the time you spend with the game. If you're not satisfied with Scopa, simply return it within 30 days of receiving it, and we'll refund your pledge. That's our money-back guarantee...no questions asked.\nAs mentioned above, extra decks are $8. This is an additional full copy of the game (card, box and all). If you would like more than one copy of Scopa for a friend or family member, simply increase your reward amount by $8 for each additional copy. This add-on price is valid for either US or International addresses or Essen pick-up\nAs we raise money beyond our initial funding goal, we will add new cards, new artwork and open a door to even more games to play with this deck. We'll release more details on this and other stretch goals as the project takes shape in the coming weeks.\nWe need your financial support to cover the cost of designing and producing this qwirky, high quality Scopa deck.

I'm Lee Garvin, the creator of Tales From The Floating Vagabond. This KickStarter is to enable the completion, printing, and release of a brand new edition of this classic* comedy role-playing game. \n*(Classic status not confirmed)\nJust a few of the over 30 ready to play Character Stereotypes available.\nTales From The Floating Vagabond is a tabletop role-playing game of High Adventure and Low Comedy, where all the tropes, standards, and cliches we've grown to love so well are dusted off, given a shiny polish, and then smashed into little bits and sprinkled over a great big bowl of cosmic oatmeal... Sorry that wasn't very good. I was going for \u201cinspiring metaphor\u201d but I only have the budget for \u201ctortured simile.\u201d\nAnd that's why I'm on KickStarter! To raise the funds to bring a newer, bigger, better, funnier edition of Tales From The Floating Vagabond to life.\nPreliminary Mock-up of the cover.\nYeah, but just what IS a Floating Vagabond? And why are there Tales coming from it?\nThat is a very good question. Followed by a pretty stupid one.\nThe Floating Vagabond is a bar built into an asteroid at the center of its universe. The owner of the bar, Hawk Luger (call him \"Spit\"), installed a Walker Random Dimensional Portal Generator on the door, and now, whenever someone walks into a tavern, pub, gin-joint, or speakeasy in any universe, at any time (past, present, or future), on any world, there's a chance they could end up walking into the Floating Vagabond.\nOnce these folks arrive, an unreasonably large percentage of them wind up embroiled in ridiculous adventures involving gratuitous explosions and acts of desperate derring-do.\nArithon Kincaid, Adventure Broker. Also, broke adventurer.\nSo it's a game of Drunken Inter-Dimensional Hi-jinks?\nWhat? No, of course... Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what it is.\nIn Tales From The Floating Vagabond (TF2V for short), you can Swing Nasty Pointy Things With Panache, Shoot Really Big Guns, or Belch For Effect.\nThe rules have been greatly streamlined from their original form, and now, nearly anything can be accomplished with a single die roll. TF2V uses a sliding scale of dice for difficulty, from d4 for the easiest task, the d100 for super-heroic-you've-got-to-be-kidding-me-what-are-you-smoking challenges.\nMan, his dad is gonna throw an OdinSnit when he see's what he did to the flowerbeds.\nAdditionally, characters in TF2V  have Shticks, comedic special effects that can fold, spindle, or mutilate the Laws of Physics. From the Flynn Effect, guaranteeing that you always have something to swing from, no matter where you are; to the Elfman Effect, providing stirring background music to give you a morale boost or an occasional warning; or even the Harpo Effect, which allows you to neatly fit anything up to the size of a Howitzer in your trenchcoat.\nTF2V is a game of Epic Adventure and Pervasive Slapstick, in a universe where the Laws of Physics have better things to do.\nSo Just What Can We Get For Helping Out?\nHey! Another question!\nYou might have noticed that there's something called Build-a-Brawl listed among the earlier rewards. What is Build-a-Brawl? It's a printable cardstock figure collection that you can use with TF2V or any other game you like. The first 8 sets were created using art by Vicky Wyman from the first edition of the game. With all-new art by Scott Lincoln, there are 5 more sets that will be coming along with the new edition. If you want to see what the Build-a-Brawl sets look like, take a look here.\nThe most obvious physical reward is the actual book itself. The original TF2V book was a 96 page softcover that was plagued with problems with its binding (many people actually thought the game came with a very thin Bartender's Screen screen (for those who were unaware, \"Bartender\" is what we call Game Masters in TF2V).\nThis new version is coming in at close to 264 pages, with a casebound hardcover binding, with full color art throughout.\nAt the higher levels, the actual Bartender's Screen becomes available. Printed on hardcover stock, this screen has a whole bunch of insanely useful charts and tables on the inside (for the Bartender's selfish use), and a gorgeous mural by the incredibly talented Scott Lincoln on the outside.\nSeriously, look at how beautiful that is!\nAt a slightly higher level, you get a set of custom dice. This set includes a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d30, and a d% (tens place die).\n3.5 Inches by 3.5 inches, and drenched in love.\nThe coasters, in addition to being a handy place to set the drink of your choice, have the bright and attractive Floating Vagabond logo on one side, and a unique in-game bonus on the other.\nA mock-up of the official Floating Vagabond beer mug, as served, bashed, and thrown in the bar itself!\nThe beer mugs offered are sturdy 20 oz. mugs for the serious drinker, with the Floating Vagabond bar logo printed on them in full color.\nOrdering From The Menu\nHey, look! We have add-ons! Some of the extras we are offering will be available for you to add to your pledge. More will be available as stretch goals are reached. For now, If you have pledged at the Soaked level or higher, you can add extra Official Floating Vagabond Beer Mugs to your order, so that you can serve up tasty beverages of your choice to all your Patrons (that's what we call Players).\nPlus, if you're just dying for an adventure or six to drag your patrons through, you can add one of the Classic TF2V adventure pdfs to your order for only $3 per adventure, no matter what your level.\nThere are six classic adventures to choose from:\nBar Wars\nThe Reich Stuff\nThe Adventure Without a Name\nHypercad 54, Where Are You?\nThe Cosmic Paternity Suit\nWhere's George?\nAdd-Ons Available:\nOfficial Floating Vagabond Beer Mug - $12.00\nTales From The Floating Vagabond Classic Adventure pdf - $3.00\nThis Table will grow as we reach stretch goals.\nWhat's All This Ship?\nThere've been a few very good questions about the shipping situations, and I thought I'd make everything as clear as possible.\nThe standard pledge levels, those without the word \"International\" in the name, include shipping to anywhere in the United States. Adding the \"international shipping\" fees to those levels will be sufficient for shipping to Canada or Mexico. (It's a tad more, but I'm willing to eat it in the big picture).\nThe International levels include shipping anywhere in the world, and are not recommended for backers in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico.\nDo You Have Stretch Goals? And Does This Keyboard Make Me Look Fat?\nDo we have stretch goals?! Boy do we! And yes, yes it does.\nIf we reach $35,000 then everyone who pledges $65 or more will also get a pdf of a new adventure written by Matt Vancil, the writer behind The Gamers, The Gamers 2: Dorkness Rising, The Gamers 3: Hands of Fate, and JourneyQuest.\nIf we hit $56,000 then everyone who's getting a beer mug gets a matching shot glass. Plus, everyone at the $270 level and above gets their choice of one of two Inter-Dimensional Zero-G Bowling League shirts; the Floating Vagabond \"Gutter Bums\", or the Crane's Nest \"Assass-Pins.\"\nIf we hit $62,000 then everyone at the $65 level and above gets the pdf of the brand new sourcebook Pub Crawl, written by Ross Watson (of Dark Heresy, Rogue Trader, Deathwatch, Black Crusade, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire fame).\nIf we hit $115,000 then everyone at the $90 level and above gets the extremely limited Pirate Ninja Monkey plush!\nThe prototype of the Pirate Ninja Monkey Plush.\nIf we reach $120,000, then everyone who pledges $65 or more gets a pdf of a TF2V / Shaintar crossover adventure written by Sean Patrick Fannon!\nThere are more to come, but lets see how close we can get to these, first.\nAnd finally, don't forget to share the love; check out  http://kickingitforward.org and see what other deserving projects are out here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a full-time game designer with a solid background in delivering projects.

Y\u2019know, I pitched this idea to Lee (me writing monthly updates for the KickStarter) for mostly selfish reasons. Like many, I was frustrated by the lack of information concerning the completion and release of a game that I had paid for three years ago. I also wanted to make sure work was actually being done on the project and that it would actually reach completion. Finally, I wanted to see if it could improve the outlook of the backers. Perhaps if we had a clearer glimpse into Lee\u2019s life, we would be more accepting of the delay. I want to focus on the creation of this project. We are all aware of the challenges Lee has been facing. But this is business, right? I want to hear about how the project is progressing, and so my goal is to focus on . In the last month Lee has been navigating governmental agencies that would put Red Tape Square to shame, along with battling sickness and fighting to keep a roof over his head. I have been there. When you\u2019re unwell and broke, the social safety net we have in this country is sparse and impossible to navigate in a timely manner. It\u2019s like discovering a time bomb in a library and being told to \u201chush\u201d every time you try to shout a warning. You feel unloved and invisible, your basic attempts at staying alive are pushed off with 90 day waiting periods and impossible co-pays. Imagine dealing with this in addition to serious health issues, all while attempting to write comedy. Well, that\u2019s what Lee is doing right now. And backers: I am proud to say that we are making progress. We can stick a fork in , because it is done! Regardless of the myriad issues we know Lee is facing everyday, he is moving forward to complete this game! During one of our extreme digressions in our talk this month, Lee told me about a concept called the \u201cmonkey sphere.\u201d To quickly sum up and get it wrong: this concept states that monkeys in the wild have a sphere, or collection of peers, that they care about and protect. The more successful monkeys have larger spheres, many monkeys make light work. So let\u2019s include Lee in our monkey sphere because there are things we can do to help. I\u2019m calling it the Monkey Sphere of Destiny, and there are things you can do to help. I hope by now you have spread far and wide word of Lee\u2019s GoFundMe page (). These donations have helped Lee to stay alive and keep his apartment for a while longer. In addition to that, tell fellow gamers and your local game store to check out ()! It\u2019s receiving solid reviews on Amazon, and the sale of every deck goes to Lee in addition to freeing up a 3 by 5 inch area in his living room! Lee has also told me how much our stories and good wishes mean to him. I guarantee progress next month if every backer who can afford it sends Lee positive energy in the form of a story of a beloved Vagabond character or campaign. It\u2019s that simple. Lee is in the trenches of life right now, and he needs the support. You\u2019ve given him money, you\u2019ve told people about his project, what else can you do? \u201cSend positive energy, brother.\u201d - Hulk Hogan (probably)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "Enjoy the Con!", "update_content": "For this update, Superfan Sean Ellis has once again stepped up in a big way to keep everyone informed.

Then, the upper for the KEEPER'S RULEBOOK and the lower for the INVESTIGATOR HANDBOOK?\nShards of Courage\nJenny lay on the floor whimpering meekly, entirely at the mercy of old, leathery Walter Corbitt. To help save her friend and colleague, she had tried to kill the old man -- and she had delivered a gruesome blow, to no avail. Visions of the blow replay in her mind, but Corbitt's yellow gaze continues to mock. She can't bear to watch her own demise.\nBut Corbitt has no mercy, only hunger and malice -- and the enveloping aroma of her essential liquid. Her blood will make him strong. Savoring the moment, hoary Walter Corbitt stoops low to the shuddering Jenny -- then a sharp stab of ice-cold terror rips his shoulder. No, it cannot be! \nWith a roar of manic fury Harvey, who stitched together the shards of courage left to him, unsheathed the ancient ornate knife from his left hand and with the other drives the blade deep into old Corbitt. Those long years suddenly take their toll and Corbitt cries out for the last time, crumbling to the floor in disgusting chunks and pieces. \nHarvey kicks at the remains. \u201cBy his own weapon is the devil worsted!\u201d\nLATER\u2026\nLaying flowers at the foot of the hospital bed, Harvey takes a seat. Jenny is recuperating. Her recovery had not gone well; her wounds had festered and needed several operations. Harvey watched her sleep. His own physical wounds were bandaged, though his left hand would never again function properly. His mind would take longer to mend. \nHe wondered if he should tell Jenny of the papers he found in Corbitt\u2019s hidden lair. What was the Chapel of Contemplation and why did the police carry out a raid on the place some ten years ago? Perhaps Corbitt\u2019s demise is not the end of the story, but just the surface layer of a deeper plot?\nWelcome to the new edition of Call of Cthulhu.\n(...earlier installments can be found at the bottom of this page)\nHow To Pledge?\nChoose a pledge level from the right-hand column, click on it and follow the instructions.\nPledge an amount equal to the pledge level plus shipping for your postal area. If you're not sure on the total cost please refer to the big green grid at the bottom of the Kickstarter page for exactly what each pledge level gets and the cost of shipping.\nIf you want more you have two options:\n1) you can buy more than one pledge level if you wish.

Lovecraft.\nBy Sandy Petersen with Mike Mason, Paul Fricker, and Lynn Willis.\nThe Great Old Ones ruled the earth aeons before the rise of humankind. Originally they came from the gulfs of space and were cast down by even greater beings. Remains of their cyclopean cities and forbidden knowledge can still be found on remote islands in the Pacific, buried amid the shifting sands of vast deserts, and in the frigid recesses of the polar extremes. Now they sleep -- some deep within the enveloping earth and others beneath the eternal sea, in the drowned city of R'lyeh, preserved in the waters by the spells of mighty Cthulhu. When the stars are right they will rise, and once again walk this Earth.\nCALL OF CTHULHU is Chaosium\u2019s classic roleplaying game of Lovecraftian horror, in which ordinary people are confronted by the terrifying and alien forces of the Cthulhu Mythos. CALL OF CTHULHU uses Chaosium\u2019s Basic Roleplaying System, easy to learn and quick to play. This bestseller has won dozens of game-industry awards, is a member of the Academy of Adventure Game Design Hall of Fame, and was voted the #1 Gothic/Horror RPG of all time by the GamingReport.com community. CALL OF CTHULHU is supported by a growing line of high quality supplements.\nThis Kickstarter project aims to build a new edition of this classic horror game and expand its award-winning tradition.\nTHE NEW EDITION\nAs currently envisioned, the CALL OF CTHULHU KEEPER'S RULEBOOK is a new edition of the CALL OF CTHULHU rules incorporating new options, an improved flow of combat, new scenarios, and a cleaner page layout with box and page decoration evocative of the primary period of play in the 1920s. Here are eighteen chapters including H.P. Lovecraft and the Mythos, Creating Investigators, Skills, Game System, Combat, Chases, Sanity, Magic, For Keepers, Tomes of Eldritch Lore (with over 100 tomes), Grimoire (with over 100 spells), Artifacts & Alien Devices, Monsters, Beasts & Alien Gods, three scenarios, plus a reference chapter containing Lovecraft Country, Historic Timelines, Mythos History of Earth, Sanity Quiz, Play Aids, and more. The \"Skills\" chapter contains full descriptions for each skill, including guidance on opposed skills, setting difficulty levels, examples of how to \"push\" the different types of skills, and suggested consequences for failing a pushed skill roll. The \"Chases\" chapter provides rules for all types of chases, whether on foot, driving a car or boat, flying airplanes, or being pursued by monsters.\nWe also wanted to address the players directly, and simultaneously we will also release the INVESTIGATOR HANDBOOK, intended for all players, which includes ten chapters expanding Creating Investigators with optional background packages, more than a hundred Occupations, Skills, Investigator Organizations (nine separate organizations described - The 'Wipers' Pals, Wrath's Circus of Wonders, Strange but True!, The South 13th, SKT Research, Novem Angelus, Ratched's Children, The Resurrectionists, The Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained), Life as an Investigator, The Roaring Twenties, Advice for Players, plus a references chapter. \"Life as an Investigator\" takes a look at investigative procedures and equipment, and also provides examples taken from the files of the Theron Marks Society.\nWhen Will It Come Out?\nWe want to have these books in your hands by Halloween (October 31) of 2013.\nThe rule book has been fully revised and carefully restructured to bring you the rules in the most user-friendly way. Call of Cthulhu is a well established game with a wealth of supporting scenarios, campaigns and source books. It's important to note that the 7th Edition rules remain backwards compatible so that previously published scenarios and source books all remain playable with the revised rules. We\u2019ve gone to great lengths to revise the rules in a way that retains the essence of what makes Call of Cthulhu such a great game.\nHere's an overview on some of the revisions that will be found in Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition...\nCreating your Investigator\nThere are lots of great options for creating investigators, along with advice on integrating your investigator with the story. It also provides you with support and tools for generating an investigator\u2019s backstory, enabling players to create fully rounded characters with a reason to investigate the Cthulhu Mythos.\nSkill rolls\nNot everything is so easy for the investigators -- if they attempt an especially difficult task the new rules introduce the \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019 skill rolls. Revised skill descriptions and new skills like Intimidate and Charm have been added to provide investigators with more ways to investigate and uncover the secrets of the Mythos.\nOpposed rolls\nNo need to refer to charts -- everything you need is right there on the character sheet! \nPushing skill rolls\nSometimes your investigator fails a task. With the new rules, if you want to try a second time you can -- if you can justify it! But beware -- failing a second \u2018pushed\u2019 roll will have dire consequences -- opening the door for the Keeper to take the story in all sorts of new, exciting and sometimes unexpected directions.\nLots of Advice for Players and Keepers\nThe new rules have been written with a mind to helping all players get the most of Call of Cthulhu. Particularly, a special advice chapter for Keepers on how to construct a scenario, how to build tension and horror, and how to develop the story and engage your players. Whether you are new to the game or have been playing a while, there\u2019s information and tips for everyone .\nToolkit\nOver the decades many gaming groups have developed their own style of Call of Cthulhu play, and 7th Edition provides you with options, tools and advice on how to tailor the game in a way that will suit you and your group. Whether you like things more pulpy or gritty, there\u2019s optional rules to build and scale the game you want.\nMissed a clue? No worries!\nEver had your players get stuck because they don\u2019t know what to do next? The new rules provide a mechanism for handling such tricky situations; a revision of the Idea Roll rule. Now you can throw tricky investigations at your players and not have to worry if they pick up every clue or not. The new Idea Roll helps to keep your game on track without unnecessary railroading of the players.\nSanity\nThe sanity track remains, however the Keeper is provided with new guidance on how to deal with episodes of insanity, including phobias, manias and delusions. Plus the Keeper is provided with advice on how to tamper with the investigator\u2019s backstory -- potentially corrupting their relationships, their possessions and other important aspects of their life as they sink further and further in to the cosmic abyss of the Cthulhu Mythos.\nArt used in our Spanish-Licensee publication, now available for our use!\nCombat \nSometimes your investigator will have to rely on his or her fists! All unarmed attacks now come under the one skill of Brawl, allowing you to describe your attacks as befits the situation. Weapons and firearms retain their own skill categories. Combat now works with opposed rolls, allowing you to resolve combat scenes faster than ever before and avoid drawn-out \"miss - miss\" situations, whilst giving players more options on the things they can do during a fight. Fast paced and exciting combat!\nCombat maneuvers replace the old grapple rules. Now you just describe what you want to do and roll versus your opponent -- allowing greater freedom to create exciting fight scenes. Your investigator can do more during combat than just fight or flee!\nChases\nAn entirely new chase system that allows you to combine vehicles, monsters and pedestrians in exciting chase scenes. Remember the chase scene in Lovecraft's 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth' wherein the protagonist, Robert Olmstead, flees the Gilman House hotel via a window and is pursued across Innsmouth by deep ones? These new rules enable you to stage exciting chases like that in your game.\nMonsters\nYou\u2019ll find a host of old favourites here, along with a few new faces, as well as insightful marginalia providing details, notes and ideas on many of the monsters and gods therein.\nSpells and Tomes\n7th Edition provides revised rules for how to handle magic in your game and also revisits tome reading times, as well as providing advice and ideas on how to use tomes in your scenarios and games. If your investigator has never cast a spell before you may find you get more than you bargained for! Likewise, insane ancient Mythos wizards and monsters have access to deeper realms of magic and a range of spells have suggested effects for just this type of insane casting.\nNew scenarios\n\"The Haunting\" -- the old faithful scenario is back, with added, step by step Keeper\u2019s advice for new players. Plus two new scenarios: \"Amidst the Ancient Trees\" and \"Crimson Letters\", designed for both new and veteran Keepers. \"Crimson Letters\", set in witch-haunted Arkham, provides the ideal starting point for a campaign.\nAnything else? The entire rulebook has been revised, edited and will be presented in a brand new layout with loads of cool new artwork. \nCall of Cthulhu was originally written by Sandy Petersen. Paul Fricker and Michael Mason have written, revised, and developed the new edition, in addition to developing the book's structure and adding new content throughout.\nBadger McInnes will perform the primary layout for the 7th Edition books. He worked on the award-winning Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd edition and numerous books for Chaosium and other publishers.\nPaul Carrick, the artist who created the award-winning cover for the Chaosium publication Cthulhu by Gaslight, will be creating new art for Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition. Stefano Marinetti and Alberto Bontempi have created art for Call of Cthulhu and for this Kickstarter page, and will create more.\nSteff Worthington is already working away on maps, plans, and diagrams.\nThe Story So Far...\n(read from the bottom to the top)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we face as a publisher is making sure that deadlines are met.

My friends and I had just finished up a major Star Wars (West End Games) series and we were discussing what type of game I should run next for them. A couple of my friends wanted to go the fantasy route, others science fiction, one wanted to play a \u201cregular Joe\u201d modern series and someone else wanted to play something James Bondish. I thought it would be fun to try them all at once, and Time Heroes was born. It was a simple system that worked well for an adventure or two, and then we moved on to something bigger.\nBut something about Time Heroes stayed with me through the years. Every so often, it would leap into my mind and I would feel a nostalgia for it akin to the nostalgia I felt (and still do feel) for those old Saturday morning cartoons. Then came the Fate Core Kickstarter, and everything fell into place.\nReading through Fate Core after getting in on the Kickstarter, what immediately came into my mind was \u201cthis would be perfect for running Ghostbusters!\u201d Almost immediately after I began thinking of the Real Ghostbusters cartoon and not long after, Time Heroes popped full steam into my head and I began to design.\nWhat began as a simple comedic adventure game, however, grew and evolved into much more. Not only do the employees of Time Heroes, Inc. have to chase after Morgan la Fey\u2019s goons in the present, I have also included options for running a different style of game in the future (post-apocalyptic) and the past (fantasy).\nNicole Tesla and Prixe the Perilous, a Dangerous Duo Indeed!\nWhat, Exactly, is Time Heroes (the setting) About?\nTime Heroes, in its default setting, is about stopping the evil sorceress Morgan la Fey from altering time as we know it.\nMorgan la Fey has come to a point in history where magic has long since died but before technology has evolved to completely replace it (basically, the present). She has torn open rips in the fabric of space and time to draw through armies from the past and future with which she intends to make the Earth her own. She has managed to place a time bubble around a few year block that has been separated from the normal passage of time. Her goal is to take control of the planet, send people back and then drop the bubble, altering the course of history in one fell swoop.\nThe Great Merlini, last living descendent of Merlin has gone from simple stage magician to discovering the power of his ancestor within himself with the assistance of his ancestor\u2019s book of magic, the Bionomipro. He is using this power to draw his own people through time and space in order to hold back la Fey's ambitions. While the bubble around the present allows la Fey to bring people through without repercussions, it also prevents going back to alter events that have already happened within the bubble itself. Essentially, if Merlini can keep Morgan la Fey at bay for a few years, the bubble will drop and normality will be restored.\nSo that's the basic lore behind the setting. But how do I see this play out in the game itself?\nTime Heroes is meant to be a zany romp for a group of players. Ultimately, I envision it along the lines of a television show or cartoon where, though there may be arcs here and there, primarily each session is its own episode and - much like, Inspector Gadget, for example - Morgan la Fey will always barely slip away at the end of each \"episode.\" Obviously the reasoning behind this is because if she's taken out completely, any series would be over. Also, she will be almost entirely in the background pulling strings and not in the thick of it herself. I want the world of Time Heroes to be one in which a sword-carrying barbarian, a laser mop-wielding space janitor and a Spam salesman are all equally likely as character concepts, even in one group.\nWhere Will Our Money Go?\nThis, of course, is always a big question. Firstly, we need to pay for the artist providing the art for Time Heroes (as well as any unlocked supplements), the incredibly talented Melissa Gay. She is an admired RPG illustrator and we are definitely glad to have her on the Time Heroes team!\nNext come the layout design, which also comes at a price. If you pledge at the $1 level, you'll see the high quality of the Quick-Start Packet layout, which will be similar to that included in the final product.\nThirdly, printing and shipping. We are using CreateSpace to print the final products (at least, as of now). Andrew is then having the books shipped to him prior to shipping them out to the final recipients. This will enable him to personalize any as necessary, as well as giving them a once-over to be sure nothing is glaringly wrong with the product.\nWhat Do Backers Get Out of It?\nFirstly, you'll get the satisfaction of knowing that you helped put a quality game into the market and assisted in bringing back the joy of Saturday mornings (even if the cartoons themselves are no longer around).\nThe rest will depend on the level at which you backed. However, all backer levels will include some kind of pre-access to the game (whether it's the Quick-Start Packet or the beta draft of the rules). That being said, here's what you get:\nQuick-Start Packet: Backers at any level will receive access to the Quick-Start Packet, which includes basic rules, four pre-generated characters, and the Quick-Start Episode: Rise of the Plushies. \nJoanna Gaskell (Stadard Action) and Brian Lewis (the Gamers: Dorkness Rising; Journey Quest) Playing Rise of the Plushies at Berserkon 2013.\nBeta Draft PDF: Anyone backing at $5 or higher will have access to the PDF of the Time Heroes Beta Draft. This will be art-free, but in a readable format. Plus, these backers will have a chance to give input into the final product in regards to what they feel works/doesn't work (we can't promise all changes will be incorporated, but they will be considered).\nPDF: Any level that includes the Big Bad reward level includes a copy of the official Time Heroes PDF before it is released to the public. Final retail for the PDF will be $15.\nThe Book: Any level that includes the Time Hero reward will include a copy of the softcover Time Heroes book. Initially, this will be a limited run, which means when levels that include the printed book are gone, that's it! The first 20 backers at this level will receive additional personalization (other than the signature that will be present on all 200).\nThe Poster: Levels that include the poster will include an 11\" X 17\" copy of a poster of Melissa Gay's Time Heroes cover art, shown here:\nTime Heroes Cover Art\nOther Stuff: At the higher tiers you will have opportunities to design your own Time Hero with Andrew that will be included as a pre-generated character in the final product. Or, you might get Andrew to run a Time Heroes game for your group!\nAdd-Ons:\nWe have a couple of add-ons that are available to backers. In order to receive one of these add-ons, simply increase your pledge by the indicated amount and make sure you mention in the surveys what add-on(s) you signed up for.\n$7 - A \"Very Special\" Two-Part Epsiode of Time Heroes - If you select this add-on, you will be receiving a two-part Time Heroes episode in PDF format that starts with Tiny Tim losing his crutch and will take Time Heroes, Inc. into the world of drugs and strangers with candy, maybe even beyond! The adventure will center around Duluth, MN and will provide several likely locations for scenes with pre-created aspects, NPCs, allies, villains, and likely scenes that can be strung together as needed by the GM. Think Cartoon All-Stars (and yes, just as cheesy).\n$10 - \"Rise of the\" Cthulhu Plushy - This add-on will get you a Cthulhu plushy like one of those from the Time Heroes Quick-Start Episode \"Rise of the Plushies. They will be crocheted by the extremely talented Amanda Mickelson (the genius behind the Rise of the Drow Kickstarter plushies and the Standard Action Kickstarter plushies). Want to take a look at one? Of course!\nProject Designers:\nAndrew Goenner: Andrew created the idea behind time heroes fifteen years ago. It then sat in a mental vault until Fate Core came into existence. He then adapted Time Heroes to the system, making this his first RPG project. In addition to RPG design, Andrew also writes the GeekWorld Online blog, is a co-host of the RPG podcast Play on Target and does the occasional written and video RPG review.

Donate right now before the required donation increases!\nIntro\nIt\u2019s time amazing audio came to everyone\u2019s tabletop games!\nOften using an OST from Lord of the Rings or other great movies just doesn\u2019t quite set the particular setting that the GM is striving for.\nIt\u2019s not easy finding a sorrowful howl of an undead or the ground shaking thunder of a charging orc hoard.\nTrying to change your voice just a little bit or adding an accent to try to bring some life to those non-player characters gets tiring and falls a bit flat.\nEverything changes now!\nWe are the Orange County Gaming Group and we are bringing tabletop gaming to the next level by composing a library of custom made, high quality music, voice overs, and sound effects, made by rockstar talent.  What we have sourced has been unbelievable and has transformed the way we game, but don\u2019t take our word for it\u2026.. \nMusic Location - Dwarf Temple - Actual\nThere was no better way to highlight the awe of walking into a grand dwarven temple than using this track. These are dwarves the way they are portrayed in some of the most iconic gaming environments out there and here, we can hear their reverence for their god, their connection to the smithing arts, and that resiliency that comes from those born of the stone.\nThe details are what counts and we nitpick the heck out of everything we source. We have split music into two categories, \u201cActual\u201d and \u201cAmbiance\u201d. Actual means that the music is meant to be actually performed by characters in the game and heard by the player\u2019s characters. Ambiance is just that, music the GM needs to set the mood.With that said, here are some more dwarf tracks with a religious or ceremonial theme.\nMusic Location - Dwarf Temple - Ambiance\n  Music Racial - Dwarf Ceremony - Actual\n Music Racial - Dwarf Ceremony - Ambiance\nWe want to create tons of scores that are custom written for races, locations, events, and themes, those that are often used in most tabletop games in order to provide the GM an arsenal of ways to enhance the role-playing experience. We don\u2019t mean music that \u2018sort of\u2019 sounds like it can be used for gaming, we mean music that\u2019s designed by HARDCORE gamers who understand what is needed to have music fit the gaming table. Music is just one aspect, here we have Joe J. Thomas (he\u2019s done voices for AAA video games titles) breathing life into merchants any character can and will run into.\nVO Script - Marketplace Vendor #1 (General Goods)\nVO Script - Marketplace Vendor #2 (Illicit Goods)\n\nVO Script - Marketplace Vendor #3 (Weapon Smith)\nVO Script - Marketplace Vendor #4 (Armor Smith)\nSure\u2026sure, no limit to voice overs, impossible right? Well, when we\u2019re talking voice overs, we don\u2019t just mean normal words. Ever wonder what the Infernal Language (or a language spoken by devils, demons, or other icky evil things) sounds like?\nVO Language - Infernal Language Set\nThen we go off into the world of sound effects and believe us, there is NO LIMIT to the number of custom made sound bites games desperately need. We\u2019ve been able to afford a few of these already.\nSFX Spell School - Basic Evocation Spell Effects\nSFX - Tower Collapsing\nSFX - Large Animal Roar\nSomewhat related to \u2018Actual\u2019 music, soundscapes add a non-music ambiance to a gaming session which can highlight the environment in a way that a narrative just can\u2019t do. For example:\nSFX Environment Soundscape - Castle Soundscape - Night\nSFX Environment Soundscape - Castle Soundscape - Storm\nThe Pitch\nToday, getting professionally done audio is affordable, we know where to find the talent, and we know the fantasy gaming setting. We want to put together an ever growing body of music, sound effects, and voice overs that will bring gaming to life like never before.\nGetting audio is one thing, making it simple to use is another. We are working with a tech team to design and develop a soundboard which will allow GM and player alike to quickly and easily play anything sourced on this and future campaigns on. We\u2019re aiming to avoid the need to open up audio files and start up a media player every time a track needs to be played, having everything one needs right there and ready to go. Moreover, we\u2019re working to create a nested play solution, allowing gamers to combine music, sound effects, and voice overs and have them run concurrently, allowing for some great variations (i.e. having the sound effect of a dragon roar over the soundscape of an ancient castle).\nHere\u2019s what we want to do with this money:\nWebsite enhancements and soundboard\nMusic \u2013 Location: Druid\u2019s Grove \u2013 Nature Deity\nMusic \u2013 Location: Fantasy Tavern\nMusic \u2013 Racial: Halfling Campfire / Camp\nMusic \u2013 Racial:Orc Battle Hymn, Warchant\nVO \u2013 Language \u2013 Celestial\nVO \u2013 Language \u2013 Draconic\nVO \u2013 Scripts - Innkeepers\nVO \u2013 Scripts - Alchemist / Potion Maker\nSFX \u2013 Monster Soundscape - Dragon\nSFX \u2013 Monster Soundscape - Giant\nSFX \u2013 Monster Soundscape \u2013 Pixie / Sprite / Small Fey\nSFX \u2013 Environment Soundscape - Forest\nSFX \u2013 Environment Soundscape - City\nSFX \u2013 Environment Soundscape - Swamp\nSFX \u2013 Spell School (Healing) \u2013 Cure Single Person / Cure Multiple People / Restoration (Reinvigoration)/ Regeneration (Regrowth of lost limbs) / Restoration Lost Levels (Life Force Restoration)\nSFX \u2013 Spell School (Evocation)\u2013 Fireball / Lightning Bolt / Magic Missile / Cone of Cold / Disintegrate\nSFX \u2013 Spell School (Protection)\u2013 Mage Armor / Shield / Fog Could / Blur / Wind Wall\nSFX \u2013 Weapons / Armor \u2013 Blunt Weapon hitting Wooden/Metal Shield, Chain, Plate\nSFX \u2013 Weapons / Armor - Piercing Weapon hitting Wooden/Metal Shield, Chain, Plate\nSFX \u2013 Weapons / Armor \u2013 Slashing Weapon hitting Wooden/Metal Shield, Chain, Plate\nKickstarter and associated fees.\nAs an endeavor to bring this innovation to the tabletop universe, all of the audio that we source through this campaign will be FREE for everyone to use, what we ask is a little bit from the gaming community to make this happen. We have already spent $2,000 dollars to source what we have and we can\u2019t do more on our own.\nWe humbly ask the community to pitch in to help bring everyone\u2019s games to a level never possible before. We know what we\u2019re doing and we love doing this so even though we won\u2019t make any money, we want to bring audio to a genre we\u2019re passionate about.\nWe are going to be starting to give out the $2,000 worth of top professional quality at only $15.

With \"Underworld\", we put you in another dimension. You will get over two hours of 15 minute looped tracks for general dungeon exploration in all of its complexities -- with drafts, torches, and crickets. Some tracks offer distant mysterious clangs and crashes. While others offer only the shuffle of footsteps, chirp of crickets, and drip of water. Yet another track offers you the experience of a \"sleepover\" in a dungeon.  In \"Underworld\", we take you on a tour of \"deeper\" adventure -- from the forsaken entrance of a wizard's tomb to the bustling activity of a dwarven mine (bring your earplugs) -- and we make numerous stops in between. Several tracks are offered with and without mysterious distant activity to allow the game master to better tailor the experience.(STATUS: \"Underworld\" is virtually complete.

You will stand uneasy guard atop the walls of a weathered and time worn castle and enter the Barrow of the Mad Lich King. Finally, here you will be drenched by rain and find wind blasted camping sites in the summer and winter.

Contributions of $10 or more will get you the PDF of the game and of any material from stretch goals we reach, and contributions of $25 or more will get you a printed book as well.\nAs of this writing, the translation is finished, and our graphic designer, Clay Gardner (who you might recognize as the creator of the OVA: Open Versatile Anime RPG) has already finished the layout. The aim of this Kickstarter is to fund the first print run. Our goal is to do a run of 500 copies, but if we exceed our funding goal we\u2019ll print more and if feasible bring the retail price down and provide backers with more goodies. Golden Sky Stories will also be the first release from Star Line Publishing, and we\u2019re aiming to publish more translated Japanese games, not to mention our own original works. By pledging you\u2019ll not only help Golden Sky Stories come out, but also help us launch something that will become a bridge to bring lots of other great games here from across the Pacific!\nThe original Japanese version of the game was 120 pages in B5 format (7.17\" x 10.12\"). The English version will preserve the formatting of the original as much as possible, but the page count will be a little higher with the addition of some cultural notes to help Western readers better understand the game\u2019s Japanese setting and mythology. Currently the plan is for the English version to be a B5 size 144-page softcover with a dust jacket.\nThe book has all the information you\u2019ll need to play. It includes rules for playing as the six different types of henge (foxes, raccoon dogs, cats, dogs, rabbits, and birds), play advice, a complete replay, a selection of NPCs with story hooks, and two introductory scenarios.\nIf you'd like a sneak peek at what the game is like, check out the free original replay and the Tabletop Day 2013 demo game we created!\nAdd-Ons\nAdditional Golden Sky Stories Books: Backers may increase their pledges to order additional copies of Golden Sky Stories in softcover. Add $25 for each additional copy, to a maximum of four copies total.\nMaid: The Role-Playing Game Rulebook: Backers may increase their pledges by an additional $25 to order one copy of Ryo Kamiya's previous RPG, Maid: The Role-Playing Game.\nWall Scroll: A special wall scroll featuring artwork by Ike. Wall scrolls will  be shipped separately; please add $40 for a domestic order or $55 for an international order.\nIf you wish to purchase an add-on, increase your pledge by the amount specified, and be sure to indicate which add-on(s) you want when you receive our backer survey.\nOther Rewards\nArt Prints: Backers at select reward levels will receive a set of prints of artwork by Ike, the original illustrator of Golden Sky Stories.\nMaid: The Role-Playing Game: Backers at the Kamiya Fan pledge level will also receive another of Ryo Kamiya\u2019s games, Maid RPG. This is a zany anime comedy RPG with maids trying to keep their master happy. Please be aware that Maid RPG is recommended for ages 16 and up, and although it can be a very fun game, it is not family-friendly like Golden Sky Stories.\nWall Scroll: Backers at the Local God level and above will also receive a special wall scroll featuring Golden Sky Stories artwork by Ike.\nHardcover Limited Edition: Backers at select reward levels will receive a special limited hardcover edition of the core rulebook, with the five new character types and short stories added to the back.\nOhajiki: Backers at the $200 level and above will receive a handmade cloth back containing a set of ohajiki, Japanese flat marbles, which players can use to represent Dreams when playing the game.\nInternational Backers\nFor potential international backers, we would prefer to offer the game to you at a more affordable price, but circumstances beyond our control have driven up international shipping costs considerably in the past few months, so that we are forced to charge an extra $20 for worldwide shipping (or $15 for Canada). We know it's a lot, so we're that much more grateful for your support if you do decide to pledge!\nGolden Sky Stories features beautiful, adorable artwork by artist Ike, who later went on to become a professional manga artist with Nekomusume Michikusa Nikki (\"Catgirl's Wayside Grass Diary\"). Over the course of the book you'll get acquainted with the six signature characters, plus their many friends.\nCrossover!\nOVA: The Anime Role-Playing Game is a tabletop RPG by Clay Gardner aimed at letting you play out adventures like in your favorite Japanese anime series.

There are still any number of things that could potentially go wrong with the process of getting the books printed and shipped to our backers of course, and we intend to be as transparent as possible about any difficulties that might arise.\n\nAlthough a lot of our possible bonus content will be ready ahead of time, some of the stretch goals, especially the later ones, will give us development and layout work to do after the Kickstarter ends.

Save the princess (or prince!) from a fire-breathing dragon, tackle invading squadrons of giant robots, or find true love amid campus hijinks\u2014everything you need is inside!\nThat's because when you create a character in OVA, you define what is important. You pick which attributes matter by choosing the abilities and weaknesses that match your character concept. There are no long lists of hard-coded statistics to fill out and no classes to sift through. If it's not important to your character, you don't write it down!\nCharacter creation takes minutes, and the rules are quick, consistent, and easy to understand. This makes it perfect for novices and newcomers. But if you're an old hand at gaming, there's room for boundless customization. You could give your character a simple bonus to damage, or you can stick around and detail each and every flashy move with unique perks and flaws. Or you could eschew having any combat attributes at all. OVA lets you play the story you want to create, not a predefined notion of what an adventure should entail.\nThis is actually a revised edition of the original OVA first published in 2005. While it was popular and garnered many glowing reviews\u2014don't take my word for it, just click here, here, and here!\u2014I felt it was time to take another look at the game and decide how to make it even better. I've spent the last few years tweaking and refining what makes OVA work, and replaced what was inconsistent or clunky. So even if you already own the original game, there's lots of new stuff here to make your games smoother and more fun. Complications make failed tasks more than just awkward stop signs, the new Attack ability consolidates several old ones in a way that's elegant and makes sense. This tuned-up edition of OVA simply plays better and smarter!\nSo where do you come in? I wanted to do more than revise the game itself, I wanted to rebuild the book from the ground up to be as beautiful as possible. Graced with a new logo, organized by a clean, fresh layout, and filled cover-to-cover with never-before-seen full-color artwork, OVA will be as fun to read as it is to play.\nWith such measures taken to make the content itself look great, I want to make sure that nothing is lost in the transition to print. And I need your help to produce a book with over 150 beautiful, full-color pages.\nWant to see how the game works? Download a copy of the Player Book by clicking one of the banners above.

In addition, as each goal is met, a new one will be revealed.
