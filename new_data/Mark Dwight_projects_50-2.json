[{"backer": "Mark Dwight", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The latest addition to our range takes all the strength, quality and craftsmanship you\u2019d expect from a WESN blade - and packs it into our most compact, lightweight knife to date. The Samla is inspired by our Scandinavian heritage and steeped in our love for the wilderness.\nNorthern Scandinavia is no place for a normal knife. Without a reliable blade to hand, it can be a remote wilderness, reluctant to yield its resources. But with the right blade \u2014 durable steel; an unrelenting edge \u2014 an abundance of wild game, fish and forage reveal itself. It takes a special blade to unlock the wilderness and make it home.\nOur Samla knife is inspired by our passion for the wilderness.  Before our blade was forged in steel, it was conceived in the blueberry groves of Michigan that I explored as a kid and the mountain tops of the Swedish wildness I later discovered as an adult.\nWe returned to this time to reimagine what a trail knife should be. It\u2019s why our latest WESN knife is extremely light and compact when carried, but versatile enough for food prep or precision cutting around camp. It\u2019s the knife that won\u2019t let you down when you venture to the edge.\n\nThe Samla knife is our latest design evolution of what an everyday carry should be. We started out with the sleek and practical Microblade, then scaled up to bigger tasks with the Allman. With the Henry pocket knife, we honored heritage. Each new design in the range is an extension not just of our pride, but of your capability in the outdoors.\n\nLight as a Feather\nEven casual day-explorers know that weight matters. For a hiker\u2019s knife, we knew we needed to make it compact and light as a feather, without compromising on toughness or durability. The titanium or wood scale handle measures a snug 3.25\u201d in length, and just 0.25\u201d in thickness. But this is a knife that punches well above its size - just 5.7\u201d from foot to tip when fully open, but that\u2019s steel enough to unlock the wilderness.\nWith Your Meals in Mind\nCarry the only knife you need in your cook kit. The sharp, precise steel blade measures 2.45\u201d and slices easily through prep work. It\u2019s tough and versatile enough to cope with everyday repair tasks around camp, from slicing rope to cutting canvas. \nThe Trademark WESN Durability\nOutstanding corrosion resistance means you can draw a bright, keen blade every time with minimal maintenance. We\u2019ve treated each component with care and attention in our design: From the non-locking friction folder for a smooth, steady action to the phosphor bronze washers for long-lasting, corrosion-resistant performance.\nThe Samla Sheath\nWe are excited to introduce the Samla Leather Sleeve. Hand made in Sweden, with natural vegetable tanned leather, the sleeve will age in time, showing character unique to how you use it. Both sleek and practical, the sleeve is the perfect companion for the Samla.\n\n\n\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nIn collaboration with BackersOnly, an exclusive crowdfunding agency for high profile creators. We've helped 500+ projects raise over $45MM.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a dedicated team focused on production. Since our first launch, we\u2019ve fulfilled over 30,000 orders. From our experience we\u2019ve learned there can always be bumps in the road. We promise to handle and solve each challenge in order to hit production deadlines. We have a strategic plan to hit those deadlines, however, due to unforeseen issues, there is always a small risk of delay in delivery.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWith our products focused on being instant classics, nothing about our designs are trendy or cater to hype trains. The knife you carry today will still suit your grandchild perfectly when they use it. We insist on crafting our knives at the intersection of quality and beauty \u2014 ensuring your WESN knife suits any and every occasion.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur packaging is made from post-consumer materials and 100% biodegradable. Although it\u2019s cheaper to go with plastic pull tabs and bubble wrap instead of leather pull tabs and wood shavings, we followed our convictions and went the \u201cgreener\u201d route. With our plastic-free packaging, you can toss it away and feel good about doing mother earth a solid.\nSustainable materials\nThere are many design trends when it comes to knives. The worst we\u2019ve seen in recent times is using low-quality materials, at the cost of a quick buck. Through many hours of R & D, we\u2019re very pleased with our material choice and functional design.

After receiving input from our backers, we created an expansion card with a focus on bullet journalers. \nOur new design features 3 journal specific tools to take your bullet journaling up a notch. Use the BUJO Expansion Card by itself or combine it with the Original Sketchmark for even more creative possibilities!\nAfter packing the Original Sketchmark with over 15 features, we designed the Bullet Journal Expansion Card to complement it, not replace it! We built a card with 3 bullet journal specific features that fit into a small, compact design. Paired with the features of the Original Sketchmark, the possibilities for your journaling are endless!\nThe alphabet stencils were carefully designed to make it easy for you to add titles, dates, and more to your bullet journal! Our unique punctuation stencil allows you to easily create question marks, exclamation points, and periods. The stencils are designed to fit within two vertical rows of a 5mm x 5mm grid journal.\nUse the monthly tracker to keep track of all your habits! Track everything from your workouts, eating habits, sleep schedule, spending, and much more! Our unique design gives you plenty of versatility in creating your own trackers. Use the card as a stencil to create boxes for each day or use the card as a guide to quickly number your days in perfectly spaced 5mm x 5mm boxes. Unlike most stencils, we included 2 title boxes for more options! You can create amazing titles featuring letters and symbols when you use the alignment guides above the title boxes!\nTitle alignment points make it easy to add icons and titles above your calendars. When drawing a title box, simply stop at one of the 3 marking points to include a 1, 2, or 3 letter title.\nFor example, to add \"JUN\" to represent JUNE on your calendar, stop tracing at the alignment point with 3 dots to have the perfect spacing to fit your 3 letter title. \nA single icon fits perfectly when you stop at the alignment point with a single dot above it.\nAdd some character to your bullet journal with our 10 journal icons! We included 7 basic icons that can be used to represent anything you want! We also included 3 journaling specific icons that can take on a few different meanings of their own. Each icon is designed to fit within a 10mm x 10mm box.\nJust like the Original, the Sketchmark Expansion Card doubles as a bookmark! Sketchmark\u2019s bookmark cutout keeps your Sketchmark close to your journal at all times. Use it to mark your page in your journal, textbook, or book! \nSketchmark isn't just for journaling. Use it as your primary bookmark to quickly underline key passages or use the journal icons to take notes and star, check or otherwise mark your book or textbook!\n\nPair the Sketchmark BUJO Expansion Card with the Original Sketchmark! Launched in January, our original card has over 15 tools for journaling, designing and sketching. After raising over 1700% of our initial goal, input from our Original Sketchmark customers helped us bring the BUJO Expansion Card to life! \nWe designed the BUJO Expansion card to complement the Original Sketchmark, not replace it! The features of both cards are designed to work together to give you endless possibilities in creating your journal. Watch our first Kickstarter video below to see all of the Original Sketchmark's features!\n Add-ons will be available following the campaign through Backerkit!\nSketchmark's possibilities are endless! Check out a few samples of what is possible with Sketchmark and the Bullet Journal Expansion Card below! \nGet inspired by other bullet journalers by following popular hashtags on social media! #BUJO,  #bulletjournal, #bulletjournaling", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving launched successful Kickstarters in the past we are confident that we can easily avoid many problems that arise for first-time creators.

It was our dream to develop a notebook that was \"hippo sized\" and could hold many memories/thoughts/ideas in one place.  500 pages of 68GSM Tomoe River Paper strong, with the help of 1401 original backers and many Late Pledges, that project came to life in a big way.\nThe original project as well as this one are dedicated to our son who left this world too soon. He will always be our little Hippo in the sky <3\nThe #hipposquad originally planned to launch the B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto first, but since the original campaign people have been asking for a full sized A5.  We sent out a survey to feel out interest, and now heed the call for a dual launch!  This project is our most ambitious yet, with more collaborations, multiple sizes, and added features.\nFront: B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto, Back: A5 Standard Hippo Noto\nThe Pygmy Hippo and new A5 Standard Hippo Noto, pack all of the features loved from the original Pocket A5 Hippo Noto and also add a few new twists.\nOriginal Features:\nBack Pocket:  For all your swabs, mini notebooks, stencils and more!\nElastic Closure:  To keep your Hippo secure.\nTwo Bookmarks:  Convenience in the form of ribbons.\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper:  All the things you love about 52GSM but with less ghosting, and a more robust feel.\nWhats New:\nPage Numbers!:  One of the most requested features our backers from the last Kickstarter had.\nColored Dots:  Each Pygmy and A5 Standard Hippo Noto have interior dot grid that match the elastic band closure of the book itself.  To add a bit of pop to your writing experience.\nTons of Pages!:  The Pygmy Hippo Noto boasts 400 pages, while the A5 Standard keeps the 500 page count that the original has.\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding:  The original Hippo Noto was thread bound, and this time we are making the binding even stronger by adding a piece of cloth to the profile.\nCover texture:  Some of our cover options will be textured!\nNew cloth reinforced binding.\nWe are so blessed to have the talented Robert Oster do a brand new ink color exclusively for this Kickstarter.  It is lovingly named Pygmy Purple.\nIt is a berry magenta that has excellent shading and sheen, especially on the 68GSM Tomoe River Paper of Hippo Noto.\nUp close and personal with Robert Oster Pygmy Purple\nLets Talk Specs!\nA5 Standard Hippo Noto: \nMeasures 148 x 210 mm\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper (the TR paper tone closest to white and the most popular option from our last campaign)\nPage Count:  500 Hippo Numbered Pages\nBack Pocket\nElastic Band Closure\nDot Grid Interior Printing That Playfully Matches Color of Elastic Band (additional rulings as stretch goals).\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding\nAttractive and Durable Covers\nB6 Pygmy Hippo Noto:\nMeasures 125 x 176 mm\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper (the TR paper tone closest to white and the most popular option from our last campaign)\nPage Count:  400 Hippo Numbered Pages\nBack Pocket\nElastic Band Closure\nDot Grid Interior Printing That Playfully Matches Color of Elastic Band (additional rulings as stretch goals).\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding\nAttractive and Durable Covers\nThe Colors! \nThis Kickstarter will start off with two colors, one in A5 Standard and one in Pygmy B6.  We will add more colors as stretch goals, some of which the backers will choose!  We wanted to make this Kickstarter more interactive, as we had such a great response letting the backers choose the stretch goal color for the last campaign.\nA5 Standard:  So Black.  This Hippo will feature a black cover, grey interior end pages, grey interior dot grid printing/page numbers, black bookmarks, and black elastic band closure.  The Hippo Noto logo on the front will feature a dark grey foil, in contrast to the traditional silver we use on all our other models.\nB6 Pygmy:  Purple.  Hippos are purple after all!  This Hippo Noto will feature a royal purple cover with purple interior end pages, two purple bookmarks (light and dark), fanciful purple interior printing dot grid/page numbers, and a light purple elastic band closure.\nPurple B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto Prototype\nInterior dot grid that matches the elastic bands! ***In the So Black Hippo Noto, the dots will be a grey as to not be tooo distracting.\nThe Paper\nAt the core of Hippo Noto is the paper that we use, 68GSM Tomoe River Paper.

The 0.7mm acid free gel ink flows onto your writing surface like no other. It's very reliable, and starts flowing as soon as it hits the paper. No scribbling to get it going.

To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this material will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.\nThere's none more black!\nBlack 3.0 is a super special acrylic paint. We have spent nearly 2 years tweaking its formulation to create a black that absorbs between 98 and 99% of visible light! Quite simply we've created the blackest black acrylic paint.\nBlack 3.0 brush applied to sculpture\nLast November we shared a beta batch of Black 3.0 with 1000 artists around the world for feedback and thoughts. We've now taken that information and reformulated it to be the best black we could possibly make. \nAll the photos and video content on this page are created with the final formulation of Black 3.0 from the UK factory that are producing it for us, we are excited to be playing with it and feel like it's perfect!\nWe need your help so that we can pay the paint factory to produce their minimum order quantity of our recipe so we can share our creation with everyone!\n The science behind the Black!\nWe wanted a super-flat, ultra-matte black that absorbed almost all visible light. To achieve that we went right back to the basics of paint making. The problem with existing black pigments is they are all slightly reflective (carbon is the most common and if you think of coal or charcoal you'll know it has a shine to it), so we created a whole new pigment in the lab and we call it 'Black Magick', it is born matte! This means that the mattifiers we used in Black 2.0, which added a tiny grey tint, are no longer needed making a way blacker looking paint! We've also managed to formulate a new acrylic polymer to hold the pigment, it's special because it has more available bonds than any other acrylic polymer being used in paints. This means it can cling onto way more pigment, leading to a really dense pigment load and a depth of colour not previously possible. We have sourced some brand new nano-mattifiers which we have added, these flatten out the last bits of stray light without compromising colour. \nUnedited comparison with other well known black paints\nWe have benchmarked Black 3.0 against 45 existing black paints, this photo demonstrates a small section of those, being the most commonly available black paints in the UK. We also sent beta versions of Black 3.0 to 1000 artists around the world, they filled in a questionnaire and 93% of them preferred it to our Black 2.0 (previously the worlds flattest mattest black). \nIt's super easy to use.\nOther super blacks are complicated to use and extremely expensive. Most require heat, science labs and specialist training to apply. We wanted to make a super affordable, easy to use paint that was familiar to artists so they could concentrate on expressing themselves. \nWe think that sharing your colours with others is nice! When Stuart heard that Kapoor was the only artist that could use the blackest black he felt sad but also a bit bad that he'd been making awesome colours and only using them in his own work. So he started sharing his colour creations on the internet with other artists. \nThe holy grail of paints is the ultimate zero-point black. We've been on a mission to create exactly that for a long while because we want all artists to be able to express themselves with awesome materials. The limits of your creations should be your imagination not how rich or successful you are. \nWe are a small team of artists and paint makers based in a studio in Dorset on the south coast of England. We are headed up by British artist Stuart Semple who has been making his own colours for nearly 20 years. \nWe've created and shared tens of thousands of the artiest art materials with artists all over the world including LIT (the world's glowiest glow pigment). PINK (the pinkest pink), Gold (the goldest gold), Black 2.0 (the mattest flattest black paint), Dazzle (the glitteriest plant based glitters) and many more creations. \nYou can see what we make and learn all about us on our website:\nculturehustle.com\nNo matter what reward you choose you will get at least one bottle of Black 3.0 but your support means so much to us we wanted to thank you properly.

Our goal remains to get everything done as quickly as possible and beat our listed delivery dates.  Thanks for the support!\nWe know what you are thinking, and we will go ahead and answer it for you. Yes, Kickstarter does need another pen project. Especially this one.\nSay hello to the Spoke Pen.\nThe Spoke Pen is a collaboration between Brian Conti of Spoke Design, and Brad Dowdy of The Pen Addict. And, most importantly, is built to specifically fit the best gel ink refill in the world: The Uni-ball Signo UM-151, also known as the Uni-ball Signo DX.\nThe Signo DX is a smooth-flowing, clean-writing, rich-color gel ink pen. Its quality among its competition in unsurpassed, yet on Kickstarter, the Signo DX has been mostly overlooked.\nSpoke brings an instantly recognizable design: A streamlined geometric-deco style in a world of minimal cylindrical machined pens. We're not knocking minimal design, but everything can't be minimal!  \nthe machined pen that's MACHINED A LOT!\nThe Spoke Pen features aluminum barrel construction, grip materials in aluminum or titanium, a magnetic cap for secure closure, and wide range of anodized aluminum colors. For you tech-spec geeks out there, here are the specifics:\nAs important as the specifications are, it was very important for us to get the feel of this pen right. We started prototyping all of the parts in June 2018, and went through many iterations to get to the final result we have today. The Spoke Pen feels light, but substantial. It is rock-solid and durable, but gets out of the way when writing with it or carrying it. It is high quality, and comfortable. The Spoke Pen is your new favorite pen.\nThe goal of the Spoke Pen campaign is to make the best barrel for the Uni-ball Signo DX on the planet. And, to have fun doing it by offering a wide range of colors in this campaign. Assuming it all goes well, after we successfully fulfill the Kickstarter we plan to periodically release future Spoke Pen 'editions' with more unique color combinations and materials. And yes, we may eventually make it for other refills too, such as the Pilot G2. \n Spoke Pen Classic Series: $60 Aluminum Grip / $65 Titanium Grip\nThe classic colorway has matching anodized barrel and cap, with black anodized accents (clip, ends, and slot see-through).  It is available with a black anodized grooved aluminum grip or a machined grooved titanium grip.  The Titanium grip is slightly heavier than the aluminum... and as a bare machined part it is a bit 'grippier' than the aluminum.\nBarrel color choices: Black, Blue, Red, Lime, Purple, Orange, and Rub/Brushed Aluminum\nSpoke Pen Classic Series colorway (black anodized grip)\nSpoke Pen Classic... aluminum barrel with Titanium grip.\n Spoke Pen Edition Series: \n1) The Joker, $60\nPurple Cap, Lime body, Black Aluminum grip, Black clip, Purple sleeve, lime top cap, purple end cap.\nSpoke Pen Edition Series... the Joker\n2) Orange Crush, $65\nOrange body, Titanium grip, Nickel clip, Aluminum see-through, Aluminum end caps (metal stamped Spoke 'S' on cap end). \nSpoke Pen Edition Series: Orange Crush\nAll pens ship with a Uni-ball Signo UMR-1-05 Black 0.5 mm gel pen refill.\nWe've concepted, prototyped, and iterated using 3D printing and machining. The design is now complete. Brian leads the manufacturing stage and has extensive experience with prior Spoke projects. While he has the ability to make prototypes and product in small quantities, we choose to work with professional machine shops to produce production quantity parts. While Spoke has traditionally utilized only domestic shops, the Spoke Pen will use a combination of US and overseas shops. Brian has lots of experience with overseas shops from his corporate days. The overseas shops have a good ability to deal with anodizing a broad range of colors over a relatively small quantity of parts. The plan is to use a specific shop in Shenzhen that Brian has experience with for the aluminum parts requiring anodize and the US shop Brian traditionally works with for the straight machined parts.\nEach Pen has 10 custom parts. These will be brought in individually and everything will be inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped out by Brian & Brad. There's quite a bit of work that goes into assembling each pen, and we'll show the process as the project moves along.\nA high level overview of the timeline is as follows ...\nBrian Conti is a design engineer and founder of Spoke Design.  Brian runs a small product development company with his brother Dan (Conti-Bros, Inc.). Their brands include Strong Like Bull Magnets, Yaket, and Baux.\nBrad Dowdy has been writing stationery reviews online at The Pen Addict since 2007, co-hosts The Pen Addict Podcast, and makes pen cases and paper goods at Nock Co.\nWill <insert refill here> fit the Spoke Pen?\nYes: Uni-ball Signo 207/307, Uni-ball RT1, Pentel Energel, Zebra Sarasa Clip\nNo: Pilot G2, Pilot Juice, Pilot Hi-Tec-C, Pentel Slicci, Pentel Hybrid Technica, Parker-style.\nWill <insert refill here> EVER fit the Spoke Pen?\nAt some point in the future we will design a Spoke Pen model to fit other refills.\nDoes the pen cap post on the back the pen?\nNo, it doesn't. This is to reduce length in use, lower writing weight, and provide better weight distribution and balance.\nThanks for visiting the project. We look forward to getting Spoke Pen into your hands!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Spoke Pen project brings together two veterans of running successful Kickstarter projects. As noted above, we've spent a good amount of time prototyping to get the design to a production ready point. We have good experience producing machined pencils and other products, and we have good experience with the overall Kickstarter process (funding/manufacturing/fulfillment). The main 'risk' is the delivery timeline. We'll be working with outside supplier partners, and so at times we'll have somewhat limited ability to 'push' to get things done.

I\u2019ve often been asked to compile them into an art book, and I finally have!\nfinished paintings on my workbench(technically a work floor, in this case).\nStrange Friends is a postcard book featuring 20 paintings of odd creatures, furry, scaled, blerpy, and/or horned. It will be offset printed on a lush felted paper, and each postcard will be a art-print quality piece of art. The cover will be a lovely thick cardstock, with foil printing! I make beautiful objects, and I intend to make this one as fancy as I can!\nOf course, I am a very practical person, so they are also nice postcards that should be sent to people you like. \nHere are some of the creatures that will be in the Strange Friends postcard book.\nGood friends. Much friends.\nThis is a very straightforward Kickstarter - you can buy the postcard book, or buy multiple copies of the book. That's because I just want to make this book, and I want to make it a beautiful and special object! There is a one fancier option, where I'll hand-wrap the book for you so you can give it as a very thoughtful gift. For Kickstarter's Make 100 program, I am also making a care package edition, which allows me to indulge in telling weird little narratives through ephemera and other objects.\nHere is a draft of what the cover will look like! I'll be hand painting it, and updating you on its progress in Kickstarter updates. The pink bits will be rendered on the cover in shiny foil! \nDigital First Draft - Strange Friends cover.\nThe Make 100 Care Package edition\nI love making care packages, as my long-time Patreon subscribers can attest to, and this is a lovingly hand curated care-package of the Strange Friends postcard book, limited edition prints, heartfelt letters from fictional girls, and other delightful handmade ephemera and found objects. I don't want to spoil the arc of the tiny-story-in-a-package, but the keywords are: mysterious disappearances, summer camp, and special beasts. \nI\u2019m using this as a platform to experiment with new found object narratives that won\u2019t be available anywhere else!\nCombining pledge levels\nPlease pledge at the highest pledge reward level listed that you would like, and add the additional cost of other reward levels you want to your pledge. \nCosts, and other details.\nPrinting costs for this book, including proofing, fancy foil printing, felted paper, and shipping from Malaysia, will cost approximately $11,500.00.

We worry almost constantly and there's nothing in this world saying that we have to. It doesn't change anything or fix the problem, but we do it anyway. We constantly pull from our bank of emotions and hormones to pay for this debt that doesn't exist. \nHow worrying can affect your body\nChronic worrying can lead to the triggering of fight or flight which causes the body's sympathetic nervous system to release stress hormones. Those hormones cause physical reactions like dizziness, fatigue, headache, inability to concentrate, nausea and shortness of breath to name a few. If excessive worrying and high anxiety go untreated, they can lead to depression. These effects are a response to stress. Whether or not you become ill depends on how you handle stress and there are things you can do to alter the way you respond.*\nHere are a few things that can be helpful\nExercise\nEat a healthy diet\nDon't drink too much caffeine\nLearn to relax\nMeditate\nBe conscious of your worries\n*I'm not a doctor. I just read a lot and have dealt with worry, anxiety and stress like all of us.\nA few years ago, I started manually machining various types of Worry Coins. They vary in metals, woods and sizes. Last year I had the idea that I'd laser engrave this quote into a coin but it was missing something and made these hand made coins even more expensive. I really wanted to be able to offer a more affordable version of a Worry Coin with this quote but, at the time, was not aware of Shire Post Mint's ability to create a concave surface on one side, so I shelved the project. A few months later, I saw what they could do with a coin so reached out to my favorite designer, Mike Major, and got to work. I couldn't be happier with the result. The size, weight, design and cost are the perfect balance and I'm sure you will enjoy.\nCheck out the coin page on my website to see some of the original hand made versions.\nwww.jllawsonco.com\nIs this coin the answer to your worries?\nI don't believe there is one answer to all anxiety or worry but I do believe that an object like a \"worry stone/coin\" can aide in self soothing. Here's a little excerpt about the origin of worry stones.\nFrom the perspective of cognitive behavior therapy, the use of worry stones is one of many folk practices that can function as psychologically healthy self-soothing exercises. Such techniques are imparted at an early stage of treatment, displacing any familiar but destructive coping methods (nail-biting, scratching, lip-biting, etc.) that the patient may have developed. This helps ready the patient to safely confront anxiety or trauma. Worry stones are simple and intuitive enough to be useful in therapeutic contexts where complexity and unfamiliarity are paramount concerns, such as when offering short-term treatment to refugees or children with post-traumatic stress disorder. After a patient has mastered a more sophisticated relaxation script for anxiety management, the worry stone itself can serve as a physical 'relaxation script reminder'; the patient may notice an impulse to use the object, and thereby become aware of their own anxiety.  The rubbing of the stone can create a sense of relaxation making the mind more relaxed and generating a sense of calmness.  There are also people that may use them during meditation practices, this is known to center a persons concentration benefiting the meditation\nThe soothing, repetitive motion of rubbing this concave coin is the perfect conduit to being present.\nLearn to relax, meditate and be conscious of your worries. This coin helps with all of those. Meditation equals relaxing but it doesn't have to mean sitting on a pillow in the lotus position. Meditating is being present and breathing. The soothing, repetitive motion of rubbing the concave coin is the perfect conduit. It's also a good way to remind yourself to let the worry go.\nMost importantly, carry this coin to remind yourself that worrying won't change the problem you're anticipating.\nThe original inspiration for my Worry Coins were traditional worry stones.\nThe difference between worry and concern\nAm I saying that you should never be concerned about a current or potential problem? Of course not, but take steps to handle the problem and let it go. I used to have a ton of trouble sleeping at night because I'd lay there thinking of all the things I needed to do in the near or distant future. In other words, I'm laying there worrying about it when there was absolutely nothing I could do about it at the time...I'm supposed to be sleeping! The worst part is that the majority of those worries never even came true...that debt I didn't owe again.\n1.25\" diameter\n.200\" thick\n1.1 oz\nAvailable in solid Bronze, Copper or .999 Silver\nsmooth concave on one side\nA little bonus for you spinning top collectors!

This Micro Top is a bit of an homage to my dad. He made the original around five years ago as a joke before the spinning top craze took off.

To ship one of these coins the right way, it has to be considered a \"package\" which is now a minimum of $13 for most countries ($9 for Canada). A 1 oz package costs me $13-$15 to ship. I don't pad the cost in any way. The only option that is cheaper than that is to ship a \"document\" and ranges $4-$8. The problem with this is that it's not a document so your package can get held up or sent back and it's just not worth the trouble. I know that other creators and companies sometimes charge less for International shipping but I can't tell you exactly why. Possibly they get better bulk rate, possibly they are shipping the product incorrectly or, more likely, they are padding the cost of the product with shipping costs to make it look like the shipping is cheaper or free. The fact is that shipping is shipping and no company can just absorb shipping costs unless they are making up the difference somewhere else. Thanks for your understanding.\nAbout us\nJ. L. Lawson & Co. was founded in 2011 with the idea to machine some rings and have a side gig. My dad was a manual machinist in the middle of the desert so work wasn't easy to come by. The company began to grow in 2012 so pops had to start training me (Anthony) in the shop. We made some spinning tops that year and machining was kicked into high gear since then. A few years ago, I came up with the idea to have a Decision Maker coin minted and found Shire Post Mint. This is my fifth coin design from the Shire and I couldn't be happier with the results. Finding good vendors for various businesses I've had has always been a nightmare so it's a true pleasure to find someone that I can trust and rely on. I believe Mike Major was sent to me via the universe when I realized that he was not only a customer of mine but I had been following a company that he was part of. He'd done the graphics for Wool and Prince and I kept meaning to reach out to them to ask who did there work. Before I could do that, Mike reached out to me to tell me how much he like the products he purchased from me and I noticed his email address was from Wool and Prince. Madness. To date, the trio of myself, Shire Post (Woody) and Mike Major has been the perfect marriage of talents and I'm sure there are many more pieces to come.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 11th Kickstarter campaign so I've gotten pretty streamlined with the process.

Ziusudra, a man well known for his humility and obedience. Ziusudra did as Sumer God commanded him and built a huge boat, in which he successfully rode out the flood. Then similar stories were then appeared in Epic Atrahasis (1500 BC), Epic of Gilgamesh, Deucalion in Greek folk mythology, Noah in Genesis, and so on.\nThe Deluges Stories\nThe Design: \nDeluge is the first series fountain pen released by our team, Genesis Pen. They tributes to the cultural heroes in the Deluge mythology by using the unique interior barrel design. The transparent barrel refracts the unique internal ink chamber. It assembled with a stack of rectangular blocks representing the Tablet of Eridu Genesis. Each layer of block rotates 11 degrees symbolizes the Deluge story in the Tablet XI of Epic of Gilgamesh. The whole structure consists of 50 layers of blocks and assembles as a helical structure that emulates the DNA 3D structure, the fundamental molecule of life. The ink chamber capacity is approximately 3 ml, which is larger than most ink cartridges, converters, and piston fillers. The Deluge initially comes with three styles named Ziusudra, Atrahasis, and Deucalion, after the historical heroes in the Deluge stories. Furthermore, we will release Noah, when the Stretch Goal is reached.\nClose-up of the metal rings\nThe ink channel\nZiusudra with ink\nZiusudra with ink\nModels:\nDeluge - Ziusudra\nZiusudra\nZiusudra with the cap on\nZiusudra comes with the unique glass-like resin with golden rings. The hand-painted golden helix symbol and the sliver/gold two-tone nib make Ziusudra unique. \n Deluge - Atrahasis\nAtrahasis\nAtrahasis, a fully transparent demonstrator comes with silver color German-made stain steel nib.\nDeluge - Deucalion  \nDeucalion\nDeucalion, with unique triple black design together with a black ruthenium plated steel nib, makes it one-of-a-kind fountain pen in the market. \nThe Making of: \nTo construct such a complicated ink chamber structure inside the narrow pen barrel will not be successful without the use of edge-cutting technology, the Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Resin Printing. This technology uses light to solidify liquid photocrosslinking resins into a rigid solid resin. This technology opens up a new horizon in fountain pen design. \nMaterial: Fountain pen users have a high requirement and expectation towards fountain pen's materials and their durability. We have been searching for resins that give satisfaction texture and at the same time, compatible to SLA 3D printing. After a lot of trial and error, we finally identified the ideal material by using a self-formulated photo-crosslinking resin that is ideal for the fountain pen. After constructed by state-of-the-art 3D printing technology, the material will be solidified and remains strong, transparent, and unique. The material is resistant to water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, and most other organic solvents. Stable up to 200\u02daC heating. The Deluge series uses the hollow eye-dropper type of ink filling system. To facilitate pen washing, we paid a lot of effort in formulating the resin that can make the pen washing and writing be enjoyable. The rings on the pen are costed-bronze, which is shinny and rust resisting. \nHandcrafting: SLA 3D printing together with the self-formulated resin only took us halfway in reaching our goal. After printing, the material is rough and non-transparent that does not look like a pen that people will love. In order to solve this problem, we recruited a specialist to our team who has good pen polishing skills. We spent a lot of time researching the best polishing process for this new type of material. Finally, we came up with a series of processes to turn the printed \"object\" into a unique fountain pen that is transparent and rigid, yet feels smooth and warm like ebonite. \nBefore and after hand-polishing\nPen washing has been a lot of people's concern, therefore we are adding a pen washing video to show the ease of cleaning. With our self-formulated resin, we ensure the ink will not be trapped in the ink chamber. \nPLAY\n\nSpecifications:\nLength: 142.6 mm caped. 112 mm without the cap.

Its uses are almost endless, yet few people use it. Why?\nBecause there is no holder designed to fit the needs of us makers.\nSo we decided to make one.\nThe Maker Knife is a tool made to be carried every day, everywhere you go. It is compact, lightweight, super quick and easy to open. No more looking for a blade. No more interruptions while you\u2019re working on a project. The Maker Knife is always there, ready to swiftly help you work more efficiently.\n- Jimmy Diresta\n          Oh yeah did we mention it\u2019s freaking magic? The locking mechanism is extremely easy to use. There are no buttons to push. No weird finger movements to do. You can just flick it open with your thumb or a finger.\nThe blade holder automatically locks securely into place when it reaches the top and by witchcraft unlocks when you pull it back down. It really does feel like magic!\n\"WTF!?? How does it work?\" - That guy in a red shirt that tried to figure out the mechanism for 2 minutes while pushing it back and forth.\nNo springs, just magic.\n          More magic! Pretty cool right? And this is without the use of springs! It's all you. You see the Maker Knife is adjustable. You can choose from a range of \"almost impossible to open\" to \"wrist flick to open\". Both offer great holding strength while retracted (no worrying about it opening in your pocket), and you can tune it to feel just the way you want it to feel.\nIt's also a fantastic feature for increasing the \"child safety\" factor of the knife as you can make it require a lot of force to open. (Obviously don't let kids anywhere near a knife of any kind though)\nWe made it for you, and us.\nWe love the utility knife blades because you can scrape, pry, cut, chop, stab, sand or whatever without worrying about them getting chipped, dull, bent or broken. They are cheap and easy to find at hardware stores, so you can just swap the blade when it gets worn out and have a new flawless, razor sharp edge in seconds.\n          What we don't like is the lack of a good way to hold them. Most handles are bulky and heavy, mainly made for industrial applications. - That won't work for us makers!\nWhat we need is a convenient, super quick knife that is lightweight and compact. A design that is made to be an EDC (Every Day Carry) item.\nSo we decided to make the Maker Knife.\nHere we are, five months later, with a finished design. You would think designing a holder for a blade would be pretty straightforward right? But we didn't just want to make a stick and shove a blade on there. No, we wanted to make something so good that you would like to carry with you, all the time, every day.\nPrecision manufacuring\nThere were these extraordinarily complex problems that needed to be solved in order to achieve the magic feeling we were seeking. Some parts were impossible to mill using CNC machines, so we used extremely accurate EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining), making cuts that are no thicker than a human hair.\nWith a core of high strength stainless steel\nSuper quick to use in either hand\n          It took many, many tries, prototypes and curse words to perfect this deceptively simple looking locking mechanism. A locking mechanism so intuitive and easy to use that you don't even think about it, you just use it, no matter which hand.\nSome of the very early prototypes\nYou can even unlock the Maker Knife wearing thick gloves.\n\"You really don't have to think about using the Maker Knife. You're already done.\"\nDid we mention it's waterproof?\n\"Unlocking the maker knife is the transition from a thought to an action. That is why we made it flawless.\"\nThe Maker Knife is available in two different finishes; Black or Silver.\nThe silver finish is very similar to a pretty well known computer model\nThe clip can be mounted on either side of the knife\nOnce the campaign is over, we will ask which finish you prefer, so you don't have to make this difficult decision just yet. Pledge now - choose later.\nMaterials\nTo ensure the best performance we made the core from high strength corrosion resistant stainless steel. The case is made from aerospace grade aluminium to keep the Maker Knife as light and agile as possible. This combination also means that the Maker Knife is waterproof.\nSpecs:\nHeight closed: 108mm\nHeight open: 140mm (with blade)\nWidth: 33mm\nThickness: 7.7mm\nWeight: 65g (with blade)\nAbout the thickness of a modern smartphone\nThis makes the Maker Knife very natural to carry\nSo that you can take it with you everywhere you go\nThis resulted in a knife that got its beauty through function\nWe really do believe we made the best utility knife. It's everything we ever wanted a utility knife to be. We think you will feel the same.\nCeramic blades\nCeramic utility knife blades? Yeah, they are really cool! Ceramic is really, really good at keeping an edge. You can cut foam, cardboard, leather, fabric and such and it will probably never go dull. It's fantastic for RC scratch builders, crafts, leather makers and many others.\nBut as always in life there are tradeoffs. Ceramic blades will chip when abused. Cutting very hard things like hard wood and such is not really its intended use. Use cheap metal blades that you can pick up local to you for stuff like that.\n- Only available as part of the knife bundles during the Kickstarter-\nBlades will be available on MakerKnife.com after the Kickstarter has ended. \n The Diresta Maker Knife\nJimmy Diresta decided to launch a Diresta version of the Maker Knife with a custom brass top plate that he'll customize himself with his brand. The Diresta brass plate comes as an addition to the normal top plate in the color of your choice.\nDiresta Maker Knife with Black Base\nThe Diresta Brass plate comes as an addition to the standard plate.\nHelp promoting this campaign by:\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox Partner Program\nPress Relations PressWisdom\n The Team\nTwo like-minded makers.

We need to make several molds and they can be quite expensive. It only makes sense to have them made if there is enough volume of parts being produced. That is why we are here on kickstarter!

Makers unite to make a tool!\n\nThis is our first kickstarter project and it's going to be a excellent learning experience for us.\nHowever it is not our first time doing product development and fulfilment.

We will try our utmost to deliver on time, but if we do run into any problems we will try to be as transparent as we can and communicate this to you here on kickstarter.\n\nThank you very much for supporting us in this endeavour.

Tarot; French cartomancy; transformation deck; analytical psychology; art; surrealism; symbolism; fingerprints; vintage prints; and illustrations (to name only a few.) \nWhy is this deck unique? Each card tells a story. The whole deck paints the landscape of our lives with vintage engravings and prints\u2014the ideal synergy between significance and design in a pack of cards. There is nothing like it out there\u2014that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it! \nCartomancy, divination? Yes, of course! The Catomancer Poker Deck uses the existing structure of a standard deck of cards as a canvas for a new insightful cartomancy system. ALL the cards feature universal archetypes and symbols making it a very instinctive tool for divination. But if you're not into this, you will still enjoy the deck for its beauty and uniqueness.\nMy dream will come true! When funded, each deck will be printed with the highest quality by the United States Playing Card Company. For me, the creation of this deck is THE quest to create playing cards I could see only in my dreams.\n_____________________________\nIMPORTANT: If you are from the United States, please select the rewards named \u201cUSA Shipping rate\u201d or \u201cUSA\u201d in order to get the proper price for your reward.\nDiamond: Sensation, perception with our senses, childhood and earth. \nSpade: Thinking, becoming part of society, early adulthood and air. \nHeart: Intuition, abundance and fertility, midlife and water. \nClub:  Feeling, knowing without reasoning, late adulthood and fire.\nAs a tribute to the people who have gotten their hands dirty with ink creating the engravings featured in the deck, I have made the suit symbols with fingerprints. As a result, no suit symbol is ever repeated on the same card. For instance, the 10 of Diamonds has 10 different fingerprints!\nThe timeworn paper background of the front of each card is a section of a larger paper so that the background of each card is different (no annoying repeated markings anywhere.) Of course the backs are uniform for obvious reasons.\nThe meaning of each card is printed in the margin of the card in both English and French as a tribute to French Cartomancie.\nThe deck contains hundreds of engravings, sometimes as many as five different designs in the same card. There is always something new to discover every time you look at them.\nRed Joker Unconsciousness: our deepest level of consciousness, a pool of desires, dreams, spirituality and emotions. \nBlack Joker Consciousness: our individual awareness of the world: sensation, thinking, intuition and feeling. \nThe ornaments on the tuck box and on the back of the cards are old foundry ornaments used in early printing.\nI want to include with each deck a companion book. It will be a 32 page booklet the size of the box, containing an introduction to the deck, keyword meanings for each card, and ideas for divination. To produce the booklet and include it with each deck we need to reach the STRETCH GOAL of $16,500.\nUncut sheet\nYou can really appreciate the collection of images and the color scheme for each suit on the Cartomancer Poker Deck\u2019s uncut sheet.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have spent many months working on every detail of this project to ensure that the production and shipping will be efficient and without issues. It's mainly for that reason that I have chosen not to include add-on items that could slow down the production of the deck itself.\n\nThe cards are designed and ready for production as soon as funded.

Last year we brought the KOSMOS Pen to life with your help. By now we shipped over 3000 pens around the world. Many of you have been waiting for a Titanium Version and after months of refinement we are finally able to present: the KOSMOS Titan.   \nWith your support we will be able to realize the production run of this ultimate Titanium Version of KOSMOS in two beautiful surface finishes. \nJust shift the Cap! - The magnetic forces inside KOSMOS are perfectly balanced. A strong Neodymium magnet holds the cap safely in the idle and writing position.\nFun to Play! - The simplest and most intuitive way to get a pen ready for writing: our new mechanism makes it possible.\nDesigned by Nature - The minimalistic design of KOSMOS is based on a universal pattern of nature: the Golden Ratio.\nThe best Material for a Lifetime Product - each part of KOSMOS is lathed from a solid block of highly durable Grade-5 Titanium.\nThe KOSMOS Titan is precision-machined out of solid Grade-5 Titanium. This remarkable material combines highest durability with exceptional light weight. We worked hard to achieve KOSMOS\u2019 ultra-high tolerances with Titanium. The effort paid off: the magnetic mechanism works more smoothly than ever which gives the pen a unique feel of quality.\nThe Titan comes in two distinct finishes: a mirror polished version and a matt version.\nThe KOSMOS Titan comes in a redesigned matt-laminated premium packaging in all black.\nThe Mirror-Polished Version of Titan runs through multiple extensive polishing stages to make it shine like a mirror.\nThe Matt Version of Titan has a nice satin feel of the surface and is especially resistant against scratches.\nThe classic version of KOSMOS is precision-machined from solid Grade-6 Aluminium. It comes with a matt surface finish, which runs through a special anodisation process. This makes the pen very resistant against scratches and wear.\nFor this new Kickstarter campaign, we improved the functionality of the classic Aluminium KOSMOS entirely. This 2.0 version of our original pen is not available anywhere else yet. Same as the KOSMOS Titan it comes with refined tolerances and a even smoother mechanism.\nYou can choose from 3 reward tiers: the KOSMOS Titan in a single pack, the KOSMOS Titan in a 2-pack and the classic KOSMOS Aluminium. \nIf you\u2019d like to receive multiple rewards, simply add the respective amount to your pledge:\n\u20ac89 KOSMOS Titan\n\u20ac169 KOSMOS Titan 2-pack\n\u20ac45 KOSMOS Aluminium\nYou will select the color you'd like to get in a Backerkit survey after the campaign.\nThe stilform Accessories will be available in the Backerkit Survey after the campaign.\nTo make your KOSMOS Pen truly the perfect everyday carry, we created a Leather Pouch that protects and holds it safely while you're on the go.\nThe Walnut Holder is the perfect place to keep your KOSMOS and present its design even better \u2013 wherever it may be: whether on your desk at work or at home in your living room.\n   Specifications:\nKOSMOS Titan Material: Grade-5 Titanium, Weight: 42\nKOSMOS Classic Material: Grade-6 Aluminium, Weight: 26 g\nBlack Premium Cartridge with German Ink and Swiss Tungsten Tip included, Size M\nCompatible with all G2 Standard Refills (Parker-Style Refills)\nGift Box Packaging\nWe have been working together with our trusted manufacturer for a long time. The production of the KOSMOS Titan is all set up and we have already produced a small batch of the polished version. In the process we gained valuable experience and resolved the production challenges of the Titanium material. So now we can make sure the production of all Kickstarter rewards runs as smoothly as possible.\nTo speed up the production process we arranged special condition with our manufacturer: We will order the raw material and start first lathing operations even before the campaign has ended. So you will receive your highly anticipated KOSMOS Titan as early as possible.\nThe final quality control of the pens will be done by ourselves personally. Afterwards a professional fulfillment partner will take care of the shipping of packages to your homes.\nSometimes the simplest things are the most profound. Attention to detail is of utmost importance when you want to look good.\nDesign and style should work toward making you look good and feel good without a lot of effort so you can get on with the things that matter. Follow us on our journey! - stilform \n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risks and challenges are as follows:\n\nProduction delays: \nWe are working with extremely experienced machining and finishing suppliers that are used to handling quantities well over the amount that are typical for Kickstarter which means that there is little risk of a production bottleneck. Though it is unlikely, delays can still happen as machinery can break down, raw materials can arrive late etc. which can create unanticipated setbacks. If this highly unlikely scenario takes place, frequent communication and transparency with our backers is our top priority.\n\nPens are popular on Kickstarter so our funding goal could be exceeded significantly.

It was discovered in 1929 by German sculptor, inventor and mathematician Paul Schatz.\n From art to toy, from math to joy...\nA desktop sculpture that brings art, science, beauty and technology together in a single piece of solid metal. Perfect for thinkers, makers, visionaries, learners, teachers, and even for children.\nIts hypnotic motion and flawless-smooth texture make it a great tool for stress-relief and concentration. A unique object that unleashes creative thinking and mindfulness.\nUNLOCKED AT $1,000,000\nThe Black Oxide Oloid.\n  The oloid is a striking, elegant piece that looks beautiful in your desk. Its fascinating shape is the perfect conversation starter.\n What is so special about the oloid?\nAlthough its shape is curved, it moves in a perfect straight line. \nAlthough its shape is not round, it rolls. \nIt has sharp edges, but its motion is gentle and smooth. \nWhile it rolls, every single point of its surface touches the ground.\nIts surface area is identical to a sphere of the same radius.\nIt's surface is developable, meaning it can constructed from a flat sheet.\nIt has incredible functional properties; the oloid shape can be used for water treatment, as a propeller in navigation, or as stirrer in biotechnology.\n  Made from liquid metal\nWe use a precision casting method to ensure every piece has the mathematical perfection of the oloid.\nFirst, we create perfect wax oloids out of a precisely machined aluminum mold. These wax shapes are used for the casting process.\nThe wax shapes are dipped in different ceramic materials and melted in a furnace at 500\u00ba C. Then, molten metal is poured into the ceramic molds, which need to get destroyed afterwards to reveal the metal pieces.\nThe mysterious shape\nIf the distance of two centers of disk is equal to the radius, then the convex hull produces another figure that rolls smoothly and is known as the oloid. (Schatz 1975).\nDue to his art studies and his discussion of questions relating to space and the zodiac, Paul Schatz discovered in 1929 that the Platonic solids could be inverted. In particular the Invertible Cube, elaborated in accordance with the respective laws, and its specific, rhythmic mobility were to become the basis upon which Paul Schatz was to build his Oloid.\nThe surface of the oloid is a developable surface, meaning that patches of the surface can be flattened into a plane. While rolling, it develops its entire surface: every point of the surface of the oloid touches the plane on which it is rolling, at some point during the rolling movement. \nUnlike most axial symmetric objects (cylinder, sphere etc.), while rolling on a flat surface, its center of mass performs a meander motion rather than a linear one. In each rolling cycle, the distance between the oloid's center of mass and the rolling surface has two minima and two maxima.\nRewards\n*To order multiple Oloids, just select the reward you want and increase the reward amount by multiplying the reward cost by the number of Oloids you want.  \nSpecs\n   Reward Upgrades and Add-Ons Guide\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge MX$ 440 or more", "title": "Early Bird Oloid!", "descp": "You can choose either brushed or polished finish.

There is always inherent risk when bringing new products to market. Production delays can occur, and we are first to admit that we have definitely experienced them before. This is our second Kickstarter campaign, and the experience we gained 3 years ago (and the journey since) has been invaluable for the planning of this campaign. We are now well versed in the production process, and have taken all steps to ensure the process goes as smoothly as possible. \n\nBut we don't like over-promising something - so here's a few potential risk areas, and how we have mitigated them. \n\n- Bottle production - quality. In our first campaign we hit a number of roadblocks - learning how to produce flat bottles with an offset neck, whilst maintaining good clarity and quality. There were months of back and forth with samples before we finally arrived at the final product. This time, we have done this grunt work in the lead up to this campaign, and have strong existing manufacturer relationships in place. \n\n- Soft good production - Manufacturing soft goods also has it's challenges. Maintaining a consistent quality of leather, fitment and stitching requires serious expertise. We've teamed up with Melbourne fashion label Kinnon to ensure that quality of the leather sleeves is top notch.\n\n- Shipping and logistics - setting up a logistics system to effectively and efficiently ship to backers all over the world is not easy - and is a hugely time consuming process.

It\u2019s been perfected to ensure a long lasting and stable bass performance.\n  Does a tiny speaker mean weaker sound? No. With 20-watt amplifiers (two pieces of 10-watt amplifiers) processing audio output, the Poison sounds more vast than other speakers of similar size.\nWe\u2019ve engineered renowned Waves\u00ae MaxxAudio Acoustic Solution that\u2019s built into the speaker, so it can produce richer and full-bodied sounding content. The algorithms of sound perception(including noise and music) create a perceived low bass and compensate for the acoustic limitations of tiny devices. Waves received a Technical GRAMMY\u00ae Award in recognition of its outstanding contributions to the recording industry.\nWith a 2000mAh built-in rechargeable battery, Poison can play up to six hours of CD quality music wireless and portable. If you prefer to connect in another way, the Poison also lets you connect via the aux cable.\n    Like a fine wine that became even more valuable with age. With a physical rotating dial for channel scanning, the Poison will bring back nostalgic memories of the good ol\u2019 days of radio channel surfing.\nCredit to @superphenblog\n     Check out iDB\u2019s review about the Poison here\n      Design iteration\n  Aging test and button life cycle test\nA little change for a better experience\nIn order to have the Poison more durable that last for years and lower defective rates in production, we\u2019ve decided to engrave functional symbols on the device\u2019s buttons instead of the original silk printing.\nWe understand you may love the previous design. But after we tested three prototypes in the past few weeks, we think the latest version offers the best user experience.\n  When you combine love and free, you get lofree. We all come from a designer's background - as reflected in our product. We dedicate ourselves to keep the most sophisticated product simple and elegant, in order to benefit and reach more people. We push boundaries in product design and have won several Red Dot and iF design awards. We love the way of life.

The Bona Fide Pen is a writing instrument designed for people that appreciate the quality and durability of machined pens and enjoy using them. The ergonomic design of the Bona Fide Pen combined with it's sturdy construction makes this pen an excellent choice as your every day pen. I hope this pen becomes part of your every day carry gear.\nThe Bona Fide Machined Pen - Silver Anodized\nI enjoy using a quality fountain pen at my desk. I wanted a pen that had the feel and classic styling of the pens I was already using, but also had the durability and strength to withstand the abuses of being used everyday, outdoors and in the field. I wanted a pen that was quick to deploy and return to my pocket with one hand. For this reason, the Bona Fide Pen needed to be a retractable pen. I also wanted a pen that used refills that could meet the diverse needs of the user and were readily available. Like the name Bona Fide suggests, this pen had to be genuine, reliable and built to earn your trust. It's Bona Fide!  \nMaterials\nBecause I wanted a sturdy pen, it had to be made entirely of metal without the use of any plastic. I experimented with stainless steel, aluminum, brass, copper and even titanium. The steel, brass and copper make beautiful pens but the weight of those metals proved to be too heavy for prolonged use.\nI finally decided on 6061 aluminum that had the best combination of machinability, strength, corrosion resistance and cost. 6061 aluminum will also accept a durable protective anodized finish that will keep the pen looking great even after years of use.\nDesign\nHere is the criteria I used while designing this pen: \nAppealing classic style\nErgonomic pen geometry\nQuality materials and construction\nPrecision fit and feel\nComfortable to hold and use\nDependable retracting mechanism\nA good variety of popular refill options\nGood price/value ratio\nThe starting point for the design of this pen was with the grip section. I like the way traditional fountain pens taper in towards the tip and then flare out again. This shape provides your fingers with a comfortable position properly spaced from the tip for writing and drawing. It also prevents your fingers from sliding down. Pens with sharp grooves or knurling can be irritating after prolonged use.\nThe undercut concave tip is inspired by the traditional nib shape found on fountain pens and adds style, strength and a clear view of where the tip meets the paper.\nThe Bona Fide pen is made with two slightly different designs machined into the barrel portion. The 'pinstripe' design has seven thin lines spaced 45 degrees apart along the barrel. The 'stars & stripes' design has the same lines as the 'pinstripe' style with the addition of eight evenly spaced stars, one above each of the seven pinstripes and one above the pocket clip.\nTop: Pinstripes - Bottom: Stars & Stripes\n  The two piece body of the pen is built strong with robust M10 threads and an extended shoulder to ensure smooth, positive alignment where the pen barrel and grip section meet. I chose the M10 x 1.0 thread because it has a pitch diameter that perfectly splits the distance between the inner wall and the outside of the pen. This provides the greatest overall strength where these parts connect.\n   M10 Threads\n  Fully Disassembled\n   We looked at a number of retracting mechanisms with the goal of finding one that was precision made and extremely durable. I consulted with Jack Roman (a great guy by the way) of Tuff Writer MFG who has agreed to supply us with his superior retracting mechanism. This American made Tuff Writer mechanism surpasses all others in quality and reliability and features an improved raceway and 416 stainless steel construction.\nPhoto courtesy of Tuff Writer MFG.\nThe spring is custom made in the USA to our specifications from 316 stainless steel.\nThe Clip\nRecessed Clip Attachment\nThe pocket clip on the Bona Fide Pen is made from 301 spring stainless steel and was specifically designed for this pen. The clip is laser cut and brake formed right here in Southern Oregon. The clip is then deburred and hand finished. Finally the clip is rigidly mounted to the pen in a close tolerance precision cut recess with two #2-56 stainless steel screws. Having the clip in a recess prevents the clip from moving and getting loose. 301 spring stainless steel resists corrosion and maintains its shape and spring retention. The clip has a slight pre-load tension and will be secure in your shirt or pants pocket or in your notebook.  \nMachining\nThe Bona Fide Pen design required a machine that can produce small, complex precision parts. I worked with Jay MacDonald of Precision CNC Products, also here in Grants Pass, Oregon, and chose the Star CNC Swiss-type Automatic Lathe to manufacture the pen.\nWe were able to make the pen barrel and grip section with all the design features I wanted while maintaining precise tolerances and a beautiful machined finish that was ready for anodizing.  \nFinishing \nThe pen barrel and grip section are then inspected for fit and finish. After the machined aluminum parts are inspected they are anodized to give the pen a resilient finish that will keep the pen looking great and performing perfectly. Anodizing is an electro-chemical process that converts the metal surface into a decorative, durable, corrosion resistant, aluminum oxide finish. We anodize in silver, black, blue and gold.\nBallpoint Refills \nWhen deciding on which refill the Bona Fide Pen would be designed to use, my first candidate was the pressurized refill made by the Fisher Pen Co. The Fisher Space Pen refill is a popular choice because of it's ability to write upside down and write on slick surfaces. It is a great choice for people who work and write outdoors.\nRealizing that users of this pen will have different preferences, I wanted to be sure this pen could accept a wider variety of refills that met different needs. I eventually modified the pen design to accept refills that conform to an industry standard, the Parker DIN ISO 12757 specification. The Fisher Space Pen refill also works perfectly in this pen when used with the Parker adapter that comes with the Fisher refill.\nWhile reviewing the many refills available I came across the Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 refill. This highly rated ballpoint refill makes a smooth and solid line much like a rollerball. The Bona Fide pens will be delivered with two Schmidt easy FLOW 9000 refills, one black and one blue.\n Balance\nWe had a question about the pen balance. Here is a photo to show the balance point of the pen by itself. The pen has a neutral balance feel in average sized hands. I have large hands and when writing I find the pen rests slightly on my fingertips if I release my grip.\nPen Balance\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI feel this project has a very low risk for it's supporters.

We love to let our imaginations run wild with ways to use these resins in fun and functional ways. Creating the FireFly zipper pull was an idea that bounced around for a while in our minds. When we finally made prototypes and went on our first camping trip with them we were amazed at just how much everyone loved them and how functional they really were. We hope this product finds a place at campsites around the world and brings help and joy to all who use them.  \nMeet FireFly!\n        We ultimately wanted the FireFly to be a simple product for adults and children alike. It had to be durable enough for an adult to put wear and tear on it and easy enough for a child to throw it on and off a zipper.  \nAfter sampling all sorts of clasps and enclosures for attaching the glow resin bead and connecting to zippers and other object, we settled on paracord.\nParacord is a lightweight nylon kernmantle rope originally used in the suspension lines of parachutes. This cord is useful for many other tasks and is now used as a general purpose utility cord by both military personnel and civilians. This versatile cord was even used by astronauts during the 82nd Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. \nThe glowing bead on the firefly is a high grade high density glow powder infused Epoxy Resin bead. The way we produce the epoxy eliminates voids in the resin and is infused with an extremely high density of photo-luminescent powder so the glow is more vibrant and longer lasting than standard glow materials available on the market.\n                                           PARACORD COLOR OPTIONS:\n GLOW BEAD COLOR OPTIONS:\n        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with most projects like this, the main challenge is managing fulfillment.

I\u2019m a Los Angeles-based writer and director of online shorts (like Old/New, Real Gone and Plot Device) and branded content for clients like Bad Robot and Red Giant. I created the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool for writers like me.\nOoh Aah, That's How It Always Starts\nIn my experience, I've found that the second best part of writing is the beginning (the first best is finishing), when inspiration strikes and it feels like someone is beaming the story to your brain from an alternate dimension.\nYou're not so much making it up as transcribing it, relaying it. Your ideas at this point are like tribbles, growing and growing off of each other.\n...Until they're not.\nThe transmission eventually stops, and you're left with a pile of disjointed and half-baked ideas. And now it's up to you to turn them into a story.\nNow just turn this mess into a story. No bigs.\nCut to: the Storyclock Notebook.\nPicture Your Story Like a Clock\nThe Storyclock Notebook utilizes the simple method of visualizing your story like a clock.\nSeeing your story this way can quickly give you a bird's eye view of it, and reveal where your gaps are.\nThere's a gap.\nAnd rather than filling these gaps by making stuff up and dropping in ideas from the outside, you can extract ideas from what you already have -- using symmetry.\nWhat\u2019s happening on the opposite sides of the clock? Anything you can set up or pay off?\nIt's a simple and effective exercise to fill the gaps in your story with relevant and meaningful material, born from what you already have.\nThis doesn't mean Lawrence Kasdan wrote Raiders with a story clock, but it demonstrates that good stories have a \"rhythm and rhyme.\"\nA Research + Development Tool\nThink of the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool. The first half of the book is devoted to studying and analyzing existing stories, with the second half devoted to developing your own. \nThis is a Development page. The left is where you dump your brain, and the right is an empty clock to start laying out your ideas in a narrative structure, and start filling out your story.\n   This is a Research page. Sometimes it helps to rip off-- er-- STUDY the choices of other writers, so we've devoted the first half of the book for clocking existing stories.\n Purpose-Built for All Kinds of Stories\nWe designed the Storyclock Notebook for screenwriters, but it works for other storytelling mediums, too!\nIt's not just for screenwriters!\nBuilt-in Resources\nOn the inside covers we\u2019ve put a bunch of storytelling resources to serve you in your quest.\nNerd stuff!\n  A general story structure guide and list of archetypes inspired by much smarter people like Joseph Campbell, Blake Snyder, and basically everyone at Pixar.\n  A page/time converter that comes in handy far more often than you'd expect.\nThe Design\nThe Storyclock Notebook was designed to be both practical and creatively inspiring, a tool for perspiration and inspiration. Something that makes you WANT a reason to use it. For this we ended up leaning on old industrial handbooks and research logs to find the look and feel.\nThe touch... the feel... of industry!\nThere are 12 Research Logs and 12 Development Logs, a couple pages in the back for miscellaneous notes, and a table of contents page in the front for easy referencing and filing of your endless ideas and research.\nPrinting the Notebooks\nGuten Co. letterpresses all of our covers in San Antonio, TX, where the Earth's gravitational pull is optimal for letterpressing journal covers.\nOur friends at Guten Co. will be letterpressing the covers of the notebooks at their studio in San Antonio, TX.\nGuten Co. was indispensable in the development of the Storyclock Notebook, helping us source materials and finish proofs so we could field test it and get as close to the finished product as possible before revealing it to the world.\nIf you\u2019re looking to letterpress anything (i.e. business cards, invitations, posters that say WANTED in huge letters) or want some sweet handmade ceramic goods (seriously, come on), check out Guten Co!\nBecause the binding process is tedious to do by hand, we will print the interiors and bind the notebooks together at a larger company in Nashville, TN, where we will also pack + ship them out to our backers.\nSpecs\n5.5x7\u201d Finished Trim Size; 52 Pages\nCover: Neenah Environment \u201cWeathered\u201d 110# Cover\nInterior Pages: 80# Cougar Text - Natural\nWho's Responsible?\nThe Storyclock Notebook was created by me (Seth Worley), designed by Micah Lanier, and produced by Anne Fogerty.\nTeamwork!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nJust gimme it.\nWell firstly, I really want this notebook. We\u2019ve had a small number of proofs printed over the course of developing this, and I\u2019ve ended up using it to write 2 feature-length screenplays, a tv pilot, 3 inspirational talks, 2 company presentations, and a wedding toast. Oh and a Kickstarter video.\nMaybe? Maybe?\nI feel like other people could benefit from this as much as I have, and Kickstarter is a great way to find out how right or wrong I am about that. After being involved in other friends\u2019 campaigns and backing several projects over the years, I\u2019ve been able to see and experience firsthand the unique benefits Kickstarter has over traditional development routes - the biggest being YOU. By releasing the storyclock notebook on Kickstarter, I\u2019m able to get your feedback and input before we ever print it, ensuring that by the time it makes it to your hand, it\u2019ll be the best possible version of itself.\nExtra Extras!\nAlong with the notebook, we'll be offering extra awesome tools and resources in higher tiers to help you on your story quest, including:\nVideo Tutorial - A short video from Seth to help you make the most of the notebook.\nWriting 101 Pack ($55 Value) - 11 videos from Seth walking through the basics of story structure, character, theme, and a comprehensive walk-through of outlining a story in the form of a clock.\nWriting 201 Pack ($60 Value, Pre-Release) - The highly-anticipated sequel to the Writing 101 pack, not-yet-released!\nSkype with Seth (Pricelesssss) - Get 30 minutes of Seth's time to talk about whatever you want.*\n*Mostly to talk about stories. Keep it PG (maybe PG-13 because Seth acts like a 13-year-old [not really (ok yeah kind of really)]).\nWhat Do I Get?\nWe've got several reward tiers to cater to your personal (notebook-related) desires:\nWhere is my money going?\nSince we\u2019ve already done most of the development of this notebook (believe it or not we\u2019ve been working on it for two years), your contribution will go towards:\nNotebooks - letter-pressing the covers in Texas, printing the interiors in Nashville, and binding the books in Nashville as well (because these are physical goods, every notebook purchased adds extra cost).\nReimbursement for Development Costs - We\u2019ve already spent money to get this off the ground (illustration costs, fonts, proofs, etc) and so this will help pay people for the work they\u2019ve done.\nFees - Kickstarter is awesome and because it costs money for them to operate we\u2019ll owe them some money. And also credit card fees. We factored all of this into our goal amount.\nWe chose $12,500 because we think that number will help us at least hit breakeven on the cost to produce these notebooks. If we bring in \u201cextra\u201d money - which depends on how many backers we have for each tier, we hope to include some fun surprise flavor for you when you receive your notebooks.\nWhere you at?\nYou can follow us on Instagram at @StoryclockNotebook, or follow me on Twitter at @awakeland3d.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've spent a couple of years developing this notebook, and we're super excited to be sending it out into the world.

We\u2019d like your help to finish our next documentary - Hanzi, a documentary exploring international design, visual culture and identity through the lens of modern Chinese typography.\nChinese is one of the oldest and most used languages in the world, yet it is perceived as difficult to learn. Furthermore, there has been a lack of discussion on Chinese typography and its transition into the digital era compared to its western counterparts. Recently there has been a renaissance and reviewing of Chinese characters in Asia and internationally, with typography and lettering books often topping the best selling books, and more and more typographical courses and workshops being held in the cities. We think that\u2019s worth exploring to the discussion of design and cultural identity. \nCollaborating with filmmakers from New York, Hong Kong, London and Taipei, Hanzi includes interviews from ShaoLan, founder and creator of Chineasy in London; Akira Kobayashi, a Japanese renowned Roman font designer; Sammy Or, a veteran Chinese font designer based in Hong Kong; also Ri Xing Type Foundry, the last traditional Chinese letterpress type foundry in the world and more, gathering some of the most important figures and insight in the current Chinese education and typography field. \nThis film is not just about Chinese characters, we wanted to keep the ideas and messages applicable to all languages and cultures. Exploring universal subjects such as \"How does language shape identity? What role does handwriting play in the digital age?\u201d, Hanzi encourages audiences around the world to revisit and rethink their own culture, language and identity.\n(Please see the press links at the bottom.)\nAbout the team:\nSince 2012, we have been extremely lucky to work on two documentaries that have created impact globally, Design & Thinking and Maker. Both films were crowdfunded on Kickstarter, distributed independently, and have gone to screen at schools and organizations all around the world, including Google, Twitter and Harvard University.\nOur audiences have shared with us how much the films meant to them, like a designer finally being able to explain her job to her parents, or a teacher telling us how the films have bought inspiration to her students. Thus, after two innovation themed documentaries, we felt like it was time to turn the lens towards our own culture and explore what perspective we could offer to the world.\nBased in Asia and also constantly aware of what's happening around the world, we set out to make a film that's not just about Chinese typography. With our multicultural background, we\u2019re grateful to have these interviewees coming from diverse fields and countries, to help us put together a broad view of what a language can present. \nThrough making this film, we\u2019ve gained a new perspective towards our own language and identity, and we hope audiences of any cultural background can have as much insight and reflection towards their own language and culture as we have.\nDirector: Mu-Ming Tsai\nProducers: Mu-Ming Tsai, Iris Lai\nEditors: Iris Lai, Emily Hsiang\nAdvisor: Yu Hsiu Yang\nHow can you help? \nBy working with filmmakers around the world, we\u2019ve finished shooting in New York, Hong Kong, London and Taipei, gathering a wealth of informative interviews and interesting footage, and we\u2019ve been editing these materials since then to tell an insightful story.\nCurrently we\u2019re in the final phase of post-production, polishing the film with color correction, sound mixing and graphic design. Then we will need to move into the distribution phase where film festival submissions, promotion and marketing expenses will also require a significant amount of funds.\nYour support will help cover these expenses and increase the production value of the final product; ultimately assisting in spreading the important insights of language, culture and identity to a larger audience.\nHow can we thank you?\nNotes on $200 pledge: \nWe\u2019re very excited to present this unique type stamp set to our backers!

It's almost totally unknown that Britain once had the beginnings of such a Netherlands-inspired network, and with your help we could rediscover it and, in some cases, literally dig it up. This Kickstarter project could result in the (re)creation of many miles of protected cycleways \u2013 and as a backer you'll be along for the ride.\nUPDATE: We may have reached our Kickstarter target but that's not the end. In fact, it's just the beginning. Reaching the initial target will enable us to research and perhaps revive a number of cycleways but by no means all of them. Every single pledge, no matter how small, is important (the number of pledges could play an important later role when we start seeking the institutional funding required for national-scale cycleway improvements). If you haven't got the financial means to back this project right now please share it widely. \nIn the 1930s, Britain's Ministry of Transport commissioned the building of 500-miles of protected cycleways. Between 1934 and 1940 more than 300 miles of these innovative cycleways were actually built, usually both sides of the new \"arterial roads\" springing up all over the country.\n(The video says it was 280 miles \u2013 but, thanks to the publicity generated by this project, more mileage has come to light.)\nSome of these cycleways still exist, but they are not today understood to be cycle infrastructure: they should be rededicated. Others are buried under a couple of inches of soil: they could be excavated. \nWe are seeking your support to make all of this happen. Cash is needed to carry out further research and then work out how the historic cycleways can be meshed into modern networks. \nWith your help we'll be able to demonstrate that the space for cycling is there, and in many cases it has been there for a long time!\nThose who back this project will be supporting something of potentially national importance, and will gain behind-the-scenes access to our work as it progresses. You will receive timely backer-only reports that won't be published anywhere else. Whether you're interested in the historical side of the project, or the modern, practical side backers will receive regular updates and will be the first to be told of what could be important and, in some cases, genuinely ground-breaking developments.\nTake a look at the backer options on the right. You could buy us a cup of coffee to keep our spirits up or go the whole hog and get us to give you an up close and personal presentation to your club, company or organisation. We'll also be taking some backers on a guided cycle tour of one or more of these innovative-for-the-time cycleways.\n\"... if Britain managed to find money to produce state of the art bike lanes during the Great Depression, it can definitely do so again.\" \nFeargus O'Sullivan, CityLab.\n+++\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThanks to amazing support our campaign hit its target three days after launching! This doesn't mean the campaign ends, the more funding we get the more cycleways we can research and rescue. \nIf we reach \u00a310,000 we'll add Kickstarter Live functionality for all levels above Pizza Levels where either or both Carlton and John will host backer-only interactive video sessions. REACHED!\nIf the pledges exceed \u00a312,000 all levels above Pizza Level will get access to the premium level of a new podcast, CyclingHistory.Today. The site has been registered (thanks to @CyclistStaffs for the prompt) and a website will be connected to that URL soon. The podcast will feature cycling history from 1817 onwards. (Naturally, there will be plenty of content from the period connected with this Kickstarter campaign.) REACHED!\nWe are now beyond \u00a312,000 but are all out of ideas on stretch goals (the best suggested to us so far \u2013 and by @tynetom \u2013 was a night out in Whitley Bay). We'll think about it.\n+++\nWHO'S \"WE\"?\nWe are author and editor Carlton Reid (the project's historian) and Urban Movement's John Dales (the project's urban planner, and with a team behind him).\nDrone-eye view of the Neville's Cross 1930s cycleway, both sides of the Great North Road\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\nBetween 1937 and 1940 the Ministry of Transport only gave grants to local authorities for arterial road schemes if they included 9-ft-wide cycleways both sides of the road, writes Carlton Reid. Some of these cycleways still exist (but are believed, wrongly, to be \u201cservice roads\u201d); others have been grassed over (but their concrete surfaces probably remain). Many are not marked on maps as cycleways (or considered to be such by local authorities.) \nThat Britain once had a great number of protected cycleways is now almost totally unknown. I started researching these Dutch-inspired cycleways for my forthcoming book Bike Boom (Island Press, June 2017) and when I started to dig deeper (sometimes literally) I came to realise there were far more of these 1930s cycleways than I, or anybody else, knew existed. By poring through ministerial minutes I discovered that, amazingly, the Ministry of Transport was working to plans submitted by its Dutch equivalent: Go Dutch, 1930s-style.\nBike Boom is out in June and has some info on the 1930s cycleways\n  Kerb-protected cycle tracks on both sides of Chester Road in Birmingham, 1946. (Click on the pic for same cycle tracks today.)\n    To date, I have identified more than 90 separate protected cycleway schemes around Britain, some of which can be found on this map. But I believe there are more to be found.\nThese innovative, concrete cycleways \u2013 many with granite kerbing \u2013 went out of use so rapidly that they were forgotten about soon after being built. A few were later grubbed up to make extra room for cars, but plenty can still be seen today \u2013 if you know what to look for. \nBy using long-neglected plans and maps I've been able to trace many of the buried ones; some appear to be tantalisingly close to the surface. \nIt's important to map, record and then rescue these cycleways. Many have lasted this long only out of sheer luck, and need to be \"listed\" so that they can't be destroyed in the future to, say, widen roads for motor traffic.\nSlivers of the buried long-distance concrete cycleway on the Thanet Way can be glimpsed via Google Street View\nThis is partly a historical \u2013 and even an archeological \u2013 Kickstarter but, as my project partner John Dales says in the video above, it's also highly relevant today because the space for cycling that many planners and politicians say isn't there is there! \nWe are combining to form a small team that will research and evaluate the schemes found to date, and then approach local and national authorities with plans for meshing the 1930s cycleways with their modern equivalents. Once the campaign has ended we can immediately start work on researching and evaluating some of the schemes identified so far. The more money we raise the more cycleways we will be able to research. We shall use this research \u2013 and the modern urban planning work \u2013 to push for grants and other monies to enable rescue work to take place.\n  GO DUTCH? \nIn 1934, the Ministry of Transport consulted with its Dutch equivalent before starting work on its cycleway programme. The MoT\u2019s chief engineer was provided with cycleway plans and advice by the director of the Rijkswaterstaat. \nMost of the 1930s cycleways were built alongside new arterial roads and bypasses. However, some were built in residential areas, such as the separated cycleway in Manchester seen at the top of this page. This cycleway still exists but, today, not all of it is marked or used as a cycleway \u2013 motorists park their cars on it, assuming it's a private road built for such use. The challenge is to find and research the history of this cycleway, and the 70 or so others, then link them into today\u2019s networks.\n1930s cycleway on the Mickleham Bypass (it's still there but much narrowed).\nIt\u2019s reasonably well known \u2013 in certain cycle advocacy circles at least \u2013 that there was a 2-mile protected cycleway on Western Avenue in London, opened by transport minister Leslie Hore-Belisha in 1934 (I wrote about it in Roads Were Not Built for Cars). What\u2019s very much not known is that this was just the first scheme, and that the Ministry of Transport majority paid-for at least 70 other schemes across the country, many of them kerb-protected and separated from carriageways. \nAfter 1949, cycle use in the UK dropped dramatically and less use was made of the innovative-for-the-time cycleways.\nIn time, it was forgotten that there had once been these many cycle infrastructure schemes around the UK. This project aims to bring many of them back to life both by rededication and by demonstrating how they can be linked in to wider networks. A great deal of further archival research is required, especially in city, county and national archives. Period newspaper reports describe when the cycleways were given the go-ahead and when they were opened, but it will require more digging to find grant-aid documents, further maps and plans, and period photographs of the cycle tracks in use. \nMost of the 1930s cycleways (at the time they were called \"cycle tracks\") were, on average, four miles long, but the 9-ft and 6-ft cycle tracks on both sides of the Southend Arterial Road (which are not marked on modern maps) extended for more than 18 miles. \nIf we could bring back to life even half of the built cycleways that's perhaps 140+ miles of cycleway that we don't currently know about, or treasure. \nThis is an ambitious and potentially very practical project, but it cannot happen without your help. \nThank you.\nCarlton Reid & John Dales\nUPDATE (28th April): Just three days after launch, we hit our funding target. This was wonderful news and means that, at the end of the campaign, we can hit the ground cycling. However, after the euphoria wore off, it's important to stress that this is just the start \u2013 it doesn't mean every single one of of the 1930s cycleway schemes identified so far can be researched and rescued. \nThe campaign lasts until 25th May, and the more funding we can raise the more cycleways we can add to our \"to do\" list. \nPleasingly, thanks to the publicity that the campaign has generated so far, we have been contacted by individuals and local authorities with more possible 1930s cycleways. The 70+ schemes we initially identified is now comfortably into the 80s. That's amazing. \nIt will require some digging (at this stage, mostly metaphorical) to confirm these as genuine 1930s-era cycleways but, in all probability, there are even more to be found. And the more we find, the more chance that these forgotten cycleways might have once linked together and, with effort, could therefore be more easily meshed with modern networks. That is, once improved, especially at junctions and side roads. \nIn the fullness of time we'll be producing plans and recommendations that could help convince local authorities (and perhaps even the Department of Transport) to release some meaningful cash so that as many of these cycleways as possible can be brought back to life. \nYou wonderful backers helped us get to the first stage, there are many more to come.\n+++\nCARLTON REID is the Newcastle-based executive editor of BikeBiz.com, and author of Roads Were Not Built for Cars and Bike Boom (both of these books were successfully funded on Kickstarter, and later picked up by Island Press of Washington, DC.)\nJOHN DALES is a transport planner and traffic engineer, and director of Urban Movement of London (\"our job is making better streets\").

Whether we are designing a magazine that will be printed, or an app that's digital, it all has its start as a sketch on a piece of paper. It allows us for more freedom, it allows for quick edits, it allows a flow of ideas that is hard to get when you work digitally. \nAs the idea progresses it goes from quick sketches done in a few seconds to more precise designs, and finally into the digital realm. During this process we use rulers a lot to make precise measurements, draw lines, and to cut what needs to be cut. The problem for us is that we have several rulers all for different purposes all with different measurements to them. There's no singe unifying product that allows us to work for every design imaginable. A regular ruler often lacks picas, a measurement used for print, and there is no accessible ruler that has simulated pixel measurements for your digital designs.\nOur goal is to combine all of these things into one ruler, the ultimate ruler for designers. The one tool you need in order to design for both print and digital.\nA bridge between worlds.\nThe Lindlund ruler comes in two colors, Luxe Silver and Midnight Black\n  Our design allows for twice the measurements\n\nDesigned with you in mind\nThe Lindlund ruler has been made with design in mind. Whether it is for print, digital, or just for regular old cutting. We have included four different measurements that will help you create for any medium. As you would expect there's the ever-present centimeters and inches, an essential core that we could not do away with. It is a part of the ruler vernacular.\nThe Lindlund ruler comes with four measurements: centimeters, inches, picas, and pixels\nMade for today\nIn addition to this we have the picas and pixel measurements. The pica, a typographic unit, is used for just that: typography. When you are writing a document and you are using a 12pt font, that is one pica. By using this edge of the ruler you can instinctively translate the measurements you see on screen into a physical size. You can, already in your sketches, measure the size that you need the font to be, or you could establish your margins, columns, and gutters.\nThe Pica measurement helps you sketch and visualize typography\n\nPixel perfect\nThe pixel edge has a simulated 150ppi (pixels per inch) divided up into batches of 10 pixels. It also has measurements indicating the size of an iPhone and iPad screen. This allows you to draw the size of an iPhone and immediately see, to scale, how big your design is. Laying out all of the buttons, and other design elements quickly on paper before heading into the computer and refining it. With the Lindlund ruler you now know exactly the size of your sketch and all the elements in it.\nOur pixel measurements allows you to quickly sketch digital designs\nAll about the details\nThe ruler also hides more features. Such as a rubber coating on the back that prevents you from slipping. Never again will you cut something wrong because your ruler slipped. As an extra bonus from our four measurements is the easy 90 degree angles. By drawing one line and then simply aligning the rulers measurements with the previous line, you are guaranteed a perfect angle every time.\nWith the Lindlund ruler you can create perfect 90-degree angles every time\n\nBuilt to last  \nMade from airplane-grade aluminium and cut with maximum precision we have ensured that every ruler will measure perfectly. Since they are made out of high-grade materials they won\u2019t be easily destroyed from bends or cuts.\nLight yet highly durable\nA superior finish\nThe choice of material and color processing has been based on looks and feel. We wanted something will stand the test of time when it comes to visuals and feel. The choice fell on anodizing our aluminium core, which will help protect it in the long run as well as provide a superior look and feel. Our choice of color is Midnight Black and Luxe Silver.\nAnodized aluminum creates a perfect finish\nPrecision cut to fit most pens\nVarious prototypes lead us to our final design\nThe Perfect Companion\nOur goal has been to create the perfect companion for a creative. We wanted to include as many features as we could, as many measurements as we could, all while maintaining a sleek and great design. In the end we have decided on our four measurements: 12 inches, 30 centimeters, 72 picas, and 1800 pixels. All organized along the four edges of the Lindlund ruler.\nCompatible with Apple devices\nOur pixel edge is perfectly compatible with Apples major iOS devices: iPhone, iPhone plus and iPad. With specific measurements made out for their size, you can quickly sketch a screen and then draw every element on it with perfect precision. \nDrawn to scale, ready to develop further\nFeatures\nWe have spent a lot of time considering every detail of the Lindlund ruler. Everything from the colors to materials has been discussed and evaluated. Our unique design allows us to pack a lot more features in than a traditional ruler. Here are some of the highlights we want to show you.\nThe Lindlund ruler is a bridge between worlds. With our innovative measurements you can create for both digital and physical at the same time.\nWith our simple, yet effective, design we have created a ruler that incorporates four different measurements on one side. That way you are ready for anything.\nThe Lindlund ruler comes in two colors: Midnight Black and Luxe Silver. Our Midnight Black ruler was made especially for use in darker situations, while the Luxe Silver is a more traditional color to match your other tools. \nThe rubber backing keeps your ruler secure. You won't ruin work by having your Lindlund ruler slip.\nMade from airplane grade aluminum the Lindlund ruler is made to withstand a lot. It won't be ruined by a knife or break when lightly bent.\nOur rulers are made to be extremely light. In fact, you won't even notice its weight in your bag when you are carrying it with you.\nOur rulers are precision cut and measured to make sure that you can fully trust your Lindlund ruler.\nThe ultimate ruler for creative people\nOur Midnight Black was designed to work in dark environments\nRewards\nSupport us and get yourself the only ruler you'll need to bring on a daily basis. Once you have yours, why not get one for your friend or your studio? We have a reward that suits everyone.\nWho are Lindlund?       \nWe are Axel Lindmarker and Jens Marklund, two Swedish designers. We met in the fall of 2013 and immediately struck up a friendship. Since then we have collaborated on a lot of projects and won some awards. Our collaboration always seemed natural, so we haven't really seen any point in parting ways. Instead we have gotten closer, moved around to different places in the world, working on different projects. You could say we definitely are in this for the long haul.\nThe name Lindlund is derived from our surnames. We have simply removed the similar part (mark) and ended up with Lindlund, which coincidentally has an actual meaning. Lind is Swedish for the linden tree, also known as small-leaved lime. Lund on the other hand is a Swedish word for a grove. So together we form a grove of linden trees.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBacking a project on Kickstarter is always a risk and we immediately knew we wanted to minimize the risk for all of you. As of now we are in contact with experienced suppliers and manufacturing partners that will help us produce the Lindlund ruler on a larger scale. They are specialized in making this type of product and have decades of experience doing so. As such we don\u2019t anticipate any major problems along the way.\n\nThat being said there are always risks and challenges when you go into manufacturing. We are currently partnering with one manufacturer that can take on this challenge, but in order to make sure the product gets made we are looking for secondary manufacturers that can take over in case of a crisis.\n\nWhen the product has been made, we will receive it and proceed to ship it out to you\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 225 or more", "title": "The Lindlund Ruler", "descp": "One Lindlund ruler: Midnight Black or Luxe Silver!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["934 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 405 or more", "title": "Twin pack \u2014 2 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "Two Lindlund rulers: Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or one of each!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["341 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 585 or more", "title": "Small Studio level \u2014 3 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "Three Lindlund rulers: Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or mix to your choice!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 1,725 or more", "title": "Studio level \u201410 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "Ten Lindlund rulers Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or mix to your choice!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 180 or more", "title": "The Lindlund Ruler", "descp": "EARLY BIRD!\nOne Lindlund ruler: Midnight Black or Luxe Silver!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "200 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 360 or more", "title": "Twin pack \u2014 2 Lindlund Rulers", "descp": "EARLY BIRD!\nTwo Lindlund rulers: Midnight Black, Luxe Silver or one of each!\nFree shipping within the US.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "160 backers"]}], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 133, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/355497638/lindlund-the-ultimate-ruler-for-creative-people", "project_name": "Lindlund: A Bridge Between Worlds"}}, {"backer": "Mark Dwight", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We are a group of scientists and engineers who for the past five years have been trying to create the perfect lab notebook\u2014the notebook we always wanted with us in the lab. After years of producing and refining, we are ready to introduce our new dot grid lab notebook! A notebook that was built around years of field testing and feedback from you, our users. \nYour support can help make these notebooks a reality, and the more support we get the more advanced notebook we can ship to you! So please help spread the word! \n$5,000 - Softcover [Original Goal]\n$7,500 - Upgrade to Hardcover [REACHED!]\n$12,500 - Upgraded Cover + Ribbon Marker [Stretch Reward Level 2] \n$20,000 - Upgrade to Two Book Ribbon Markers [Stretch Reward Level 3]\n        Book Specifications\nWe have chosen our full-size lab notebook form: 144 pages, 9.25 x 11.75 inches, 70lb heavyweight writing paper. The large pages allow for ample writing space and makes adhering full size printed sheets easy. The three cover options are represented below. \nIf our initial goal is reached we can send out our softcover variation (left), with our lay-flat, permanent bookblock with water-resistant laminated cover. If our next stretch level is reached we can upgrade to our standard hardcover with printed cover. And if the final stretch level is reached we will be able to use our ultra-durable cloth cover with a book ribbon.\n  The Complete Design, Distilled \nWe have surveyed hundreds of labs over the years to come up with the ideal lab notebook layout. We started by generating a list of everything a user could possibly need or want, and through years of collaboration with a design team, we refined that list into the following streamlined layout. \n    Quick Reference User Information Block\n    Lab Notebook Protocol & User Guide\n  Complete User Information Page\n  Complete User Index\n  Dot Grid Spread With Numbered Pages, Signature & Date Blocks\n  Abbreviation & Accessory Data Chart\n  Reference & Conversion Charts\n    Why Dot Grid?  \nA dot grid provides the same amount of information as a traditional line grid, but does so in a less visually distracting way\u2014allowing your work to be the focus of the page. This is especially true when creating graphs, tables, or illustrations. The subtlety of the grid also allows for versatility of use\u2014the pages can be easily used as a blank page or a ruled page. Furthermore, dot grids minimize contrast on the page, limiting eye-strain when in the lab, a real problem for users in the lab all day.\n  Construction \nVela invested in years of material testing and refining manufacturing techniques. Every component has been optimized to result in a book that is durable, and lays flat for ease of use in the challenging conditions of the lab and field. \nThe Paper. \nOur new heavyweight writing paper is a less rigid sheet, allowing our new book to lay flatter than previous editions. While less rigid, this sheet still has high opacity, to minimize ink show-through. The paper is elemental chlorine free and acid-free for archival quality, and Sustainable Forest Initiative Certified.\n\nThe Binding. \nOur books are gathered and Smyth-Sewn in small page count registers, which translates into extraordinarily durable and lay flat binding that are both permanent (pages will not pull out) and tamper evident. In addition to the high strength sewn binding, each book is reinforced with multiple adhesive layers.\n  The Cover. \nOur hardcovers use extra heavyweight high-density bookboard to ensure no warping of the cover in even the most severe conditions. Our basic printed covers features a scuff-resistant laminate that also protects from spills and general wear and tear. Our Duracover fabric is out most durable cover material\u2014it can withstand aggressive use with little to no signs of wear.\n    Your Support\nYour support allows us to make these books to the highest standards, using the best materials and manufacturing processes\u2014years before we would be able to afford to on our own. It allows us to produce locally, supporting fair wage workers and their families. It allows us to use sustainable materials, like 100% recycled bookboard, american produced cloths, and SFI & ECF certified papers. Finally, your support allows us to reach more students, scientists, and engineers faster.  \n        Thank You!\nIf you like our project, please share and help get the word out!\n~Vela Sciences Team\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing a lab notebook is no easy feat. A good lab notebook needs to both be as flexible as possible, to ensure the book lays as open and flat as possible, and durable enough to withstand any lab condition and remain unaffected and unchanged in long-term storage for decades to come. Meaning every component of a lab notebook needs to far surpass the quality standards of any standard book, and if any one of these components fails the entire book fails. \n\nOvercoming these challenges, and going beyond the previous standards for lab notebooks, is therefore a very expensive and time consuming process. Involving years of material and manufacturing testing, as well as years of field testing - one of the main reasons why no one has ever created lab notebooks like Vela lab notebooks before. But we have always felt that if investing in better lab notebooks has the potential to accelerate the sciences, even just a small amount, the time, cost, and risk would be worth it. \n\nAnd after years of manufacturing and refining we are confident we can deliver our best lab notebook yet in this project, and deliver it on time.

It is designed to be hung on your wall like a picture frame. Joto is not another screen, quite the opposite, it turns pictures and words from your screen into pen and ink drawings.\nAs soon as you send something to it, Joto's pen starts to move. It has an eraser and a dock too, so the pen doesn\u2019t dry out and when you are ready for something new, it refreshes the surface and prepares itself for your next Jot.\nPeople say there\u2019s something about the way Joto jots live. There's something that mesmerises, excites and inspires. It seems some things in life are just better off screen! \nUsing the Joto app, on a computer or mobile device, you can discover, create and share jots. These are some ways you can turn images and text into beautiful ink drawings and make the most of Joto.\nJoto takes requests, sketching everything from works of art to love notes, to-do lists to puzzles. We believe Joto is as versatile as its users are creative. Here are some of our favourite uses:\nA sketch of Hockney for when you\u2019re hosting a summer BBQ. Klimt's The Kiss for romancing. And Dogs Playing Poker for a boys\u2019 night in. Obviously. \nWaking up to a new piece of art every day now is possible. To celebrate the launch of Joto we're releasing something special: 365 days of Art. Like the sound of it? Find out more below!  \nHang Joto in the kitchen and it\u2019s a family to-do-list. Pop it up in a cafe and it's an updatable menu. Or use it in the workplace and it\u2019s a nifty noticeboard. Joto is also easy to update, so you can schedule different content throughout the day to suits your needs. \nQuotations, tweets, headlines, happy birthdays and \u201cHello, how are you?\u201ds. Joto can handle them all. Jot-to-Jot Messaging is even enabled, allowing you to scribble on your friend\u2019s wall from anywhere in the world.  \nAn ever-growing community of design enthusiasts, artists, illustrators, makers and hackers are excited to see how Joto will change the way we communicate and display the things we love. \nWe\u2019re concentrating on getting the hardware right first, so we can build a community of users that love Joto.\nWe've made sure that Joto's software has been built so it can integrate with your favourite apps like Twitter, Spotify and Slack.\nFor all you makers and tinkerers, the accompanying Joto app has also been designed to allow further integrations and connections. We'll be releasing a public API and also making key parts of the software available and open so that you can experiment outside our cloud platform. We want you to be free to come up with as many amazing and crazy ways to use Joto as possible. We've even got it up and running with Node-RED!\nJoto will work with standard pens and paper\nSince we reached our initial funding target of \u00a3100k, we\u2019ve taken on board your feedback and we are excited to announce, if we reach our new goal, all Jotos will come with two new add-ons:\n- a pen holder\nso that you can use a wide range of both whiteboard pens and paper pens\n- paper grips\nthat allow you to use Joto with a sheet of paper.\nClick here for full update\nIt turns out people love Joto. We were over the moon when Joto was announced as Winner of the Beazley Design of the Year Public Vote at the Design Museum in February. \nJoto was the public's favourite over social and visitors to the museum, now we can\u2019t wait for you all to be part of the Joto movement and see what would you jot! \nJoto is made up of a pen, an eraser, a board and some sleek robotics: the key parts are a perfect balance of form and function; the surface is lightweight and wipe-clean, and the pen and eraser attachment is held and manoeuvred via a mechanical arm. The whole thing is controlled via the Joto app. \nTo celebrate the launch of Joto on Kickstarter, we\u2019re excited to announce something we call 365 days of Art. You can get your Joto with 365 unique pieces art, each created by a top illustrator. That\u2019s a brand new, inspirational image on your wall, every day, for a year.  \nWe're honoured to have artists from around the world excited about being part of 365 Days of Art. Just some of the illustrators that will be producing artwork for Joto include Anthony Burrill, Supermundane, Ben the Illustrator, Will Scobie, Mr. Bingo, Jon Burgerman, Quibe, Kaloian Toshev, Jordan Metcalf, Salventius, Sneaky Raccoon, Ben Johnston, Burnt Toast Creative and Thomas Hedger.\nPLAY\n\nThis series of three awesome illustrations created by JARD Design is just an example of the artwork that you can get delivered straight to your wall. Don't miss out, get your Joto with 365 Days of Art!\n   We have spent a year at the Central Research Laboratory in London. One of the UK's first hardware incubators. They have helped us develop both the hardware and our business with a programme of mentorship and learning.\nWe knew Joto had to be special and look beautiful enough to hang on your wall. We didn\u2019t want complicated robotics scaring away your guests. We\u2019ve gone through many design iterations and prototypes to get our close to prototype working. \nWe\u2019ve been working closely with our manufacturers in Shenzhen, ironing out any issues we may face in manufacturing so that when we push the green button everything will run as smoothly as possible.\nOur first prototype was part of the Beazley Designs of the Year exhibition at the Design Museum of London, and it ended up being one of the winners voted by the public.\nWe\u2019ve prototyped, prototyped and prototyped some more and we can\u2019t wait to start manufacturing Joto so people can get their hands on it. \nWe\u2019ve taken all the learning and expertise we\u2019ve developed over the last 3 years and put it into creating Joto. \nIt's been an amazing journey to bring this product all the way till here and see the Joto community growing. Kickstarter is a milestone to validate the product and fund its production.\nTo make all this a reality, we need your help. We are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to life. \nJoto is the next generation drawing machine out of Those\u2019s studio. One of the very first prototypes Barney ever made using chopsticks, string and anything else he could find lying around the home.\nThe Woodpecker \u2013 Proof of concept.\nThe first product was called Woodpecker and was designed to bring retail windows and public spaces to life. It caught everyone's attention, even the labs at the advertising agency Ogilvy described it as \u201cthe year\u2019s most innovative retail product\u201d. \nBuy this unique lightweight drawing frame for your shop, exhibition or foyer. \nThis is the only time we've sold our Woodpecker drawing machine.

Just capture the things in your daily life that you don\u2019t want to miss. It automatically converts your voice notes into text and organises them for easy access.\nSenstone's overview\n  Stretch Goals\n  We check smartphones 150 times a day, every day. But what if there was plainly easier way to capture those precious words?\nSenstone lets you record your thoughts quickly and conveniently. Senstone is a notepad size of a bottle cap. Imagine walking in the busy street or driving a car and taking those notes, reminders with the speed of thought.\nTap on the Senstone to start recording and speak. Tap again and it stops. All audio and text notes are synced into the Cloud seamlessly.\nSenstone saves you from getting distracted while reaching for your smartphone and looking for the necessary app. Especially when focusing is critical.\nIncrease your focus in everyday life\n  Senstone should be close when you speak \u2014 for best performance. You can hang it around your neck, clip it to your shirt collar or a jacket, or even wear it on your wrist.\n  Senstone is a standalone device so you can take notes and create lists when its not connected to your smartphone. It records for up to two and a half hours when offline. Then it automatically syncs your notes in the cloud when you are back in range.\nIts a standalone device -- record and save notes anytime\n  Being able to take notes on the go is critical \u2014 be it your personal goals, your breakthrough ideas or your travel journal. This is why the world\u2019s greatest writers, inventors, and visionaries kept notebooks to document their ideas. And today we offer a much more convenient and handy solution.\nFamous people record their ideas\n  Are you a food blogger discovering a new cafe and wanting to document your experience? Take notes in seconds with Senstone. It has been designed specifically to keep track of details in any situation. You can even capture an impromptu interview with someone at the cafe.\nNo typing\n    You can also use Senstone at night, but you don\u2019t need to wear it. It listens to you when you sleep and is just a finger snap away from recording the details of your dreams while you still remember them. There\u2019s no need to press any button. Thanks to our unique machine learning system we help you record your midnight thoughts and dreams with just a snap of your fingers. \nNB: Currently, the finger snap feature is only available when the gadget is charging on its dock.\nCapture midnight dreams\n  Senstone helps you stay focused, lets you organize your thoughts quickly and allows you to manage your life with confidence and style. Send reminders to other members of your team. Just say \u201cTom, I figured you didn\u2019t bring lunch today, so I ordered pizza\u201d and the message is sent.\nSenstone is your communication tool with others on the team. However, sometimes it is more convenient to have your thoughts laid out right in your favourite app. For these scenarios we are integrating with apps like Evernote, Trello and more.\n  Everyone has their own sense of style. People are wearing accessories to underline their personality, get attention and feel good. We tried to be timeless and original with this device. Senstone\u2019s design is pure and minimalist \u2014 it\u2019s something will match any style or look.\nInspired by Brain and Sound Waves.\n  Early mock-ups\n  Our fashion designer picked the best materials for Senstone to look and feel right. The casing is made of Chrome-plated brass and clear brass. We also offer a lighter, Aluminium version anodised in white gray and black. All models feature a scratch-proof tempered screen.\nSenstone product line\n  Senstone\u2019s screen consists of 17 white LEDs that inform you of key activities such as starting and ending a recording, synchronization, battery status, and charging. It\u2019s all displayed by flashing patterns and shapes with the LED array.\nGadget screen scenarios.\n    Senstone online demo:\nPLAY\n\n  We do care about environment, so we made the box that is indisposable and reusable. This is your stylish dock that is used for charging and a sole place to store and carry Senstone and its accessories. You can use it to hold the device itself as well as all your detachable backs.\nThe box is a charging station\n  Charging is fast and simple\n  Our line of interchangeable backs was developed by a fashion designer. You can clip it to your clothes, hang it from your neck, or wear it on your wrist, for the style that suits you best.\nLine of Detachable Backs.\n  Sizing details.\n  We developed our own firmware with the Protocol that works specifically with audio tracks (files). It optimised to record and transmit high quality audio without data loss and run them later through AI systems in the Cloud. We ensure encryption of our data so its highly protected during data transfer over the air.  Hardware is optimised for low energy consumption which gives  about 4 days of average use.\nThe reason we've chosen the components is multi layers, among them the size. We spent several months trying to fit components into a small casing and maintain good battery life at the same time by using BLE microprocessor.\nPrinted Circuit Board tech details.\nHere are some technical highlights of our device.  It includes Ultra-low Power Wireless Microcontroller with the following features:\n1) Multi-core system, 2) Support Over-the-Air Upgrade (OTA), 3) AES-128 Security Module, 4) Compatible with BLE 4.2.\nDigital MEMS Microphones with the following features: \n1) Three modes: Standard Performance, Low-Power and Ultrasonic Mode, 2) Frequency Range 0.01kHz - 80kHz.\nMemory with the following features: \n1) Minimum 100,000 recording cycles, 2) 20 years of data retention.\nLithium (LiPo) battery:\n1) 4.2 Voltage, 2) 80mAh capacity, 3) 4 days of average use.\nAs great as a simple and convenient tap could be, we are constantly looking for more natural ways to capture your thoughts. One of them is a snap. \nThe magic lies in the device machine learning system. The microphones are in active listening mode and when the captured sound matches the Snap pattern \u2014 it activates device. It works best in silent environments, and with the shipped device you will be able to switch to Snap or back to Tap mode depending on your preferences. See it here in action.\nPLAY\n\n  We bring a new level of intelligence to your voice notes.  The moment you start a recording, it\u2019s stored on your smartphone and backed up in Cloud, even if your app is in background. The Cloud software platform converts voice memos into text, extracts keywords, to-dos and analyses your speech patterns. \nIt's like having an AI to organise your notes. What is the topic of the note? What was your mood at the time? What was happening around you? Where were you? You can then find your notes by hashtags, their content or time and location to replay original audio, edit them or export to other apps.\nWith additional premium app subscription you\u2019ll be able to access more AI features, like automatic punctuation or noise analysis, get larger cloud storage for audio notes and more free speech-to-text transactions. The App also works in the background, notifying you on the progress and number of notes made. Once you open the app, all your voice memos and text notes are automatically synced to the \u0421loud.\nApp screens.\n  Integrates with Evernote and much more\n  App features.\n  Since both the audio recording and the converted text are available for each note, there are a lot we can do to improve your note-taking experience. You\u2019ll have a chance to vote on the upcoming features you want, like automatic punctuation, intonation analysis, productivity tips based on your previous performance, noise and context analysis, and integration with various software.\n                 Our plan\n  Senstone Inc. is an audio company that\u2019s on a mission to provide the best note-taking experience. We do it through voice analysis, text extraction and machine learning via deep audio analysis. Our company provides seamless and smart voice recording by combining well designed hardware and a cloud based software platform.\nOur team\n      For more questions, media inquiries or review unit requests please contact us at team@senstone.io.\nPress Kit is available here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have completed manufacturing design of the product and have produced about 20 working prototypes in 7 iterations total. \n\nWe also started negotiating with the mass production manufacturer to make sure that our device is produced and delivered to our first customers on time. But there's risk that mass production process may require different design decisions which may take more time to implement. We manage this risk by saving extra few weeks for this.\n\nOther risk is economical. As we're using third party engine for speech-to-text conversion, we need to pay for each transaction. This puts the limit on number of transactions you can take per month for free. Currently we assume a normal limit would be free 300 transactions per month, which wouldn't be noticeable for you on average use, and would still make sense to us economically. But it might end up being to few transactions for you, or still tight for us economically over time. We manage this risk by giving you free 3 months of (almost) unlimited transactions, then measure the average use and try to set limit just above this number. So it can be more or less than 300 per month. \n\nFor people who use Senstone more frequently we will offer premium app subscription with larger number of transactions. And you will still be able to make recordings even after the limit is reached.

The King Arthur Legend always made the list.  I have been inspired by this legend since I was a child and now I am excited to share this deck with you.   \nThe Arthur Legend is full of rich characters and a wide range of lore.  All this history makes it an ideal foundation for a playing card deck. Kings, Knights, Queens, Love, Betrayal, and Brotherhood are just a few of the themes that play out in this beloved story.  \nWhen I decided to capture the story of the Arthur Legend, I then picked an art style that has been attractive to me for years.  The art for this deck is a reflection of the Book of Kells.  The Book of Kells is a beautiful hand drawn and written illuminated manuscript that tells the story of the four Gospels of the Bible. This book was written around the same time as the origins of the King Arthur story.  This legend and art style are a perfect compliment to each other. \nFollow my Kickstarter for the next 30 days to watch this deck come to life.

Scribes worked meticulously to perfectly reproduce and record cultural, religious, and political records using expensive materials that were designed to last for centuries. So important was the veracity of these documents that in the unfortunate occasion of a mistake, the document would often be destroyed so as to not perpetuate any errors.\nOf equal importance to the accuracy of these artifacts was their care and protection. Therefore, it was common practice to invoke the wrath of gods and all manner of supernatural havoc upon any who would seek to edit, steal, or destroy any of these works. This protection took the form of what is now referred to as a Book Curse.\nHow delightful!\nThe Book Curse bookplates\nInspired by the idea of an 'Ex Libris' bookplate that doubled as dire warning for any potential book thieves, I set my poisoned pen to the illustration of a set of Book Curse bookplates!\nMark your precious books as your own with sexy, sexy bookplates that you can write your own protective curses upon. All tiers include the cost of shipping! Worldwide! Please note that beyond postage, all additional duties, fees, and tariffs are the responsibility of the International backers.\nNow make a pledge and be done with it already!\nThe most petty annoyance or eternity in a flesh-rending hell-- just write it in there yourself.\nWhat your support... supports\nAs a meticulous artist and painstaking craftsman, I've invested in my own printing and production equipment and have produced my own fine art prints for years. Supporting this project will help to defray the costs of upgrading my print equipment while allowing me to produce these bookplates for you!\nA percentage of the proceeds will also be earmarked for funding other crowdsourced projects. Learn more about Kicking It Forward at http://kickingitforward.org.\nHow are the bookplates made?\nFor the sake of the majority of readers, I opted for a self-adhesive solution instead of non-adhesive leafs that required a separate adhesive. Every 3.33\" x 4\" label is printed with Epson Durabrite pigmented inks and acid- and lignin-free self-adhesive papers. These bookplates are designed for permanent adhesion that will last for years without yellowing and a lifetime without fading. It is as close to an archival self-adhesive solution as is possible at the Maker level of production!\nThe Art of the Book Curse\nBefore and after, from rough to final.\nHere are the designs that I have planned for this first edition of the bookplates. The final printed artwork will be high resolution. I've posted concept sketches, as well as a couple of printed prototypes using the final artwork:\nMemento Mori (prototype, final artwork)\n  Trickster (prototype, final artwork)\n  Nevermore (concept sketch). Please see final artwork in Updates!\n  Cursed Roots (concept sketch). Please see final artwork in Updates!\n  Carrion, Wayward Son (concept sketch including a curse to test the available space for writing). Please see final artwork in Updates!\n  Doombag (concept sketch). Please see final artwork in Updates!\nOriginal Artwork rewards\nA comparison of a bookplate (left), the original artwork (right) and a skull and some scissors. A pen, too.\nBetween the concept sketch and the production prototype, I draw all of the designs at 2X scale. I then scan them and reduce their size, sealing in all the juicy detailed goodness. All Original Artwork rewards will receive the actual full-scale drawings (signed and personalized with your name and a message of your choice), along with a supply of matching bookplates.\nThank you for considering this project!\nSincerely yours, Chris (and my lovely muse Janet).

You just need to practice, especially you Brett.\n$15,000 pledged: Home Library Circulation Kit\n\"Let's play library!\" - Me as a kid (full disclosure: last week too).\nAt $15,000 funding, every backer at the $12 level and above will receive a PDF download of my DIY papercraft Library Circulation Kit!\nI've heard it said that the old-fashioned library card is a small time-travel device. Marked as they are with names and dates, one can relive the journey that a book has taken over its life and recall those with whom you've shared its interior riches. As a child I would look at library cards with such interest, wondering who these other people were, or even delighting in the discovery of a friend's signature. Often enough, I'd then add my own name and continue the story of the book's life.\nThe kit will contain all you need to print your own library cards and card pockets with plenty of space for annotating who borrowed a book and when. The pockets and cards will be decorated with artwork from the bookplate project so everything can match!\nWith this PDF, some cardstock, a printer, scissors, and a bottle of mucilage (hehe... \"mucilaaaaaage\") or even a glue stick you'll be able to create an unlimited supply of your own circulation stock.

It does need a better shirt. The RS01 is that shirt.\nThe RS01 was engineered from the ground up to meet your work and active life. It is a shirt built for the transitions. During the day it passes for well-cut office wear. En route, it lights up like a STOP sign. The RS01 was ruthlessly developed through endless prototyping, creative destruction, and fastidious attention to minutiae to wring out the perfect fit, material, and closures for your modern life. The result is an office-formal shirt that works as well in the crouch on your bike as it does at your desk, a shirt with minimal, clean details and an extra-sharp silhouette. It is also a shirt which lights up via 3M retroreflective when on the street. The RS01 is passive*, minimal design at it best. \n*shouts when needed.\n    Retroreflective  \nWhile we love smart tech solutions, nothing beats the straightforward simplicity of passive design. No USB cables, battery recharging and malfunctioning electronics - wear the RS01 and be seen. \nWe worked with a specialty technical fabric mill to make a custom fabric which has retroreflective woven into the material. Other reflective garments often have reflectivity printed on top, wearing out quickly, cracking, peeling and losing its luster. In the RS01 fabric, the reflectivity is durable and bright. The reflective element is invisibly nestled into the Shepherd's Check pattern. It stays hidden during the day, and pops out on the street. \nPedestrian Visibility at Night\nActive Cut\nWe did backflips to develop our own pattern made specifically to stretch and twist. We reduced pattern pieces. We rethought sleeve construction. We tried, failed, and refined. The current construction is sleek and novel. It fits like a modern dress shirt and behaves like a second skin. \nBonded Edges\nKeep it tight and flat. We removed pattern pieces, and sharpened the silhouette by bonding instead of sewing key elements of the RS01. The cuffs, collar, and wind block are all super-flush (the anti-Puffy shirt). This innovative construction will keep you looking, literally, sharp. \nWind Block \nDesperate cyclists stuff newspapers down their shirts to block wind on chilly descents. No more. The RS01 integrates wind blocking panels directly into the shirt construction. We added sueded microfiber panels over the ribs to block just enough wind to keep out the chill. The back, armpits, and sleeves uncovered so you can dump heat as you warm up from the inside. \nRear Pocket\nThe cel phone hasn't yet been installed into your brain pan. Until then, easy access is the next best option. We installed a rear pocket into the seam with a snap-closure, so you can snag your cel in an instant. Keep your digital device easily at hand, balanced AND out of harm's way. (Yes, we designed the pocket to fit your 6\" phablet) \nLow-Profile Snaps  \nEverything about the RS01 is \"High Speed, Low Drag\". We edited, questioned, tested, and reduced every. little. detail. These snaps are flush to the body, tough as nails, hold well, and fasten quickly and easily.\nDrop Tail\nMost active transit options involve some degree of crouching, the cut of your garments should fit that posture. Keep your crack covered with a little extra. We've got your back.\n      The RS01 is tailored for a sharp, active fit with a modern silhouette. \nCheck your measurements and use the guide below to select your size. You don't need to answer when pledging - we'll ask for your size right before we begin shipping.\n      You can trust that when you back our project, you will receive your rewards. Together we have launched 4 other successful Kickstarter projects - all delivered. The fabric mill is waiting for our green light to begin producing our custom integrated reflective fabric.

During the day, I am a graphic designer at Pentagram Design in New York City. After hours and on weekends, I work on my own independent projects such as this.\n\u2014\nFive years ago my boss at Pentagram, Michael Bierut, handed me a composition book, and I've been fascinated by these utilitarian and ubiquitous notebooks ever since.\n\u2014\nThrough extensive research, I've learned that, interestingly enough, these notebooks haven't changed all that much since they came into being centuries ago. And that they have an 180+ year history of being produced using the most economical manufacturing methods available.\nWith all the new advances in the fields of papermaking, printing, and binding since the 1800s, I was interested in what it would be like to create a notebook that uses the new printing and binding technologies and the highest quality materials possible, while still maintaining the nostalgic pattern that we all know and love. \n\u2014\nThat's how 'comp' was born. An elegant, sophisticated, and long-lasting version of the classic composition notebook.\ncomp uses today's finest available processes, materials, and design\nFront cover with custom drawn pattern and redesigned offset label\nLayflat binding opens completely flat to reveal ultra white, smooth 120 gsm uncoated paper\nDetail of book spine made with beautiful Italian Cialux cloth and thick, durable 'boards on' covers\nLined version features optimized 3/8\" ruling and black interior feint lines\nThe interior of the unlined version of the notebook\nColor-through dyed black endsheets\n\u2014\n\"When you look at [comp], immediately it\u2019s recognizable. It reminds us of something that all of us have seen all our lives. And yet, it\u2019s taken all the characteristics of that object and made them the best they can be.\" \u2014Michael Bierut, Partner, Pentagram\n\u2014\nThe history\ncomp first started as a curiosity, then turned into a research project, and finally, (admittedly) into a bit of an obsession. I've spoken with many experts in fields such as paper marbling, book binding and design, have visited rare book libraries, and poured through many stationery catalogs trying to document the history of the composition notebook. \nBookbinder, Paul Vogel. Photo: Brian Kelley\nThe pattern on the composition notebook was an industrialized version of the traditional art of marbling, a process that was used to make decorative papers for book coverings and end papers. Paper marbling began thousands of years ago\u2013\u2013in the tenth century in China and later in Japan during the twelfth century.\nEbru pattern. Image: Terry Underwood Evans/Shutterstock.\nThe marbling process remains more or less the same today: It essentially involves dropping different colored pigments into a bath of water (typically with size added), and working them into a unique pattern with different instruments and brushes. Once you have the desired pattern, a piece of paper is rested on top and absorbs the pattern to create a marbled paper. Meanwhile, in the fifteenth century in Turkey, a different type of marbling was being developed called Ebru, which eventually made its way to Europe.\nExample of a pseudo-marbled agate pattern\nAround the early nineteenth century (1820s\u20131830s), a new industrialized type of paper marbling began in France and Germany. This 'pseudo-marbling' process, a term coined by marbling expert Richard J. Wolfe, aimed to create marbled patterns using industrial processes\u2013\u2013it was here that a new type of pattern was created in Germany, called the 'agate' pattern. Over time, these chemically made agate papers started to be used on more and more cheap blank notebooks, and the pattern evolved slightly into the printed composition notebook pattern we know and love today. \n\u2014\nThe evolution\nPseudo-marbled French composition notebook from 1860.

Image courtesy of Alwen Rambo/Belle Brocante\nPrinted American composition notebook, 1964\nPrinted composition notebook, 2016, Pennsylvania, USA\n\u2014\nA cultural icon\nThroughout the years, the composition notebook has become a sort of cultural icon. Its unique design has been imitated, reproduced, shared, and worshiped; making a name for itself inside the art and design community and beyond. Strangely there\u2019s no one producer of these notebooks since the pattern is not copyrighted and exists in many unique variations.\nOver the years, the composition notebook's black and white marbled pattern has inspired and been used by famous artists, writers, and designers, like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Ettorre Sottsaas Jr., Roy Lichtenstein, and Michael Bierut.  \n\u2014\nWhy recreate the composition notebook?\nComposition notebooks, as they are now, have become an important piece of American culture. That said, they fall into a category of objects created for utility, that focus less on longevity and more on economy.\nAs a graphic designer, printmaker, and bookbinder I wanted to create a notebook that uses today's finest available processes, materials, and design to create something that will be kept, cherished, and used for years to come. \n\u2014\nFeatures\nHere is a more detailed look into comp's features.\nAn exposed spine using the best quality Italian cialux cloth, instead of tape for added durability. \nCovers that are made of thick wrapped boards for added durability and rigidity. The cover shown left is a traditonal notebook cover. The cover shown at right is comp's thicker covers.\nLayflat binding allows the notebook to open completely flat, which makes for easier use. \nItalian micro-embossed cover paper, which is durable and feels much more premium than a traditional notebook cover. \n Color dyed black end sheets for clean inside and outside back covers.\nA beautiful, unique, custom marbled cover pattern, optimized to balance light and dark perfectly, with every shape in the pattern individually placed for a unified look throughout. \nA redesigned offset label that balances perfectly with the black binding at the left edge and allows you to write your name or other information you choose on the front cover. \nUltra white interior paper that is substantially thicker than a traditional composition notebook, allowing for less show through back to back between pages. These uncoated sheets work exceptionally well with all sorts of pens and pencils.\nBoth unlined as well as lined versions of the notebook. The lined version utilizes 3/8\u201d ruling in which the length of the lines have been optimized for the best writing experience. Thin black lines are also used instead of traditional blue lines for a more streamlined look.\nThe lined version also has unique header ruling that help provide hierarchy as well as a clear way to track page to page.\n\u2014\nTechnical specifications\n7.5\" x 9.75\" upright\n148 pages (74 leaves)\nCustom designed pattern\nOffset printed covers (with double hit of black ink for extra contrast)\n2mm wrapped hardcovers wrapped with fine micro-embossed cover paper\nBoards on, layflat binding\nSquare back with sewn and glued signatures \n120 gsm ultra white, smooth, uncoated interior paper 155 whiteness (CIE), 96% opacity, 122 brightness (ISO 2470/D65 %), 150 Roughness (Bendtsen, ml/min)\nColor-through dyed black endsheets\nSquare corners\nBlack Italian cialux cloth\nLined version printed offset with stochastic screening for fine reproduction of feint lines\nAll materials used are FSC certified\nPrinted and bound in Italy\nRewards\n\u2014\nOne book\nLined or unlined\n$19\n\u2014\nThree books\nAll lined or all unlined\nPlus free tote bag\n$57\n\u2014\nTen books \nAll lined or all unlined \nPlus free tote bag \n$170\nWhy Kickstarter? \nSince the composition notebook is such a ubiquitous object and has been used by so many different people in so many different communities, I thought Kickstarter would be a perfect place to bring comp to life and share it with as many people as possible.\nWith your help, I'll be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of comp, along with compensating all the different components that have helped bring this project to life.\nThe Kickstarter goal includes every single cost involved in making this project happen:\nLLC creation\nLegal fees\nPrinting\nBinding\nTote bag manufacturing \nLabel manufacturing\nShipping the books to the US fulfillment house\nPackaging\nPrototyping\nMedia Licensing\nPhotography\nVideo\nMusic\nCampaign management\nKickstarter fees\nPayment processing fees\n\u2014\nProject Credits\nCreated by\nAron Fay\naronfay.com\nCampaign Management \nVann Alexandra \nvannalexandra.com\nFilm\nBrandon Kuzma \nkuzmafilms.com\nMusic\nEdo Van Breemen\nedovan.com\nProduct Photography \nBrian Kelley\nbriankelley.nyc\nSpecial thanks to Michael Bierut, Caroline Weaver, Paul Vogel, Richard J.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become!

Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention.

Almost 6 years ago, we launched the Glif, a tripod mount for the iPhone 4, on Kickstarter. The response to our campaign was incredible, and it allowed us to build our company, Studio Neat. Since then, we have released several updates to the Glif, but we are back where we started, on Kickstarter, to launch the best version yet.\n      (Note: The Glif shown in all images and videos is a 3D printed prototype. The final production Glif will be a much nicer and smoother finish.)\nThe landscape for smartphone photography has changed dramatically since we launched the original Glif in 2010. With each successive smartphone, the camera is getting more and more incredible. The smartphone has become a legitimate tool, for photographers, filmmakers, and mobile journalists. So our goal is simple: to create the best tripod mount for smartphones, period. To do that, we are focusing on three areas.\n1: An innovative quick release mechanism.\nCurrent tripod mounts on the market today fall into one of two categories: screw, or spring. Screw mounts work like a vise; they allow for a secure grip, but are slow and cumbersome to operate every time you want to take your phone in and out of it. Conversely, spring mounts are quick to load and unload, but they have a flimsy grip and are not secure at all. We wanted to create a mount that is the best of both.\nThe solution we came up with took several rounds of iteration and engineering. The quick release lever, when opened, allows the jaws to move freely, making it easy to quickly load or remove your device. Here is the clever bit: when you close the lever, it automatically tightens around your device, resulting in a super secure connection. It's quick, and secure.\n  Cross section of the tightening mechanism.\n2: Portrait and Landscape \nVery few tripod mounts on the market today can support a device in both portrait and landscape orientations. With things like panoramic photos, Periscope streams, and Snapchat, smartphones have legitimized the once-smirked-at portrait orientation. The Glif has a side mounted tripod mount, which allows devices to be mounted directly in portrait orientation. \nAnd speaking of that side mounted tripod mount...\n3: Extendability\nWe want you to consider the Glif as the starting point, the base, of your mobile photography rig. We want it to be a flexible tool that caters to your needs. As such, the Glif has a total of 3 tripod mounts, one on the bottom, one on the side, and one on the top. These allow you to add additional accessories, like a microphone or light.\n  Speaking of accessories... we are introducing two!\nHand Grip\nNot every situation calls for mounting your smartphone on a stationary tripod, and the hand grip provides a much more comfortable way to shoot freehand, especially if you have additional accessories attached. The hand grip is lovely, milled from solid cherry hardwood. It has an additional tripod thread on the bottom as well.\nWrist Strap\nA wrist strap is crucial for that added bit of security when you are shooting freehand. Dan used a prototype when he went zip-lining in the jungles of Jamaica and it worked great. Attach the wrist strap to the bottom of the hand grip, or just attach it directly to the Glif, as a way to add a bit of security and comfort. It is made from durable paracord and leather. The Glif, hand grip, and wrist strap are all tough, robust, and built to last.\nWhat Devices Can the Glif Hold?\nThe Glif can hold devices roughly in width from 58 mm to 99 mm. This is essentially the range of a naked iPhone SE to an iPhone 6 Plus with a really thick case on it. In all likelihood, your device will fit. \nDesign Process\nWe have been working on and improving the Glif as a product for the past 6 years, and have been working on this version for the last several months. Through countless iterations, we are super happy with the design, and think you will love it too! \nSome of the many prototypes we made.\nWhy We're on Kickstarter\nAs usual with these types of products, there is a considerable upfront investment needed to create the multiple molds for injection molding. We have spoken with and received quotes from our manufacturer here in the US, and they are ready to start production if this campaign is a success. As with all of our other Kickstarter campaigns, we want to take you along on the journey of bringing a product into existence. We will be posting numerous update videos, which will document the manufacturing process, and we will be discussing everything in depth on our podcast, Thoroughly Considered.\nWe hope you will join us in this campaign to create the best tripod mount ever. We can't do it without your help, so please, hit the green button on the right to become a backer and help bring this into reality.\nThanks and have a great day!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo date, we have successfully funded and fulfilled 5 (!) Kickstarter projects. Each has brought their own challenges and obstacles, and we foresee the same for this one. We hope our track record proves we are capable of overcoming these inevitable challenges in order to bring the new Glif to market. Our manufacturer here in the US (in South Dakota) is already lined up and ready to go, and we have worked with them many times in the past, so we are confident moving forward if this project is funded.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Glif", "descp": "New and improved!

To guard against this, material is put in a dryer and typically only takes a few hours to dry, but our material ended up taking a couple days due to its unusual composition. On top of that, while the levers were being molded one of the parts didn\u2019t eject, and as the mold closed it bent a pin, which needed to be repaired. Fun times!

They are estimating that orders will begin to ship to backers on Tuesday or Wednesday next week, and they estimate being able to ship about 500 orders a day. Which means getting all of the domestic orders shipped should take a little over a week.

You may remember from the last update we were waiting on one last material to try so we could make a final decision. This material look quite a bit longer to arrive and get molded, but we are happy to say the wait was worth it because it performs exactly as we hoped. For a bit of detail to those who care, the material is PC (Polycarbonate) with PTFE (Teflon) as an additive. What this gets us is a material that is durable and very resistant to wear over time, which is important when you are snapping and unsnapping the quick release lever hundreds of times over the life of the Glif.

As stated in the previous update, we decided to make a slight modification to the mold, which was slated to take about 4 weeks. This is on schedule, and we should be getting the modified mold back and tested in a week or so. For those curious, the modification has to do with the \"feet\" of the Glif, and where the rubbery bit is overmolded. We wanted to create more space so that the rubber had more room to compress, and this required a modification to the mold.

Toward the end of his presentation, Jobs excitedly introduced the first iPhone, and just like that he changed the world of photography as we know it.\niPhone 1 Introduction\nThe fact that the iPhone is part of our life 24/7, along with the most updated technology Apple engineers continuously pour into it, the ease with which superb images can be produced and its addictive sharing capabilities, have turned the iPhone into the most popular camera in the world. That's why it's not surprising to discover that more than 75% of all the photos taken in the world in 2015 were done by smartphones.\nIt's almost impossible today to find someone who doesn't take pictures with a Smartphone - from little kids who can hardly hold their parent's iPhone but love taking pictures, to seasoned pros who are not ashamed to pull out their iPhone 6S to capture a fleeting moment in the street or document a process on a professional mission. We are fortunate to witness history in the making...\nBut is everything really that perfect?\nThe iPhone camera, and the strong competitors from the East, have made meteoric progress since the first device was introduced with its modest 2 megapixel images. Today they offer photographic technology that matches the standards of professional cameras.\nThe problem is that these advanced cameras are packed inside a smartphone. The thin, sleek and slick device doesn't offer any secure external grip or controls with the characteristics of traditional DSLR cameras we've come to appreciate.\nThe iPhone's camera technology has made huge progress since first introduced - but we still take pictures in an uncomfortable and unsafe way - just like 9 years ago. It's time for a change\nAlong with the availability of the smartphone, we\u2019ve become accustomed to (or rather, we have compromised on) two matters of principle: First, we still use the smartphone's camera in the most awkward way, and pray it doesn't slip out of our fingers and fall to the ground (and indeed sometimes it doesn't); and secondly, most of us never utilize even a fraction of the iPhone camera's enormous potential, because no one has the time or patience to browse through endless internal menus.\nThe result? In most cases, we shoot in auto mode and compromise on picture quality. It's like coupling a Formula One engine with a steering wheel and gearbox of a golf cart - the engine's potential just cannot reach the road... no matter how skilled the driver is.\nPictar was born to help mobile-photographers to unleash the power of the iPhone\u2019s camera for much better pictures!\nFeels like real camera. Shoots like real camera.\nPictar was born to combine the benefits of advanced cameras - IE, full external control of all shooting functions as well as a stable and secure grip, with the advanced camera technology and ultimate availability of the iPhone. In other words - to unleash the full potential of iPhone's photographic capability in order to take much better pictures, time after time! It's pretty cool, but who is it designed for? Pictar is designed for people who are just starting out in photography and are looking to get more out of their iPhone, as well as serious amateur or professional photographers who want ultimate and uncompromising control over the iPhone's camera. No matter what's your level or experience - Pictar will help you get much more from your iPhone!\nWe invite you to dive in (and scroll down) to learn more about Pictar and what it can do for you and your iPhone:\nThe real thing - just like a pro DSLR!\nElectronically calibrated to provide maximum sensitivity, just like a traditional DSLR. Pictar\u2019s shutter button offers a \"half press\" mode to lock focus and exposure for easy tracking of a moving object or to create a desired composition, as well as full-press for immediate shutter release. The button is located right under the index finger to enable precise and intuitive shooting, with one hand.\nTip: if you're shooting in a cold environment, or taking pictures of extreme sports, you'll be happy to learn that with Pictar's shutter button you can now take pictures on an iPhone with your gloves!\n\nHalf-press to lock focus and exposure. Press to shoot - even with gloves.\n Zoom with only one hand.\nLocated right below the shutter release button, the rotating zoom ring does away with the need to touch the screen to pinch-and-zoom, and makes it easy for the user to zoom in and out with just one hand. The zoom ring can also be re-programmed by user to suit specific needs, such as the flash, white-balance, etc. if that's the case, zoom in or out will be done by \"pinching\" the iPhone's screen, like before.\n  Let the fun begin!\nClicking the zoom ring will switch between the iPhone's front and back camera for easy \"selfie\" shots. Like the rotation of the zoom ring, the button can also be re-programmed by user to suit specific needs and control other settings.\nTip: Changed to \"selfie\" mode? Shooting one-handed? You can use the zoom ring for perfect composition, and shoot pictures you'll love to share.  \n Control light like never before!\nStrategically located in the right corner is the exposure compensation wheel, which lets the user quickly and easily control brightness level even before shooting. And just like with an advanced camera, the exposure compensation wheel changes the exposure in steps of 1/3 aperture, and the clear display appears at the bottom of the iPhone screen.\nTip: In manual mode, the exposure compensation wheel changes its designation and allows control of ISO values.\n Fully customizable, the smart wheel allows users to control a variety of functions.\nBeginners will love the ease of control - in default mode the smart wheel controls 7 pre-set modes, which enable users to easily adjust the iPhone to any situation while focusing on actually taking the shot. Pre-set modes are:\nAuto mode\nPortrait mode\nLandscape mode\nSport mode\nSnow mode\nSelfie mode\nVideo mode\nAdvanced photographers will feel right at home: the smart wheel lets you choose between 3 advanced modes:\nShutter priority\nISO priority\nManual (iPhone manual = Shutter + ISO adjustments).\nThe Virtual Wheel is another great feature that allows the user to control different modes such as Flash modes, Shutter speed, ISO and more - simply by using his thumb. Switching between modes is done by using the Smart Wheel.\nFeel like you're holding a real camera\nThe iPhone is an amazing design icon, and we as designers are full of admiration for the people who brought it to the world - but let's face it: as a camera, it's nowhere near the comfort, safe feel and familiar grip of a traditional camera. So the second task we undertook - after developing advanced controls - was to design an ergonomic grip that would sit comfortably in one hand and let you take one-handed shots while holding it out the window of a speeding jeep. And we believe we did it! \nPictar's grip is coated with anti-slip material and gives you something solid to grasp on one hand, while being compact enough to provide what we love about smartphones - accessibility and ease of storage. Pictar lets you take one-handed shots, anywhere, without falling out of your grasp. It provides sharp images thanks to the steady grip. We think it also looks great, with its trendy retro design inspired by classic cameras we love. Your iPhone will love it.\nSaves time looking for your iPhone so you'll never miss a shot or have your precious phone fall. \nIt's rare to see a camera that isn't connected to a strap. So when we developed Pictar, we knew we wanted to design not one but two straps: a wrist strap to secure it against falling, and a neck strap for carrying. The classic Pictar kit offers a standard adjustable wrist strap with a fast connection clasp. The Pictar-Plus kit includes a neck strap too - which also connects to the same fast connection clasp.\nTip: You can easily change between them or disconnect them both.\nThe padded case will keep your PICTAR safe when not in use.\nEasily connect any tripod, for sharper than ever images\nThe mobile-camera revolution enables anyone to go out into the wild - jungle or city - armed with just an iPhone. There they discover that they sometimes lack a trusty buddy - a tripod. There are many ways to improvise, but you won't always find a convenient tree or flat rock to stabilize the iPhone when you really could use a tripod.\nThat's why it was important to us to incorporate a standard 1/4\" thread in Pictar, just like real cameras have.\nStable and reliable cold-shoe connector - for many camera accessory - not just iPhone oriented.\nThe market offers an endless choice of LED-based lighting devices which add a fascinating dimension of light to the creative process. The problem is that many of them - especially the professional ones - are designed to be connected to real cameras with a standard upper connection. So Pictar offers a reliable and stable cold-shoe connection to hook up anything you want - via Pictar - to your iPhone.\nNOTE:\nPICTAR's App does not support hand-held flash units.\nThe cold shoe mount can support lighting units weighs up to 300 gr. / 0,66 pounds.\nDue to the fact that while it attached to PICTAR, the iPhone's connecting jack is concealed - any device that is using the connecting jack must be disconnected before actual attachment to PICTAR.\nPictar's semi-open body allows connecting most \"clip-on\" lenses. We've tested it with olloclip lens, and it works great. \nMode shown: SPORT\nA powerful, dedicated app featuring patented high-frequency dual tone sound control.\nPictar is designed to communicate with iPhone via a dedicated camera app which unlocks key features inaccessible on the native app to iPhone users. Each of the physical controls found on Pictar drive a specific function or setting and does so using high-frequency dual tone sounds. \nEach physical control is assigned a specific tone, and with each turn of a dial, press of a button or turn of a wheel, Pictar emits a sound that \u2013 when detected by the app \u2013 generates a corresponding action. The high-frequency dual tone (18,500 \u2013 20,000 khz) is inaudible to the human ear and significantly increases battery life when compared to Bluetooth connectivity. \nHigh-frequency dual tone technology saves energy compared to \"Bluetooth\" systems.\nUsing a standard CR \u00bd AA battery, we estimates 4-6 months of use before the need to replace the power source is required.\nWe are offering two almost identical models who share the same features. PICTAR fits iPhone models 4 to 6S while PICTAR PLUS fits iPhone 6 PLUS and iPhone  6S PLUS.\nModels shown: 4s, 5s, 6s\nPerhaps one of the biggest challenges in the development process was how to let as many iPhone users benefit from Pictar, without making it too expensive by adding various adapters. The solution consists of two elements:\n1: Wireless connection between Pictar and the iPhone using high-frequency sound waves (see separate chapter);\n2: A modular mechanical connection to connect different model iPhones of different sizes. The result - Pictar fits most existing iPhone models, and is ready for future models. If any backer plans to upgrade one day to a new model iPhone - chances are that it will fit.\nTip: If you have numerous iPhones in the family, you can share Pictar without a problem by installing Pictar-Up (free) on all devices.\nCan I use my iPhone cover with Pictar?\nPictar\u2019s semi-open body design doesn't allow to connect a case while attaching the iPhone. \nThe only exception is the iPhone 6 / 6s that can be fitted with a silicon case - similar to Apple\u2019s original \u201cSilicon Case\u201d.\nAnd what about Pictar for Android?\nThe decision to develop Pictar for iPhone only was not easy, and it required a lot of thought and long discussions into the night. In the end we have our reasons:\n1. Development of app and operating system: Thanks to Apple's unified OS it was easier for us to develop software for iPhone than Android, so we decided to focus the project to avoid wasting resources and valuable time.\n 2. The physical size - the iPhone comes in a limited number of models. Android phones come in so many different shapes, sizes and thicknesses, it was easier for our designers to develop a body that fits most iPhone models then to tackle countless Android models.\n3. Focus! The Pictar project was extremely challenging - even for companies much bigger than miggo. So it was important for us to focus only on iPhones so we could come up with a production-ready prototype as quickly as possible - and make it as good as can be. Diversification on many platforms would have diverted us from our goal.\n                                                                                                                          From dream to reality\nEighteen months ago, Guy - one of the miggo partners - stole two hours of breathing space between meetings in New York to travel to the Ground Zero memorial site. Guy is an avid photographer but he left his DSLR in the office, so all he had on him to document the exciting site was his iPhone. The images he was able to shoot frustrated him to the point that he decided that the next miggo project will be an advanced grip-control for iPhone photographers.\nFast-forward 6 months: the miggo team prepare first sketches and begin to formulate designs. Very quickly we realized we were looking for a grip that will provide external control of the advanced and powerful iPhone camera. The process included searching for a suitable design concept of the Pictar body - one that resembled a camera without being too cumbersome.\nAt the same time we carried out a proper characterization of camera features which we would like to control externally: exposure, zoom, electronic shutter release, and more. Design took shape quite quickly - we knew from the start that it would look and feel like a classic camera. We examined a large number of sketches till we finally focused on the current direction. As you can see in the pictures, the process eventually led to the final result that we really love.\nSearching for the perfect shape\nThe next stage was the most difficult - how to make the external buttons operate the iPhone camera without a physical connection? The easiest solution - Bluetooth - was thrown out due to its tendency to \"hog\" power like there's no tomorrow, from both the iPhone itself and the grip.\nAdvanced 3D-printing models\nAlona and Dan\nA surprising solution came from an engineer who worked with us - using high-frequency sound waves of 18500-20000 kHz. The idea is that each external control emits a dual frequency when operated, that isn't detected by the human ear. Frequency duplication distinguishes between the frequencies produced by Pictar and similar frequencies that exist in the environment, thus avoiding false commands.\nThe specialized operating system we developed receives the frequencies and translates them into an order that results in an action. The great advantage of the system is its zero power consumption. A standard CR \u00bd AA battery in Pictar can last for up to 6 months, with reasonable use.\nThe picture above shows \"Albert\" - the experimental motherboard specially designed to simulate what Pictar knows how to do today. Clicking on each of the five buttons activating a high frequency which controlled the camera.\nWhile developing the voice system, we designed a dedicated app in collaboration with one of the best companies in the country. The app - free of course - offers even more control in terms of what the iPhone camera allows.\nWe also added straps and a padded pouch to keep everything nice and safe, and we were ready to go. So this is it - we are ready to manufacture and hope for the best. Looking back - this past year was exciting, challenging and especially intense for the development team, but the result is worth it all.\nYou may ask who we are and why are we here for the 3rd time?! Thanks for asking!\nFrankly, we believe in Kickstarter.\nWe believe the crowd funding is the best way for a small and ambitious company like us to quickly and efficiently reach the people for whom we work so hard to develop breakthrough products.\nWe like to listen.\nKickstarter is a wonderful place to hear exactly what people think about your product - long before it reaches the market. Just think about it - this is the best, largest and most professional focus group in the world! Your knowledge is invaluable and what's really cool is that people are happy to share their knowledge and experience - to help developers like us bring to market products that might not have been developed using the traditional way.\nThese are just some of the reasons we're here for the third time. This, and the adrenaline rush the campaign gives us, after so much hard work developing a product that we totally believe in.\nWe were here 2 years ago with our strap&wrap - the world's first camera strap that morphs into a compact protective carrier. The campaign raised 400% above target and our young company received a huge infusion of energy to continue developing innovative products.\nA year ago we were back again with agua - an ipx3 storm-proof quick-draw camera holster - this time we raised 800% of what we asked for, with only 2000 amazing backers.

Precisely because of this reason, we know that unexpected delays sometimes happen during manufacturing. To minimize risks, we have taken the following actions:\n\n1. We are assisted by a British engineering company which is a leader in its field in Europe. The company specializes in bringing products similar to Pictar to manufacturing stage, so we can ensure Pictar will enter production without a flaw.\n\n2. We secured an agreement with a leading European-owned manufacturer located in China, with a wealth of experience and a proven track record in the field of plastics, metal and delicate electronics.\n\n3. Our schedule takes into account unexpected delays, and the financial target we have set allows us to produce, pack and ship Pictar orders without any problems, so we are confident we can meet our commitments.\n\n4. In addition, this is the third time on Kickstarter and we have an impeccable reputation. In our two previous projects we successfully delivered to 100% of our backers - a total of over 3,500.

Then I published a post on my Medium account with the business\u2019 address and a little information about what they do and why I chose them. Whoever was following the project could go to that business in person and pick up the art for free, I just asked that in return they support that business in some way, like by buying something from them or posting about it online to help spread awareness. \nDiane Campbell, owner of The Candy Store, week #41\u2019s featured business, said, \u201cWe were so happy to be part of Vincent\u2019s amazing project, \u201852 Pick Up\u2019.

And it has indeed! I am forever grateful to have been asked to be a part of this and to see what comes from this gentleman.

From design options to shipping costs, I learned a great deal from self-publishing my last book and I want to take this book to the next level. My plan is to make another limited edition of 1000 museum quality books to celebrate and further benefit these independent shops. This 60+ page hardcover book will feature all 52 small businesses featured in the project, some interior design photography of the local shops, my experience throughout the year and all the original weekly pieces of art. Check out some of the prototype ideas below.\nMy plan after I satisfy all the Kickstarter backer rewards and deliver those books, is to distribute any remaining books amongst all 52 small businesses. They can keep 100% of the proceeds from their book sales.\nConcept Design Of Wood Book Cover\nPrototype Title Page\nPrototype Art Page\nPrototype Interior Page\nThe Backstory\nIn 2013, I gave away 365 pieces of my original art as a gift each day to the first person to ask for it, anywhere in the world. It was an amazing experience. Project 365 culminated in a 9x12-inch, 316-page, two time award winning book whose proceeds went to benefit the Children\u2019s Creativity Museum in San Francisco. \nProject 365 Book\nExample Finished Project 365 Books\nProject 365 Book: Example Interior Page\nProject 365 Book: Colored Head and Tail Bands\nThe Cost\nWhen I did the Project 365 book, I learned a great deal about what goes into producing a museum, high quality art book. I grossly underestimated my first Kickstarter campaign and estimated a goal of $11,000. I ended up using thicker, coated art paper, colored head and tail bands, hardcover stock, blind debossing the title into the cover, cloth bounding and running a special edition slipcase. My shipping charges were $60 per international book and I was selling the book on my campaign for $60 so that was a wash. And while it's mentioned in the fine print, I just didn't consider the 8% crowd funding fees which came off the top of my budget too. The quantity of books also play a big role and the per unit price will greatly depend on how many books are produced. I ended up with a total cost of roughly $20,000 to produce the book I wanted in both design and quantity. I was fortunate enough to raise $20,526 during my campaign, but the 8% of fees brought my total budget to $18,883.92.\nEven though the art was free, I'd never want to sacrifice quality in regard to the production of the books. It's important to me that the quality of the book lives up to the same standard so I personally covered any balance to make sure it was done right. After a year of hard work between my designer and I, the book was recognized and awarded \"Outstanding Book Of The Year: Best Book Arts Craftsmanship\" by the IPPY Awards and \"Best Art Book\" by the 2015 USA Best Book Awards. \nI'm really excited about this new book and being able to use all the past knowledge and experience to make it. I've determined this book will estimate at a cost of $20,354.00 which will cover all the design options, shipping charges and fees to produce. Of course, there could be minor design changes that will potentially shift this number up or down, but I will work with Global PSD to make sure it fits within budget. If the Kickstarter campaign goes beyond the funding goal, well, I'll just make an even higher quality book. :)\nThe Specs\nApproximately 60-70 pages. This is still under development as we're working out the final design. \nThe hardcover will be wood with the title burned into the cover, mimicking a vintage business sign. \nCloth spine with blind debossing\nDimensions approximately 9 x 9 inches \nSmythe swen book binding \nColored head and tail bands \n157 GSM art paper \nThe gicl\u00e9e prints are produced on an Epson 9900 utilizing the 11 color high dynamic range inkset, which results in a wide color gamut. Paper is conservation grade and acid free.\nThe Schedule\nA rough outline of the schedule looks like the following, although is subject to change based on any unforeseen production delays.\nKickstarter Campaign: April - May\nDesign: Layout and copy: June - July\nBook Production: July - September\nBulk Shipment to San Francisco: October\nPackaging and signing: November\nOut For Delivery: December\nThe Faces Behind the Window Sign\nI want to thank and give recognition to all 52 small business that were a part of 52 Pick Up!

White-Ti Oi now available\nTHE TALK\nTHE WHAT \nWe\u2019ve designed a bicycle bell, Oi. We think it\u2019s a bit different. We hope you like it. If you do, why not help us bring it to life?\nHello\nTHE WHY\nBike bells have been domed since they were invented in 1877. In which time we\u2019ve sent man to the moon, cloned a sheep, and created hundreds of different styles of beautiful bicycle, yet not reimagined this simple analogue device. What if it wasn\u2019t a dome? What if it didn\u2019t protrude from your handle bar like a blister?\nOh dear\nWe set out to design a totally new bell where form and function played an equal part. A bell with a beautiful tone, but also a remarkable style and choice of materials that embodies a rider\u2019s personality. We wanted to embrace a variety of riding genres, without compromising any.\nTHE WHO\nKnog is a bike accessory brand that is well know for its innovative design in bicycle lights and locks. Until now, we haven't focused on the humble bell. So what better way to test a revolutionary new product design than put it up on Kickstarter?\nSome Knog characters\nWe're designers first. A small team of hungry engineers and industrial & graphics creatives who like to challenge everything. Especially the basics. Especially the stuff that people don\u2019t think is worth changing. Yep, that\u2019s the stuff we like changing. \nTHE HOW \nThe Oi bell's shape originates from its home - the handle bar. Our design team explored hundreds of iterations in designing the style. Then tested and prototyped different widths, depths, materials, curvature, actuators, springs and more to get to the optimum design. \nStep 1: Scribbling\nStep 2: CADing (is that a word?)\nStep 3: Prototyping\nAs with all our designs that reach this stage, we have applied for patent and registered the design. //Design Registration applied for: No. 201610483 //Provisional Patent applied for: No. 2016900305\nTHE LOOK \nWhere bells usually protrude up or out, Oi doesn\u2019t. It appears to hover around the handle bars. In one sense, it's discreet. But in another, it stands out as unrecognisable.  \nYum\nSaucy\nTHE SOUND \nWe tested numerous prototypes to get the perfect pitch, length of ring, and volume. With a spring-loaded actuator built into the mount, the strike of the bell is firm and fast, allowing a good balance of volume and longevity of sound. Our bell actually has several pitch tones - one core and several supportive higher tones to ensure it's unmistakable and safely heard. To compare it to a musical instrument, where some bells play a single note, Oi plays a chord. Hear it here for yourself...\nPLAY\n\nThe bell-off...\nPLAY\n\nTHE FINISHES\nFrom left to right: Aluminium, Titanium, Brass, Copper, Black\nThere are five styles. The standard aluminium model comes in 4 finishes: brushed aluminium; brass-plated; copper-plated; and black. The top of the range, \"treat yourself\u201d model is made from titanium. \nTHE SIZE AND SPEC \nThe bells fit on almost all cylindrical bars. The SML Oi is for the common 22.2mm bar, and with the \"spacers\" that come in the pack, the LRG Oi is for all bar sizes up to 31.8mm. The Oi will also work on any aero bar with a 16mm cylindrical section (usually near the stem). \nDeets\nAfter you pledge, we'll be in touch to ask for your choice of size.\nTHE MOUNT \nWhat about the handle-bar cables? No worries. Built into the shape of the mount is a cable management system. So not only does it allow the bell to look and sound uninterrupted, it also helps gather your cables (for the organiser inside us all).\nWhat about getting it on the bar. Again, not a thing. Just pop it over, give it a quick tighten up, and you're good to go. No sliding down the handlebars, no dismantling and re-assembling.\nEasy on. No need to remove grips or cables.\nManage your cables\nTHE OI\nWE WILL CONTACT YOU AFTER THE CAMPAIGN (EARLY APRIL) TO REQUEST FOLLOWING INFO: \nSIZE\nFINISH \nENGRAVING TEXT (for \"Bells and Whistles\")\nDELIVERY ADDRESS \n---\nGALLERY\nThank you, backers.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\nProduction:\nWe\u2019re in the fortunate position of having many years of experience designing and manufacturing bike products.

The set of Ti-MQR is a 1/4\" shorter over all then the TK-MQR. It may not seem like much, but it is noticeable.  The Ti-MQR magnets are also a little weaker, however I haven't noticed it.\nCan I pledge for more than one Reward?\nI have introduced \"packs\" into the rewards, for this project please don't add on to your pledge like past projects. (Unless you are in the \"quick draw reward\")  The complexity on my end is already high, even tho it may not seem like it. We will have different color options which is hard to keep track of if adding on to your pledge.  I'm sorry if there isn't a Pack that suits your needs on this project.\nAren't your prices kind of high?\nWell, remember you are getting 2 (1 set). Lets look back to TiMaG, a 4 pack of para-cord mags were $56. Which translates to 2 sets of Ti-MQR for $36. So why is it $20 cheaper? It's cheaper because I know what I'm doing now, haha - no really. I have learned how to be more efficient.  I now have better equipment, etc.  So... I pass the savings on to you for supporting my project :) How often does that happen?\nWhat are the key rings you are using in the pictures?\nThey are the FREEkey accessory rings.  I originally included them with TK-MQR, however many people didn't care for them and used their own rings.  Currently no rings are included, but that may change as the project goes on.

I\u2019m a design engineer/maker/small business starter and I\u2019ve successfully completed 7 previous Kickstarter projects to date.\nI\u2019ve been able to create the Strong Like Bull Magnets brand and product line through multiple projects on Kickstarter. Magnets are cool and useful\u2026 and my previous projects have been well received. I\u2019m returning to Kickstarter to try to further broaden the SLB magnet lineup\u2026 this time with a smaller version I call TackMags.\nShaped like thumb tacks, TackMags are perfect for your refrigerator, whiteboard, or any steel surface you\u2019d like to \u2018tack\u2019 something to. \nI'm certainly not the first person ever to make a tack shaped magnet, but hopefully you'll like my unique version... a strong neodymium magnet coupled to a cool custom machined aluminum housing which as always sports the stamped Strong Like Bull logo (I still remember sketching the logo going on a few years ago now).\nDesigned to be not too small and not too large... TackMags utilize custom 8mm diameter high grade Neodymium Iron Boron magnets that have a respectable 'axially pull' specification of almost 6 lbs.  Axial pull specs are always a bit hard to visualize, so I like to describe magnet strength in terms of how many sheets of full size paper a single magnet will hold to a typical refrigerator... for TackMags, it's 21!  So for 'tacking' up a few envelopes, pictures, pizza coupons, or your kid's artwork... you're all set with these!\nWhile they\u2019re not the strongest magnets I've made, they still have a good amount of hold, much more than your average refrigerator magnet and the shape makes them easy to grasp and remove.\nI plan to deliver a certain portion of the rewards in December, for delivery prior to Christmas (timing requires this to be for US backers only). I've got machine shop time locked up already to make sure I can meet that goal.  If all of the limited quantity 'December delivery' rewards get pledged for, these 'overflow' rewards are scheduled for February fulfillment (along with any international backer rewards).\nTo keep things manageable, December TackMags are only being offered in a silver aluminum anodized finish.  If there ends up being 'overflow rewards' for February, I might add some anodize color options for those.\nTackMags will be packaged in clear 6-pack tubes making them super cool, super unique holiday gifts! Rewards are available from 1 to 5 individual six-pack tubes.  If you are looking for some awesome stocking stuffers, look no further!\nTackMags start with a custom machined aluminum magnet housing. I use my hobby lathe to make prototypes until I\u2019m happy with the design.\nIf the funding is successful, I will work with a professional machine shop to produce production quantities.  I can make some nice parts myself, but I'm pretty slow;)\nThe machined aluminum parts then go to a finishing shop to be anodized. Anodization is a hardcoat process to keep the magnets scratch free so they\u2019ll look good for a lifetime.  This time around, I'm going to have the machined parts sand blasted prior to anodize to get that textured, shimmery high-end look.\nNext comes the logo. I'm stamping after anodize this time around... this will save time and since I'm having these parts sandblasted, stamping afterwards will keep the logo crisp.  The big goal of my last project (Stick Magnets) was to fund the purchase of an \u2018impact stamp press\u2019 to allow for more precise and repeatable logo stamping.  \nThe impact press has been a great addition! Prior to having the press, I would stamp all the parts I made manually using a hand stamp and hammer (yes really!). The press works great and will be again utilized to mark the SLB logo on TackMags.\nThe last step is installing the high grade neodymium magnet. While I work with a machine shop to produce production quantity aluminum housing parts, I do all of the final assembly, inspection, packaging, and shipping myself. \nI stepped up packaging a bit on this project to make the magnets a bit more 'present-able'.  Cool, clear tubes, with an SLB logo cap.\nWhile I've managed to build Strong Like Bull Magnets into a small business, I still find it useful to test the waters on Kickstarter before committing to a new product addition.  Beyond gauging 'market interest', a successful Kickstarter provides me with scale... or the ability to order materials and components in large quantities to get prices to an attractive level. So if you're interested in some custom magnets, as always, I'd appreciate your support!\nAs noted above, I have lots of experience and a good track record on Kickstarter. Big thanks to Kickstarter for such a cool platform!\nLastly, you can keep track of me at these places...\nWebsite: StrongLikeBullMagnets.com or SLBmagnets.com\nBlog: SpokeDesignBlog.com\ntwitter:  @SLBmagnets\nInstagram: @stronglikebullmagnets\nFacebook: StrongLikeBullMagnets\nAlso... if you back for one on the 'December Delivery' reward tiers, please make sure you have your email & update notifications turned on for this project so you don't miss the Survey notice... timing is tight on this one, so if we fund, I'll need surveys done promptly:)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTackMags is my 10th Kickstarter project attempt (two did not fund).

Pulse plugs into your DSLR or Mirrorless camera's USB port, so whether you're shooting photos, time lapse, or video, you get complete creative freedom - remotely from your smartphone - with your current camera. \nISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed Control\nPulse's strength comes from its 100' bluetooth low energy radio, advanced USB control software, and a beautifully designed interface. We wanted a product that could handle your biggest project ideas - from day-long time lapses to your next backpacking trip. Because of its size you can take Pulse anywhere, and thanks to what it can do you'll never want to leave it behind. \nGet image thumbnails wirelessly on your phone.\nWith image preview you can view thumbnails on your phone right after you take a photo, at a range of up to 100 feet. Whether your camera is sticking out a 5th floor window or you're warming up while it braves the cold, Pulse has you covered so you can still get the perfect shot.\nPulse plugs into your camera's USB port and is compatible with just about any Canon or Nikon DSLR (and now the Panasonic GH4), and the Pulse app is free for both iPhone and Android devices. Want to confirm that your camera is compatible? Check the FAQ at the bottom of this page.\nWant Pulse to work with your Sony camera?! So do we! See the FAQ for the full explanation.\nGet group photos, without having to race back into the shot.\nWhether you're part of the shot, or not, there are a lot of times where it is just nice not to have to stand behind your camera. With Pulse, you can set up your camera and trigger it from anywhere in the room. Pulse's Bluetooth connection allows you to roam as you need to and gives you a range of up to 100 feet from your camera.\nGlacier Point, Yosemite\nShooting in low light requires you to keep your camera absolutely still. Pulse makes it easier than ever to get the shot you want, and allows you to leave your shutter open for up to several hours, or as little as a few seconds. In long exposure mode you can either lock the shutter down manually and then release it, or set the exposure to a timer and just let it count down until it is finished. Pulse also supports HDR capabilities for differing lighting conditions!\nGet epic star trails with Pulse's Long Exposure feature!\nAnd don't worry! The light on Pulse blinks before it takes a photo so that it won't mess up the lighting of your shot, and you can always turn it off or dim it if needed. \nWe've spent the last 4 years making the smartest time lapse products on the market. Pulse builds on all of our previous work, and makes time lapse easier than ever for first timers whilst expanding the features and level of control for experienced shooters. \nOne of the biggest issues with traditional triggers is the inability to know when things have gone wrong. With Pulse's USB control your camera will get every single frame, and the app will let you know about problems (like low battery or buffering time) before they ruin your shoot.\nMost remote triggers only let you do one thing - take photos. Because Pulse plugs into your camera's USB port and not the trigger port, it has the ability to let you control video as well. \nPulse allows you to control up to three Pulse-equipped cameras at once - all from the same smartphone. This is especially useful for independent film makers or really anyone who has more cameras than they have camera hands. With Pulse, you can be everywhere at once and make sure you get all the right angles for your shot, even if you are just a crew of one. \nTo add more than one Pulse to your order (up to 3), just add $74 to your pledge for each additional Pulse and your shipping cost will stay the same!\nPulse's Exposure Ramping features allows you to ramp your ISO and shutter speed so that you can capture day-to-night transitions (the \"Holy Grail\" of time lapses) without having to touch your camera. We've designed this feature specifically to work with LRTimelapse. \nUnlike shooting in Aperture or Shutter Priority, Exposure Ramping keeps your camera in manual so that your photo's EXIF-Data is written properly for LRTimelapse workflows.\nWhen we first got started we were inspired to make better tools for motion time lapse. From that inspiration we built Radian, Michron, and Radian 2 - and brought them all to life through Kickstarter. This last year we got excited about remote camera control and the kinds of shots that remote control allows you to get.\nNow we are back on Kickstarter to make Pulse. One of the big pieces of feedback that we got from our users and backers was that smartphone-enabled wireless camera control would not only make for better time lapses, but would open up a higher level of general photography to more people. We also wanted to make something that fit beautifully with your camera and felt like a natural extension of your camera's aesthetic and function. \nThanks to our work with Radian 2 we had a huge head start on the electronics. And while there was some PCB trickery (or fun as Steve calls it) to get it all to fit into our enclosure, we are really happy with where it's all at. \nInitial drawing brainstorm on the Pulse mechanical design\nA few of the early Pulse protos.\nWhy yes, there are 2 double sided PCBs in there - good eye!\nPress Kit \nFull resolution photos and videos can be found in the Dropbox Link above and on Vimeo below. \nFull Resolution Video\nWe are a team of friends with a love for taking photos (especially time lapses!) and building things.  It all started in 2012 when Kris had the need for a motion time lapse device and was disappointed with what was available. Kris teamed up with his friends and roommates Kevin, Marcus and Steve to create the first Radian Kickstarter campaign. After delivering on Kickstarter and running out of Radian stock, the team put Radian sales on pause as some of the team moved to other jobs to keep up with bills as others finished up school.\nIn 2013, Steve teamed up with Greg to test the idea of a new stationary time lapse device and launched Michron on Kickstarter. They successfully delivered 4500 Michrons two weeks ahead of schedule in early 2014. With renewed momentum, we started a new manufacturing run of Radians, brought Greg and Michron onto the team, and started tinkering with some new product ideas. This last spring we launched Radian 2, the most advanced motion time lapse device on the market. Now we are back on Kickstarter to build Pulse and we cannot wait to see what you do with it.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.

Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter campaign! With your help, we can bring the newest GoWorx\u00ae product to life. We did it last year with our best selling GoKnuckles, and we're excited to work with this community to do it again! Please enjoy, and help us share if you dig it.\nWe set out on a (product design) journey to change the way you mount and use your Smartphone to capture creatively. Today, we are ready to introduce you to FreeRide - a versatile and fully adjustable Smartphone Mount that enables you to simply and securely attach your Smartphone (with or without a case) to pretty much anything, anywhere! The FreeRide Smartphone Mount features both of the world's most popular camera mounting systems:\n(1) You're free to directly connect your Smartphone to any mount or accessory designed for GoPro\u00ae HERO cameras, including existing GoWorx products!\n(2) The included tripod adapter allows you to attach your Smartphone to any traditional camera mount (with universal \u00bc\u201d-20 threads).\n\nPictured with: (Top) GoPro\u00ae Suction Cup, (Bottom-left) GoPro\u00ae Handlebar Mount + Pole Mount, (Bottom-right) GoPro\u00ae Handlebar / Seatpost / Pole Mount\nFreeRide opens up a world of possibilities, whether you own a GoPro\u00ae HERO camera or not. We gave your Smartphone a secure connection to any mount that works with GoPro\u00ae HERO cameras. With thousands of different styles and purpose built mounts on the market, you've got creative control with your Smartphone. If you're already a GoPro enthusiast, now you've got another mountable camera to capture additional angles and take your film making to the next level! FreeRide also works great as a way to mount and control your phone when using the GoPro\u00ae App.\nPictured with: (Top) The Original Handle + GoPro\u00ae Handlebar / Seatpost / Pole Mount + GoPro\u00ae App, (Bottom-left) GoKnuckles, (Bottom-right) The Original Handle Pro + Aftermarket Lens System\nFreeRide is 100% compatible with all the existing mounts designed by us here at GoWorx. When hooked up with our GoKnuckles, you'll have an ultra-portable and super functional \"handsfree\" grip for your Smartphone! Paired with The Original Handle and GoPro's Handlebar mount, FreeRide allows you to use your Smartphone as a display to view and control the GoPro\u00ae App - so you can adjust settings, and frame your shots perfectly.\nPictured with: Professional and consumer tripod styles\nLeave your bulky DSLR camera at home. FreeRide lets you take the world's most popular camera (your Smartphone) and use it with traditional camera mounts and equipment like Tripods! Get ready to leverage your Smartphone's awesome camera features like Slow Motion and Time Lapse to their fullest extent.\nThis is our favorite part. We're finding exciting and unexpected applications for FreeRide every day! From simple solutions like mounting your Smartphone on your car dash - to the unexpected, like strapping your Smartphone to a 50mph RC car! We even sent our Smartphone to the skies on board a drone. We love the DIY (do-it-yourself) culture, which is why we love to design tools that empower you to be even more creative.\nWe designed FreeRide to ensure it'll stand up to your demands in any environment. The main body components are injection molded with a high-strength and impact resistant Polycarbonate. The hardware is precision machined from AISI 304 Stainless Steel and perfectly safe for use in fresh or salt water. The padding is a premium grade Urethane rubber with 100% recovery (will not deform) that securely and safely holds your Smartphone.\nAbout GoKnuckles: Hit the streets, surf, and snow with the most awesome way to mount and use your GoPro\u00ae HERO camera and Smartphone! GoKnuckles are an incredibly functional and ultra-portable \"handsfree\" mount.\nAbout The Original Handle: Leave your bulky camera gear at home and keep it simple with The Original Handle for your GoPro\u00ae HERO camera and Smartphone! Capture larger than life perspectives and stabilize your photos and videos with ease.\n   Our Timeline:\nHere's a snapshot of our timeline! Once we know we're well on our way to our funding goal, we can expedite our tooling phase, and hopefully get your FreeRide Smartphone Mounts shipped early! We've built in some extra time for fine tuning the first production samples so we can make sure we've refined every possible detail.\n                               Can my Smartphone take a FreeRide?\nFreeRide fits all Smartphones (with or without a case) between 56.5-86.5mm wide.

Sorry we missed you! Please send us a message or leave a note in the comments and we'll be happy to help.\nWe asked hundreds of photographers, cinematographers, and action-adventure enthusiasts about the cameras, mounts, and accessories in their bag(s). Here\u2019s what we learned:\nThe majority of GoPro\u00ae and DSLR camera users owned multiple camera mounts for different activities and shot requirements.\nEveryone's using their Smartphone to capture photos and video.\nFew had the tools necessary to securely attach their Smartphone to the mounts they already owned - but almost everyone wanted the ability to!\nSo, what if you could attach your Smartphone to pretty much anything, anywhere? Good question, right? We used our insights and questions as the basis of our design process. Realizing there's a camera mount designed for just about every purpose, we knew we had a compatibility issue. We quickly identified both of the world's most popular camera mounting systems - those designed for GoPro\u00ae HERO cameras, and those designed for traditional camera equipment like tripods. We researched, bought, and tested every product that had at least 1 similar function. What did we find? Too heavy, not secure enough, poorly designed, no versatility, etc. After 8 months, and 15 prototypes, we have developed a solution that meets the creative and performance demands of today's photographers, cinematographers, and action-adventure enthusiasts.\nGoWorx is a team of designers, entrepreneurs, photographers, filmmakers, and action-adventure enthusiasts based in Asheville, North Carolina. We joined together to create performance and lifestyle products fused with innovation, simplicity, originality, and style. We design and manufacture mounts and accessories for GoPro HERO\u00ae cameras - and now Smartphones! Our products have been adopted by photo/video enthusiasts, action sports athletes, and adventurers throughout the world seeking to capture and share their experiences more creatively. If you share our passions for high-quality media content and extraordinary products \u2013 we invite you to join us.\nJoin our Community!\nWe're fortunate to have an incredible network of fans and brand ambassadors around the world creating epic media content.

Come along for the ride; It's going to be EPIC :)\nYou will love the TUKK, I promise; there have been no dissatisfied backers in any of my projects.\nThe TUKK 100% USA Made, between Jess in Utah and me in Iowa!

Kickstarter gives the ability for a \"normal guy\" to do what he loves. (I suggest YOU do a project, I'll help you) I have set out to make things that you can ACTUALLY use. \nIt's true I don't have a fancy page, pay for photography, or video.  You are getting 100% me in these projects.  Many people have said my projects are very unique in that my heart is in these projects, it's not a money show for me.\nThere have been a crazy amount of \"keychains\" since I first launched my Bottle Grenade; that aren't actually usable/functional.  Kind of upsetting really, but no worries you are here now. So lets make this story together, as the project goes on :)\n---\nSince pictures don't really do the TUKK justice, I opted to make this project more about the video. So please watch this video if you are interested in seeing more about it and how to use it.\n---\nMy Goal (Thanks Jess Proctor)\nMy goal is $1000, that is for purchasing the Titanium in bulk. $50 is \"cheap\" for a Titanium Utility Knife. There have been a few larger versions (including my own TK-RZR) but nobody had really tackled the small and actually carriable (that's a word... right?) utility knife.  The hobby blade idea comes from Jess Proctor of the \"Gear-a-biner\"  so Jess is a part of this project, and he will be making the Brass button for the TUKK.  I'll make the Titanium cases, and if I happen to get behind, I'm sure he will pick up some of the slack, haha - Thanks Jess!\n---\nBecause the TUKK uses magnets, it's magnetic enough to hold itself on metal objects, perfect to keep it handy.\nSlightly Magnetic!

The parts were not tumbled to perfection. Many little details you may never notice, I notice :)\nProduction:\nAll parts will be made on a CNC mill, which means tolerances around .001\" (1 thousandths of an inch) - if it's it's not perfect, it goes in the recycle bin. All parts will be tumbled in a special media for up to 24 hours to be sure it's as smooth as a baby's... well.. you get the idea :)\nSo as you can see the Prototype is just that. I try very hard to make my Prototypes look like the Production units. However, the end result is always better :)\n--- Thank you for your support!\nI love this place :)\nBrad & Family\n---\nIf you are on Instagram, be sure to check out my page.
