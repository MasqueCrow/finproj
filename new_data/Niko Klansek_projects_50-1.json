Join the Partisans (Postani partizan) is a WW2 board game with a historical background where players play as Slovenian Partisans to liberate their country.  \nYou have to roll the dice to win battles against the evil Axis powers, answer quiz questions on WW2 and perform various other tasks, including  singing, drawing or even preparing food for your fellow comrades, all to win the liberation war!\nHave fun while learning history\nRelive exciting historical events\n Spend great time with friends and family \nThere are 5 different wooden Partisan figurines to choose from.\nTake a look at who takes the role of the enemy:\nPer each year of war you have to conquer one wooden white guard tower and one wooden coloured guard tower.\nYou can take a look and see how to battle in our game.\n\u201cAll had one thing in common:\n          an intense pride in their Movement and in its achievements.\nFor them, the outside world did not seem of immediate interest or importance.\n          What mattered was their War of National Liberation,\n          their struggle against the invader,\n          their victories, their sacrifices.\n          Of this, they were proudest of all, that they owed nothing to anyone;\n          that they had got so far without outside help.\u201d\n- Sir Fitzroy Maclean\u2019s understanding of the partisan movement and its motivation\nComplete more than 150 missions (based on real events) from General Headquarters (HQ) and answer over 200 questions in The Partisan school! \nAnd draw a Special ops card from the pile to: Liberate the prisoners, Blow up the bridge, Evacuate the wounded, Destroy the enemy airfield and many more.    \nWhen players scan our QR code on Special Ops cards they will be diverted to our page where they'll recieve over 40 video orders - like this one:\nWe added a few more things:\n Stars & Traitors\nIt is the most essential add-on to have for our game.

Please allow me to welcome you to my Kickstarter campaign. After months of work with lots of sleepless nights, I'm very very excited to finally announce the (drumroll please) ...\nFant\u00f4me tarot deck is a full card deck. As a tool for spiritual guidance, it enables you to receive a tarot reading to connect to your inner wisdom. The name itself honors the guiding hand of tarot and your inner spirit in the cards. The design is a culmination of my love for geometry, mystery, and traditional brutalist artwork all blended together with the storytelling of tarot. The deck is also accompanied by a special multidimensional guidebook in the form of an augmented reality app. The app will help beginners learn more about the cards and how to practice tarot. It will also contain intriguing content for more advanced readers. A printed version of the guidebook will be included as well. Please check out this campaign to learn more about Fant\u00f4me.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe deck will consist of the full 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana, broken into four suits of wands, cups, coins, and swords. When making this deck I focused on three things:\n GREAT DESIGN - I wanted to offer you a gorgeous tarot deck,\n TOP-NOTCH QUALITY - I wanted it to survive the rigors of everyday use,\n UNIQUE EXPERIENCE - and last but almost most important, I wanted to offer you a unique guidebook experience.\nA Bewitching Design\nFant\u00f4me's design draws inspiration from brutalist architecture - a style that was an ethos of \u2018social utopianism\u2019 in the previous century. This style is generally characterized by its rough surfaces, unusual shapes, straight lines, and small openings. The night atmosphere and light illuminated icons symbolize how tarot helps us find our way even in the darkest moments. The iconography of its 78-card is based on the classical Rider-Waite-Smith tarot but reinterpreted through modern geometric design. Please take a look at the individual card designs below.\n For a more detailed view, you can access the cards here.\nHigh-quality materials\nA core concept of this deck is exceptional and unparalleled quality, both in its imagery and experience as well as in its construction and manufacture. Fantome aims to set a new standard in build quality and execution. The deck will stand up to the rigors of everyday use. Cards will be made from high-quality three-layer Italian card stock. The front part of the cards contains the beautiful full-frame artwork and the backside is partially covered with gorgeous ice blue foil. It's all packed in a rigid Lid-Bottom box to keep your deck safe wherever you take it. The size of the cards is 70 mm (~2.75 inches) wide and 120 mm (~4.75 inches) tall.\nFant\u00f4me's sturdy design and high-quality print make it easy to shuffle (it's a GIF, give it a second to load).\nWorld's First Multidimensional Guidebook\nBesides a printed guidebook this deck also comes with a beautifully designed multidimensional guidebook app. This augmented reality (AR) guidebook elevates the beauty of the card as well as pushes the idea of merging the reality which we live in and the expansive more energetic reality of Tarot.\nThe guidebook app will allow you to learn more about tarot and individual tarot card meanings. The app will also help you see other things - from popular card spreads to hidden design gems. The technology behind it is based on augmented reality and it provides a one-of-a-kind experience. Take a look at some of the things you will be able to do with this app below. \n\nChose your guide.\nThe app will contain a personalized guide in the form of a cat (yes, I'm a cat lover) that will take you through the app experience. You'll be able to choose between different guide designs to personalize your guidebook experience.\nLearn more about individual cards. \nThere's a lot of symbolism in each tarot card.  With the Guidebook App, you will be able to see the most important symbols visualized through 3D models. If you click on them you can read more about each symbol.\nJust point your phone towards a card to learn more about the symbolism behind it (it's a GIF, give it a second to load).\nLearn about tarot spreads and when to use them.\nAnother thing you can do is use the app to learn more about different tarot spreads. Choose one of the available spreads, learn more about its use, and see how it should be laid out on the table. \nTap where you want to place your virtual spread to see how it's done (it's a GIF, give it a second to load).\nThese are just a few things you'll be able to do in this multidimensional guidebook app. I have hidden plenty of easter eggs and additional content in the deck. It will also be continuously updated in the future. The app will support a list of Android and iOS devices.\nMain reward: Fant\u00f4me Tarot Deck \nAs this is a crowdfunding campaign for a tarot deck, the main reward is of course a tarot deck. Every deck will contain:\n78 cards (22 major arcana + 56 minor arcana) + any bonus cards from Stretch goals\nPrinted guidebook - a pocket-size version\nDigital multidimensional guidebook in the form of an AR app\n\nREWARDS AVAILABLE: \n One (1) deck - a great choice if you want to get a deck for yourself.\n Two (2) decks - 2 is better than 1, get one for yourself and one for a friend.\n Five (5) decks - this option is a good friends & family choice. Tarot for everyone.\n Ten (10) decks - if you're looking to buy wholesale then this is for you.\n Check the Add-ons section for more goodies available through this campaign.\nThere are additional items available. They are in two categories:\n Add-ons - items you can add to your selected campaign reward.\n Referral rewards - items you can earn if you refer a friend.\nRead more about both categories below.\nYou can read more about the add-ons below.\n\nArt prints\nBesides being one of the main campaign rewards for backers, you can also get an art print as an add-on if you decide to purchase a deck. If the campaign is successful and you select this option you will be able to select one card which I will print for you as an A5 print (148 x 210 mm ~ 5.8 x 8.3 inches). \nTarot cleansing kit\nIf you ever find that the energy of your tarot deck is feeling dull or you are having a difficult time connecting with your deck, it is likely that your cards need to be cleansed and charged. Cleansing your tarot cards before or after every use will ensure there is no residual energy from previous use affecting your readings. Amethyst, palo santo, smudge stick, and rose quartz will help you to cleanse and charge your tarot deck.\n\n Fant\u00f4me Designed Tapestry / Pareo \nWhat you can see on the image below is a beautiful Fant\u00f4me-inspired wall tapestry that can also be used as a pareo (wraparound summer beachwear). It will be about 55 x 55 inches big (140 x 140 cm) and made from velvet chiffon. Chiffon velvet is a type of velvet that is very lightweight, allowing it to drape in a variety of ways. It is a special Kickstarter exclusive (!) add-on.\nTarot cards bag\nMade out of lush deep blue velvet, decorated with enchanting embroidery, and adorned with adorable gold tassels, these tarot bags will keep your precious decks protected. Versatile as heck, you can use them to protect your precious tarot deck or for whatever else your heart so desires.\nTarot cloth\nInterested in getting a spread cloth? Well, look no further. I prepared a Fant\u00f4me inspired tarot cloth if you're thinking to get a full set. Hopefully, this cloth will bring magical energy of renewal into your altar. As beautiful as it is functional, the cloth helps you create and read your spreads. It is available in silk. The size of the cloth is 55 cm x 55 cm (19.7 inches x 19.7 inches).\nEnamel Pin\nGet this lovely Fant\u00f4me-style enamel pin that the awesome backers of this campaign helped unlock through Stretch goals!\nMystery Sticker Pack\nAs this deck's motif revolves around the mysterious nature of tarot I wanted to incorporate a mystery add-on for anyone looking to spice up their selected reward. Pick this sticker pack and you'll see what's included when you receive your reward. \nThere is another way how you can get delicious goodies from my campaign - refer a friend. I know that tarot is not the cheapest of hobbies, but I can truthfully say that quality comes at a price. I maxed out my cards and budget to get this deck to this point. Which means I'm kind of without any extra funds to promote it. But that's where we can help each other. Help me promote this Kickstarter campaign and you can earn some cool rewards. You will need a personal referral link to participate.\nHow to get your referral link?\n FIRST: Fill out this form - Application Form \n SECOND: I'll send you back your personal referral link. I'll check the form 2x per day, so please be patient if you don't get it right away.\n THIRD: Once you get the link, share it with friends and within your tarot community, but please be polite and respectful in doing so.\nWhat are the referral rewards?\nGet 2 friends to back this project by purchasing a deck - A free art print (value 15 EUR or 17 USD) \nGet 5 friends to back this project by purchasing a deck - A free tarot deck (value 55 EUR or 66 USD) \nGet 10 friends or more to back this project by purchasing a deck - A free tarot deck with all Add-on items included  (value of 125 EUR or 147 USD) \nYou are not able to use your referral links for your own purchases.\nIf you're new to Kickstarter, a Stretch goal is a point set past the original funding amount where a new aspect of the project is \"unlocked\". This is possible as the cost of production usually drops with increased order volume. If there is something you'd like to see included in the project, feedback is always welcome.\n\nThe idea to launch a new deck was rolling in my head for a while. I started working on it in September last year. Things really started to get going after the new year when I got some encouragement from the Tarot community. Right now we're in the middle of the Kickstarter campaign. If it's successful, the production will start at the beginning of June 2021.  If everything goes to plan, I believe I'll be able to ship out the orders in September 2021.\nUp to now, the project is funded by myself in its entirety. A big thank you goes to my existing customers whose support allowed me to be a tarot deck designer in the first place. By backing this project you will help turn Fantome into a tarot deck with a unique guidebook experience that will bring joy to countless tarot readers around the world.\n\nLast but not least, please let me introduce myself. My name is Esra and I'm the creative force (\"jack of all trades\") behind this project. I'm an ex-art teacher living abroad with my husband. The new environment and a break from teaching really allowed my love for the tarot to flourish. The result of that love is La Muci Design.  La Muci Design is a small boutique shop that delights customers with its tarot decks, oracle decks, and other spiritual items. Every item is crafted until perfection and created with lots of love. And based on the customer reviews, that love is felt all around the world.\n\nA final word\nI appreciate each one of you helping bring this project to life, truly, really. Your feedback throughout the design process was incredibly valuable. Please keep in mind, all of these images are of the first prototypes, there are bound to be changes to the design as the project evolves.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart thank you, thank you, thank you.\nFeel free to connect with me on social media:\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been designing and selling Tarot decks for a few years now.

It is meant for artists, game developers, software engineers, visual effects experts and computer graphics enthusiasts. Idea is to make Application as user-friendly, simple and fun as much as possible.\n\nApplications\nThere are 3 Applications that are currently available or in the development:\n ImaGen - Images Generator and Editor. ImaGen is a subset of 3Gen and It is already available as standalone application on Gumroad. ImaGen currently contains more than 100 nodes for manipulation of images and textures. \n 3Gen - 3D Worlds Generator. It is Autodesk Maya's plug-in (add-on). Maya is one of the most popular software for 3D modelling and animation.  3Gen contains all the features ImaGen has and many more for creating and editing 3D models. It currently contains more than 130 nodes.\n 3Vial - Trivial 3D Engine. It is in the initial stages of development. It will contain all the features 3Gen has but it is going to be standalone 3D Engine.\n\n Follow the development\nI am trying to post newly developed features and tutorials at least once per month. You can follow development on my:\n Youtube channel \n 3Gen Facebook Page \n Here are some previous demos for the new features. You can find many more on my Youtube channel. \nWhy am I doing a Kickstarter?\nPledged amount reduced by fees and taxes will cover all the costs of software licenses, books, scientific papers and publications for up to 3 years. More than half of the time I develop 3Gen is spent on research. Also, I'm collecting a lot of ideas from the already existing 3D Applications and Engines that are not cheap. If I however collect a lot more I will be able to work on these Applications full time which will drastically speed up the progress. But, to be completely honest, promotion that Kickstarter offers is what I'm currently looking for. \n\nWho am I?\nI am Nemanja. I have masters degree in Applied Mathematics and I have 5 years of experience as software engineer in several different areas: embedded software, compiler development, graphics programming, scientific computing, computer vision, image processing, procedural content generation, artificial intelligence, data science, automotive...\nContact:  LinkedIn,  Artstation ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am confident that I have the skills, experience and know-how to make this project a reality.

Now we are back for the MAKE 100 special!\nWe are making 100 unique wooden pocket watch stands that complement our pocket watches, transforming them into desk clocks.\nIn the 19th century Levi Strauss & Co. introduced the small pocket on jeans so miners, cowboys, railway, and other workers could keep their fragile pocket watches from getting broken. It has remained there ever since, despite pocket watches being replaced by wristwatches. Our mission is to bring pocket watches back to life.\nDaily, we get distracted by notifications and text messages that are screaming for our attention. We are forgetting about ourselves and the time that is slipping by. We realized that we should value our time more and that we should by no means be slaves of the hectic lifestyle and technology. The Itero Pocket Watch was born.\nTime is an important dimension we have created to order events in the past, present, and future. Keeping time is the key to success. With Itero Pocket Watches, you carry an important piece of the past in your pocket and value yourself and your time more.\nSlim design, decorative wood, the analog spirit in your digital world. Rest your eyes. \nPut your Itero pocket watch on the stand. We promise you won\u2019t stop looking at it.\nNot only is the pocket watch stand useful, but it also makes a great decoration for an office or a living room.\n\nThe name Itero comes from Latin and means \u00bbto do a second time, to renew\u00ab. And that is what we wanted to do \u2013 to bring the appreciation of time and tradition back to life.\nWe have decided to participate in the MAKE 100 Kickstarter January project.  Many of you have expressed interest in the Wooden Pocket Watch stands, which transforms Itero into a desk clock, which we have run out of.\nFor that reason, we are going to make a Kickstarter MAKE wooden watch stands made out of a single piece of walnut or oak. \nThe variance in the wood patterns and color gives every stand a bespoke look. To satisfy your specific preferences, we are going to enable you to pick the exact stand you would like to receive after the campaign.\nEvery stand comes with an Itero Pocket Watch.  3 distinct colors are available.\nWe designed a pocket watch stand, made out of solid wood from the local forests. Precisely crafted in Slovenia, EU.\nSolid walnut wood and oak will be used to make the pocket watch stands even more luxurious and durable. Every stand is treated with oil to provide the best natural conservation.\nAll the stands will be made locally from the woods of Slovenia. Our home country is the third most forested country in Europe, just behind Sweden and Finland.\n Our pocket watch stand has been carefully designed to perfectly fit the Itero Pocket Watch. We followed contemporary design guidelines to create a piece that fits well in every space. \n Modern design makes the Itero Pocket Watch suitable for a diverse range of styles. \nWith an Itero Pocket Watch, you will make a lasting impression.\nItero is designed for those, who care about fashion and tradition.\nAdapted to a modern gentleman.\nCustom engraving is available to make your watch unique. Put on your life motto, a quote, a special date, or something that you love. For only 10\u20ac you can give it a whole new meaning.\nOur mission is to bring pocket watches back to life. We decided to design pocket watches with a modern look, suitable for every style. Itero watches are only 8 millimetres thin, providing a slim fit for every pocket.\nThree color combinations are available.\n\nMIDAS BLACK\nMIDNIGHT BRONZE\nMIDAS WHITE\n\nCase diameter: 44 milimetres\nThickness: 8 milimetres \nCase material: 316L stainless steel, PVD plated\nDial window material: Sapphire crystal glass \nMovement: Swiss Ronda Quartz \nWater resistant: 3 ATM \nKeychain: 25 centimetres (included)\nKeychain material: PVD plated brass", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working hard and have overcome many barriers to make this project become a reality.

Its me.\nTHE REINVENTION OF THE BASKETBALL NET\n MEET KHARBONET \nThe Basketball net is arguably the most important piece of equipment in basketball -- equaled perhaps only by the ball itself. Without the net, there is no game. While having a net is essential, it's also highly important to have a net of an appropriate height.\nThere was a time when basketball nets were a simple thing. From wooden peach baskets attached to balcony railings to today\u2019s unbreakable basketball nets, the evolution of the basketball goal was influenced to a degree by 2016 NBA Hall of Fame inductee Shaquille O\u2019Neal. BUT first, why we need a basketball net on the hoop?\nFirst Carbon Fiber Basketball Net you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nThere are some benefits to having a net on the hoop. Now nets help break a ball's fall. The net helps control the direction of the ball when going through the rim, besides when the ball hits the rim first and bounces through, The net helps slow the ball down so it's not always bouncing the headlight after a make and usually makes the ball land in the same general area after going through. Nets give players a sense of depth for good aim and allow refs to see what the basket was made of. Without a net it's sometimes hard to tell if someone has made a bucket or not. Beyond these functions, nets add to the audio, kinetic and aesthetic experience that leaves players driving for \"nothin but net.\" Think about how your net might move, look, sound and function. Unconventional approaches are encouraged.\nBLACK & WHITE CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET.\nSo we carefully designed it to give you the most satisfaction on your basketball game.\n BUT WHY KHARBONET IS OUTSTANDING? \nEXTREMELY DURABLE\nThe unique material used in the KHARBONET assures good weather resistance. For extra protection against the harsh weather the fibers are also UV stabilised. ALL WEATHER!\nSUPER LIGHT & ULTRA FLEXIBLE\nThe special feature of the rope themselves is the low weight. The special material used assures extreme lightness. For better flexibility during temperature treatment double criss cross knitting was implemented.\nUNIQUE INNOVATIVE DESIGN, SAFE & HANDMADE\nCarbon fiber basketball net is being made by hand, which means each individual rope is being inspected from the beggining which provides high quality standard.\nCarbon fiber basketball net is also easy washable!\nThe way our basketball net is designed, a better visualisation can be achieved, which means basketball players can better evaluate the net depth, which is crucial for succesfull throws on larger distances.\nBEST MATERIAL\nThe basketball net is knitted out of carbon fibers. Some call it also the material of the future. This gives the net special values and uniqueness.\nFITS ON ANY HOOP\nNo matter what brand the basketball ring is - our net fits them all.\nSuitable for outdoor & indoor court !\n\nTOP SOUND\nSpeaking of sound. Get your own net and then we can talk which net gives the better sound. While scoring nets \"KHARBONET\" is the only option for the best satisfaction while playing basketball. You have to try!\nTHE LIFESPAN\nThe Lifespan of CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET  is 3X longer than nylon nets, so we say that KHARBONET breaks the rules! hehe :) Remember that!\nTECHNOLOGY\nCarbon fibers are fibers thinner than a human hair, about 5-10 micrometres in diameter and composed mainly of carbon atoms. Carbon fibers are classified in mechanical engineering as a group of composite materials. This means that the material is composed of two or more building blocks that are joined together. In this case, carbon fibers appear as nuts made from organic materials, followed by fillers. Carbon fibers are often presented as a composite of the future, mainly because of its mechanical properties and low weight, making the material much more useful. If the fibers are acting in all directions, the fibers are positioned in such a way that some fibers are horizontally left up and vertically, and the fibers intertwine and transmit forces in all directions, usually such fabrication of fibers is said to be a fabric. Everybody knows the carbon fiber fabric, but what about the carbon fiber rope?\nPrototyping...\nIntroducing the first Carbon Fiber Basketball Net on the market. WHITE EDITION.\nWhat you can't see, it's what matters the most. It\u2019s all about the little things that make the difference. BLACK EDITION.\nGALLERY\n\n\n WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT OUR KICKSTARTER? \nWe have put thousands of hours into this project to make it live! The team is full of enthusiastic and experienced individuals coming from various fields such as design, engineering, production and logistics. The complexity of this project required lots of knowledge and hard work. Together we have brought our dream project to life and we are excited about what lies ahead. We\u2019re starting our journey with Kickstarter because we believe the backer community will play an integral role in the development of carbon fiber ropes. Through Kickstarter we\u2019re not just pre-selling our products to early adopters, but rather forging relationships with a passionate community of innovative individuals. We want to show ourselves to the world, we want to share our product with the whole world. We want to show people what everything can be done from Carbon fiber.\nCarbon rope has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With the team , we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create. \nTHANK YOU!

As soon as we are funded, we will be able to fine tune the grinder, kick-off the production and ship it to our backers. \nWe have mapped out the critical path and have made all necessary precautions to ensure we can scale production if we surpass our goal. We are very confident in our timeline, but it's our core belief to never settle for a mediocre product, so we won't be compromising on the quality in order to save time.

Only a small amount of material in the grinder is plastic that is easy to remove and recycled if needed. \nThe motor for the electric grinder conforms with international standards for electric devices and due to a small workload, the motor is expected to be as durable as the body of the product.\nReusability and recyclability\nARCO is a coffee grinder, a tool, that is designed to be durable and long lasting without any defects. As a product with a long life span, it does not pose a threat for additional burden on landfills, also considering the fact that ARCO is manufactured of materials that are not bonded together for easy separation of materials and recycling (aluminium, steel, plastic).\nThe packaging will be designed using recyclable materials that will be easy to separate and recycle.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe building blocks of ARCO are sourced from Europe (Italy, Slovenia) with some additional parts manufacutred in China (Shenzen). We have high standards when it comes to choosing our suppliers and manufacturing companies. All the companies we work with are highly reputable companies with premium quality standards and good work environment for the workers.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe most important aspect of sustainability in our delivery is transport optimization. We have an established transport route from the companies we work with and thus we can optimize the delivery of all our products. ARCO will be added in our transportation plan with little additional transportation stress. \nWith precise planning of deliveries we optimize delivery cost and we ensure that no container leaves the factory unless loaded in full, thus ensuring perfect optimisation of transport.\nDelivery to end customers will be handled via our delivery partners with established delivery routes that are as well optimized to perfection.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac125 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird - ARCO hand grinder", "descp": "With superb grind consistency and simple grind adjustment, you'll be ready to take this hand grinder anywhere!\nINCLUDES:\nARCO hand grinder\nHandle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["429 backers", "Limited (21 left of 450)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac144 or more", "title": "Early Bird - ARCO hand grinder", "descp": "With superb grind consistency and simple grind adjustment, you'll be ready to take this hand grinder anywhere!\nINCLUDES:\nARCO hand grinder\nHandle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac250 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird - ARCO 2-in-1", "descp": "The 2-in-1 coffee grinder that will change the way you grind.

Cakewalk is working as an extruder so there\u2019s no need to change anything on the connections on your card or even your firmware. Slicing profiles are provided for selected materials.\nOpen design\nWe chose to make our products extendable, upgradable, and easy to maintain.\nExcept the food-safe core parts of the extruder, most parts are standard spare parts that can be sourced. This campaign is designed to help us fund the injection molds for the core parts.\n3D Printing lovers are part of a strong community and we hope that more and more makers will experiment and promote food printing thanks to Cakewalk 3d. We\u2019re eager to get feedback and don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll be always here to help!\n\nHi, my name is Marine. I\u2019m a 3D printing executive, a graduated pastry chef, and the creator of Cakewalk 3d. I live in Paris, France.\nI love innovating with food and that's why I started Cakewalk 3d, first as a side project during the spring. It all began when we were all quarantined in France, and I wanted to automate my own pastry techniques. With a mechanical engineer, we worked together remotely, each one testing and improving on its own 3D printer.  We gather our result daily, and we iterated over 3 months.\nOnce I started showing other pastry lovers the desserts I was getting, there was so much interest that I knew it was something I had to share with the whole 3D printing community. I worked and designed new recipes during months (mostly tested and approved by my coworkers!) and searched for the best production methods.\nEven if I always want to 3D print everything, I came to the conclusion that the core parts of the extruder need to be injected. So I worked with an engineering team to select the best providers and design the molds. The campaign is aimed to raise enough money to pay these molds.\nThanks to your support, Cakewalk 3d will be soon in production, and I am really excited to share what we\u2019ve built with the Kickstarter community.\nIf you\u2019d like to see some of the designs and recipes I\u2019ve been getting with Cakewalk 3D, you can find me on Instagram @marine_corebaillais\nMay 2020 : The first designs\nMay 2020 : First 3D printed parts\nMay 2020 : First prototype assembled\nJune 2020 : Corentin's trial on Creality Ender\nJuly 2020 : New version on Marine's Anet 3D printer\nJuly 2020 : Testing new recipes\nPLAY\n\n July 2020 : First tests with chocolate\nAugust 2020 : 3D Printing Chocolate on Thibault's Alfawise\nSeptember 2020: Prototype testing on Alfawise and Anycubic\nSeptember 2020 : Final version, ready for production\nOctober 2020: Burger printing in progress...\n Help us spread the word and receive an extra ingredient in your box !\n\nShare this with friends on Facebook.\n  Share on Instagram.\n  Mention and follow us on Twitter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing:\nAs the old saying goes: good tools for good works.

Without the net, there is no game. While having a net is essential, it's also highly important to have a net of an appropriate height.\nThere was a time when basketball nets were a simple thing. From wooden peach baskets attached to balcony railings to today\u2019s unbreakable basketball nets, the evolution of the basketball goal was influenced to a degree by 2016 NBA Hall of Fame inductee Shaquille O\u2019Neal. BUT first, why we need a basketball net on the hoop?\nFirst Carbon Fiber Basketball Net you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nThere are some benefits to having a net on the hoop. Now nets help break a ball's fall. The net helps control the direction of the ball when going through the rim, besides when the ball hits the rim first and bounces through, The net helps slow the ball down so it's not always bouncing the headlight after a make and usually makes the ball land in the same general area after going through. Nets give players a sense of depth for good aim and allow refs to see what the basket was made of. Without a net it's sometimes hard to tell if someone has made a bucket or not. Beyond these functions, nets add to the audio, kinetic and aesthetic experience that leaves players driving for \"nothin but net.\" Think about how your net might move, look, sound and function. Unconventional approaches are encouraged.\nBLACK & WHITE CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET.\nWe carefully designed it to give you the most satisfaction on your basketball game.\n WHY KHARBONET IS OUTSTANDING?\n   EXTREMELY DURABLE \nThe unique material used in the KHARBONET assures good weather resistance. For extra protection against the harsh weather the fibers are also UV stabilised. ALL WEATHER!\n\n SUPER LIGHT & ULTRA FLEXIBLE \nThe special feature of the rope themselves is the low weight. The special material used assures extreme lightness. For better flexibility during temperature treatment double criss cross knitting was implemented.\n\n UNIQUE INNOVATIVE DESIGN, SAFE & HANDMADE \nCarbon fiber basketball net is being made by hand, which means each individual rope is being inspected from the beggining which provides high quality standard.\nCarbon fiber basketball net is also easy washable!\nThe way our basketball net is designed, a better visualisation can be achieved, which means basketball players can better evaluate the net depth, which is crucial for succesfull throws on larger distances.\n\n BEST MATERIAL \nThe basketball net is knitted out of carbon fibers. Some call it also the material of the future. This gives the net special values and uniqueness.\n\n FITS ON ANY HOOP \nNo matter what brand the basketball ring is - our net fits them all.\nSuitable for outdoor & indoor court !\n\n TOP SOUND \nSpeaking of sound. Get your own net and then we can talk which net gives the better sound. While scoring nets \"KHARBONET\" is the only option for the best satisfaction while playing basketball. You have to try!\n\nCOMPARISON\n\nTHE LIFESPAN \nThe Lifespan of CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET  is 3X longer than nylon nets, so we say that KHARBONET breaks the rules! hehe :)\n Remember that!\nLifespan of nylon nets...\nTECHNOLOGY\nCarbon fibers are fibers thinner than a human hair, about 5-10 micrometres in diameter and composed mainly of carbon atoms. Carbon fibers are classified in mechanical engineering as a group of composite materials. This means that the material is composed of two or more building blocks that are joined together. In this case, carbon fibers appear as nuts made from organic materials, followed by fillers. Carbon fibers are often presented as a composite of the future, mainly because of its mechanical properties and low weight, making the material much more useful. If the fibers are acting in all directions, the fibers are positioned in such a way that some fibers are horizontally left up and vertically, and the fibers intertwine and transmit forces in all directions, usually such fabrication of fibers is said to be a fabric. Everybody knows the carbon fiber fabric, but what about the carbon fiber rope?\nPrototyping...\nHowever, if carbon fibers are oriented in one direction and are twisted or cast in a spiral during the temperature treatment, carbon ropes are formed. Carbon fiber ropes are the future!\nIntroducing the first Carbon Fiber Basketball Net on the market. WHITE EDITION.\nTESTING AND QUALITY\nCarbon fibers have very high resistance to mechanical forces, especially they are very resistant to tension. These properties have been used very well in the industry and in the technology, so carbon fibers are suitable for any kind of use. Since we wanted a very durable rope and Basketball Net,we simulated the most complex conditions and we designed the most versatile basketball net. We designed black and white version!\nNo net , no sweat...\nWhat you can't see, it's what matters the most. It\u2019s all about the little things that make the difference.\nThe world's most versatile basketball net.\nSPEND LESS WITH KICKSTARTER\nMORE EPIC PICS\nBlack CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET and white edition behind.\nTIMELINE\nFOUNDER\nDOMEN VRSIC Industrial engineer/Founder\nCreative problem solver since 1995\n WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT OUR KICKSTARTER? \nWe have put thousands of hours into this project to make it live! The team is full of enthusiastic and experienced individuals coming from various fields such as design, engineering, production and logistics. The complexity of this project required lots of knowledge and hard work. Together we have brought our dream project to life and we are excited about what lies ahead. We\u2019re starting our journey with Kickstarter because we believe the backer community will play an integral role in the development of carbon fiber ropes. Through Kickstarter we\u2019re not just pre-selling our products to early adopters, but rather forging relationships with a passionate community of innovative individuals. We want to show ourselves to the world, we want to share our product with the whole world. We want to show people what everything can be done from Carbon fiber.\nCarbon rope has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With the team , we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create.\n\nFOLLOW THE JOURNEY\nKickstarter, your feedback will help us and your support will enable us to reach our goals and beyond!

Pick up your action cards on the way to get ahead or slow down other travelers. It\u2019s super educational and engaging for kids and adults alike. The more you play \u2013 the more you know. \nWe will ship a free World Map Poster to every backer that pledges for the game. The map shows all countries and capital cities, along with flags sorted by continent. The map will help you master the game and become a Geography Wiz!\n\nThe World Map wall poster will only be available in this Kickstarter pack. It will later retail as a separate item.\nThe game's objective is to be the first player to complete the race around the world and cross the finish line. You move forward by winning with strong country facts or by answering geography challenges correctly.\nThere are 194 countries and there is a card for each country. Soon, you'll be able to recognize most of them.\nEvery turn each player draws a card from the country card pile. When it\u2019s your turn, roll one dice. Then you have to choose between 2 options. Calling out a fact or a challenge from your country card.\nPick a fact you believe is the strongest and try to beat other players. But be careful, if you lose, someone else will move forward. \nChallenge! In order to move forward you will have to answer a challenge question from another player. You will either have to recognize the flag, name the continent, capital city or show  a country on the map. If you answer wrong, other players will get a chance to move forward.\nThe difficulty level of the game is easily adaptable to players of all ages. You can play a variety of easy to hard challenges, depending on geography skill.\nThis is where it gets really interesting. There is another deck of cards which is full of action. These are the 26 action cards that you pick up along the way, every time you reach a new continent.

Each country is represented by a number corresponding to its country card.\nWe wish to bring geography and the scale of the world closer to people in a fun and engaging way, which will hopefully spark a future interest and curiosity about our world. \n\u201cStudents frequently mentioned learning things in their geography class that brought clarity or connections to existing knowledge, that led them to want to learn more.\u201d\nSDSU Study\nWe have been developing this game for quite some time. There were numerous prototypes, figuring out the length and structure of the race, deciding on illustrations and color coding while preserving the learning mechanisms that make it an effective educational tool.

Deductive reasoning requires a premise, a conclusion, and a justification linking the two. Sometimes called axiomatic reasoning, an invention of deduction has long been attributed to the ancient Greeks. Deductive reasoning is a skill that can be developed and Mag-Net Tiles is a tool for just that, more than a game that improves our deductive reasoning skills in a fun, effortless and an efficient manner.\n\n                      Majority of the schools today do not encourage creative approaches for learning and therefore our children are suffocated with deductive reasoning. Deductive logic provides a system of tools and techniques that allow the truth-values of certain classes of statements\u2014known as propositions\u2014 to be evaluated for consistency. Beginning with propositions properties known to be true or false, deductive logic allows us to derive other statements with already known truth-values. Simultaneously it allows us to identify incorrectly set truth-values and inconsistencies. Learning deductive logic provides a basic theoretical foundation that is helpful when studying more complex (and less exact) forms of logic.\nWe hope to bring the concept of Mag-Net Tiles - learning tool and Color TALE paint book to every school in the world.\nMag-Net Tiles are one of the most effective ways to give your child an exciting hands-on learning experience within a classroom, or alternatively among friends and family members. It basically provides a foundation for the kids to develop their creativity and keep them engaged for hours through building mind boggling creations of their own. Talk to your Educational professional and start presenting this fantastic learning tool which will contribute enormously when it comes to advancements of your child\u2019s thinking process and logic. Moreover, Mag-Net Tiles is not only a game for children, but it also helps us, as parents to spend our valuable time with our kids. This fantastic family game is also being used in the Homes for the elderly, and it is already being loved by many adults.\n If you are currently unable to afford or support this campaign, feel free to contact us and we are always happy to help and provide this Mag-Net Tiles and Color TALE paint book to you or your local educational providers.\nMany thanks to all of the team members for devoting their valuable time and skills from the beginning of the campaign and supporting Shape & Share in order to succeed at all stages of the development process.\nWhat age is appropriate?\nThe Mag-Net Tiles can be enjoyed from the age of 4, up to 120...\nToy safety\nMag-Net Tiles have been tested and approved in authorised laboratories of SGS (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance) for toy examination in France, Standards for safety and security are agreed with European regulations (CE).\n What are the cognitive benefits that the use of this game has for the user? \nThe main potential resides in the training of an abstract thinking, it helps in developing mental health with benefits such as increased focus and decreased anxiety, according to our research.\n  The given three-dimensional-shapes stimulate the sense of visual perception and allows us to create further images. The youngest ones benefit with a sense for \"serialisation, structure and order\". The black board guides your attention on your work and while adding more and more colour-tiles this effect gradually get\u00b4s stronger.\nWhat about creativity?\nThe younger child will probably form \"pictures\" of his or her own imagination. Just like the good old \"Tangram\", but today with our more appealing shapes and colours. The only limit here is your imagination! The older users are getting stimulated by our models as well as any other real World ideas (e.g. art, technology, nature, daily life items, logos...)\nCan my motor skills develop with this toy?\nSince the suggested models are challenging to work on accurately, it improves our eye-hand coordination (motor skills in other words). This means that you will, in the process of laying the tiles properly, enhance your motor skills.\n Is this game a family-toy as well? \nCertainly, it is always fun to create some innovative and engaging projects together, and do that as a game! The advantage is that you can keep your assembled works and exhibit them with pride at \"your united projects\" section.\nWhy do you think this game is motivating?\nOf course it may seem challenging at first, positioning the tiles in the correct way, but as you are progressing further you come closer to fulfil your chosen project! Which in result is very satisfying!\nCan the toy been played in more than one way?\nThere are numerous possibilities to play this game. Such as, you could work with your child on a picture and one will \"secretly\" change the previous one! Now would be the question: What has changed? Will you remember? This can be fun and could train your memory. You could compete in who can build the fastest, the opportunities are endless.\nIs the toy worth the costs?\nThe board and the tiles are produced from high-quality material and hold an approval from the SGS and CE certificate (see previous questions). You will feel and see that our product has a high-valency. Besides it is a one-time investment and if you look after it, you will enjoy the Mag-Net Tiles for a long time!\nDoes the toy reflect the child's individuality?\nThe fact that in \"playing\" there is no right or wrong, it`s evolving with our game!\n                     The beginner will first maybe get fascinated by just laying the tiles without a special order, but will soon lay simple \"pictures\" and will from there, develop more and more abstract and challenging models...

It is made from Pi\u00f1atex; a natural, sustainable textile made from pineapple leaves. All the materials are 100% vegan and cruelty-free. The backpack is carefully designed + ethically made in a small local artisanal workshop.\nWe support slow fashion and design and produce our bags using the same values.\nWho are we? \nWe are Fi by Gaja, a small startup fashion brand from Slovenia. Our sustainable bags have a clean and thoughtful design.\nOur brand emphasizes individuality, freedom and having a connection with nature. It is aimed at urban and environmentally conscious women.\nCollection\nWhy is Dahlia BAGpack multifunctional? \nBecause you can turn the backpack into a shoulder bag in just three easy steps! The shoulder straps of the backpack are removable with a detachable metal ring. The handle of the bag made from Pi\u00f1atex is also removable. \nRemovable straps\nMultifunctional\nDahlia BAGpack like a bag\nThe bag closes with a magnetic button and zipper. At the back, there is also a practical pocket with a zipper, where you can store the things you want to have to hand.\nDetails\nWhy is Dahlia BAGpack sustainable and what is Pi\u00f1atex?\nThe backpack is sustainable because we use carefully selected materials which are cruelty-free and have a low environmental impact. \nPi\u00f1atex is an innovative natural textile made from waste pineapple leaf fibre.\nPi\u00f1atex\u2019s journey starts in the Philippines where the pineapple leaves, a by-product of the existing agricultural industry, are collected. The leaves of the plant are processed to extract the fibres and these are manufactured into a non-woven substrate. No extra land, water or pesticides are required to produce the raw material.\nPi\u00f1atex is also R E A C H compliant. It is lightweight, durable and water-resistant. The material is sustainable, ethically sourced and has a low environmental footprint.\nThe dyes used for Pi\u00f1atex are GOTS approved and the resins comply with AFIRM standards.\nPi\u00f1atex\u00ae certificates\nWe already have great experience using the material when producing some small bag collections with it. It is pleasant to the touch and has an interesting texture.\nThe lining of the backpack is made from organic cotton with a Fi by Gaja original print. It has both a zippered and open pocket.\nMaterials\nThe shoulder straps are made using recycled ECONYL yarn. Econyl is made from recycled fishing nets and textile waste. The material is OEKO TEX 100 certified. The straps are removable with a detachable metal ring.\nStraps from Econyl\nAnother aspect of sustainability\nThe backpack is lightweight and the well thought out design gives it that timeless quality. It can be worn in all seasons and combined with different styles.\nYou can wear it for a walk around the city, for a business event or a weekend getaway in the countryside.\nHow big is Dahlia BAGpack?\nThe dimensions of the Dahlia BAGpack are: 30 cm x 33 cm x 10 cm (11,8 in x 13 in x 4 in). It fits a 13-inch laptop and everything on the picture: a book, a planner, a wallet, sunglasses, a mobile phone, 4 x Pencil case from Pi\u00f1atex, a tablet and 2 x mandarin orange.\n\nRewards\nAll the rewards that include the Dahlia BAGpack will be shipped to backers on Earth Day on 22 April 2021. We will send you a survey to collect information about your colour preferences and your shipping address soon after the campaign is finished.\nCollection of Dahlia BAGpacks: light grey, black, light green and blue colour.\nLight green and blue Dahlia BAGpack\nLight grey Dahlia BAGpack\nBlack Dahlia BAGpack\nPencil cases: light grey, black, light green and blue.\nTimeline\nWhat are we planning to do with the money that we raise on our campaign?\n70% of our goal will be spent on the purchase of sustainable materials (Pi\u00f1atex, organic cotton with a custom print and Econyl straps + all the metal accessories) and for the manufacturing. 10% will cover our other expenses (promotions, photo & video shootings). All the rest will be used for the future development of new products and collections and also for the expansion of the Fi by Gaja brand.\n\nDesigned and ethically made in Slovenia \nMultifunctional Dahlia BAGpack is designed and entirely made in Slovenia. We are collaborating with a small artisanal workshop from Vrhnika, where almost all Fi by Gaja bags made from Pi\u00f1atex are produced.\nOur collections are usually made in small series. If we will have the opportunity to widen our production, we will still strive to cooperate with other small local businesses.\nIt is our priority to keep our production in our local environment and to ensure our contractors have a fair wage and regulated working conditions.\n\n Fi by Gaja journey\nGaja Hanzel, Fi by Gaja founder and designer\nFi by Gaja fashion brand and startup were created by Gaja Hanzel in 2018. She is a fashion and graphic designer and she noticed that sustainability and design don't always go hand in hand. Her passion for design and caring for the environment motivated her to focus on designing modern looking bags made from sustainable materials.\nIn 2019, she signed up for a mentoring program in the business innovation centre Inkubator Se\u017eana, where her idea and the philosophy of the brand and products became clear.\nShe is collaborating with local small businesses who help her bring her ideas to reality.\n\"I have been carrying around the idea of this backpack for a while now; Kickstarter offers me a great opportunity to share our brand and our products abroad and make my idea a reality. We are a small start-up, any financial help and support goes a long way and I thank everyone that will support this project and our entire philosophy to allow us to expand and continue our journey.\" Gaja\nDahlia BAGpacks\nDon't forget to follow all of Fi by Gaja stories on social media.

The palm shaped wooden egg feels cozy and soothes your body and mind with the feeling of warm comfort.\n\nMASSAGE OBJECT: The rounded shape of the Zen Egg allows you to hold it firmly in your hand and apply pressure directly and easily to relieve body tension. The warmth of the solid wood and inherent aroma gives the egg the natural feel that your body responds to.\n\nCONVERSATION STARTER: Create a calmer and understanding work environment by starting an open conversation about stress and anxiety. Zen Egg has a strong \"wow\" effect that sparks curiosity and creates an opportunity to start the conversation about the things that matters to you.\nCONCEPT: Zen Egg was created with an emphasis on tangible sensations. We are tactile creatures; it\u2019s common for us to have something in our hands. I started to realize that every object that we hold is associated with some activity that we automatically start to do. It\u2019s for this reason that I wanted to develop an object that would be associated with taking time out.\n\nMATERIAL: Zen Egg is made out of different types of wood that you can choose to match your character, style, or environment. You will choose the egg material after the campaign in a survey: Oak, Walnut, Beech, Cherry, Maple, Wenge, Zebrano, Mahogany.\n\nLOCALLY PRODUCED: Zen Eggs are hand-crafted, following an age-old tradition of local Slovenian woodcraft. Even though the shape itself looks minimalistic, the process  behind it requires a great deal of expertise and focus on making it. Every Zen Egg is treated with organic oils to increase its durability. They are made with a high  level of precision, tested, and checked to ensure top level quality.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS: Measures, weight, and currently available wood types. We will add another wood types of wood for the Alter Eggo (+) when we overpass 50 orders for this size.\nRE-ENGINEERED: Zen Egg was re-engineered, from inside out to impress your with outstanding quality, attentively polished surface, and beautified shape. We improved the weight system insert, and optimized the gluing and assembling process to ensure the exceptional durability of Zen Egg.\n\nTHE ZEN EGG \"ALTER EGGO\" EDITION: You will elongate the calming experience with slower and longer swaying of bigger sized Zen Egg Alter Eggo. Its greater presence will enhance the zen vibe in your environment. Touching and fidgeting the huge wooden egg will satisfy your sensations with warmth and coziness. \nWhy did we name it Alter Eggo? The term \"alter ego\" is used for a second-self created by the individual, usually to live out a better version of the self. And that's the name of the game of the Zen Egg project.\n\nZEN TUNES are 5x few minutes long audio guided tapes, that help you to calm your mind and build a new perspective on situations that usually wreck your nerves. \nIn few minutes they will put you in good mood, where you will be able to gain the new habit o thinking. It will support you to change your reaction and act constructively in stressful moments. It is not just a quick calm down tape, it is a tutorial that help you to change. Zen Tunes doesn't give you fish, it teaches you how to fish yourself.\nTopics that are currently covered: (1.) Coming home from work, stressed out... now what? (2.) I had a fight with a partner ... how can I feel more connected? (3.) I feel stuck financially... how to solve the puzzle? ... and more\nWOOD TYPES: You will be able to chose the desired wood type later in a survey (after the Kickstarter campaign ends). For now you only chose the type and quantity of the Zen Eggs.\nADD ON: For more products use ADD ON options. When you click \"continue\" or \"pledge\" for desired Zen Egg, the new \"configure reward\" section appears. Here you can add on another products.\nEARLY DECEMBER SHIPPING / HOLIDAY GIFT REWARD OR ADD ON: We will be able to produce a very limited batch of new Zen Egg (the smallest one) for shipping before the December Holidays! Available woods: Wenge, Mahogany, Zebrano, Walnut. You can get this reward as a PLEDGE or ADD ON that adds it in your existing pledge. Holiday gift will be shipped in early December, the rest in march.\n\u275d I loved mine so much that my brother bought one for himself, it sits next to his couch on the side table in their family room. We\u2019re both very happy with our purchase and I\u2019ve always contemplated buying one for my home too. There\u2019s something about a nice clean shape with a beautiful wood grain. thank you for taking the time to make these, I think they\u2019re wonderful. \u275e\n\u275d I liked the story behind having something physical in my life where I produce mostly digital things. It helps me think. It helps me destress. It\u2019s also a conversation starter. I think at the end of the day -- it is what you make it. For me, it\u2019s a great product that I appreciate every day while I\u2019m in my office (I keep one at both of my offices). \u275e\n\u275d I appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail. More importantly, I feel connected to your energy and creativity, as if I were part of making your dream a reality.

We designed it and sourced the producers, but the tooling and material costs are simply too much for us to afford on our own. The crowdfunding campaign goal is to cover the costs of tools, optimizing the production on a large production scale and materials costs. After these costs are covered, we\u2019ll be able to run the Zen Egg project more sustainably.\n\nFIRST THANKS TO YOU. You took time to take a look at our project and we are happy you did. Fell free to write to us, ask question, comment, or share the project to people you care about.\nTHANK YOU OUR COWORKERS.

We use advanced high-quality food-grade impregnation to protect the wood from humidity.\n4. We make Zen Egg in a slow manner to ensure the wood is correctly dried and glued together.\nReusability and recyclability\n1. The packaging we use is 100% recyclable and made out of paper.

Bojan Zajc is a leading traditional woodworker with a workshop that follows sustainable production guidelines. For iron weight we cooperate with Griffing d.o.o. that has just won an AAA excellency of business in Slovenia.\nSustainable Distribution\nZen Egg has been designed to be as light as possible which minimizes the environmental impact caused by shipping.

We can now hardly imagine a life without all of that, but have you ever asked yourself what all those \u201caddictions\u201d do to the quality of our lives? We socialize less, we, especially children, exercise less and that is why we are more prone to various illnesses. To prevent that, we must create a better future for all of us. Physical activity and socializing, especially through playing games, are a recipe for a long and happy life. HopaGame is a solution as it offers the whole package. Did you know that by playing one game you could burn up to 300 Kcal?\nIt is all about the personal contact which was an integral part of personal and social development through the whole history. We need socialization, affability, fun, and more. That is why we decided to offer you something sociable, affable, fun, playful and all of that live and personal. The answer is HOPA.\nWhat came out of your mouth the last time you tripped? The answer is HOPA.\nWhy did you cheer when you toasted with your friends? The answer is HOOOOOOPAAAAAAA!\nIt is almost unimaginable to have a day go by without HOPA. Hopa is among us, you might have just not been aware of it.\nWhy not making the most of your travels by meeting people from different continents, communities, religions, traditions and hanging out with them, playing and having fun? Has anyone ever offered you entertainment, fun, and pleasure and at the same time income? How many times did you want to make changes in your life? Unsatisfied with your job. Stressful life. Not spending enough time with your loved ones. Wanting to make new friends. Peace, understanding, unity, game, fun, etc.\nOur vision is to connect as many people around the world as possible into the HOPA Community \u2018HOPAASSOCIATION\u2019. We are going to achieve that though tasks that are pleasant to us all: travelling, fun, socializing and games \u2013 Holidays Organization & Playing Association (HOPA). And income.\nDid you know that HOPA is a registered trademark, a brand that promises H appiness, O pportunity, P leasure, A dventure?\nHOPA.GAME can be played all around the world and you will always feel #Happiness when you are winning, #Opportunity to win your best score, #Pleasure to score HOPA Bonus and #Adventure to play all around the world.\n\nWe have developed a HopaGame. The first prototype was manufactured by the students of Carpentry school from Maribor, Slovenia, so it was made in EU, made from wood and was thus environmentally friendly. After we subjected the game to rigorous testing, we decided to create the final version of the game from Eco Silicone because it makes no noise and can be played indoors as well as outdoors. The game is easy to use. Everyone can compete and every amateur can become a professional. The game does not distinguish between short and tall, thin and fat, young and old, etc. WE ARE ALL EQUAL WHEN PLAYING THE HOPA GAME!\nWe have all once had or still have a role model, an idol. Usually, those people are athletes, movie stars and singers and most of them have the amount of wealth they would not be able to spend in more than one lifetime. Where is your current financial security?\nHopaGame offers financial stability or even independency. And the monetary fund will increase each year.\nLook for the HRCC\u2014Hopa Red Carpet Competition\u2014near you and qualify for the grand finale. Check Hopa.Game for updates.\n\nHow do I become a member of the Hopa Association? Become HOPA family member\nIt\u2019s very simple. Just like everything else that we do. Enter your data into the system.\n\nCOMPETITIONS\nCompetitions will be held on different locations and for different levels:\nRecreational (pubs, cafes, birthdays, garden, picnic, team buildings, etc.)\nInternal (companies, clubs, schools, universities, retirement homes, etc.)\nExternal (all \u2013 pubs, companies, schools, retirements homes, etc.)\nLocal\nRegional\nNational\nEuropean\nInternational\nOther options, suggested by you.\nHOW TO PLAY / RULES\nThe chips are tossed from the 295 cm distance (9.7 ft).

Even today, the feelings of joy and happiness are vivid.\nNow I am also the father of two children, to whom I wanted to give just the same experience as I had as a child. In my search for an original and slightly different model from the flood of cheap plastic copies, I noticed that nowhere can you get a ride-on car made of wood. All that was available was cheap plastic copies of cars. \nThe idea then developed on its own. I wanted to create a wooden children\u2019s car. With my experience and technical knowledge, I studied the possibility of making such a product and together with my colleagues implemented ideas and perfected it. \nWoody was born \u2013 THE FIRST ELECTRIC RIDE-ON CAR FOR CHILDREN MADE OF WOOD. \nMatev\u017e Reber\u010dnik, creator of Woody CAR\n\nHow it  all started?\nStory of project Woody starts more than one year ago. First designs were created several months later, and first fully functional prototype was bringing joy to kids in spring. \nWith proof of concept complete we got overwhelming support and praise from our peers. This pushed us to develop this idea into something more than just side project.\nWe learned from first prototype, greatly improved design in every way with safety and reliability at the top of our priorities. \nWe sourced only the best, well proven components and materials, performed daily real-world tests and carried out laboratory tests to confirm our product meets or exceeds EU directives and harmonized standards for toys.\n Still, we never stop improving. By the time we send you rewards we plan to make many more improvements, get our product tested by independent lab and upgrade our workshop machinery and knowledge - all in the name off better, safer product. \nFrom one-off experiment, to side project, to complete Kickstarter product with message for better future.\nMatev\u017e\nMatev\u017e is where it all started. With degree in mechatronics engineering, many years in e-mobility sector and hands on person from early age this project is his personal passion and challenge. \nInnovator and car enthusiast coming from one of the greenest countries in the world where wood-craft culture is rooted in its people it is no surprise Woody CAR was created here. \nLike all his projects Woody CAR is constant work in progress, constantly finding ways to improve existing design as he prides himself as perfectionist who wants to create the best possible creation each time.\n\u201cWhen you become parent and you try to spend as much time as possible with your children you realize that time will not last forever. Years fly by and you want to make each moment count; no really, read that again and let it sink in. I choose toys with educational value, not just physical but also mental, to help develop motor skills and real-world learning experience. And why limit fun only to young ones, Woody is made to bring fun, joy and pride to all.\u201d\n\nBut this project could not be realized by only one person. \nJaka\nJaka is one of the first supporters and part of this story from its beginning. With many successful business ventures under its name it provides valuable support to this project. \nAndrej\nAndrej is seasoned master carpenter with many years of craftsmanship experience. His resume includes many unique, hand crafted wooden products under his own brand name.\nWoody CAR team\nWe all share common vision - to offer the world environmentally friendly alternative to plastic ride-on vehicles. We take pride in what we do or create, and we strive to continuously better ourselves and our products.\nKnow someone who would love Woody CAR?

Not sure how Kickstarter crowdfunding works? Let us help you with some quick basic facts regarding our project.\nHow Kickstarter works?\nKickstarter is crowdfunding site used as launchpad for companies or individuals to raise funds for their ideas to become reality. This could be used for development, production or just to prove market viability of the product.\nWhat happens if you back the project (pledge)?\nWhen you back a project you contribute funds to overall goal of making product a reality. For this you are rewarded with exclusive discounts, early deliveries and other exiting rewards that depend on pledged amount. In our case, backers can get fully functional final product with discounted prices before they are available anywhere else and additional individual perks. Sooner you pledge, sooner you get accesses to excusive content, project updates and important milestones.\nHow to back this project and collect rewards?\nTo back our project, select reward you want to receive and amount you want pledge. You will select your shipping country and finally set up your payment. Remember, in case funding goal is not achieved your pledged funds are not collected, so ether you get your reward, or you get your money back!\nAfter successfully funding campaign we will send order form with further instruction to e-mail address associated with your Kickstarter Account. In this form we will also collect your delivery address.\nWhen are rewards delivered?\nPredicted delivery dates are listed with each reward type. Generally, our delivery timetable plans for first units to be delivered to customers by the end of November, while other rewards will be delivered in first months of 2021. Please note that this are our best estimates, delivery dates can differ from country to country and because of production delays. \nSHIPPING & WARRANTY\nDoes Woody CAR have a warranty?\nYes. Woody CAR comes with standard 1-year warranty on all parts and battery. We want our customers to have confidence in our product and service. Termes and conditions of warranty are listed in User manual.\nHow long is shipping time to my destination?\nEU based addresses can expect deliveries in 14 days after dispatch. Non-EU based addresses will be shipped via Express Air cargo freight. Delivery times can vary substantially form destination to destination, but should be delivered within 14 days after dispatch \nAre there VAT or other fees related to shipping?\nNo. We cover VAT and other fees based on current legislation in country of origin (Slovenia). What we send you is a gift/reward for your donation, so there should be no import fees, but in some cases anchorites can still circumvent this, so we can't take any responsibility if there are additional fees for addresses outside EU. After delivery we will send invoice to your provided e-mail address.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMain purpose of our Kickstarter project is to see if you, potential likeminded backers have same vision as we have. With this project we want to unlock affordable alternative to plastic ride on vehicles, not just for small select group of people but for everyone, this is our goal. \nTo achieve this, we of course need confirmation from you, our backers, that you want us to make this happen. In turn, we can confidently order larger quantities of materials used in creating Woody CAR, we can negotiate better prices, lower shipping costs, constantly improve our product, all for you, our customers and for our environment. If our campaign is not successful, we will be very limited in production quantities, price and shipping option.\n\nWith your funding we will also be able to make product safer thru harmonized standard testing by independent testing laboratories. We want to make sure these tests are performed before we send out the bulk of our rewards to ensure maximum safety for all potential users. These of course can be delayed if we need to adjust several things according to test results. \n\nWith more than 250+ individual parts needed to make each Woody CAR there can be delays in manufacturing due to complications in part deliveries and supplier manufacturing. We do take these possible delays into account with our reward fulfillment timetable and set our initial production goals very low for this reason.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Matev\u017e\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nEngineer by education, creator and explorer by profession.

As free movement outdoors and physical gatherings became impossible, me and a few classmates started yoga classes online. I was a bit sceptic in the beginning for I believe in the energy of the physical presence but soon understood that these virtual moments were one of those that were saving my days.\nMy yoga teacher started working intensely on social media and asked me whether I would be interested  in drawing yoga poses in order to enrich and add value to her video explanations of each one of them. I have been thinking of drawing yoga poses for a long time but it seems like the time had to get ripe and here it was. I can\u2019t really move but I need to stay active. There is so much fear all around so I need to breathe consciously. The trick is to keep breathing. Practising and drawing yoga poses are all about what I mentioned before.\nThe trick is to keep breathing.\nSo I started drawing. The more I drew, the more it all made sense. The illustrations I was creating had a surprisingly strong impact: I percieved them as embodiments of pure stillness - active stillness - very conscious active stillness made of colourful lights; merging of spirit and matter. As my collection of \u201cillustrated yoga\u201d grew and with it my enthusiasm to do more I felt it is time for the next step: sharing it with the world.\nOriginal drawings, aquarelle markers.\nVirabhadrasana - Warrior II Pose.\nDirection and Path \nFirstly - with your most kind help - I would like to produce a limited edition of high quality art prints. (I am very much tempted to apply my yoga series drawings onto unique pieces of clothing on the next stage.) Each art print featuring a calmly up-lifting, vividly vibrant, strongly energetic illustration is a reminder about what truly matters. It is very simple and extremely hard at the same time - it is finding one\u2019s peace by merging spirit and matter.\nAnd that\u2019s what my project is all about. Your support will help me make it alive.\nWin - Win\nAs a thank-you gift for supporting my creative process and my project you could choose between a hand-signed and dated postcard from the drawing series Active Stillness,\nVrishchikasana - Scorpion Pose // Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana - Revolved Head-of-the-Knee Pose // Utthita Trikonasana - Extended Triangle Pose // Adho Mukha Svanasana - Downward-Facing Dog Pose // Tittibhasana - Firefly Pose // Urdhva Padmasana - Upward Lotus Pose (from top to bottom, from left to right)\n ... a signed, limited edition unique piece of clothing featuring one of my illustrations from the drawing series Active Stillness,\nVrksasana - Tree Pose // Padmasana - Lotus Pose\n... or a hand-signed, numbered and dated limited edition high quality art print from the drawing series Active Stillness.\nPadangusthasana - Big Toe Pose\nVirabhadrasana - Warrior II Pose\nPadmasana - Lotus Pose\nAdho Mukha Svanasana - Downward-Facing Dog Pose\nVrksasana - Tree Pose\n\nNext step\nI attend to create a 2021 calendar, full of graceful yoga poses.

The game covers the Balkan Peninsula theater where one small country, The Kingdom of Serbia, was invaded by three fierce Empires, Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.\nIf you want to sign up for our newsletter, please visit  March on the Drina and leave your email. Thank you!\nMarch on the Drina began development in 2013 as the centennial anniversary of World War I approached. We wanted to make a game about the lesser known theater of WWI \u2013 The Balkan Peninsula Theater.  Without further ado, we invite you now to enjoy experiencing historically grounded components, a taste for the exciting gameplay, and the immersion into the battlefront of the Balkan Peninsula.\nFor easier maneuvering we used magnetic tokens.\nMarch on the Drina is a game for 2-4 players ages 14+. The game duration is from 120 to 180 minutes. Each player controls one of the powers in conflict: Serbia, Germany, Austro-Hungary or Bulgaria. \nThe setting from July 1914 to December 1918 is divided in 14 periods, where each period is described in one Calendar Card. Each Calendar Card also brings some effect to the game, so by using Calendar Cards, you will also learn highlights about the most important events of World War I.  \nEach power has four types of units: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery and Generals. All units have their attacking and defending values used to resolve combat.\nWhen all Calendar Cards are used, the game ends. In order to win, Central powers (Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria) work together and they must occupy all Serbian cities and hold them for one round. If Serbia wants to win, it must liberate all its cities and hold them for one round. If the game ends after 14 periods and neither side completes its goal, the winner is the side who controls most Serbian cities.\nBefore players place their units on the Game Board, each side takes one mini map where, without knowledge of the other side, can mark a starting point for every unit under their control. In that way, the opponent has no idea where you will place your defense or from where the main attack will come.\nArea within 3 fields from the field with a general is called General\u2019s Area of Command and units within that area are under that general\u2019s command. Each General has a special ability, which is written on his General\u2019s card. General\u2019s special ability is transferred on the units under his command.\nArtillery have greater range of action than Infantry and Cavalry, so it can attack (fire upon) enemy units within a 3 field area.\nIn late October 1915, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria launched a synchronised major offensive against Serbia. That same month, France and Britain landed four divisions at Salonika, but were unable to move north to help their outnumbered Serbian ally caught between the invading forces. \nIf the enemy is pressing too hard, Serbian units may use the option of Retreat through Albania, which becomes available in January 1916.\nIf Serbian units stand on one of the five fields in northern Albania that are marked on the game board with dark gray color, it is automatically transferred to one of the dark gray color fields in northern Greece.\nCities have Military Capacity. The sum of the Military Capacity of the cities under player's control represents National Military Capacity and players can use Military Capacity Units to purchase reinforcements.\nWatch our How to Play video\n Click here to download English Rulebook for March on the Drina \n\nIf you would like our game in your store, please contact us on princepsgames@gmail.com.

By pledging from just $79 (Kickstarter discount) we'll give you everything you need to get started:\n1. Our new complete virtual drum kit that's silent and portable.\n2. A 3 month subscription to our app (iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows) that will teach you to play and much more.\nWe love playing the drums but they're large, loud, and expensive. That's why we've created an instrument that's silent, portable, and significantly more affordable.\nOur solution is a complete hardware and software subscription service that will give you everything you need to start playing the drums.\nThis tightly integrated relationship between instrument and app will transform the way that you practice and give you deeper insights into your improvements.\n\nLEARN TO PLAY ALONG TO MUSIC\nPLAY\n\nOur app takes learning to a new level of fun. We will include a catalog of licensed music so that you can learn to play along with your favourite songs. Our software will show you what you should play and how well you are playing it.\nTRACK YOUR PROGRESS \nThe activity analysis in our app removes the guesswork from tracking your progress. We'll summarise the following data in chronological order from each of your practice sessions so that it's easy to find and read:\nPlay time: how long did you play for and when\n  Intensity: did you take it easy or did you thrash it?\n  Your set list: songs you played along to\n  Recordings: listen back to your recorded practice sessions\n  Accuracy: how accurate you are with tempo, hitting the right drums, and muscle memory.\n  Notes: annotate your practice sessions to jog your memory later on\n  SHARE YOUR RECORDINGS \n You'll have so much fun improving your skills that you won't be able to keep it to yourself. We're making recording the drums easier than ever before. Simply share your recordings with the Freedrum community in a few clicks.\nOUTPUT MIDI TO ANY DAW\nOnce you\u2019re ready to take your drumming into production, output MIDI from our app to your favourite Digital Audio Workstation such as GarageBand, Ableton, and Pro Tools. You\u2019ll be able to remap the MIDI so that you can:\nTrigger different notes\n  Set continuous controller values\n  Define fixed velocities\n \nNEVER STOP LEARNING\nEven the pro's never stop learning. Our service will grow with your confidence level and keep challenging you to be better. We'll recommend exercises that encourage improvement as well as retention of learned skills.\nHAPTIC FEEDBACK \nPLAY\n\nNothing is going to replace the feeling of playing behind an acoustic drum kit but our new virtual drum kit will bring you closer. Haptic feedback (similar to what you feel with a game console controller) creates a unique sensation based on which drum you hit and how hard. We\u2019ve done this by recreating the vibrations you feel when playing an acoustic kit.\nHEEL UP\n\nOne of the most requested features from our customers is the ability to play the bass pedal with your heel up: increasing your speed and comfort. This will work for single bass, double bass, and the hi-hat.\nCUSTOM GRIP STYLES \n In our app you will be able to select your preferred drumstick grip style for both left and right-handed playing: intelligently re-calibrating the drumstick sensors to meet the ergonomic grip of your choice.\nPackages and Upfront Cost\nIt's our mission to make Freedrum compatible with as many devices as possible. As our name suggests, you should be free to use our product in a way that suits you best. Please refer to our FAQ for a full list of supported devices. \nSince Freedrum is using interactive audio, Bluetooth headphones and speakers have an inherent latency that makes it difficult to play. Please refer to our FAQ page for more information.\nThanks to you, the community, our first virtual drum kit reached over 400% of the Kickstarter goal and we delivered our rewards, on time, 9 months later. Since 2017 we've shipped 15 000 units globally and we've listened to all of your feedback. We're back, four years later to ask for your help once more.

By August, despite running almost every day for three months, I was no faster than I was at the beginning of the summer. I realized that what I needed was the competitive edge I got from racing alongside one of my faster friends. But with everyone busy all the time, we could never quite get our schedules to line up.\nAfter yet another subpar workout, I had a thought- what if we could somehow build the ultimate training partner? One that I could train with on my schedule that would still help me get the competitive benefits of training with a partner. And that\u2019s how the idea of the Ghost Pacer was born- a pair of glasses that project a holographic training partner that runners could run with anywhere, at any time. Not only would it improve my time, it would make each workout that much more effective.\nAt every step of the way, we have been advised by experts in both running and technology, helping ensure that we deliver the best product possible. And now, three years and countless solder burns later, we are ready to launch on Kickstarter and bring the Ghost Pacer to the world. Please back us today, and get the most effective and reliable workout partner the world has ever seen.\n- AR Bhatti (CEO of Ghost Pacer)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we prepare to deliver the Ghost Pacer, we are continuing to work very closely with our advisors who have delivered products like the Hololens and Emotiv headset.

The generosity of our backers has encouraged us that many share our values and vision, and want to help us transform the justice system through free technology. So, we are setting a stretch goal of $50,000. Prisons are still on lockdown due to COVID-19. Your contributions will fund free letters for 4,000 families over the next three months. Thank you for your support.\nWhat is Ameelio?  \nAmeelio is a nonprofit technology company committed to transforming prison communications. Through free letters, postcards, and video calling, we're supporting meaningful connection between incarcerated people and their loved ones outside. Our vision is to disrupt the captive prison telecommunications industry, decouple incarceration and profit, and reduce recidivism. \n\nAs of May 15, 2019, Ameelio Inc, EIN 84-1800611 is a registered nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization based in Connecticut, USA. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n Ameelio\u2019s work intersects the two issues most central to the public consciousness right now: COVID-19 and criminal justice reform. Prisons are on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19, and incarcerated people are more isolated than ever. 95% of Americans support criminal justice reform. Supporting human connection to reduce recidivism is the first step towards a more rehabilitative justice system. We are an innovative solution for this historic moment.\nN.B.

Continue as guest.\"\nPROBLEM\nThe $1.2 billion prison communications industry generates obscene profits (51% margin for Securus, 2015) by charging extortionate prices to the incarcerated and their loved ones. Families report spending up to $500 a month to stay connected to their loved ones inside. A 15-minute phone call runs as steep as $25.\nWhy? Exclusive contracts leave prison telecommunications companies unchecked by competition: former FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn called the industry \u201cthe clearest, most glaring type of market failure I\u2019ve ever seen as a regulator.\u201d \n\n\n\nPoverty and incarceration are bound in a vicious cycle. Over 50% of incarcerated people had no income in the 8 years preceding their arrest; four years post-release, around 50% of formerly incarcerated people are still without income. Industries like these entrench this cycle. One in three families with incarcerated loved ones is forced into debt (by $13,000, on average) by the costs of maintaining contact.\nThis is a social and moral disaster.\n\nSOLUTION\n  We\u2019re outcompeting profit-driven telecommunications providers with better, cheaper solutions that seek to serve, not exploit, the incarcerated and their loved ones.\n\nLETTERS FOR FAMILIES\nThrough our web and mobile app, users can send free letters and photos to any incarcerated person in the U.S. criminal justice system. We\u2019re removing financial barriers to contact between incarcerated people and their loved ones to build community and lift financial burdens from loved ones of the incarcerated. \n\nPLAY\n\nRichard Watkins of Emerge CT, a New Haven based nonprofit, discussing the importance of receiving letters while incarcerated.\n\nLETTERS FOR ORGANIZATIONS\n  Closing the revolving door of recidivism requires coordinated reentry support. Letters for Organizations, a paid add-on to Letters, connects incarcerated people who are nearing their release dates with organizations providing support in finding employment, housing, healthcare, legal support, and more.\nCONNECT: VIDEO CONFERENCING\nThe closest substitute for in-person contact, Ameelio\u2019s video conferencing platform will connect incarcerated people with their loved ones, lawyers, educational and telehealth resources, and more \u2014 for free. We have secured our first partner facility. By 2021, we will have launched the nation\u2019s first free prison video conferencing platform.\nMaintaining contact with family members and loved ones during a period of incarceration is essential, especially now during the pandemic, and even more so for juvenile offenders\u2026 Video visits can help provide an important emotional connection, and sense of normalcy during these very unusual and trying times. \n\u2014  Former CT Department of Corrections Commissioner, Rollin Cook\n\nPLAY\n\nIMPACT\nSince our launch just three months ago, we\u2019ve sent more than 22,000 letters to over 1,000 correctional facilities in the U.S. We have over 5,500 users in 49 states and 29 countries. Our growth has been completely organic. \nBut our growth statistics cannot capture our impact. Countless users have reached out to thank us and describe Ameelio\u2019s impact on their lives:\nI can't tell you how much difference your organization has made for me and my loved one\u2026 my LO gets one 15min call per day... how can you keep a father-child relationship strong with that? it rips families apart... you have been able to help... it means a lot... thanks again.    \u2014 Steven\nThank u for everything it really helps cause money is so tight and I can\u2019t afford stamps. I'm choosing stamps to talk to my husband or my heart meds that are expensive. I don't have insurance.     \u2014 Savannah\nWHAT ARE YOU FUNDING?\n100% of our revenue from this campaign will fund free letters for families impacted by incarceration. A pledge of just $100 will fund one family's letters to their incarcerated loved one for an entire year. By supporting our work, you're directly supporting families impacted by incarceration, and committing to building a more humane justice system.\nWHO'S BEHIND AMEELIO? \nWe're a team of over 50 engineers, students, and designers. Some of us have personal experience with the justice system. But most importantly, we're people who believe that everyone experiencing incarceration should be able to stay connected to their loved ones. \nUzoma Orchingwa, Ameelio\u2019s co-founder and CEO, is a P.D. Soros Fellow and student at the Yale Law School. His interest in criminal justice reform is rooted both in his childhood experiences, and in his desire to eliminate financial and social barriers that entrench cycles of poverty. He became passionate about the problem of prison telecommunications while pursuing his MPhil in Criminology as a Gates Scholar at the University of Cambridge. \nGabriel Saruhashi, co-founder and CTO, is a senior at Yale College, where he studies Computer Science and Psychology. He has experience working as a Software Engineer at Facebook and Product Manager Zippi (YC S\u201919), and is passionate about building technology that serves populations historically overlooked by innovators.\nPLAY\n\n\n\nSUPPORTERS\n\nPRESS\nYou can learn more about us on Tech Crunch, Fast Company, Business Insider, Trend Watching's Innovation of the Day, The Washington Post. \n\nWant to know where we're getting our stats?

Our body and home care products come in a bundle that includes a dispenser and powder refill doses that are both fully recyclable. An important fact of our product in terms of sustainability is that to avoid producing more plastic than it is already on our planet, we\u2019ve chosen to manufacture our dispensers out of 100% recycled single-use plastic bottle waste.\nSustainable materials\nEQUA CARE has been designed in a sustainable way with the full product life-cycle in mind, from the bottle production, packaging, and formula development. We chose recycled plastic as a long-term alternative solution to the glass material.\n\nWhen researching the carbon footprint of different materials, we found out that recycled PET is the most efficient option for body and home care products, since no new materials need to be produced in the process. Our dispenser creates 4 times less carbon footprint than a glass bottle would from the production and transport. More about materials\u2019 efficiency and their carbon footprint here: www.ecolizer.be\n\nAnother reason for not using glass is that it can break and therefore be unsafe, especially in the shower area.\nSustainable Distribution\nDistribution is an entire part of EQUA CARE.

I am an urban planner, architect, illustrator, painter and conceptual artist.  \nArtist Tom. Schlegl and his (Trump-like) Statue of Liberty (2019)\nIn the time of the Corona virus, my architectural work has completely stopped. The horrors around the world prompted me to start creating a fairy tale called The Invincible Seven. A fairy tale about a virus that changed the world. This story is now finished and it is here in front of you.\nStarting point  \nThe world is increasingly dominated by pride, greed, lust, wrath, gluttony, envy and sloth. People are neglecting their ethical values. One day they wake up in the middle of deadly pandemic, from which there is no escape. The virus plunges humanity into a giant crisis\u2026\nPerhaps the virus is not a curse at all, but a gift from God? Because of it, many began to realize that they could be better than the vampiric system of capitalism. The virus opened the door to a new society for us. A society that works in solidarity and cooperation. A society that will take care of the common good, for all people and all nature, animate and inanimate.\nWhat kind of society we will form is not a question of tomorrow, but a question of today.\nThe Invincible Seven tells the story of how the world can be different from the one in which our children are currently growing up.\nBook Trailer \nAt the top of the city of Babylon, seven giant chimneys rise into the dark sooty sky. Night and day, fire erupts from the chimneys, creating seven majestic pillars of smoke. Because they are so colorful, the townspeople of Babylon adore the mighty pillars of smoke.\nOne day there was a sudden flash and thunder. Annoyed by the pillars, mighty lightning strikes them. The lightning strike is so violent that little billows of smoke are separated from each chimney. Because the billows of smoke are incandesced by the lightning, they cannot return to the majestic smoke pillars.\nIn order not to extinguish too quickly, they merge into a small column of smoke. They want to see how far the mighty smoke pillars reach into the sky and what is burning at the top. So they start to climb\u2026\nWhat is up there and what happened will remain a mystery for now...\nIllustrations\nThe book is entirely new in the field of illustrated books. For me, this book is like an architectural structure - by turning it, the reader will have a special experience. Its design reflects the author's architectural approach, where the illustrations blend into each other in an original way. You will enjoy looking at 17 inspiring handmade illustrations, which are a pleasure to study for parents and children alike.\nWho is the book for? \nThis educational story is suitable for children age of three and older. It is suitable for all those who want to change the world.\nIt might be a little scary for a toddler. But that is not a problem, because your toddler will grow up. The book will be waiting for him.\nTechnical data about the book\nThe book is 32 pages long. The format is 22.4 x 29.0 mm (8.81 \"x 11.42\"). It is printed on 170 g satin paper. It is a hardcover, sewn with thread. For now, it will be available in English and Slovenian. As a quality artwork, it is ideal as a gift.\nTimeline\n1st July 2020 - the start of the campaign on Kickstarter\n1st August 2020 - in case of a successful campaign, the book goes to print immediately\n20th August 2020 - the book is compressed\n30th August 2020 - the book is sent to your address\nAbout the author  \n\nTom Schlegl is an architect and urban planner. He has shown his talent for drawing and painting from an early age. Although he focused professionally on urbanism and architecture, fine arts remained his true love and with them he expresses his view of life and the world in which we live. In addition to occasional painting exhibitions and performances (for example the famous Trump statue that went viral in August 2019), the author has also been regularly publishing his critical caricatures in Zarja, Slovenia's leading weekly magazine.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks to this project.

Then we figured out that nobody speaks on the phone these days and messengers with emojis and GIFs rule the world... and memes of course.  \n \n         Unlike your regular phone, this device does not need a cellular network or a SIM card to work because it creates its own wireless network and communicates with other Chatter devices you\u2019ve paired it with.\nIt uses the so-called \u201cLoRa\u201d low-power wide-area network technology in order to send text messages, emojis, memes, and GIFs. \nChatter uses a publicly-available set of frequencies that are allocated for use cases like this one.\nThe messages you send to other Chatter devices are encrypted and are not passing through an internet service provider so you can share as many secrets as you want with your friends (maybe we should\u2019ve programmed a pinky swear button). \nThis device is not a replacement for your regular phone and has the range of an average walkie talkie - around 1 - 7km depending on the surrounding area (concrete buildings and basements are usually not a good spot for getting a good range with this thing) but it can prove useful in certain situations.\n\nThe main purpose of Chatter is education and showing people that you can communicate free and remotely without big corporations and the internet.\n What you\u2019ll learn: \nWhat you can do with it:\nText your friends for free\nLoad custom emojis and memes on the device (you don\u2019t want to be a normy, this thing needs to be updated regularly)\nCode a jumping dinosaur game for your Chatter \nPlay the preloaded snake game on it\nWant to know more about Chatter? Click here.\nSTEM Box #6: Clockstar - Build & code your own smartwatch\nWith this kit, we want to show you how to make and code your own smart wearable device. \n \n         Clockstar is equipped with a dual-core ESP32 microcomputer and has Bluetooth low energy and Wi-Fi onboard.\nIt connects to your phone using our mobile app and can mirror your smartphone\u2019s notifications to its 128x128 TFT color display. \nClockstar is also equipped with a gyroscope, accelerometer, and a magnetometer that can be used for precise motion tracking.\n\n         The watch uses machine learning to recognize and memorize different movements that you can assign to trigger certain actions.\n\n         For example, you can train your Clockstar to play/pause your phone\u2019s music app whenever you perform the floss dance.   \n What you\u2019ll learn: \n\n\nWhat you can do with it:\n Check the time (yes, it actually shows time!)\nConnect it to your smartphone and mirror notifications \n Control the media app on your phone with your smartwatch\n Use machine learning to detect when you do a certain Fortnite dance and automatically send a laughing-crying emoji to one of your friends\nCode the watch to count the number of steps you make every day\nPlay the built-in Tetris game on your watch (do this only if you\u2019re really bored)\n Connect the watch to the internet and interface it with our other IoT products such as Spencer or Wheelson\n Want to know more about Clockstar? Click here.\nYes! Gift your loved one the gift of learning!\nOur STEM boxes can be delivered every three months to yourself or straight to the lucky recipient :) \nYour loved one will be reminded of you for a long time with fun electronics projects delivered to their door every three months.\n For kids, adults, and everyone in between \nCircuitMess STEM Box is for the curious minds of kids (ages 11 and up)  and adults interested in electronics, coding, and technology.\nWe\u2019ve done some research and here are the most common buyers of our educational kits.\n1) A caring parent that wants to teach their kids something new\nWhen the kids ask him if they can play Fortnite now, he asks \u201cwhat\u2019s Fortnite?  \n2) An adult who knows nothing about electronics and probably works as an accountant, but would really like to learn something new about the interesting world of technology. \n3) A child prodigy that is doing science and electronics experiments in his/her parent's garage all the time. \n4) A full-stack developer that spent 10 years behind a MacBook\nHe basically knows everything about computers, but he never saw what\u2019s inside a device  IRL.  \n STEM education is still not there, but STEM Box is here to change that \nSTEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education is crucial for everybody's future. Still, STEM education is not there yet.\nMost educational STEM products are not engaging enough for kids. They lack imagination, fun, and usability in children\u2019s daily lives.\nThat\u2019s why we designed a line of products that are going to teach you the skills of the future all while actually being fun to use. \nAll the cool kids are learning by doing!\nLearning about machines by reading a book is boring. STEM Box is going to teach you by doing something with your hands.\n CircuitMess Resources - our dedicated learning platform\nThis is a place for all our users to find tutorials, share their creations, exchange knowledge, and download apps and games other users have made.\nOur dedicated learning platform\n Learn how to code with CircuitBlocks - our unique coding platform \nCircuitBlocks is our graphical programming interface that helps newbies get into physical programming.\nWe really hate installations! That\u2019s why CircuitBlocks automatically makes sure all the necessary components and drivers are installed.\nIn CircuitBlocks, you code using puzzle-like blocks that represent logical steps your device can take.\nWhen the colorful puzzle blocks are placed, Arduino C code is automatically generated on the right side of the screen so that you can instantly see how your code would look in C!\nWe\u2019ve learned how to code and design electronic devices thanks to the internet and open-source technology.\nThus, we want to push our work back into the community. \nAll our products\u2019 software is fully open-source and available for you to download on our Github page.\nThe hardware schematics are also open-source and available online.\n So here\u2019s the plan: \nShipping costs\nPlease note that shipping is not included in the reward perks' prices.\nShipping will be charged in the pledge manager that will be sent to you after the campaign ends. \nThe amount will be determined depending on what you buy and your address.\nPlease check the table below for the shipping costs in various regions. \n\nWhat happens after I receive my Kickstarter STEM Boxes?\nAfter we fulfill our Kickstarter rewards, you will be able to continue receiving STEM Boxes by extending your subscription on our webpage?\nIf you do not wish to extend your subscription, you can do so. No commitment. \nThe story of CircuitMess\nWe are a team of young talented individuals that are designing and producing fun and educational electronic devices.\n We\u2019ve started in 2017 with our first product MAKERbuino that was successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter.  \nSince then, we\u2019ve launched our second product called Ringo (MAKERphone) and have sold over 15 000 devices to customers all over the world.  \n  We currently have 15 employees and are a small, but very ambitious, self-made business with lots of great ideas and big plans for the future. \nWe think technology is the future and everybody should understand it.\n        Help us build that future together!\nThank you!\nOur company was founded three years ago thanks to generous Kickstarter supporters just like you.\nThis wonderful experience allowed us to spread positive influence, open new jobs in our community, meet new people, and learn a lot.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Borna Bedi\u0107, Dora Ladika, Tea Bari\u0107, Tena Mar\u010dac, Matea Tepi\u0107, Doris Brala, Nikolina Dobrica, Erik Rudec, Emil Gaj\u0161ak, Robert Medvedec, Filip Budi\u0161a, Tomislav & Ana Car, Antonio Valenti\u0107, Fran Zekan, Matija Fu\u0107ek, Anton Premec, Luka Trava\u0161, Ante Medi\u0107, Dajgoro Labinac.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.\nAs seen on: ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving a hardware startup is hard work. \n\nMass production risks are real and we\u2019ve taken every precaution to prepare for them:\n\nWe\u2019ve developed 6 STEM Boxes in advance so that we are sure that we can fulfill our promises on time\n\n\nHired workers and helpers will be doing the production of STEM Boxes at our headquarters. We will directly control the manufacturing process and the quality of the finished kits\n\nWe already have certain experience with producing similar kits and a production line set up as we\u2019ve already successfully delivered a total of 15000 electronic devices to our customers all across the globe\n\n\nWe\u2019re a team of hard-working young technology enthusiasts living for what we do and believing in what we live for.\n\nWe promise we'll keep you updated about any issues that may arise.\n\nKeep making!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAll products included in CircuitMess STEM Box are made with durability, hackability, and the maker culture in mind. \nWe want to create new makers, tinkerers, future engineers and creators of any sort that are going to fix, modify, hack, and expand electronic devices instead of just throwing them away and buying a new one.\n\nWe think electronic waste is a huge problem and the main cause for this problem is the way modern consumers think and act. We're here to change that with CircuitMess STEM Box\nSomething else\nThe products that we will deliver to our customers in CircuitMess STEM Box can be interconnected and used in a different way when combined, which extends the possibilities and the lifetime of our products.\nFor example, our robotic autonomous car Wheelson can be paired with our educational game console ByteBoi so that you can use it as a remote controller for Wheelson.\nAlso, our DIY voice assistant Spencer can be connected to Clockstar in order to interface apps over the internet and trigger various IoT functions.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Give us some love\u2026 and coffee of course!", "descp": "You\u2019ll contribute to this project by giving us an extra shot of caffeine and support.\nWe love coffee, YUM.\nIn return, you get telepathic love and hugs.\nAlso, sharing our project on social media or with your friends costs nothing and helps our project A LOT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 79 or more", "title": "Single STEM Box -

It is a creative process developed during the period of limited activity and outings. The images question reality from a passive, restrained standpoint where the world is only as large as our view permits it to be.\nPhoto from the book \u201cWhile waiting for this to pass\u201d\n~ While waiting for this to pass [Dok smo \u010dekali da sve ovo pro\u0111e] is an upward view from the earth and memories, a view toward a segment of sky, calling for our exploration. The perceived flow of time can seem as a repetitive and continuous feeling of confinement and impaired movement.\n~ The things we didn\u2019t use [Stvari koje nismo koristili] is a return to the place and time we are confined to, the quarantine \u2013 a moment of reduced living conditions in which one searches for new meaning.\nThe next two volumes consist of photos taken in the period between 2016 and the beginning of 2020. They are reflective details of the Everyday, the situations and processes intrinsic to it. These photographic notes reference seemingly generic images, signposts of past emotions, with which we try to recall the world as it was (or as it is). The poetry of those times is transformed today, when we are contrived to consider that caring can mean isolation, and freedom of movement, a risk. Each part of the photobook inevitably provides us with an opportunity to take time to explore each frozen frame in its entirety and establish our own existence within the world.\nPhoto from the book \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\n~ I can\u2019t even remember who won [Vi\u0161e se ne sje\u0107am tko je pobijedio] is about a birthday celebration. It analyses the situational togetherness and camaraderie that can be interpreted as a kind of finished past tense; it\u2019s an album of habits that have since become an arena of questions on boundaries, risk, freedom.\n~ A place from previous tales [Mjesto o kojem sam ve\u0107 pri\u010dao] is a collection of photo-notes from various journeys. In these times we live in, the question arises: are these photo-notes of illusions, of some utopian time of freedom and movement, or a possible future?\nThis is my intimate journey I will continue to expand on, adding new segments to the open-ended structure of this collection. Each expansion should seamlessly connect to the rest, and strengthen the whole. \nSize comparison: An egg, \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\", A beer bottle (0,33l)\nAll four parts are made in the same format, with the same care: \nSIZE ~ 21x14.8 cm\nVOLUME ~ 36 pages\nPHOTOGRAPHS ~ From 21 to 25 in each volume\nINSIDE PAPER ~ Conqueror Connoisseur 100% cotton, Soft White, 110g\nCOVER PAPER ~ Keaykolour 100% Recycled, Particles Snow, 300g\nBINDING ~ Hand-bound with a simple white seam down the middle\nLANGUAGE ~ Croatian, with English translations on the last page of each volume.\nHand-bound with a simple seam down the middle\nDetail of the seam\nThe purpose of this campaign\nMy wish is to offer a unique experience where my journey intertwines with yours while you explore the photobook as it connects with your own story. The photograph is only part of the journey. How it is printed and bound together, is another key part. \nCurrently all volumes are printed digitally, but my plan is to have the final collection done in offset or digital offset, depending on the amount of people supporting the project. I have chosen what would most appropriately suit this intimate exposure and new relationship I form with you through this creation. My wish is to print 100 special editions of the four-part photobook.\nThe photobook collection in space\nAbout the photographer\nMy name is Karlo \u010cargonja. I was born in Rijeka in 1987 and I\u2019ve been doing photography since high school.\nIn 2013 I went to one of Sa\u0161a Kralj\u2019s photography workshops and have since educated myself in photography by way of reading and researching the industry, while attending other, relevant workshops. In 2014, Tod Papageorge, an esteemed professor at Yale University, USA, was chosen as the lead judge in the selection process for the Rovinj Photodays, which is why I\u2019ve decided to enter the contest and was later chosen as one of the finalists in the international competition. That same year I mentored, along with Sa\u0161a Kralj and Dalibor Talaji\u0107, the Multimedia workshop as part of the 6th edition of the International Photography Festival Organ Vida. I\u2019ve been a member of the Creative Cluster KOMBINAT since its inception and have launched Talks about Photography as part of one of its first big projects. They are now held monthly in the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rijeka.\nI would like to give a big thanks to my friends, without whom this campaign wouldn\u2019t be possible:\nCyrille Cartier, Goran Fer\u010dec, Tomica Grubi\u0161a, Sanda Hunjak, Sa\u0161a Kralj, Ivona Milo\u0161, Japanski Premijeri, Sara Salamon, Anja Su\u0161anj, Ivan Vranji\u0107.\nRewards:\n ~ Postcards ~ \nPostcards can function as a pair or separately\n ~ Photobooks ~ \n\"While waiting for this to pass\" photobook\nA spread from \"While waiting for this to pass\"\n\"The things we didn\u2019t use\" photobook\nA spread from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\"\n\"I can\u2019t even remember who won\" photobook\nA spread from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\n\"A place from previous tales\" photobook\nA spread from \"A place from previous tales\"\n ~ Poster set ~ \nA set of four posters\nIf you don't have room for all four, you can hang up just one\n ~ Fine Art print,13x20 cm ~ \nA photo from \"The place from previous tales\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"The place frome previous tales\"\nA photo from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\nA photo from \"While waiting for this to pass\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"While waiting for this to pass\"\nA photo from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\"\n ~ Fine Art print, 20x30 cm ~ \nA photo from \"A place from previous tales\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"A place from previous tales\"\nA photo from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\nA photo from \"While waiting for this to pass\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"While waiting for this to pass\"\nA photo from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\"\n ~ Handmade wooden frames~ \nEvery frame is carefully measured...\n...painted...\n...put together...\n...and finished.\nFrame detail\nFrame detail", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is no risk in investing your resources into this project!

What if you could do everything for them, in less than 15 minutes a day?\n\nWe have recently opened discussions with a U.S. based television producer to develop a \"Superpower Your Kids\" broadcast special for PBS. It\u2019s a long way to go before it is a) green-lit, and b) runs, but it\u2019s the key first step and very exciting!\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve all got our kids at home during this crazy isolation time we\u2019re living through. As parents, we want to engage with our kids, inspire, teach and help them. But sometimes we run short on ideas, low on energy, and could use a little help.\n\n\nTeach your kids a single new thing each day through Lesson Games, taking as little as a minute and no more than 15. These mini lessons are designed like a flexible syllabus and presented with some professorial tricks to make them more fun and to better stick. This system uses a proven, scientific approach--including techniques used by Nobel Prize winners--to teach and empower young children. Take a big, complicated thing to learn and break it down into manageable, bite-sized pieces, scaled to whatever each child can handle...and enjoy. Because this is about playing first (in an educational way) and the learning is a powerful side effect!\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\nThis project is LIMITED EDITION. At the moment, there are no plans to publish this book for anyone beyond the backers on Kickstarter during this campaign. So this may be YOUR ONLY CHANCE to get Superpower Your Kids!\n\n\u201cA new approach to inspiring a love of learning in young children\u2026 Dr Charney borrows techniques used by Nobel Prize winners and his approach as a university professor and creates a system suitable for fun, engaging \u201clessonlets\u201d with kids\u201d -Christine C,, parenting and lifestyle columnist \n\u201cWhen I first discovered Prof Noah Charney's forthcoming book and app, Superpower Your Kids, I couldn't help but be excited. I mean, lockdown is definitely showing me flames and it made me realize that I do not have the capacity to sufficiently educate my kids, while doing a full day of work AND looking after our home, all at the same time. Prof Charney's book basically teaches you skills that enables you to school your kids in just 15 minutes per day. How rad?!\u201d -Luchae W., parenting blogger, My Spreadsheet Brain \n\u201cParents need and deserve this book.\u201d -Lea M., family therapist, mother of 4, author of Connect to Your Teenager \n\"What does a best-selling author do during quarantine? He writes the book he wasn\u2019t allowed to during normal time.\" -Thrive Global\nMy name is Noah Charney. I\u2019m a professor, presenter, columnist and best-selling author of more than a dozen books. Most importantly, I\u2019m a father, but in this case the professor, TV presenter and author parts come in handy.\nFor years, I\u2019ve been preparing a book based on a unique approach I have to teaching my young daughters. This time of self-isolation, when we are all at home with our kids and could use a little inspiration, led me to write it now and make it available to all, as quickly as possible.\nThe result is Superpower Your Kids: A Professor\u2019s Guide to Teaching Children Everything in Just 15 Minutes a Day.  It\u2019s a handbook for proactive parents, unlocking a new way to approach teaching at home: as a game. Each new game teaches your kids a new miniature lesson, a \"lessonlet.\" And each lesson, once learned, gives your kids a new superpower. These superpowers come through a combination of knowledge and empowerment which is the result of attention from you parents while you play games with your kids.\n\nNoah has written for, or been featured in, these fine publications.\n\nMy superpower is that I\u2019m a Dad who knows how to teach and to make the act of learning feel easy, painless, even fun. I practice with my kids every day. This book will help you do the same.\n\n\nCorona Time has pushed me to write Superpower Your Kids publish it quickly\u2014hence this being self-published, which I normally do not do, as my dozen-plus books have been published by major houses and have been international best-sellers. But traditional publishers simply could not turn around a book quickly enough for it to come out during this time of isolation, which is ideal for getting started with your kids. \nSuperpower Your Kids and make this isolation time count by starting a new, empowering learning tradition that you can carry forward throughout their childhood. Kick off a lifetime love of learning. Give your kids a gift a day\u2014knowledge that will empower them and bring you and your kids closer.\n\n\n\nSuperpower Your Kids on Instagram\nSuperpower Your Kids on Facebook\n\n\n\nSuperpower Menu: Over 365 Suggested Activities\nThe Rules of the Lesson Game\nThe Superpower Toolbox\nThe Preview \u2013 Engage \u2013 Review System\nThe Magic of 15 Minutes (or Far Less)\nThe Most Important Lesson in Your Child\u2019s Life Comes in Kindergarten: Cultures of Early Childhood Education\nSuperpowers for Parents\nTeaching Styles: American vs European and Getting the Best Out of Both\nTips for Multilingual Families or Learning New Languages\nHow to Travel with Your Children: Tips for Car Rides and Holidays\nHow to \u201cTravel\u201d with Your Children While Self-Isolating\nThe Power of Boredom: Why Letting Your Kids Get Bored Sometimes is Great for Them\nLeveling Up Your Superpowers\nMaking Memories: Integrating the Quantified Self\nTotally Legit \u201cCheats\u201d\n Bonus essays by Dr James Charney (the author\u2019s dad, a child psychiatrist) and Dr Diane Joy Charney (the author\u2019s mom, a professor at Yale University)\n Illustrations and design by Urska Charney (the author\u2019s super-wife)\nAnd much more! \n\n\n\nUrska Charney (the superwife/supermom) will design and illustrate the book, to increase its cuteness quotient.

So if you read about lesson game #247 (maybe learning to yoyo), and you try it with your kids, you can press a button on your eBook reader screen and your device will magically open the app and already know that you're doing lesson game #247 (fierce yoyo-ing), so you can just upload a photo of your kid \"walking the dog\" (level up #3) and you're good to go! At least, that's the plan.\nThe App will not contain any of the explanatory text that appears in the book, so you'll need the two together for your superpowers to fully unlock!\n\n\n\nMore About the Author\nDr Noah Charney is a professor of art history specializing in art crime and the internationally best-selling author of more than a dozen books. Born in New Haven, in the US, he has lived in Europe for the past two decades, and settled down in Slovenia, where he lives with his wife, two daughters and a hairless dog named Hubert van Eyck. Noah presents on television (with appearances on CBS, BBC and also here, Discovery, History, Nat Geo and more) and he writes regularly for numerous major publications, including The Guardian and The Washington Post.\nTo read more about him and his work, click here.\nTo read some of Noah's published articles, click here.\n\nNoah appears on TV as a host or guest expert, on these fine channels and others.\n\nSome of Noah's books, which have been published in more than a dozen languages and have been best-sellers in five countries.\n\nBut mostly he\u2019s a Dad trying to give his kids all he can, all his love and as much love for learning as possible. His kids totally have superpowers\u2026and yours do, too. He\u2019s here to help you help them to level up and expand their superpower repertoire!\n\nNoah in action at a TEDx event\n\n\nIf you want to see him speaking, here's a clip from CBS:\n\nAnd if you want to see him teaching, here's a talk he gave at the Dallas Museum of Art recently:\n\nThank you for your support and I hope that this will inspire a lifetime of learning through Lesson Games and superpowers!\n\n\nWait, are you really still reading? Awesome. So if you're interested, here is a short sample section from Superpower Your Kids, to give you a sense of the style and approach, as it includes an example of the Lesson Game in practice!\n\n...\nThese learning activities have no set rules per se, but more guidelines on how to keep the experience positive, enthusiastic, casual and un-forced. That goes both ways: don\u2019t force your kids and don\u2019t force yourself, as parents.\nI have a very mild obsessive streak in me that keeps me productive, but I can see how it could tip into compulsive behavior that would slow me down. For instance, I cannot check email without responding immediately to everything in my inbox. Not to do so, to put off responding, makes me nervous. This is why I check email only once or twice a week (I get a lot of emails commenting with enthusiastic curiosity about the line at the bottom of my email template apologizing for my slow replies because I only check email twice a week). I map out projects and work packages in my weekly planner notebook and have empty squares next to each. I cannot bring myself to turn the page to the next week unless the squares are checked off, meaning I\u2019ve done what I portioned myself to do that week (there\u2019s a chapter in this book about how these eccentricities have actually made me more productive, and you\u2019re welcome to borrow them).\nI mention these quirks because you need to know what works best for you, to make teaching your kids feel manageable and never like work. You\u2019ve already got enough work at, well, at your work. Home time should feel relaxing and fun whenever possible. So, knowing myself, I do not map out what I want to accomplish with my kids week to week, much less day to day. That would make me nervous and prompt me to push the kids to fulfill specific lessons, when in fact I want to allow them to guide what we learn about together. For this reason, I prefer to keep a long master-list\u2014the Superpower Menu\u2014in which I put all the ideas I get for mini lessons, our lessonlets, and then I usually don\u2019t even refer to it. I like to know that it\u2019s there, but I do not want to feel chained to its content, and least of all to a certain order. I only find myself referring to it when I can\u2019t think of anything off the top of my head, and I\u2019ll dip into the list for inspiration. I\u2019ll also use it to try to find cross-referencing lessons, one that would logically and inspirationally follow another, and string them together.\nFor example, I watched the classic film, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, with my girls. They loved it, especially the \u201csubstitutiary locomotion\u201d song and the great battle scene at the end when the friendly witch (played by a young Angela Lansbury) successfully animates a museum full of suits of armor which proceed to chase an invading Nazi squadron from a seaside English town. It\u2019s a magical moment (literally and figuratively) and the girls were totally into it. This led me to play the Lesson Game in a number of directions inspired by what they were interested in.\n\u00b7 We talked about how to say \u201csubstitutiary locomotion\u201d in a less fancy way (\u201creplacing movement\u201d), and why a \u201clocomotive\u201d is an older word for a train.\n\u00b7 The film features a variety of British accents including London Cockney, a polite \u201creceived pronunciation\u201d and a sort of gangster slang. We talked about various accents in English and which they find more difficult to understand and which they could imitate.\n\u00b7 We talked about the suits of armor from various time periods and then browsed through a book we have of arms and armor. We looked at horse armor, described what it felt like to wear armor, how it was put on.\n\u00b7 The \u201csubstitutiary locomotion\u201d spell can make inanimate objects move around on their own, as the good witch explains in the film. We talked about the difference between animate and inanimate objects. I listed things and asked my girls to tell me if they were animate or inanimate: a fish, a shoe, our dog, a hot dog, a suit of armor, a knight in armor, a photograph of a knight in armor. I was trying to be tricky, because once I saw that they grasped that animate objects were living and capable of movement, I pulled a fast one asking about a photograph of something that is animate (the photograph being inanimate). I also played with words to be tricky and playful (our dog is animate, a hot dog is inanimate).\n\u00b7 The film has some silly Nazi bad guys (not the scary kind) but we talked a bit about who they were, why they spoke German, and that there had been a war a long time ago\u2014Second World War history lite, to gently inform but not over-complicate or upset a 5-year-old.\n\u00b7 There\u2019s a great scene on Portobello Road in London, where the characters search for the second half of a torn book of magic. I lived in London and had been there many times, so I told them about the antiques market there, we watched a walk-through video of the market and I asked what they would be interested in looking for, if they were there.\n\u00b7 The film has a scene in which the children list their favorite foods, and the list sounds intriguing but confusing to non-British kids: bubble and squeak, sausage and mash, toad in the hole. So we looked up what these dishes were and cooked some for ourselves.\nThose are seven mini lessons (which we\u2019ll call \u201clessonlets\u201d because the word \u201clesson\u201d unfortunately has the connotation of work) that emerged from the fun of watching one film. Suddenly you\u2019ve got your whole week\u2019s-worth of Lesson Games laid out for you in one go. On the first night, you watch the movie together and talk about it afterward, reviewing what you saw and what stood out. Then each of the following six days, you pick one of the lessonlets above to play with together. There could be infinitely more of them, but this is to give an example of how a web of ideas can emerge from each activity.\nEach of these lessonlets gives your kids a new power. Some of these powers are as simple as learning a new word. But don\u2019t for a moment think that learning a new word is anything short of a powerful tool. Think how impressed your 7-year-old\u2019s teacher would be if she throws in the words \u201csubstitutiary\u201d and \u201clocomotion\u201d in conversation. Each new word opens up a window in your child\u2019s imagination palace, letting in light and allowing them to see out in a way they never could before they learned that word. The world around them becomes fractionally clearer. The next time they encounter the word they will not glaze over and ignore it but understand it. The various accents that they hear in different films will not just be funny ways people talk but will carry meaning and help identify where the speaker comes from.\nWhat\u2019s your newest superpower, you might ask your kids after each lessonlet: \u201cI cut vegetables with a knife. I can build a snow man. I can count to ten in Chinese. I can whistle. I can play foosball. I know what \u201clocomotion\u201d means. I know the capital of America. I know the world\u2019s fastest fish. I know why the sky is blue. I can bake cookies. I know the traditional iconographic schema employed by Flemmish \"primitives\" in 15th century proto-Realist paintings like Jan van Eyck's triptych, Adoration of the Mystic Lamb. You name it, anything is possible!\n\n\nOkay, that's really it for now. Thank you for your interest and support. May your kids have the superest of superpowers and may you all be healthy and happy...\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks whatsoever with this project. The book is 75% written, and so just needs finishing touches, an edit and design and layout. We\u2019re doing it all in-house (the author\u2019s wife is doing design, layout and illustrations, the author\u2019s mom is the editor) and the plan is to publish via Amazon KDP, which means that the printing and posting will be automated and should work smoothly and efficiently, even in Corona Time (which is why we\u2019re avoiding traditional printers, as most are closed). I suppose the only real risk is in a delay in getting the book to you because of Corona Time slowdowns. But there\u2019s a reason we have this very low Kickstarter target. We don\u2019t need an injection of capital to launch a new product. This is just a way for you to get a super-discounted price on pre-orders of this book. We\u2019re hoping the whole book will be finished by the end of the campaign and so we can upload it and have it sent out to you very soon after the campaign has ended.

Simple rules of movement and firing include all the most important features of the aircraft of the time: speed, agility and firepower. Battles are lead at five different altitudes, so there are differences between the planes in terms of climbing and descending speeds. Some specific characteristics were also taken into account, such as gyroscopic effect, which gives some aircraft exceptional maneuverability. Wind influences movement and the position of the sun affects firing accuracy, so these factors are also taken into account. A plane under attack can escape into the clouds and thus hide from the enemy. Most of the pilots are average, but there are also rookies and aces.\nThe game contains as many as 54 plane pieces belonging to three countries: France, Germany, and Great Britain. Each country has 6 types of aircraft (3 pieces each) from different war periods.\nIn the initial period of WW1, most planes were single-engine two-seaters whose primary purpose was to observe and photograph enemy positions and background, but they also dropped bombs and fired at enemy aircraft when meeting in the air. As early as 1915, specific aircraft with special tasks appeared: fighting, reconnaissance, and bombing. Accordingly, there are three basic types of warplanes in this game, and their characteristics can be described as follows:\nFIGHTERS are small, fast, and agile single-seaters. They can accelerate rapidly and they are armed with fixed machine guns that shoot straight forward in the axis of the aircraft. There are exceptions, however - two-seaters with additional dorsal machine guns (Bristol F.2 Fighter and Hanriot HD.3).\nSCOUTS are single-engine two-seaters, their primary task is to photograph enemy positions, which is why they have cameras. They also have fixed and dorsal machine guns, so they can fight as well, but they can't accelerate abruptly. They can also carry one bomb.\nBOMBERS have two engines and carry two or three bomb markers. They also have flexible nose and dorsal machine guns, which can only be used defensively.\nThe expansion includes aircraft from other countries participating in the war, a total of 27 types (54 pieces).\nWORTH OF CERTAIN AIRCRAFT TYPES\nOn all control panels, in the upper right corner, there is a number that indicates the worth of that type of aircraft. In the basic game, all fighters have similar values (from 6,5 to 7,5), with the exception of two extremes, Airco DH-2 (6) and Fokker D.VII (8). In the expansion, there are some older types from 1914-5 which are worth much less.\nTo calculate the value, we made a formula that takes into account all the characteristics of the aircraft (in this game). Speed is an important factor, but agility is twice as important. Other characteristics of the aircraft (armament, gyroscopic effect, climbing speed, ...) were taken into account in an appropriate way. The results are quite realistic: the highest value is Fokker D.VII (8), followed by SPAD S.XIII, Sopwith Camel and Fokker Dr.I (7.5), while the worst are the slow Russian Mosca-Bystritsky Mbbis and sluggish Turkish Fokker D.I (4,5). For scouts and bombers, there is a worth for the empty aircraft and for the total value when carrying bombs (numbers in brackets).\nThese values do not affect the basic game, and they are used if you have the expansion. In some scenarios, you can choose a smaller number of planes with a high value or a larger number of those that have bad features (lower value). We believe that gamers will be interested in playing a game in which, for example, 8 Russian fighters try to protect the bombers from the attacks of 6 Austro-Hungarian fighters.\nAn Excel spreadsheet which contains the mathematical formulas we used can be downloaded from the webpage with the rulebook.\nTo make the basic game even more interesting, we have put together a rich list of goals and hopefully, all of them (or at least the majority) will be reached.\n #1 - $ 5 000 - Wooden sliders \u2713\nCardboard markers will be replaced with wooden cubes (60x red and 30x green)\n #2 - $ 8 000 - new aircraft: Br\u00e9guet 14 \u2713\n #3 - $ 12 000 - new aircraft: Sablatnig N.I \u2713\n #4 - $ 16 000 - new aircraft: Airco DH.9A \u2713\n #5 - $ 20 000 - 6th altitude level \u2713\n 5 additional altitude stands\n #6 - $ 25 000 - new aircraft: Voisin V \u2713\n#7 - $ 30 000 - new aircraft: AGO C.I \u2713\n#8 - $ 35 000 - new aircraft: Airco DH.1 \u2713\n#9 - $ 40 000 -  Double-sided board \u2713\n+ 6 ship-shaped Task Zones (transparent plastic foil)\n#10 - $ 45 000 - new aircraft: Hanriot HD.2 \u2713\n#11 - $ 50 000 - new aircraft: Rumpler 6B \u2713\n#12 - $ 55 000 - new aircraft: Sopwith Baby \u2713\nlink to PDF\nThe rules in this game are very clear, simple, and logical. Our basic principle - 'MCMD' (Minimum Complexity, Maximum Diversity) is fully complied with, for which we have received confirmation from several relevant people:\n\"... it says 'minimum complexity, maximum diversity', and he's right on 100%.\" - Dan Pancaldi\nOur original Triangle system for positioning and movement of the pieces is applied. Each rule is well and clearly explained and supported by an illustrated example.\n\"The Triangle Movement System gives a very organic feel of to the aircraft maneuvers.\" - Richard Martin\nTowards the end of the rulebook, the basic game modes and several scenarios are explained. There are short paragraphs that connect certain rules with historical and technical facts, which helps the player immerse into the role of a pilot of a combat aircraft from WW1.\nOn the last page, the entire manual is presented in an abbreviated fashion, which only confirms how simple the rules are, and at the same time, how they provide huge opportunities for the battle to develop in a dynamic, interesting and realistic way. Experienced gamers will probably be able to play the first game only on the basis of that shortened version, but we recommend that you read the manual fully.\n\"Now I was already familiar with their air gaming system so it made the transition to play easier. But if I didn\u2019t know the system already, I would have found the rules easy to understand and well laid out.\" - Robert Smith\nRulebook in other languages\nWe will do our best to provide rulebook translations to several languages in cooperation with backers. You can read more about it in update #9. For now, a translation into French, Spanish and Portuguese has been done and Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Polish and German has been agreed.\nThe whole series of Age of Dogfights games is intended as a simulation of pure aerial battles with fighters in the main role. For diversity, the kit features also the scouts and the bombers, whose primary battle goals are reconnaisance and bombing, while fighting with enemy aircraft is secondary.\nDOGFIGHT\nThis mode features only fighter planes, and also scouts in the role of fighters. The goal of the game is simple - shoot down as many planes as possible. This mode includes a scenario \"Intercept the General\".\nRECONNAISSANCE\nScouts have the lead role in this mode. The task is to reach the reconnaissance zone (Task Zone A, B, or C), to take photographs, and then return and leave the Combat Zone (in order to get the photo negatives to the airport). This mode includes a scenario \"Flying High\" scenario.\nBOMBARDING\nThis mode has two variants: zone bombing and bomber breakthrough.\nThe zone bombing variant is very similar to the reconnaissance mode.\nIn the bomber breakthrough variant, they have task to go through the entire Combat Zone and exit the opposite side of the board (in order to carry out strategic bombing). Scenario: \"Attack at Dawn\".\nCOMBINED MODE\nPlayers may arrange for the game to be played in combined bombarding-reconnaissance mode. First, the bombers should bomb the target zones. Afterwards, the scouts will photograph the results of the bombing.\nIn our games so far, we have never explicitly featured a solo mode, although some of them had all the prerequisites for that. We have to be honest and say that we have never played any other board game, nor have we read any of the rules in full (that is the reason for the originality of our games). Therefore, we are not sure how the rules for such a variant of the game should be written.\nHowever, our friend and collaborator Richard Martin will make sure that this game gets the rules for solo mode too. He has already suggested a version of the rules for solo mode, which will soon be tested (you can find the latest version HERE). Rules for solo play will be included in the game set.\nJudging by some relevant comments, this game can be very interesting even for only one player according to the already existing rules. Airplanes have different characteristics and you can always start a battle, say 3 against 3, to determine which type of airplane is better. Various scenarios are also possible, and they can be very interesting even if one player plays on both sides.\nDuring the First World War, airships and tied observation balloons played an important role in air combat. Barrage balloons were also widely used. From the ground, machine guns and cannons fired at the targets in the air ...\nAll these elements are part of the Expansion, as well as 27 new types of aircraft from 6 countries. The brochure describes additional rules for the new pieces. Is it feasible to attack with fast Italian planes on targets in the Austro-Hungarian background that is sheltered by barrage balloons and defended with strong anti-aircraft fire? Do the large and slow Russian bombers have a chance against German fighters? The mixed French-Serbian squadron returns from a task with low ammunition and encounters a strong Bulgarian patrol ... There are a total of 10 scenarios in the brochure and we believe that you will be able to immerse into the role of a squadron leader on an important task ...\nAs in our previous campaigns we have a First day gift. It is a set of 12 pieces (6 x 2) of Turkish planes with corresponding control panels in a separate box. Everyone who pays for one of the options (except $1 and $10) in the first 36 hours of the campaign will receive this gift ( \"Forsage\" first day lasts 36 hours! :) )\nYou have enough time to decide and pay for this game, which will give you a valuable reward.\nAfter that, this set of pieces will be able to be ordered through the pledge manager BackerKit for the price of $ 10.\nAdd-ons can be selected in a subsequent preorder campaign on BackerKit (pledge manager).\nAdditional board ($8)\nEstimated weight: ~0,65kg\nAn additional set of 3 board bi-fold segments with 4 board extensions and 6 task zones.\nThe board is designed in such way that it can be continued to any of the four sides, just by placing another board next to it. That way, a very large battlespace is formed (126x70cm or 140x63cm).\n\"Additional Aircraft Types\" ($30)\nEstimated weight: ~0,5kg\n40 new aircraft types (80 pieces and 40 control panels)\nWhen choosing the aircraft that will represent the countries participating in the First World War, we tried to choose the most important types from different periods of the war. The main game includes planes from Germany, France and Great Britain.\nThe main Expansion includes planes from Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, USA, Bulgaria (German planes), and Serbia (French planes). These countries had a much smaller number of aircraft types in use, so we chose only 5, 4, or 2 aircraft types for some of them.\nIn total, this basic game (18 types) + first day gift (6 types) with Expansion (27) and possible stretch goals (1 to 15) will possibly have as many as 66 different types of planes! That is more than enough to enjoy the game, but there are many more planes, especially from Germany, France and Great Britain that had a significant role in the war. It might be interesting for some gamers to try some of them in air battles, so we decided to optionally offer another game add-on that would contain various airplanes. You can read more about it in the Update #7 and Update #13.\nOur preliminary proposal was to feature 30 types of aircraft (fifteen each for Central Power and the Entente, with two pieces and a control panel for each type), but it will be increased to 40 types. There may be fighters, scouts, bombers, various prototypes and experimental aircraft among them. The planes with the most backers' votes will be represented.\n\"Important Aircraft Supplement\" ($24)\nEstimated weight: ~0,45kg\nBased on some suggestions, we are introducing another add-on where only the most important types of aircraft would be repeated, but in a larger number of 3 pieces per type. In that way, some larger air battles could be simulated, where the most common aircraft participated. The final list of types of aircraft that should be represented will be specified in a special update.\nA current proposal for the content is that the three countries (Germany, Great Britain and France) have 6 types of airplanes with 3 pieces each (54 aircraft pieces, 18 control panels and 30 altitude stands).\nThe planes would be: Fokker E.III, Albatros D.III, Albatros D.V, Fokker Dr.I, Fokker D.VII and Albatros C.III   //   Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Pup, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5, Bristol Fighter F.2, Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2, Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8   //   SPAD S.VII, SPAD S.XI, Nieuport 17, Nieuport 24, Morane-Saulnier AI and Nieuport 12. So, in total, this add-on will have 54 airplane pieces. There will also be altitude stands in the set, 5 of each height (30 in total).\nOttoman Empire aircraft ($10)\nEstimated weight: ~0,3kg\nA set of 12 pieces (6 x 2) of Turkish planes with corresponding control panels.\n\nThe first concept for a board game by the author Predrag Lazovi\u0107 was about air combat. It was Saratoga (designed 1993, released \u201896). This is where our original Triangle system for positioning and moving pieces came to life. In later years, a dozen games were created, mostly featuring modern jets.\nIn the desire to make a game with the emphasis on air battles, \"Dogfight\" was created. This game simulates aerial warfare during WW2. Age of Dogfights WW1 is the direct successor of these games.\nWe decided to make a whole series of Age of Dogfights games that will cover the period from the very beginning of air battles until today.\nLogically, the first in the series is a game that features WW1. In addition to the expansion offered during this campaign, we plan to make an expansion with aircraft from the 1920s soon. The rules would be the same, and the planes themselves very similar (though much faster) to the planes from WW1.\nThe next game will be Age of Dogfights: WW2. The rules will be similar but more advanced and adapted to newer planes. For example, 3 dice will be used for shooting and damage resistance of the planes will also be a factor (it is not the same whether you shoot at fragile \"Zero\", \"Betty\", etc. or at Spitfires, Messerschmitts, etc. or at robust Il-2, P-47, B-17 ...).\nThe third in a row will be the game Age of Dogfights: Transonic Era. For me as a big fan of aviation, this is the most interesting period. This game will include all transonic aircraft and the first few supersonic ones: F-11, F-100, F-102, Super Myst\u00e8re, and MiG-19. The rules will differ from the previous ones to reflect the progress: higher speeds, engine afterburner, air-to-air missiles and Mighty Mouse rockets, ...\nThe final game, Age of Dogfights: Supersonic Era will feature all supersonic aircraft from F-101 and Mirage III to F-18 and MiG-31 ... There will be a major expansion in which all Stealth aircraft will be represented, both existing and those in development.\nAll in all, we, as authors, have set ourselves the difficult task of preparing all these games with expansions and various additions in the future. This work will be a pleasure for us because we believe that the originality of our concept will attract a large number of gamers who will enjoy this and the subsequent games.\nAfter 4 successful projects on Kickstarter, we can say without restraint that we have never played any other board game except our own! That is the reason why our games are original and fresh in the world market. Airplanes and history have been our preoccupation since childhood, we have a large number of professional books and magazines, we study very seriously the period to which our wargames refer. We are extremely pleased that our passion and hobby has turned into a serious business. The Japanese print magazine Banzai dedicated the cover and seven more pages to us as authors and to our games. In that interview, we explained our motives and inspiration for creating games, and you can read it HERE.\nShipping fees from Serbia to other countries are quite high, so we will subsidize the costs by about 30%. We have favorable agreements with DHL and UPS and we plan to ship most of the packages through them, which means they will reach the recipient within a couple of days. We have provided \"friendly\" shipment status for EU member states, the USA and Japan. If the number of backers in the UK, Canada, Australia, and China is large enough, we will provide the same status for those countries as well.\nThe shipping price of each pledge depends on the country to which it is shipped and the weight of the package. The shipping fee will not be charged during Kickstarter, but only in pledge manager (BackerKit). That way, the shipping fee will be calculated after you complete your order (you may add various items then) according to the total weight of the order. The table shows the shipping fees:\nFor example, a single copy of the game Age of Dogfights: WW1 weighs approximately 1.6 kg, and the Expansion weighs about 0,5 kg. So, AoD + Expansion falls into the ''up to 2,5 kg'' category.\nAdd-ons section show the rough weights so you can estimate what the shipping costs will be if you purchase add-ons in the pledge manager.\nThis project is very important to us for the further progress of our small company. During the campaign, we will regularly publish updates related to stretch goals, possible add-ons, and other important topics. We are open to various suggestions and accept the possibility that we have missed some characteristics of certain types of aircraft and we will gladly adopt remarks that have a foundation.\n\n                   We will try to answer all questions, either as a reply to the comment or in the FAQ section or within some updates.\n\n                   We hope to have backers from all parts of the world, so we expect comments at different times of the day (during all 24 hours). We will post answers to questions and comments as soon as possible, but keep in mind that sometimes there will be a delay of several hours.\nWe believe that communication with backers will make this project better and more complete to the satisfaction of both us authors and the public.\n-", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fifth project already. We have gained a huge amount of experience during the previous projects and we have also expanded significantly our own production facilities.\n\nAs always, we put a low target for our campaign, because in our workshop we can produce small and medium series of any game. In case several thousand games need to be produced, we will hire associates who helped us produce over 3500 Tank Chess copies along with expansions.\n\nThis game is very easy to produce. It contains many elements, but for almost all of the cardboard ones, we already have tools for cutting. Plastic parts (stands) are very easy to manufacture. For a series of a few hundred games, the 3D printers we already have are enough, and for larger series, a plastic injection tool will be made. That tool is extremely simple, because one side is completely flat, and the other has only two protrusions.\n\nWe have set the deadline for the delivery of games in January 2021. As far as production is concerned, we are sure that it will be fulfilled, and we even believe it will be much earlier.\n\nThe shipping of various goods has become quite complicated in recent months due to the Covid pandemic. We are following the situation and adapting to the current circumstances. We have contracts with DHL and UPS and we believe that there will be no problems during the shipping phase of this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe game will be produced of high quality materials.

Our associates: Lucky Graf (printing house) and Alfaplast (print finishing) are small companies with which we have been cooperating for years. They suddenly got one big well-paid job that needs to be done urgently. They asked us if they should accept it because we had already ordered and paid for sheets to be made for the \"1920s\" aircraft expansion. Due to the long-term cooperation during which they also made concessions to us many times, we agreed that they should finish the job first and then continue to work on our sheets. In these times of crisis, we have to show solidarity, and I hope that the backers will not resent us for the fact that deliveries will be delayed a bit. We should get those sheets in the next few days, and then in our workshop, we\u2019ll manage the assembly and shipping in parallel."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Shipping \u2013 import taxes", "update_content": "We have to give a comprehensive answer to the questions related to taxes and \"EU friendly\" status, so we are posting an update about it.\n\nPrior to our first Kickstarter project (2016), we requested information from customs related to taxes (in the EU and other countries). The answer was that Serbia, as a candidate for EU membership, has signed an agreement with the EU according to which no fees are charged if the goods are produced in Serbia. That is why we had wrote that the project has EU friendly status. At that time, we had only about 40 backers from the EU, but still we sent all the games in one shipment to a company in Germany, which then sent packages to individual backers. However, the German customs have charged the import tax then! To our question why, we received the answer that this agreement between Serbia and the EU is non-binding, and that some countries respect it while some not always.\n\nFor our next project (Tank Chess), we sent the packages directly from Serbia to the backers. We used regular Mail (for small packages up to 0.5 kg), DHL and Post Export service. Post Export uses an agreement between the State Posts of different countries, and we are told that for shipments sent that way no taxes are charged. At that time, we had over 1000 backers from the EU. We have information that only a small percentage of them paid a fee \u2013 if the package went by regular mail or via DHL.\n\nIn the announcement of this project, we wrote that the status of EU friendly has been secured. We had two options: to send packages through a fulfillment company from Slovenia, that respects the agreement between the EU and Serbia. The second option was, if there weren't enough backers from the EU to make fulfillment service profitable, to send packages via Post Export. There were enough backers, but we found out that the agreement between Serbia and the EU has not been applied since January (and some countries even earlier), and that taxes are always charged when goods are sent from one company to another! When a package is sent to an individual, each customs office decides for each package individually whether to collect customs tax or not. That is why we send all shipments to the EU via Post Export directly to backers. We still don't have complete information on the number of cases in which customs duties have been collected.\n\nThe corona epidemic is the reason why now almost all countries charge regular and some even additional taxes, because a way is being sought to fill the budgets. Our friends from Serbia, who had their successful campaigns recently, decided to produce the games in China. They knew immediately that the taxes would have to be paid when the goods entered the EU, so they collected all the taxes in advance. We did not charge anything in advance, because we believed that no one would pay the fees, because we produce games in our workshop (in Serbia). We even took it upon ourselves to subsidize shipping fees by about 30%. We did not count on the fact that the shipping prices will be increased by 5.5\u20138.7 USD from January 1. In addition, the packages are much heavier than the original estimate, which is why we pay a much higher price than expected. Fortunately, at least we did not have any large unplanned costs in production.\n\nThis situation is new for both us creators and the backers. We are sorry that fees are charged, but, according to the data we have collected so far, this rarely happens. For the next project, we will have to seriously consider how to solve this problem in advance. We will also try to find a way to somehow compensate the fees that our backers had to pay."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Shipping status and support to our friends", "update_content": "We inform the backers that we have continued to send packages. From this week, we believe that we will send 150 packages per week.\n\nWe have announced in advance that we charge shipping fees slightly less (by 4\u201310 USD) than the actual. However, as of January 1, both Post Express and DHL have increased their prices. Depending on the weight of the package and the destination, the price increase ranges from 5.5 to 8.7 USD.\n\nOur estimation for the weight of the basic game (with transport package) was around 1.7kg, but the actual weight is 1.97kg. The increased weight is from many achieved stretch goals and better (and heavier) materials compared to the prototype. Because of this, some packages have moved to a more expensive shipping category. Due to all of the above, our shipping costs have increased a lot, but that is part of the risk that each of the creators accepts when starting their project.\n\nOn the accompanying documents with each package, we write much lower prices for both games and shipping fee. The reason is a daily limit in values that we can send packages. With a lower value for each package, we can send more in one day."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Production status and shipping", "update_content": "There was a short interruption in shipping.

We noticed some mistakes in prepress back in November and they were corrected immediately.

Our co-worker who printed the sheets did not notice it in time, so the sheet was printed with an error. A similar error occurred on one sheet on which the main expansion control panels were printed. Here, the inscriptions on the control panels for observation balloons have also been converted into a different font.

However, we wanted to follow the order by starting the Age of Dogfights series from the beginning.\n\nSince it is certain that we will send all AoD1 games during January and February 2021, we want to announce a campaign for Age of Dogfights: WWII (AoD2) in this update and invite backers to follow our further activities on that project.\n\nThe rules of the game AoD2 will be very similar to the rules for AoD1, with changes related to the newer aircraft (higher speed, better weapons, etc.). Because of this, the new game rules will be somewhat more complex, but on the other hand some elements will be simpler. For example, WWII aircraft did not use rotary engines (gyroscopic effect), and dorsal machine guns weren't used offensively (there will be fewer positions for offensive firing).\n\nThe rules of movement are basically the same, with some key improvements. The number of steps that an aircraft moves is still determined by the sum of its basic and the rolled number on a die. A novelty is introduction of four different blue dice with different range of numbers. Those are , , and die. The green die remains - (limited usage). This gives much more flexibility for aircraft movement."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "First packages", "update_content": "We are informing you that we sent the first small number of packages on Tuesday, December 29.

This innovative fermenter is set out to provide you with the tools for traditional fermentation that you can easily master.   \nGlass weight with a pressing spring holds down the veggies to make sure all the air bubbles caught in the jar can flow up. \nYou can pump out the excess air in the jar. Oxygen-free environment helps the good bacteria to thrive.\nMark the date of starting fermentation with built-in fermentation clock and let live organisms do their magic.  \nVeggie Fermenter keeps your ferment safe with the one way valve technology. This enables air to come out but not into your ferment.  \nIt forces the gas out once the pressure builds up. No risk of bottle explosion, no burping the jars needed! \nIt catches bad smells that form during the fermentation and efficiently neutralises them with active carbon felt filter positioned on the top lid. \nWith stackable top lids you can save space in your pantry by stacking the jars one on top of the other. Who doesn\u2019t need more space?   \nSUSTAINABLE\nPreserve the vegetables when they are in season and you can\u2019t keep up with them. With fermentation you can store them in the fridge for months. Making small batches of ferment is convenient because you can actually put vegetables and fruits directly from the garden to the fermenting jar. This is an important step to self-sufficiency. You can actually make sure you are never without important nutrients, even when food is not in season or you don\u2019t have access to the stores, etc.\nVEGGIE FERMENTER SIZES \nINCLUDES \nCOLORS \nREWARDS\nYou will choose the colors of the lids in a post-campaign survey! \nSTRETCH GOAL: $55.000\nTongs & pounder hybrid\nKitchen tool for adding the vegetables and pressing them down in the jar. When we reach the $55k goal, every Kefirko Veggie Fermenter will include this item.\n\nTIMEPLAN\nWHY WE NEED YOU\nDo you want to eat healthy food rich in good bacteria? Even more, do you want to eat food that is grown locally or in your own garden? And do you want to eat them all year long? With Kefirko Veggie Fermenter you are a step closer to being self-sufficient and to eating nutritious fermented foods that are prepared in your own home. To make this happen, you can play an integral role in the development. With your support we will be able to produce the molds that are needed to manufacture the final product.

We are confident that it will please active people all over the world.\n\nSHOPPING BAG\n\nEach shopping bag is made from a sustainable material that is produced of 4 recycled plastic bottles. We completed a small trial order with our sourced fabrics in China and Sweden, where we tested all processes to get ready for mass production.\n\nRUNMASK\n\nTransparency is one of your core values, and we want to be clear about the benefits and shortcomings of our RunMask.\n \nIt\u2019s important to clarify that no mask provides 100% protection against COVID-19. Also, the effectiveness of this particular mask has yet to be tested.\n \nStill, we did base on scientific research for the choice of the materials. As demonstrated by researchers from the Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago (USA), the combination of cotton with other fabrics, including synthetics, can effectively (70-80%) filter aerosol particles that could transmit the COVID-19. The RunMask is made from multi-layered cotton and polyester which ensures proper protection via electrostatic-based filtration. \n\nFurthermore, the RunMask can be used as a cover placed over a medical-grade as it has a compartment that fits a KN95 filter inside. This enhances protection and prolongs the filter\u2019s usable life if used correctly (right fit to the face).\n \nLast but not least, the design of the RunMask is ergonomic, size-adjustable, and weather-resistant, which makes it perfect for outdoor activities.\n\n2) Delivery\n\nGetting products delivered on time is a priority for us. We have years of experience in manufacturing, quality control, and logistics, and have successfully produced and delivered similar products in the past. Also, this is our fifth Kickstarter campaign, and are we confident that our backers will love it as much as our previous products.\n\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that there will be no delays in delivery due to the COVID-19 situation.

Our focus is to prevent spreading bacterias all over the places and that is the reason, that we've inventend Safepoint.\nTHE BACK STORY\nIn the past few months the world has shifted in a ways no one could have predicted. Covid-19 came by suprise and turned our lives upside down and in response to that we have become even more germ conscience then ever. In this hard times our top priority is to keep ourselves, our families, friends and all of the society healthy  and safe by staying home and abiding the instructions we have been given. But sometimes we just have to go out, if nothineg else we have to buy groceries and that is the time when we are highly exposed to germs and viruses.\nDo not let history repeat itself and do something to make a world a better place by being responsible. Take care. Use Safepoint.\nOur campaign starts in April. Hopefully it will finish successfully funded in May. In that case we will start the production in June. As our suppliers are on standby we hope to start the first shipments beginning of July.\nWe can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make a world a safer place.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are more than capable of delivering \"Safepoint\" to the market.\nWe proved our competence with our Kickstarter projects \"MyPocketMaster\" reaching over 5,000$ in backing, \"JO- Titanium bottle opener\" reaching over 3800$ and \"Key master multi-tool\" reaching over 3700$ (feel free to check it out).\n\nAlthough we don't foresee any major problems, we understand that there is always a chance of small delays. We have lowered the risk of failure by making \"Safepoint\" production process as simple as possible. Our business partners are fully informed about the launch of \"Safepoint\" and are waiting for the first production orders.

The movie is about a fictional story of a pandemic, and the whole world is desperately searching for a cure against an aggressive virus. After that movie, I said: \u201cI hope that never happens in real life!\u201d Unfortunately, it did happen somehow.\nThat is why we decided to design a product that will help you to stay safe. Around us, there are many viruses and will always be. Our multifunctional carabiner will enable you to do everyday tasks in a safe and easy way.\nThe Stay Safe carabiner can be used as a door opener, stylus, key carabiner, quick fixer and a box opener.  Carabiner give us quick access to all the functions. It can be clipped on your pants or purse. Because of the germs transmission, we do not recommend carrying it in your pocket. \nPatent pending design\n\nFUNCTIONS\n1. CARABINER\nThe carabiner give us quick access to all the functions and to not carrying it in the pocket. Clip it on your pants, bags or purse. In these days nobody wants to touch the door handle with a hook or a hand and then put it in the pocket. And we recommend, that when you wash your hands, wash also the carabiner.\n2. DOOR HOOK\nThe door hook gap is 2inch (5cm), which will definitely work perfectly with all the standard door handles. \n3. STYLUS\nOn the carabiner there are 2 points that can be used as a stylus. Every key pad, elevator button, touch screen situation will show you which one to use. \n4. BOX OPENER\nIn these days, we are all trying to avoid going to the shops, so online shopping is working on full capacities. Because we know, we got many packages these days, we added the function of a box opener, which is very needed in these days. \n5. HEX DRIVER\nIf you will need any quick fix, hex driver is added on a carabiner. \nTHE BACK STORY\nIn our daily lives, we are constantly touching different public objects and surfaces, like door handles, elevator switches, keyboards, toilets, faucets, kettles, doors, soap dispensers, etc...\nWe know that all the cleaning stuff is working hard on cleaning all the public surfaces, however that is a never ending story. All of us have to consider, what we can do for our own protection.  \nThe whole world has fallen into a situation, where we are all more conscious about germs and public surfaces.  Did you ever find yourself in front of the door and trying to find a way to open without touching it? Well... we have and that is why we decided to make a tool for solving some of those problems. \n How it is made? \nStay Safe carabiner is made out of 99% COPPER, which is fully recyclable. COPPER is a natural antimicrobial material, therefore is a perfect material for our product. The carabiner spring is made out of stainless steel. \nThe carabiner is cut with a Water-jet machine. After we cut the basic shapes, we continue with manual work like sanding, sharping the edge for a box opener, assembling, packaging. \nAs one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.\n We are TRUSTED PRODUCERS\nWe have already sucessfully finished some of our Kickstarter projects in the past. You can check it here: Carabinsi, Hudwood, Xavier Wallet. Our website: www.hudwood.com \n and below are some of the comments:\nWe have been using our Carabinsi (Jimi and Billy tools) for a few weeks  now, we love them!  Mine goes with me to work every day and the box  opener part of the Billy is used all the time.  Excellent quality  product. :)\nI got it and it's really funtional.\nI just received mine today, it looks pretty awesome and gave it to my  brother-in-law and he likes it. Also, thank you for the free gift.\nThanks for your great solution. I am very happy with my wallet and the  quality is really great. I use it every day and get positiv feedback  from my environment all the time. It really is an eye-catcher. I  couldn't recommend it more.\nVery classy carabiner, excellent workmanship. Now I have a carabiner  that goes with suits that my high tech looking ones clash with.\nI received my Wallet and carabiner in Colorado, USA today and I love the craftsmanship.  they are both supurb!

Smoothies are great, but can be inconvenient, and wasteful. Orchard Smoothies changes all that.  \n How does Orchard Smoothies work? \nEasy peasy blend n' slurpy.\nStep 1: Order online. Subscriptions or one-offs. Free delivery in our service areas. \nStep 2: Kits delivered to your door in glass jars, packed in insulated, reusable bags. \nStep 3: Didn't we tell you already - just blend n' slurp!! \nStep 4: Put containers back out on the next delivery day. \nStep 5: Keep blendin', keep slurpin'.  \nOur recipes include nutritious, locally grown fresh fruits and veggies as well as boosts to keep you focused, energized and healthy. Delivered in zero-waste, reusable jars.\nWhy Orchard Smoothies are better?\nThis is not your who-cares-about-the-planet way to slurp. We are the greener and better alternative to services like Daily Harvest, smoothie bars or even making your own smoothies.  \nMainstream smoothie companies and even your everyday grocery store produce is sourced from around the world. The fruits and vegetables can sit in cold storage for up to 11 months - ending up losing nutritional value and taste. Ingredients in our kits are sourced from Texas (with some exceptions) and are never frozen so you are guaranteed freshness and high nutritional value.  \nWhat We Need\nWe need your help so we can optimize our service and spread our message of mindful consumption and modern sustainability.\nYour contribution would help us with working capital, building our team and expanding our delivery range. \nFlavors\nOur smoothies are created collaboratively by chefs, nutritionists, local produce experts and slurpers like you! What makes our smoothies even more special are the boosts made up of medicinal herbs from around the world, and vegan protein powders - designed to enhance flavor and nutritional value. \nOur single serve kits are $7.99 per 16oz smoothie. Daily Harvest single serve kits are $7.99 per 8oz smoothie. Their smoothies are DOUBLE the price. What you are paying for are the ice-packs, the wasteful packaging and the long distance travel. Save the money and buy yourself a trip to a cool place :) \nHere are two of our featured smoothie kit recipes:\nPurely Energizing: A burst of Texas grown apples are combined with other fresh ingredients to give you an energetic, nutrient filled start to the day. The aswagandha herb is known for fortifying adrenal functions and helping modulate stress levels.\nIngredients: Apples*, organic lemon juice*, organic celery, organic kale*, organic cucumber*, aswagandha herb and hemp protein.\n         *grown within the state of Texas\n\nRecommended liquid bases: Water, coconut water, milk, any nut milk\n\nBenefits: Energy, Burning Fat, Reducing Stress, Fortifying Adrenal Functions\nPurple Mint: When antioxidant laden blueberries mingle with power packed cashews, mint and arjuna herb, the result is a smoothie that is sure to satisfy while helping your heart\u2019s oxygenation and modulate your cholesterol levels. *Contains: Nuts\n\nIngredients: Blueberries*, organic oranges*, mint*, organic cashews, organic dates, arjuna herb\n         *grown within the state of Texas\n\nRecommended Liquid Bases: Water, coconut water, milk, any nut milk\n\nBenefits: Energy, Anti-Inflammatory, Better Skin, Modulate Cholesterol, Heart Health\nThe Blend N' Slurp Process\n\n\nSome of the farmers who make our smoothie kits possible:\nCrawford Orchard, Idalou, TX, G&S Groves, McAllen TX, Village Farms, Marfa, TX, Patty\u2019s Herbs, Pearsall, TX, Lightsey Farms, Mexia, TX, Makewood Plantation, Huntsville, TX, Joe's Microgreens, Austin, TX\nThings That Matter to Us \nWithout supporting rural communities and their farmers, city life would look very different. With more and more people moving to cities, the demand for food and other goods is skyrocketing. The farmers we source our fruits and veggies from are right here in Texas, we bring their harvest to you in a way that makes your life easier and their business possible. \nOur glass jars come in 32oz and 16oz portions and are consistently reused throughout our smoothie kit process. \nIn a world where single-use packaging is everywhere, we believe Orchard Smoothies has potential for real impact. There will be as much plastic waste in the oceans as there are fish, by 2050. Not what we want those fishies to be slurpin' on! \nTested, and Ready to Roll \nWe have already been testing the concept in partnership with Lettuce (a zero-waste meal kit delivery service). Here\u2019s some feedback we\u2019ve received:  \n\nWe put all this feedback and more into a blender, slurped it all down, and the result is this final Orchard Smoothies experience.\nWith your contributions we can make zero waste the new norm not only in Austin but communities all over. The environment needs all the help it can get, so the little things add up. We believe that small changes equals collective impact. One smoothie kit at a time. \nOperationally speaking, powered by our technology partner, Loconomy, we will use Lettuce's operational infrastructure and delivery network to create and deliver our kits to customers - further reducing wasteful use of resources and helping make our business model more robust.  \nAbout Me & Us\nAbout 8 months ago I packed up my life and drove down to Austin from Philadelphia and took a chance at a new life. This is my first time living alone and it astounded me how much trash accumulated in such a small amount of time. I\u2019m a big foodie, so being new to Austin I am constantly bombarded with food and drinks at every turn. I found myself eating out more than I should and neglecting my kitchen at home, for either convenience reasons or pure laziness. How could I cut down on my waste but maintain that Austin lifestyle I love so dearly? Orchard Smoothies became the solution I didn\u2019t know I needed. It combines the ease of delivery with healthy and waste free alternatives. The best part is I don\u2019t have to take out my trash as often.\nBut this project is not just me, myself and I. Orchard Smoothies is made up of knowledgable chefs who work with us to make sure our smoothies are nutritious and delicious. An operations team that works very hard to perfect your kits and get deliveries out on time. And a support team ready to answer your questions or address issues. \nThe appeal of smoothies for me is that there is a smoothie for everyone, and that reflects your experience here in Austin. You're consuming something that isn\u2019t a big brand, isn\u2019t a ploy for money or your data but something that aims to provide you with a food experience that won\u2019t leave you guessing. No matter who you are, we have a smoothie for you. And this is just the start! \nI am always looking for advice, feedback and support from people like you. So please feel free to reach out, critique my words or applaud my cause, I\u2019d love to hear from you.

Not only can they substitute synthetic materials, but in many ways they are far better than plastic. We are using 10 amazing plants: hemp, kenaf, linen, cork tree, wood, corn, jute, eucalyptus, rubber tree and New Zealand wool to craft our 97% ecological MIRET sneakers.  \n\n\nMIRET Woodies are premium VEGAN-friendly sneakers. With a silky smooth surface they look like premium leather sneakers, but this is not leather at all. They are made with a very fine layer of smoothly polished Oak wood. Yes, you are reading this correctly. A thin layer of wood which is flexible because it is cut with a laser into tiny squares. The surface resembles premium leather with it is silky smooth touch, but the sneakers are completely vegan. The feel and the look of the sneakers are special and you can actually see the natural rings of the wood in the texture.  \nWe are industry insiders who have inherited a factory from our father in our 20s. We have manufactured sneakers for some of the most famous high-end brands in the world. We realised that the footwear industry is apocalyptic to nature because the materials used in the shoe industry are downright horrible.     \nFootwear has a detrimental effect on the environment. Made out of plastic and leather, 20.000.000.000 pairs were manufactured just in 2019. Polyester and rubber are made from oil derivatives and are the source of micro-plastics that pollute our grounds, seas, air, water, and ultimately ending up on our plates. Most people think that leather is natural, but actually, it is filled with very toxic chemicals, most often heavy metals like chromium. When trends fade, we discard sneakers while putting an unbearable burden on Earth's ecosystems.   \nUsing our manufacturing expertise we redesigned sneakers from the bottom up, making them compatible with nature. We decided to change ourselves, our setting and most importantly - the industry.       \nWe have traveled the world searching for new materials. It was a five-year-long journey of research, tests and development filled with ups and downs, tears and joy. \nThe result of our quest are MIRET supernatural materials. Not only can they substitute synthetic materials but in many ways they are far better than plastic. We are using 10 amazing plants: hemp, kenaf, linen, cork tree, wood, corn, jute, eucalyptus, rubber tree and New Zealand wool to craft our 97% ecological MIRET sneakers. \nMIRET sneakers are super soft and cozy from the moment you put them on. They are flexible and will keep your feet happy during long walks. \nOur new outsole contains no oil-based synthetic rubber whatsoever. It is pure natural latex, harvested from rubber trees - this makes the outsole softer and more flexible than any other rubber out there.       \nPLAY\n\nMIRET ultra-light insoles are made from cork throughout and protected by a natural textile. They are ergonomically shaped and even food-grade certified, so your dog can chew on them safely. \ud83d\udc15  \nPLAY\n\nThe pure hemp lining allows the breeze to travel through the fabric to keep it fresh.    \nPLAY\n\nHemp lining is naturally odour-resistant, while cork is on a whole other level. About 45% of the mass of cork is a waxy compound known as suberin, and it makes cork naturally mold and mildew resistant, as well as resistant to termites and fire.\nThe outer fabric of our sneakers is protected by a special natural water repellent layer so you can be safe even when it rains. Standard water repellent treatments are petroleum-based and harmful for the environment, especially for aquatic life, but our water protection is 100% natural. The layer works by mimicking the self-cleaning effect of the lotus flower and degrades naturally with zero impact on the environment. This will also keep your sneakers clean for much longer.  \nMIRET water protection is 100% natural\nBecause it's hard and expensive. We\u2019ve spent five years making MIRET 97% super-ecological sneakers. That means they are almost entirely made out of natural materials, safe for the environment and your health. The remaining 3% is synthetic glue and polyester thread. We will tackle this  3% very soon. Our vision is to create a 100% ecological and home-compostable sneaker, and with each new generation MIRET sneakers we are getting closer to this goal.\nOur super 97% ecological sneakers are all identical in anatomy, but there are five different varieties of outer layer materials:\n Hempies: 100% pure hemp outer layer - vegan-friendly  \n Woolies: 100% pure wool outer layer - vegetarian-friendly  \n Fluffies: 100% pure fluffy wool outer layer - vegetarian-friendly  \n Veggies: biodegradable textile outer layer - vegan-friendly  \n Woodies: oak wood outer layer - vegan-friendly  \nMIRET Hempies are VEGAN-friendly. We have developed a pure hemp textile for MIRET Hempies. It is naturally breathable, strong but soft, anti-bacterial and with a low environmental impact. Grown on European farms and fully processed in Europe while maintaining every stage of the manufacturing process as healthy as possible to the individual and to the environment. Hemp gets softer the more you wear it and provides natural optimal temperature regulation. Our hemp is completely unbleached and undyed.\nMIRET Woolies and Fluffies are VEGETARIAN-friendly and their textile is 100% pure wool. Woolies textile is certified by the most rigorous ecological certifications in the world Cradle to Cradle\u2122 which guarantees the highest possible standards of safety the environment, while Fluffies textile is certified by Oeko-tex\u00ae and EU Ecolabel\u00ae. All of our sheep live happily in New Zealand.\nMIRET Veggies are VEGAN-friendly. Our Veggies are made from vegan biodegradable textile, developed specifically for MIRET. The Cradle to Cradle\u2122 certified material is strong and durable enough to replace the standard polyester textile, but can be fully compostable when the sneakers are discarded. The laboratory tests showed the plants grow better when our material is mixed into the soil.  \nMIRET Woodies are premium VEGAN-friendly sneakers. With a silky smooth surface they look like premium leather sneakers, but this is not leather at all. They are made with a very fine layer of smoothly polished Oak wood. Yes, you are reading this correctly. A thin layer of wood which is flexible because it is cut with a laser into tiny squares. The surface resembles premium leather with it is silky smooth touch, but the sneakers are completely vegan. The feel and the look of the sneakers are special and you can actually see the natural rings of the wood in the texture.  \n\nPLAY\n\nIn 2019 we have launched our first-generation MIRET sneakers and sold 800 pairs. We received a ton of feedback and this is one of the reasons why we pushed the envelope and developed a much improved second generation of ecological sneakers. Our new product features 97% bio-based ecological materials, innovative construction and much-improved comfort and durability.     \nOur manufacturing partners come from nine European Union countries and every single one of them is thinking green.   \nAll sizes matter. US: 3-14, EU: 34-49. We made sure you can fit your whole family with MIRET by making them in a wide range of sizes. When we decided we wanted to make a change in the shoe industry, we knew we needed everyone on board, no matter their shoe size.   \nOur new sneakers are ready for production and we are ready for the next logical step.

We promise to keep our backers updated and informed about any issues that may arise.\n\nWe are an experienced team with more than 10 years of experience in footwear development and manufacturing. This is the 2nd generation of MIRET sneakers and is ready for serial production. Our 1st generation was launched in 2019, and we got amazing feedback from our customers. We have organized and prepared everything in line to bring you the best quality product.\n\nWith the creation of any new product that includes manufacturing processes, there can be a number of unforeseen risks and obstacles. We will do everything we can to eliminate any possible interruption during production and delivery. If something unexpected happens, we will keep you up to date. However, from our side comes the fact that MIRET is already a finished and developed product. We need your final push to bring this product to its final production run.\n\nThe biggest challenge that we could probably face is the unexpected number of backers and therefore some products might not be ready for the scheduled delivery as planned. All materials are sourced from our stable suppliers, all of which are based in the EU. Our factory is local, well established and experienced in co-working and production. We will do our best to scale the production if needed so each of you can receive your MIRET sneakers in the shortest possible amount of time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWith over 10 years of experience in footwear development and production, we are experts in crafting quality sneakers. We have spent the last 5 years searching and developing sustainable and ecological materials for our sneakers. MIRET 97% ecological materials are strong, durable and natural at the same time. Developed with the latest technologies and ecological knowledge, our wool textile materials are Cradle to Cradle\u2122 SILVER certified. Our fluffy wool materials are Oeko-tex\u00ae and EU Ecolabel\u00ae certified, and our veggies textile is Cradle to Cradle\u2122 GOLD certified. All of our sneakers are protected with an innovative water repellent layer that protects the sneaker from water. It also protects the sneakers from dirt and stains which increases the lifespan of the sneaker as they do not need to be washed so often. The layer works by mimicking the self-cleaning effect of the lotus flower. Usually the water repellant treatments are far from being eco-friendly, but are very harmful for aquatic life. Our layer is completely natural and degrades naturally with zero impact on the environment. The inside of MIRET sneakers is made out of 100% natural, un-bleached and un-dyed hemp which is naturally anti-bacterial and odour resistant. MIRET ultra-light insoles are made from cork throughout and protected by a natural textile. Cork is amazing because about 45% of the mass of cork is a waxy compound known as suberin which makes cork naturally mold and mildew resistant, as well as resistant to termites and fire. In 2019 we have launched our first generation MIRET sneakers which was an amazing test for us. We have received a lot of feedback which we have used to design our new much-improved generation of sneakers \u2014 more durable, more comfortable, more eco-friendly. MIRET sneakers are made with 97% natural materials. The remaining 3% is synthetic glue and polyester thread. This 3 % is actually making our sneakers more sustainable because they are greatly improving the durability, and ultimately reducing waste. We will tackle this 3% very soon.\nReusability and recyclability\nUsing our manufacturing expertise we redesigned sneakers from the bottom up, making them compatible with nature. The design of our sneakers is defined by optimised material consumption. We have reduced the complexity of the aesthetics in order to reduce cutting waste. The waste generated during the manufacturing process will be collected, composted and turned to plant food.\nSustainable materials\nMIRET supernatural materials are not only a great substitute for synthetic materials, but in many ways, they are far better than synthetics. We are using 10 amazing plants to craft our sneakers: hemp, kenaf, linen, cork tree, wood, corn, jute, eucalyptus, rubber tree and New Zealand wool. Classical sneakers are made out of many different components which makes recycling virtually impossible. Over the course of our 5-year development, we have successfully replaced non-sustainable components with ecological alternatives, one by one. Our vision is to create a 100% ecological and home-compostable sneaker, and with each new generation MIRET sneakers we are getting closer to this goal. Our hemp materials are VEGAN-friendly, custom developed for MIRET, and with a super low environmental impact. Grown on European farms and fully processed in Europe while maintaining every stage of the manufacturing process as healthy as possible to the individual and to the environment. MIRET fluffy wool sneakers are VEGETARIAN-friendly. The fluffy wool textile is 100% pure wool and certified by Oeko-tex\u00ae and EU Ecolabel\u00ae, while Woolies textile is certified by the rigorous ecological certification Cradle to Cradle\u2122 SILVER certificate. MIRET veggies sneakers are VEGAN-friendly. They are made with a vegan biodegradable textile, developed specifically for MIRET. The Cradle to Cradle\u2122 GOLD certified material is strong and durable enough to replace the standard polyester textile but can be fully compostable.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nIn our five year-long search of sustainable materials we have found a lot of companies claiming their materials are sustainable. But in reality, only a handful of them are true to their cause. The carefully chosen dozen have become our manufacturing partners.

They are delicious and they look so great on your plate.\nMicrogreens are an early stage in a plant's growth - instead of waiting months for the plant to grow, we eat it in the 7-12 day period after the germination.\nAnd the best part - You can grow them in your apartment. With Evolve Garden, the process is so easy, a 3-year-olds can do it (we have tried) and the result is so delicious, they will want to eat them too.\n * USDA study that shows microgreens contain 4 to 40 times the nutrients of their mature counterparts - https://agnr.umd.edu/news/mighty-microgreens\nEvolve Garden is an extremely easy and fast way to grow your own greens and herbs in 7 days - just add water?\nEvery microgreens grower will tell you that growing your own greens is easy... but they will start talking about water pH, blackout times and different types of growing mediums in the same breath. That's just too complicated, there must be a better way, right?\nPLAY\n\n Evolve Garden makes growing microgreens easy for everyone. \nWe created an easy to use, \"all-inclusive\" kit that provides you with everything you need to start (and continue) growing your greens in no time, with no mess and no guessing if you are doing it right.\nPLAY\n\nNo soil = no mess\nWorking with soil may be fun sometimes. But planting seeds in soil indoors can be time consuming and messy. So, we ditched the soil and developed a growing system that uses special coconut fiber mats - no mess.\nCoconut growing mat holds water extremely well, for 10 days or more. That means you won't have to worry about watering your greens. And it's weaved together, so it doesn't make a mess. When you harvest your greens, just roll it up and throw it on your compost pile or organic waste bin - it's 100% natural and compostable. \nOnly water once\nI admit. I can't keep a cactus alive. That is why Evolve Garden is designed especially for growing microgreens and herbs. Growing mats are full of tiny spaces that hold the perfect amount of air and water to provide nutrients to your plants for over 10 days.\nThat means you don't have to worry about watering your greens, just add water in the beginning and forget about them until they are ready to harvest approximately 1 week later.\nWhen you are done, just throw it into composting bin\nEverything about Evolve Garden is natural. When you harvest your lush, yummy greens, you are left with an empty growing mat. You can simply throw it in the composting bin or on your compost pile. It is 100% biodegradable.\nYou can grow up to 300g of microgreens from just one Evolve seed pad. Every starter kit comes with 2 seed packs, so you can grow almost $100 worth of microgreens in your first month!\nSimply cut your greens with scissors or a sharp knife. You can cut them all at once and store in fridge for up to 2 weeks, or you can cut them as you go.\nMicrogreens are getting popular, but they are still hard to come by in some countries. If you can find them in farmer markets or supermarkets, they are not always fresh and they can cost a lot.\nWhy not grow them yourself?\nIt's fun watching these greens grow. You will be amazed at what a difference even a few hours make.\nYou will know your greens are as fresh as they can be.\nAnd you can save a lot of money.\nBeautifully crafted wooden frames.\nEvery Evolve Garden kit comes with a modern wooden frame. The frame is designed to provide support for the growing tray and expose your greens to as much light as possible.\nIt's also designed to fit into our vertical stand. If you are serious about growing microgreens, have a large family or even a restaurant, you can easily slide these frames into the Evolve strand and save a lot of space.\nEvolve Garden looks great on any countertop, shelf or window sill. It's like a piece of furniture and the contrast between wood and greens is really something to look at.\nEstimated shipping time - EU backers in February 2020, USA a few months later.\nWe are based in the EU. All of the Evolve Garden parts are produced in the EU and our seed are grown locally, under one of the strictest agriculture legislation in the world.\nWe have already made a small number of Evolve Gardens and we have figured out most of the mass production processes.\nWe are planning on sending out the first batch (Early bird) of Evolve Gardens to our European backers in late February 2020 with other rewards following shortly after.\nUnfortunately, we will need more time to sort out shipping of the live seeds to the USA so our American backers will start receiving their Evolve Gardens 2-3 months later.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I grow microgreens in my apartment, in my climate?\nShort answer: Yes. Microgreens can be grown in all climates, at all times of the year and take up so little space you can grow them even in a small apartment.\nThey don't relly much on external factors for their growth - just a little bit of light and some water is fine. They don't need to be fertilized, because all the nutrients they need for growth are present in the seed, so you know there are no nasty chemicals involved.\nVisit our website to see a full list of frequently asked questions.\nWhat varieties of microgreens can I grow with Evolve Garden? \nThere are 10 varieties of greens available from the start with more to come in the future.\nThere are dozens of microgreens and herbs that you can grow at home, some are very forgiving and some a bit harder to maintain. But, we had to start somewhere.\nWe handpicked 10 different greens to start with.\nAfter the initial period, we will start adding new, interesting and seasonal seed packs to our web store. The possibilities are endless. From the bright red Amaranth to almost black Dark Opal Basil and everything in between.\nSubscribe to our growing packs and save\nWith every Evolve Garden starter kit, you get 2 seed packs to get you started. You can order more seed packs from the start or buy them later from our web store.\nBut, you don't need to choose and go through the process of buying seed packs every few weeks - we are rolling out a subscription service.\nSimply subscribe, tell us what your favorite flavors are and every month you will receive new seed packs. You can save time and money by subscribing, plus, there will a small surprise included with every package you get.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupply chain\nWe developed the product to the phase where it is ready to be sent out to consumers. However, there are some challenges and risks involved. Evolve Garden is produced locally and some parts are hand finished. Out supply chain has not been \"stress-tested\" so there may be delays when it comes to mass production.\n\nSeed availability\nEvolve Garden contains live plant seeds. We have chosen varieties that are easy to grow and widely available. However, seed availability is not 100% guaranteed - there may be a shortage of certain variety due to natural phenomenons. We have prepared a list of over 20 microgreens varieties so we will be able to find a suitable exchange with similar properties if one variety of seeds becomes unavailable.\n\nSending to counties outside of EU\nWe are an EU based company and we are proud that every part of Evolve Garden is built in the EU. We are using local suppliers that are as close to our headquarters as possible. We are planning on sending Evolve Garden worldwide. Since it contains live plant seeds, there may be some issues with customs and regulations.

This ensures that the seeds have already sprouted before they\u2019re even in the ground and that they have a strong rooting system when they grow. Not only that, but after we plant them we follow up with our spraying drone to remove competition and provide nitrogen and other nutrients for the best chance of success. We continuously monitor our seedlings with the mapping drone to make sure they\u2019re healthy.\nHow do you plant the trees?\nWe plant our seed pods, using a heavy-lift drone that\u2019s been customized with a pneumatic firing device to insert the pods into the soil at the appropriate depth.\nTree planting companies use seedlings. Why would they use seed pods instead of seedlings if it takes longer to grow?\nPlanting pods has several advantages over seedlings.\n1) Drones allow us to plant pods 10X faster per drone than seedlings can be planted.\n2) Our seed pods contain 3 pre-germinated tree seeds, mycorrhiza, nutrients and other supportive species for the area.\n3) Pods are much less energy/ water intensive to produce and have a lower environmental impact.\n4) Pods can be created in mass within a month, whereas seedlings take 1 to 2 years of intensive care in a nursery before they can be planted. This allows us to plant rapidly and at 20% the cost of a seedling.\nAre you qualified?\nYes. Three of our core members have backgrounds in science and engineering. Additionally, we\u2019re working closely with scientists with PhD's in botany, seed genetics, and forestry specialists on every job. We are fully certified and licensed for UAV operation in Canada.\nWhat tree species do you plant?\nThis year we planted eight deciduous and coniferous species local to Southern Ontario. We can easily fill our pods with seeds of virtually any tree species (except for acorns and a few of the larger exceptions). If interested, we can also plant any flora that\u2019s appropriate for an ecosystem in it\u2019s successional period.    \n In your video you talk about planting for full eco-system recovery, how are you doing this?\nWe know that planting a single tree species will not restore an ecosystem to its natural state nor will it guarantee a healthy forest. That\u2019s why we develop pods that capture the relevant tree seeds, mycorrhiza, nutrients, and soil properties for the target area. Seeds from local sources are usually the best adapted to the target ecosystem but even that isn\u2019t always the case. Climate change has rapidly changed ecosystems and sometimes seeds from lower latitudes are actually more likely to survive in warming climates. We are building a team of experts in restoration ecology to ensure that science underpins all of our efforts and captures nature\u2019s nuances.\nDo you work with companies that are interested in planting only one or two types of trees?\nWhile our focus is on full-eco system recovery, we can work with others, including oil and timber companies, who prioritize a select few tree species. However, we will always push to ensure our seedlings have the best chance of success and will disclose what the ecosystem's needs are to ensure this.\nWhere do you operate?\nSo far we\u2019ve planted in southern Ontario.
