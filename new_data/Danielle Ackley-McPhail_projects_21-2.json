[{"backer": "Danielle Ackley-McPhail", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "CORVID-19: A RavenCon Anthology\n2020 has been a challenging year for all of us. No one expected the world to come to a grinding halt. No one expected stores to run out of toilet paper, or the Tiger King to be a thing on Netflix, but here we are.\nAfter planning, prepping, and purchasing all of the supplies for our 2020 event, the pandemic hit. Everything started shutting down. Conventions and all in-person events were cancelled.  RavenCon led the way, putting our guests' safety above all else, and we were one of the first to cancel\u20143 weeks before the convention. We had spent eleven months purchasing supplies for an event that wasn\u2019t going to happen. \nAs a fan-run convention, we pride ourselves in being there for emerging artists, writers, and vendors. We may be small, but our heart is mighty.\nWe know the community is vital to many of you. Conventions are a way to meet with your friends, to make new friends and new connections. To boldly go where you haven't been before, and to come together as a family. We don't want this to end, but 2020 was certainly bent on it. This is where we need your help.\nMichael Pederson had an idea (a lot of RavenCon stories start with this sentence, by the way).  Why not make something everyone can enjoy? We are all home much more often now; what's better than reading a good book? So, we reached out to our past guests, and began collecting our \"tribute\" to 2020: CORVID-19, an anthology. Yes, you read that right. CORVID-19. An anthology themed around the corvidae family of birds\u2014ravens, crows, bluejays, magpies, etc.\nOur generous and talented author friends have donated their stories, now we need your help to get this published. You can also support the convention so we can thrive for years to come. \nWe have something for everyone! You can choose to be a major or minor character in a book! Maybe you want to be a Red Shirt and get killed off? We have that too. Want stickers? We have that. Want help with the story you're writing? We got you! Mad for music? We hear you. Take a look at the list of pledge levels and for ways to help support us. \nWe couldn't run RavenCon without you. We thank you for everything you have helped us with over the last 15 years, and we don't want this pandemic to take that away. \nThank you for sharing our project, for supporting us, and we look forward to seeing you when we can be face to face again. \nWhat exactly are the nineteen corvid-filled stories in this 210-page volume of awesomeness? Just look at what we\u2019ve got\u2026\n\u201cWindows to the Soul\u201d by Danielle Ackley-McPhail\n\u201cRaven\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d by Heather Ewings\n\u201cThe Cruelest Team Will Win\u201d by Mike Allen\n\u201cJenny\u201d by Debbie Manber Kupfer\n\u201cDaughter of the Birds\u201d by Maya Preisler\n\u201cKvetina and the Crows\u201d by Rhys Schrock\n\u201cCorvus Monitus\u201d by Cass Morris\n\u201cIf the Moon is Real\u201d by Samantha Bryant\n\u201cLife in a Moment\u201d by James Maxey\n\u201cCrows\u2019 Feet\u201d by Diana Bastine\n\u201cA Warning of Crows\u201d by Jennifer R.

Once we reach our first stretch goal of $4000, everyone who is getting the book will get a digital copy of The Second Wave. \nMy feathers are a flutter just thinking about this! Or maybe that\u2019s just a bad hamberder.)\n\n*Update! Our second stretch goal of $4500 wil get everyone who supported us at the $10 or more level will also be getting a limited-edition bookmark and button made exclusively for this kickstarter! \nCORVID-19 Button\n*Update!

Last year, to honor those halcyon days, I conceived of Thrilling Adventure Yarns and invited a ton of friends, old and new, to join me in this celebration.\nI then turned to you, the discerning reader, for support. I was stunned and gratified to not only meet my objective but far, far exceed it. We earned 248% of the goal, which allowed me to bring our readers a number of attractive and exciting options I would not have been able to provide otherwise.\nWe had fun producing the book, and our reviews and personal comments were almost all laudatory. The common question was, \u201cWhen is the next book?\u201d The answer is February. \nThe second common question was, \"When is the next Thrilling Adventures Kickstarter?\"\nThe answer is: NOW!\nAs part of Crazy 8 Press\u2019 10th-anniversary celebration, we will release a second volume, once more packed with all genres of pulp goodness, with several returning authors along with new ones. Several characters from our first volume will be making second appearances here, including Cannon Belle! Other Crazy 8 characters will also be appearing here, including a tale from the Crimson Keep and Angela Hardwicke, private detective!\nJoining me on this journey will be C8\u2019s Aaron Rosenberg, Michael Jan Friedman, Glenn Hauman, Mary Fan, Paul Kupperberg, and Russ Colchamiro.\nReturning will be David Mack, Paige Daniels, Will Murray, and Karissa Laurel.\nNew to this volume will be William Leisner, Danielle Ackley McPhail, Dayton Ward & Kevin Dilmore, Greg Cox, Heather E. Hutsell, Kelli Fitzpatrick, Michael A. Burstein, Richard White, Scott Pearson, and Sherri Cook Woosley.\nAnother Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished detective tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign.\nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns\u2014in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable artist Gary Carbon. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur Goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $6000, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la Carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package\u2014to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't. Just take any existing package of $25 and up, and add to it the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list. Then send us a message letting us know what additional reward or rewards you've qualified for. (International backers, there will be some additional postage; if you're interested in an add-on, shoot us a message and we'll figure it out.)\nGet listed as a patron on the acknowledgments page  $10.\nReceive a one-time mention as a character, street, company, etc.  $35.\nE-book package #1 $20.\nE-book package #2 $20.\nE-book package #3 $20.\nPackage #1 includes Lost Days by Michael Jan Friedman, Cats Triumphant by Jody Lynn Nye, The Wild Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Will Murray, Harbinger of Darkness by Richard C. White, and Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn by Day Al-Mohamed and Danielle Ackley-Mcphail.\nPackage #2 includes Transcendence and The Halfling's Court by Danielle Ackley McPhail, Flynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil, by Mary Fan, Altered States of the Union, edited by Glenn Hauman, In the Services of the Guild by Tina Closser, and \"Midnight Rider\" by David Mack.\nPackage #3 includes In My Shorts by Paul Kupperberg, Crackle and Fire by Russ Colchamiro, One Haunted Summer by Aaron Rosenberg, Eternal Wanderings by Danielle Ackley-McPhail, and \"Our Possible Pasts\" by David Mack\nFor $25 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition (after the option is unlocked, of course).\nStretch Goals!\nUNLOCKED! At $7000 we unlock \"the hardcover option,\" allowing any backer whose reward includes a paperback copy to upgrade to a handsome hardback version of Thrilling Adventure Yarns 2021 (see A La Carte menu above).\nUNLOCKED! At $7250, I will be able to include a story from Stuart Moore, an editor/writer with credits from St. Martin's Press, Vertigo Comics, Marvel Comics, and currently Ahoy! Comics. His previous prose works include collaborations with Stan Lee and several Marvel novels.\nAt $7500, I will be able to include a story from veteran comics writer Ron Marz, whose credits span from Witchblade to Green Lantern, from DC vs. Marvel to Batman/Aliens. His work speaks for itself and here he'll be making a rare prose appearance.\nAt $7750, I will be able to include a story from Jody Lynn Nye, the prolific author of over 40 books and more than 120 short stories, spanning genres. \n$8000, I will be able to include a story from the possibly even more prolific Jonathan Maberry, he of V-Wars and Joe Ledger fame. The multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author continues to write and edit across genres.\nAt $8500 we will upgrade those receiving one signature to three signatures from our illustrious cadre of authors. (See Risks and Challenges for options.)\nAt $9000 we can send everyone a digital art set of images, suitable for your digital wallpaper.\nAt $10,000, it will allow me to hire a cadre of talented artists to render a black and white illustration for each and every story in the collection. Last time, we had work from Mark Wheatley, Peter Krause, Jerry Ordway, Karl Kesel, and Tom Mandrake. We're already lining up several new names should we reach this level!\nAt $10,500 we will up our guarantee of three autographs per print edition to five autographs. (See Risks and Challenges for options.).\nAt $12,000 we will have a Kickstarter-exclusive cover from Richard Pace, who has illustrated for Vertigo and Marvel and has also co-written Dale Keown\u2019s Pitt and Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham and is the co-creator, with Mark Russell, of the hit indie AHOY Comics series Second Coming. Only backers will receive this exclusive edition in softcover and/or hardcover.\nWe'll be announcing other stretch goals as our campaign develops.

If you have a story idea that fits one of the three themes described below, write it up, revise it, polish it, and then send it in for consideration! You may end up in one of these anthologies!\nThis project will fund THREE science fiction and fantasy anthologies, titled THE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY, DERELICT, and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, containing approximately 14 all-original (no reprint) short stories each from established SF&F authors in the field and new voices found through an open call. The books will be edited by Patricia Bray & Joshua Palmatier (THE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY), David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier (DERELICT), and S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier (WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE).\nTHE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY:\nIn this follow-up to THE MODERN FAE'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY, we switch our attention to how the deities of old have managed to fit themselves into today's modern world! Is Narcissus an Instagram influencer? Is Coyote playing the stock market? Does Ra own a solar panel company? Was Dr. Ruth really Venus? How have the gods and goddesses managed to survive alongside cell phones and computers and social media influencers? We invite authors to explore how the immortals have changed with the times.\nEdited by Patricia Bray & Joshua Palmatier, THE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors (and the gods they may use) include:\nAlma Alexander (Freyja: Nordic),\nDavid Farland (Woden/Odin: German),\nTanya Huff (Hera: Greek),\nJuliet E. McKenna (Nemesis/Themis: Greek),\nPhyllis Irene Radford (Anshar/Tiamet: Babylonian),\nLaura Resnick (assorted),\nKari Sperring (Cigfa, Goewin, Gwydion: Welsh),\nJean Marie Ward (Dionysus: Greek), and\nEdward Willett (Ninkasi: Sumerian)\nDERELICT:\nNo one can resist the mystery of the abandoned ship--whether it's the ghost ship found afloat at sea in the Bermuda Triangle or the spaceship drifting in the depths of space a la the movie Alien. What happened to the crew? What horror forced them to abandon their vessel and flee\u2026or are they still on board, trapped or even all dead? In this anthology, we want authors to explore all of the possibilities when one runs across\u2026a DERELICT.\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, DERELICT will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each. Anchor authors include:\nJacey Bedford,\nAlex Bledsoe,\nGerald Brandt,\nJulie E. Czerneda,\nKate Elliott,\nJohn G. Hemry/Jack Campbell,\nD.B. Jackson,\nGini Koch,\nSharon Lee & Steve Miller, and\nKristine Smith\nWHEN WORLDS COLLIDE:\nThroughout history, different cultures have collided in different ways, whether it be the peaceful contact between Rome and Han China in the second century that established the Silk Road, or the more violent interactions between Europe and the Americas thirteen hundred years later. Such first contact stories have long been a staple of speculative fiction. The stories featured in WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE will continue this long tradition as the authors explore the myriad ways in which two cultures\u2014alien or fae, machine or human\u2014can clash. Will the colliding societies manage to peacefully coexist after they finally meet? Or will they embark instead on a path of mutual self-destruction? Find out\u2014WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE.\nEdited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include:\nS.C. Butler,\nEsther Friesner,\nAuston Habershaw,\nSteven Harper,\nNancy Holzner,\nHoward Andrew Jones,\nStephen Leigh,\nViolette Malan, and\nAlan Smale\nBackers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade paperback edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run.\nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition!\nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors.

Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 8 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch goals would include an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2021. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

You have one week to download them before the link expires! So download them NOW, rather than later.

Remember, the three new anthologies won't go out until summer next year, so these surveys are more for those that got add-ons or special rewards that need to be shipped now rather than later (for holiday gifts or whatever).

If you have a story idea that fits one of the three themes described below, write it up, revise it, polish it, and then send it in for consideration! You may end up in one of these anthologies!

This book has been long delayed due to health concerns and issues with the past publisher of the series. After long last, and thanks to the help of author Keith R.A. DeCandido, we bring you the final installment of this hard-core military science fiction novel where humanity fights for its very existence. (For those new to the series, books 1 and 2, ISSUE IN DOUBT and IN ALL DIRECTIONS, are available through the add-on section or via specific pledge reward levels.)\nIn addition, we also present a brand-new series by veteran Star-Trek author Christopher L. Bennett. ARACHNE'S CRIME--the first book in a planned duology set in in a universe of the author's original creation--sets out to explore deep space and ends up in a harrowing encounter with new races, in a twisted tale of blame and redemption where responsibility and motives are not as clear as they may seem.\nWon't you help us make these books a reality?\nThe primary goal for this campaign will fund the production of both books and the fulfillment of pledge rewards. The authors receive an equal share of 50% of the profits raised thereafter, with 50% invested in the press to meet promotional and operational needs.\nIf science fiction isn't your thing, you can still help support us. You can choose the IMPARTIAL OBSERVER reward level and pledge a sufficient amount to claim the book or books you would like from our Add-Ons section below. There are plenty of fantasy and steampunk titles available, even a little bit of horror, if you're into zombies! If no...perhaps you could help us out by spreading the word!

He has written about US Marines in Vietnam (the Night Fighters series and three other novels), and the DemonTechseries about Marines in a fantasy world. The 18th Race trilogy is military science fiction.\nOther than military, he wrote a non-conventional vampire novel, The Hunt, and a mystery, Dead Man's Chest. He has also released a collection of short fiction and non-fiction from early in his writing career, Sherman's Shorts; the Beginnings.\nWith Dan Cragg he wrote the popular Starfist series and its spin-off series, Starfist: Force Recon\u2014all about Marines in the Twenty-fifth Century.; and a Star Wars novel, Jedi Trial. His books have been translated into Czech, Polish, German, and Japanese.\nAfter going to war as a U.S. Marine infantryman, and spending decades writing about young men at war, he's burnt out on the subject and has finally come home. Today he's writing short fiction, mostly steampunk, and farcical fantastic Westerns.\nHe lives in sunny South Florida, where he doesn't have to worry about hypothermia or snow-shoveling-induced heart attacks. He invites readers to visit his website, novelier.com.\nKeith R.A. DeCandido is a writer and editor of more than three decades' standing (though he usually does them sitting down). He is the author of more than 50 novels, more than 100 short stories, around 75 comic books, and more nonfiction than he is really willing to count. Included in those credits is fiction in the worlds of Star Trek, Alien, Farscape, Doctor Who, Andromeda, BattleTech, and many other science fiction milieus, as well as in universes of his own creation (such as the \"Precinct\" series of fantasy police procedurals, also published by the fine folks at eSpec).As an editor, he has worked with dozens of authors, among them Mike W. Barr, Alfred Bester, Margaret Wander Bonanno, Adam-Troy Castro, Peter David, Diane Duane, Harlan Ellison, Tony Isabella, Stan Lee, Tanith Lee, David Mack, David Michelinie, Andre Norton, Robert Silverberg, Dean Wesley Smith, S.P. Somtow, Harry Turtledove, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and Roger Zelazny. Having edited David Sherman's first two 18th Race books, Issue in Doubt and In All Directions, he is honored to assist him in finishing the trilogy by coauthoring To Hell and Regroup with him. Keith is also a martial artist (he got his third-degree black belt in karate in 2017), a musician (currently with the parody band Boogie Knights), and a baseball fan (having avidly followed the New York Yankees since 1976). Find out less about Keith as his cheerfully retro web site at DeCandido.net.\nChristopher L. Bennett is a lifelong resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, with a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in History from the University of Cincinnati. A fan of science and science fiction since age five, he has spent the past two decades selling original short fiction to magazines such as Analog Science Fiction and Fact (home of his \"Hub\" series of comedy adventures), BuzzyMag, and Galaxy's Edge. Since 2003, he has been one of Pocket Books' most prolific and popular authors of Star Trek tie-in fiction, including the epic Next Generation prequel The Buried Age, the Enterprise -- Rise of the Federation series, and the Original Series prequel The Captain's Oath. He has also written two Marvel Comics novels, X-Men: Watchers on the Walls and Spider-Man: Drowned in Thunder. His original novel Only Superhuman, perhaps the first hard science fiction superhero novel, was voted Library Journal's SF/Fantasy Debut of the Month for October 2012. He has three collections reprinting his original short fiction, Among the Wild Cybers: Tales Beyond the Superhuman from eSpec Books (containing an original Only Superhuman prequel novelette) and Hub Space: Tales from the Greater Galaxy and Crimes of the Hub from Mystique Press.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the books proposed in this campaign have already begun production.

She loves stories about brave princesses and spends a lot of time with her imaginary friend, Waldo. But one day her friend goes missing, and no one will believe her or take her growing concern seriously. Marymae can feel something is not right, and so decides she must go find him. But there\u2019s something odd happening in the Forest of Make-Believe; those that were noble are now hiding away, inky shadows snake through the trees, and a growing darkness threatens to engulf even the bravest heart.\nThis illustrated novelette is filled with colorful characters, whimsical and crazy situations, and a powerful theme of having hope - even when surrounded by despair. Marymae has the sweetness and straightforwardness that only a child could have - which makes for many touching and hilarious moments as she finds herself gallivanting through the ever darkening Make-Believe Forest. Enjoy the journey with her as she discovers how to be a light to inspire courage in those around her, and how to love even the most broken heart.\nIt's a book that will uplift and inspire you with touching moments, while it makes you laugh at the absurdities of little girls and pirates wielding chainsaws!\nWho will love Marymae and the Nightmare Man?\nAnyone who enjoys a good story!\nWhen writing Marymae, I wanted to capture that feeling of imagination and simplicity of childhood. Something that as adults we can get lost in, and enjoy the flow of the dramatic and the silly, to join the characters on their journey as they spring from one thing to the next. A refreshing light to illuminate the mundane every day.\nChildren and Parents!\nReading to your children has endless benefits:\nIt builds listening skills and imagination.\nReading comprehension.\nMakes reading fun and something they\u2019ll want to do.\nA wonderful time to bound.\nSo many wonderful things! Even if your child can already read, don\u2019t be afraid to read them books above their level. Good stories are meant to be shared, and there\u2019s no age restriction on a good story!\n\nWhat will the book look like?\nThe story runs about 11,500 words, will have a minimum of 10 illustrations, and be approximately 50 pages. It will be printed in 6x9, making it easy to store on your bookshelf.\nOne of the goals of this campaign is to provide the funding to commission more amazing art, which will increase the illustration and page count. See more details below.\n\nThe Stretch Goals:\nStretch Goal #1 $3,900 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 18 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS 1 bonus Art Print added to all Physical Perk tiers!\nStretch Goal #2 $5,200 - +7 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 25 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS every backer will receive a digital file with the concept art and character designs of: Marymae, Waldo, the Noble Pirates, and the Nightmare Man.\nStretch Goal #3: $6,600 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 33 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS all books will be upgraded and printed on Premium Paper\nStretch Goal #4 $7,900 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 41 pieces of art to enjoy!

When you look at stories\u2014and the way we talk about stories\u2014there\u2019s this sense that when a woman becomes a mother, she ceases to be the heroine. Instead, she\u2019s relegated to a supporting role for her children, who are now meant to be the center of her life and the only reason for her existence. There are exceptions, as there are in everything, but overall, we\u2019re left with the impression that once a woman becomes Mom, her tale ends. Mother figures also rarely figure into fiction the way father figures do. It\u2019s not often that the wise or experienced elder sought out by a young protagonist is a woman.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: A heroine doesn\u2019t stop being a heroine because a kid came into her life.\nSo I'm putting together this anthology to turn the spotlight on bad ass moms. This is inspired in part, of course, by my own bad ass mom, who emigrated from China to the U.S. fresh out of school, got her PhD in statistics, and named me after her personal heroine and another bad ass mom, Marie Curie (Mary and Marie are the same name in Chinese).\nSince moms and badassery come in infinite forms, I gave the contributing authors only one criterion: that their story be about a bad ass mother or mother figure. We\u2019ve got moms across the age and experience spectrum, from grandmas to new moms. We've got warrior moms and moms who are bad ass in a quieter way. We\u2019ve got biological moms, adoptive moms, and mom figures. A mom who runs a space colony, a hard-boiled detective mom, a witch mom, a coach who\u2019s a mom figure to her students\u2026 and much, much more.\nTo bring these stories to life, I've partnered with the Crazy 8 Press crew: Russ Colchamiro, Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman, Robert Greenberger, Glenn Hauman, Paul Kupperberg, and Aaron Rosenberg. \nI've also assembled a fantastic line-up of additional authors (some of whom are bad ass moms themselves!): Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Derek Tyler Attico, T. Eric Bakutis,  Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Heather E. Hutsell, Kris Katzen, Karissa Laurel, Khaalidah Muhammad-Ali, TJ Perkins, Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg, Joanna Schnurman, Hildy Silverman, and Denise Sutton.\nAnd who am I? Hi, I'm Mary Fan, author of sci-fi/fantasy books about intrepid heroines, including Stronger Than a Bronze Dragon, Artificial Absolutes, and Starswept. Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, Booklist, and Kirkus liked my books, so I guess I get to call myself \"critically acclaimed.\" I'm also the co-editor of the Brave New Girls anthology series about girls in STEM.\nOur awesome cover art is the work of Sean \"MunkyWrench\" Eddingfield (background art) and Streetlight Graphics (design and layout).\nThis a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package.

This marks my 17th published novel and my 7th crowdfunding campaign. I'm thrilled that two books in the series have made the New York Times Bestsellers list, three of the books became USA Today bestsellers, and three have made it onto the Washington Post Hardcover bestseller list on multiple occasions. This campaign has become the third most-backed and fourth most-funded fiction Kickstarter of all time.\nWell, we are down to our last one hour of the Kickstarter, and Robin and I wanted to say . . .\nto all backers old and new.  Your support of our work is truly amazing and we appreciate the faith you have put into the series and us in making this our best Kickstarter yet.  \nAnd for anyone who might have missed this Kickstarter, we have your back!  You'll be able to join the fun through the manual add process of Kickstarter. Just use this link and we'll get you added.\nAnd keep your eyes open for updates from Kickstarter and emails from BackerKit as we start rolling out the rewards!  We'll keep you in the loop!\nWhat is the book about? Here's the marketing copy from the back cover:\nA DOOR OPENS. AN ARMY OF DRAGONS ADVANCE. AND THE FATE OF THE LIVING RESTS WITH THE DEAD.\nAfter obtaining the secret to creating dragons, the leader of the Fhrey has turned the tide of war once more--but gaining the advantage has come at a terrible price. While Imaly plots to overthrow the fane for transgressions against his people, a mystic and a keeper are the only hope for the Rhunes. Time is short, and the future of both races hangs in the balance. In this exciting conclusion to the Legends of the First Empire series, the Great War finally comes to a climactic end, and with it dawns a new era in the Age of Empyre.\nFor returning readers, recaps are available so you can be reminded about what has happened so far. \nWant to check out my writing style? Well, it's a bit tricky because this book opens in the middle of the story, and I didn't want to expose people to spoilers. So to help mitigate that, I took the sample chapter and redacted the names by doing substitutions. I should note that this sample hasn't yet gone through copyediting, but it should be in relatively good shape.  Another spoiler-free option would be to read from the start of the series, so I included a sample chapter to Age of Myth (the first book of the series) as well.\nAge of Myth Sample Chapter\nAge of Empyre redacted Sample Chapter\nThis project mirrors my other Kickstarters, but for new people, I'm summarizing some important aspects of what you'll receive.\nAll physical books come signed: a perk for ordering the books directly from me.\nAll ebooks are DRM-free, which means you can load them on any device: computer, smartphone, and tablet without any locking feature preventing you from moving it from place to place.\nFor backing this project, your name will be printed in the Acknowledgment Section so everyone will know that you are an awesome supporter of the project (you can, of course, opt-out if you choose)\nThe official release through the retail channels is May 5, 2020, but all levels with ebooks will receive the story in March.\nFor the levels that provide a physical book, we've bundled the ebook to ensure early access to the story. If you don't want to pay for the ebook (for instance you only want a physical copy), there will be a process for you to pre-order just the hardcover after the Kickstarter is over.\nAnyone receiving the physical book will also receive a matching signed bookmark. If you choose a reward level with multiple books, each of them will also have a matching bookmark.\nIf you are missing one or more of the previous ebooks, you can purchase some of them here (use DIGITAL DOUBLE TROUBLE, DIGITAL THREE BOOK NIGHT, or the \"add-on\" feature) to get copies of Age of Legend, Age of Death, or extra copies of Age of Empyre for a friend. Unfortunately, we can't make the other ebooks available (Age of Myth, Age of Swords, and Age of War) because the rights are owned by Penguin Random House, and only they can sell copies of those titles. So, you'll have to buy books #1 through #3 from your favorite ebook retailer.\nIf you are missing one or more of the prior hardcovers, this Kickstarter is the best way to get them. Not only will they be signed, but they are sold at a discount ($25 rather than $27 or $28). Also, we have significantly discounted the shipping costs for people located outside the US, and future purchases won't have the \"bulk shipping\" advantage that a Kickstarter provides.\nThe Legends of the First Empire series is a six-book epic fantasy, and the first three books have been released by Del Rey (a fantasy imprint of Penguin Random House) from 2016 - 2018. The remaining three titles have been self-published and released on an accelerated schedule (3 books in a 10-month span: Age of Legend - Jul 2019 | Age of Death - Feb 2020 | Age of Empyre - May 2020).  \nLike my best-selling Riyria novels, these books are also set in the fictional world of Elan, but the events occur 3,000 years in the past. It IS NOT necessary to know anything about the other stories, but for those who do read both, you'll learn the truth about a number of lies regarding various historical figures. \nAt the time of this Kickstarter launch, Age of Death hasn't officially \"hit the street,\" but here is some data regarding how readers have rated the books in the series on Amazon, Goodreads, and Audible.com.  I'm proud that only 2.2% have had poor ratings (1- and 2-star) and the vast majority (nearly 90%) have garnered 4- and 5-stars.\nIn case you are not familiar with the other books in the series, here is a bit about each.\nAge of Myth:  Since time immemorial, humans have worshipped the gods they call Fhrey, truly a race apart: invincible in battle, masters of magic, and seemingly immortal. But when a god falls to a human blade, the balance of power between men and those they thought were gods changes forever. Now, only a few stand between humankind and annihilation: Raithe, reluctant to embrace his destiny as the God Killer, Suri, a young seer burdened by signs of impending doom, and Persephone, who must overcome personal tragedy to lead her people. The Age of Myth is over; the time of rebellion has begun.\nAge of Swords:  Raithe, the God Killer, may have started the rebellion by killing a Fhrey, but long-standing enmities dividing the Rhune make it all but impossible to unite against a common foe. And even if the clans can join forces, how will they defeat an enemy whose magical prowess makes the Fhrey indistinguishable from gods? The answer lies in a faraway land populated by a reclusive and dour race. With time running out, Persephone leads a small band of misfits in a desperate search for aid, a quest that will take them into the darkest depths of Elan. There, an ancient adversary waits\u2014an enemy as surprising as it is deadly.\nAge of War:  The alliance of humans and renegade Fhrey is fragile\u2014and about to be tested as never before. Persephone keeps the human clans from turning on one another through her iron will and a compassionate heart while Nyphron, seeks to advance his own nefarious agenda. Old loyalties will be challenged while fresh conspiracies will threaten to undo all that Persephone has accomplished. In the darkest hour, when hope is all but lost, new heroes will rise . . . but at what terrible cost?\nAge of Legend: After years of warfare, humanity has gained the upper hand and has pushed the Fhrey to the edge of their homeland\u2014but no farther. Now comes the pivotal moment. Persephone\u2019s plan to use the stalemate to seek peace is destroyed by an unexpected betrayal that threatens to hand victory to the Fhrey and leaves a dear friend in peril. Humanity\u2019s only hope lies in the legend of a witch, a forgotten song, and a simple garden door.\nAge of Death: Winter blankets the land, and more than hope has died. Barred by the tower of Avempartha, the western army cannot invade the Fhrey homeland. So it must seek a way across the Nidwalden River before the fane obtains the secret of dragons. As time runs out for both humanity and the mystic Suri, the only chance for the living rests with the dead. Having made their fateful choice, can a handful of misfits do the impossible, or are they forever lost to an inescapable grave? As in Virgil's Aeneid, Dante's Divine Comedy, and Milton's Paradise Lost, the most epic tales transcend the world of the living. It's time to see what lies in Elan's Age of Death. \nOkay, so we've learned a bit about the book and the series, but what about me? Well, my name is Michael J. Sullivan, and I\u2019m a full-time novelist. To type those words is kind of surreal, as writing isn't a career that most can make a living at. I'm eternally grateful to all my readers who make it feasible to live a dream I never thought would be possible.\nLike many (too many), my road to authorship wasn't an easy one. I wrote in a variety of genres from 1979 to 1994, and after thirteen novels and more than a hundred rejections, I quit after vowing never to write creatively again. Well, never turned out to be a bit more than a decade, as I couldn't suppress the itch to write any longer. Over those years, a story had been growing in my head, and I decided to write it but with a condition: I wouldn't seek publication. I hoped that a few friends and my dyslexic daughter (who had always struggled with reading) would take a look, and that would be good enough for me.\nAfter reading the books, my wife made it her mission to make sure they saw the light of day. She willed them into existence, first with a small-press (who was well-intentioned but ultimately provided us no income nor any substantial readership), later through self-publishing (which worked much better), and eventually, she attracted the interest of Orbit (the fantasy imprint of a big-five publisher, Hachette Book Group). The rest, as they say, is history.\nIn the publishing business, I'm what's referred to as a \"hybrid\" because I've released books through traditional publishers as well as utilizing self-publishing.  If you want to learn why I do that, you can look at the Why Self-Publish section below.\nAll told, I've written 32 novels: 13 are sitting in a trunk never to see the light of day, 12 are released by a traditional publisher, 11 are currently or previously self-published,  1 is releasing soon, and 2 more are written (these are books in my next series, The Rise and the Fall). \nSome of my publishing accomplishments include:\nNew York Times Bestselling Author (twice)\nUSA Today Bestselling Author (3 times)\n3 books with multiple appearances on the Washington Post Hardcover Bestseller list\n2M+ English language books sold\n90+ foreign language contracts in 14 languages\n2,200+ days (6.0+ years) on the Amazon Top 100 Fantasy Author list\n8-time Goodreads Choice Award Nominee\n4 Earphone Award Wins and one Audie Award Nomination\nOne of the Top 50 most-followed authors on Goodreads\nNamed by io9 as one of the most successful self-published science fiction and fantasy authors\nNamed to more than 260 best-of or most-anticipated lists including those compiled by Library Journal, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Audible, and Goodreads.  \nThis handy chart provides a quick and easy way to determine what you receive at the various reward levels.  \nAs you can see, we offer a wide range of pledge levels from the low-level $5 to the comprehensive \"All In\" ($25 per book + $10 for ebook) which provides all six novels of the series as well as early access to the story via the ebook. For the multi-book levels, you'll be able to select which titles you desire for each book and you can even use it to buy multiple copies of the Age of Empyre book.\nBecause we will be using BackerKit to fulfill the project, this allows backers to customize their pledge to get exactly the items they are interested in. To receive these \"Add-ons\" you should do the following:\nSelect the reward level that covers the largest number of items you want to receive.\nSelect the \"Add-ons\" from the table below and note the cost of each.\nIncrease your pledge amount to include your pledge level plus the costs of the desired add-ons.\nWhen the Kickstarter is over you'll be able to \"distribute\" that excess money to the various desired add-ons.\nBelow is the list of add-ons available:\n\nIn addition, we'll also continue Robin's Tip Jar (as it was missed in recent Kickstarters, and people appreciated its return in the last Kickstarter. Some notes about a few of the add-ons.\nMontemorcey Bag - for the last Kickstarter, we offered this in black but the supplier has had problems keeping that color in stock. So, this time around we switched to a \"natural\" color with green handles (which we have never seen go out of stock). All other aspects of the bag will be the same. The size is 12\" x 13\" x 5\".\nSullifan Bag - One of the stretch goals was an alternate bag design and we decided to make a heraldic crest for \"Sullifans\" The design is a work in progress, but I wanted to show you the direction we are going. This crest features items from both series (the Tower of Avempartha and a Gilarabrwn. Then also images specific to Legends (Magda) and Riyria (Hadrian's swords, and Royce and Hadrian riding into Medford). Like the other tote bag, this will also be a \"natural\" color with green handles. All other aspects of the bag will be the same. The size is 12\" x 13\" x 5\".\n We suspect that many of the backers of this Kickstarter also backed the last one (and as such you already have a set of 5 bookmarks). So as to not kill a bunch of trees, and double up EVERYONE who buys a book on this Kickstarter) we are ONLY   adding the new bookmark (Age of Empyre) to the single book orders (multiple-book orders will have a bookmark that matches each book).  But if you missed getting the \"5-set bookmarks\" you can order a complete set separately. NOTE: Only the Age of Empyre bookmark will be signed.\nHere are some examples to help you figure out how to calculate various orders with \"Add-ons\" included. \nYou missed the Age of Death Kickstarter, so now want to get ebooks and hardcovers for both it and Age of Empyre.  You should choose the pledge level \"DOUBLE TROUBLE\" ($60) and add $10 (total of $70 + shipping) to get the Age of Death ebook.\nYou generally read ebooks but you like the design of the bookmarks and would like to get a set. Plus you also want the tote bag. If you are in Canada you would choose to make your pledge $10 (digital delight), $5 for the bookmarks, and $40 for the bag. That's a total of $55. If you also wanted the hardcover you would pledge $35 (Hardcore), $5 for the bookmarks, and $30 for the bag. That's a total of $70.\nYou live in the US, read ebooks, and you would like to get the tote bag. You would pledge $35 ($10 for the DIGITAL DELIGHT level) + $25 for the tote bag. \nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $100,000 - short story bundle (12 tales) (UNLOCKED) - So, I did a little analysis from one Kickstarter to another and discovered there was 29% carryover from HW to DoD, 32% from DoD to DoWD, 28% fro DoWD to AOL, and 39% from AoL to AoD. That means there is a good number of backers who haven't received various short stories. So I'm going to make the first goal a HUGE set every short I've written so far. Including: \n Riyria: The Thieves, The Viscount and the Witch, The Jester, Professional Integrity, The Ashmoore Affair\n Legends: Little Wren and the Big Forest, Pile of Bones\n Tales from Elan: Traditions\n Unrelated Shorts: The Game, Burning Alexandria, Autumn Mists\n Comic book Short: The Jester\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $119,338 or 3,103 backers  - the untold story (UNLOCKED)-  With the entire tale told, it's possible to talk about the series without fear of spoilers if we meet this level, Michael and Robin will produce a free ebook which will peel back some of the hidden gems of the Legends of the First Empire and delve into the decision making progress regarding how the story was told, and even discuss the road to publishing. Why such an odd reward level? Well those are the number needed to move this project from 7th to 6th (in most-funded) and from 4th to 3rd (in most-backed)\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $125,000 -  A second tote-bag design (UNLOCKED). If we reach this stretch goal we'll have Cory Freeman (the man that designed the Montemorcey label), design up a new image related to the world of Elan. When buying a tote bag you'll be able to decide which image you want. Or you can add it to your order and receive two different bags.\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - $155,367 -  Free Anthology: Heroes Wanted. Best Anthology winner on reddit /r/fantasy for 2019. 19 short stories by some of the best new voices in fantasy. Each is centered around heroes of all shapes and sizes, including a Royce and Hadrian short story (which is already included in Stretch Goal #1.\n Unfortunately, I'm not able to offer the audiobook as part of the Kickstarter (it's under license to Audible Studios, and only they can distribute it), but that doesn't mean you can't join the fun. You can back at either the SOUND ADVICE level (no ebook) or the DIGITAL DELIGHT level (includes ebook), and you'll still get exclusive bonus perks that only backers of the Kickstarter will receive. Oh, and the audiobook will be available on release day, so be sure to pre-order the audiobook now to receive it on May 5th.  \nWe have no desire to make a profit shipping the books, so we have priced our shipping fees at cost. That said, all the fees do add up. Here are some of the things the shipping costs cover: postage, insurance, packing material, fulfillment company picking and packing fees, and shipping the books to the fulfillment company.  Shipping is automatically added to your pledge and is based on your country. We've deeply discounted foreign postage rates so that the shipping for a single book is $7 - $9 regardless of your location.\nUS: $7 - $14\nCanada: $8 - $15\nMost foreign countries: $9 - $16\nNote: Some foreign countries have higher shipping, but we have applied discounts to keep this expensive as low as possible. \nNormally when buying directly from us, we ship via the USPS, and this is very expensive. But doing a Kickstarter allows us to consolidate a number of orders, send one large shipment, and utilize fulfillment partners in various overseas markets (like Canada and Europe). Shipping locally means that backers will not have to pay VAT, customs, or import fees (we'll absorb those costs), and it also helps to keep the overseas shipping costs down. Even with all those efforts, postage can drive up the cost to non-us backers, so we're taking some of our profits and using it to drive down the shipping costs further. Here are the discounts we have applied:\n1 book: $7 - $13\n2 books: $5 - $18\n3 books: $5 - $25\n4 books: $5 - $28\n5 books: $5 - $28\n6 books: $5 - $30\nIf you are outside the US and want to get hardcover copies, there will never be a better time than now.\n If you've read or listened to any of my books in the past, many of these names will be familiar to you as I've developed a finely tuned team that has been with me for years. It includes:\n Marc Simonetti (cover artist) - Marc has created 15 covers for my books (for both the US and foreign translations) and also has illustrated covers for some of the biggest names in the business including George R.R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss, Terry Pratchett, and dozens more.\n Tim Gerard Reynolds (audiobook narrator) - Tim has recorded 14 novels of mine, and he's also narrated books by Pierce Brown, Mark Lawrence, Larry Correia, Edward W. Robertson, Jonathan Renshaw, and Gail Z. Martin. He's won multiple Earphone Awards and has been nominated for several Audies.\n Laura Jorstad (copy editor) - works for multiple fantasy publishers (Del Rey, Ballantine Books, St. Martins, and Sterling Publishing just to name a few). She's edited books by David Gemmel, Naomi Novik, a number of the books in the Star Wars franchise, two New York Times Bestsellers from Steve Berry, and eight of my novels.\n Linda Branam (copy editor) - has been editing for 20+ years and has a passion for fiction. This is my seventh project with her.\n Shawn Speakman (publisher/distributor) - Shawn started up Grim Oak Press to help pay medical bills after beating cancer a second time. Generally, he's produced anthologies and premium hardcovers, and Age of Empyre will be the third time he's releasing a trade publication. Some of the authors Shawn has worked with include: Terry Brooks, Brandon Sanderson, Raymond E. Feist, Pierce Brown, Naomi Novik, Jacquelin Carey, Jim Butcher, Stephen R. Donaldson, Mark Lawrence, Janny Wurtz, Peter Orullian, and Barbara Hambly.\n BoxInBoxOut - is an order fulfillment company based in Madison Virginia. They've been shipping books ordered from our website for more than a year, and they expertly handled the shipping for our last Kickstarter Age of Legend. I've found them to be professional, conscientious, and hardworking. They've shipped more than 9,500 books for us and they make running a Kickstarter so much easier than when we used to do all the shipping ourselves.\nAs I mentioned, this will be my 7th crowdfunding campaign, and I'm proud to say they have all been a huge success. In fact, several of them rank on the top of the charts both in the number of backers and the funds raised.\nRanked #3, #4, #5, #7, and #9 of the most-backed fiction projects of all time.\nRanked #4, #5, #7, #9, and #13 when looking at the most-funded fiction projects. \nIf you want to check out what people have said about the past projects and explore our track record for delivery and service,  you can see them at the following links.\nAge of Death\nAge of Legend\n Age of Swords (Indiegogo)\nThe Disappearance of Winter's Daughter\nThe Death of Dulgath\nHollow World\nI think it's important that backers know where their hard-earned cash is going. The price of each component is shown below.\nWe set the goal of the Kickstarter at about half that amount, so if we end up \"just squeaking by, the costs of the hardcover will be split between the supporters and us. If past performance is any indication we should be able to clear that bar easily. \nSince 2011, most of my books have been traditionally published, and so you may be wondering why I'm self-publishing this title. There are a few reasons. The first has to do with audio rights. When we signed the original contract for the first three books in the Legends of the First Empire series, the rights included just ebook and print, which was good because the audiobook rights for the entire series had already been sold. When it came time to negotiate for the last three books, a change in corporate policy from Penguin Random House required audiobook rights as well, so for this reason, it became impossible for us to publish those books with Del Rey.\nBut aside from that, we've been self-publishing since 2009, and it's an approach we really enjoy. Age of Empyre will be my 12th indie novel (I released 6 books from 2009 - 2012 and another 6 from 2014 - 2020). Having done both self and traditional, I find producing the book myself is (a) easier (b) creates a better product (c) is more profitable and (d) offers me greater freedom. With all those advantages, it's little wonder why I'm going to be self-publishing all my titles from now on.\nNow, for all the good things about self-publishing, there are some downsides as well. First, it's the publisher that pays all the out-of-pocket expenses. Hopefully, the Kickstarter will help on that front. Second, traditionally-published advances ensure a certain amount of guaranteed income to the author.  With self-publishing, you could end up losing money, and again the Kickstarter helps with this. Third, self-published titles rarely make it onto shelves in bookstores and libraries.  To solve this last problem, I'm partnering with Shawn Speakman at Grim Oak Press who will be using his distribution contacts to get Age of Empyre into bookstores worldwide.  I had the same arrangement for Age of Legend and Age of Death, and so far it's been working wonderfully, but my contract with Shawn is quite unconventional. Basically, I'm assuming all the capital expenditures, and he'll take a cut of each copy sold through the retail chains. My hope is this will work well for both of us, and if so, then it may open a whole new business model for Shawn, someone who is already a publishing veteran and thinking outside the box. \nOkay, so that's why the book is self-published, but why do a Kickstarter? The obvious answer revolves around the high cost of a large print run, but as I already mentioned, we could take out a loan for that. But having done six other crowdfunding projects, I can honestly say that we love how this platform is democratizing the creation of art. It's an incredible experience to be part of a group who are all pulling for the success of a project and spreading their enthusiasm to others. Plus, getting the story in people's hands early can help build excitement before the books ship to the population at large. Also, Kickstarter provides a system for me to offer additional perks to the people who are financially backing my project. Without Kickstarter, getting people's names in the book, and providing bookmarks would be difficult or impossible.\nI also love the fact that Kickstarter removes middlemen. For instance, Amazon takes 55% off the top for any print books sold, and when you factor in the costs of the distribution partners that can mean 80% of the list price goes to others. Ebook margins are better. I only lose 30% with them, but that's still much more than doing a Kickstarter. Yes, Kickstarter is a middleman, but their fees (including BackerKit and credit card processing) are just 10%. That's a huge difference. So by running a Kickstarter, it ensures the highest percentage of your purchase comes directly to the person who created the book. \nWell, that's all I can think of for now. I'll be updating the FAQ's as the project continues and adding stretch goals if the project funds. If you have any questions, just drop me a line. I'd also like to take just a minute to thank those who have been reading my books over the last decade. It's because of you that I'm able to live my life-long dream, and it's something that I'm always grateful for. I'll keep writing, and hopefully, you'll continue reading.\n-- Michael & Robin Sullivan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGenerally, the most significant risks with novel projects are (a) will the author finish the book (b) can they write well and (c) can they handle the logistics of distribution? With this project, the book is already written, and I've provided writing samples for you to evaluate my writing style. As for distribution, I've been working with BoxInBoxOut for the last two years, and they've shipped more than 9,500 books for me. They will continue to be my partner for this project, and having them involved means timely shipping and carefully packaged parcels.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "SOUND ADVICE", "descp": "You can join the fun and show your support to make this project a success without receiving the book.

In a world where what we see and experience is driven by want and immediacy, No Business Magazine encourages readers to slow down while exploring stories of artists and art-making. The No Biz Mag team is intentional in how we present these stories in our arts and culture publication, and we spend quality time conceptualizing every issue to make sure we\u2019re truly incorporating the people and their knowledge within the book.\n\nHow can we make interactions and \u201cconsumption\u201d of art and culture more meaningful? How can we move away from art conversations starting with \u2014 \u201cHow much is that piece?\u201d\nHOW IT CAME ABOUT\n\"No Business Magazine grew out of an earlier concept-based publication. It was a very special project, and now I get to revive it with good friend and highly talented designer, Hanna Peterson. About two years ago, my partner Eli Show (an artist) and I started a concept-heavy arts and culture publication (self published, often screen-printed in our basement) called Sound + Color and published three issues over the year, but things slowed down with a toddler in tow. I also realized that I wanted to use this collaborative project to work with another friend. Hanna is the absolute best!\" \u2014 Angela Zonunpari, No Business Magazine.\nINTENT\nWe have visited at length to see what form this publication could take and we've fulfilled a lot of those goals with our first issue, Identity. We\u2019re committed to making something good and memorable. We want to encourage people to slow down and interact with the printed matter, but also empower them to have more honest conversations about art and culture, outside of art events. \"No Business Magazine\" because we won\u2019t deal with the business side of art/culture, won\u2019t look at art as commodity, but we'll actively try to talk about concept, art practice, and an artist\u2019s work as is. We want to learn about the ideas behind bodies of work. Basically, we don\u2019t want art conversations to start with \u2014 how much is it? Yes, to make more art, artists have to sell work, but we want to dwell more on artists and the works they\u2019re making. We want to lift up the ideas behind art. So, no business, just broad themes we\u2019d visit with each issue.\nThe themes help us narrow down and zero in on artists, art practices and concepts we want to visit as No Business Magazine. Our curation of artists and concepts in each issue spans United States, and we are continuously working to connect with people from around the world as well. We can't exist or thrive in silos, and we whole-heartedly embrace intersectionality, hybridity, and fluidity in people, ideas, and practice.\nOur design, editorial guidelines and concept for No Business Magazine follow a similar path of how we approached Sound + Color. We\u2019re intentional in what we\u2019re doing, the people we\u2019re connecting with, and how we\u2019re presenting all of it in each issue of the publication. Our plan is to have a limited print run for each issue which will be distributed in conjunction with two other things we're working towards: artist open studios and curated house art shows. Our timelines are a little loose as compared to standard publications, as we depend on donations or grant funding. And also because we want to be truly intentional in what we produce \u2014 sort of like creating an art object. This is truly a labor of love.\nISSUE ONE: IDENTITY\nFor No Business Magazine, we developed an approach to make our scope wider (in relation to our last series of zines) \u2014 in artists and writers we connected with, art that we talked and wrote about, and geography. For our first issue, we decided to explore identity in various forms and concepts \u2014 how identity has formed art and art choices, how choices and art has impacted identity, or how an identity is formed and/or presented through concepts in art. We produced Identity, our first issue last June, with launch events in Omaha (NE) and Sioux Falls (SD) in conjunction to a curated art show and artist open studios. \nThe people featured in Identity touch on very different things, from photographing a Burmese refugee community in Zomi Town aka Tulsa, a popular American sport influencing art practices, exploring identity as an outsider, looking at hybrid identity through art, how fan fiction manifests itself in art, to finding community within a subculture. So, we decided to use these ideas to inspire our approach for designing the whole publication. Our intention with every issue is to make it an immersive and interactive experience for the reader, with a hope that it will lead to more nuanced conversations / interactions with art.\nFor our first issue, Identity, we used various printing methods and interactive printed materials alongside varying layouts to relate to the content, concept, and artist.\nOur first issue wouldn't have been possible without the energy, time, knowledge, and opportunity shared by Daniel Mung, Amelie Mancini, Paul Dressen, Marsha Mack, Lorraine Rubio, Brian Bieber, University Libraries at the University of South Dakota, Amy Jarding, Eli Show, Amanda Smith, and Amplify Arts. The launch of No Business Magazine and limited run of Identity was through grant funding from AIGA South Dakota and Sioux Falls Arts Council. \nISSUE TWO: POWER COLORS\n\"When I\u2019m looking at art, I think of it as a friendly and passionate conversation with the artist. It becomes a layered interaction. Art-making embodies so much of an artist\u2019s history, personality and aesthetic. And, as a viewer, we often project our experiences and understanding of things onto an artist\u2019s work.\" \u2014 Angela Zonunpari\nPower Colors is a tiny intersection of individual histories, perception, and manifestation of personalities. Our intention with the second issue of No Business Magazine is to present artists and works that push us to look beyond their surface value and survey how / why they find power within color.\nWe're pretty excited about our line-up for Power Colors, slated to go to print at the beginning of April 2020.  We're hoping to step it up a notch with artists we connect with and the final book we produce! With your support and encouragement, we'll be able to produce a wonderful and cherished art book that aims to add value to our art interactions.\nPEOPLE\nNo Business Magazine is a collaboration project between Angela Zonunpari and Hanna Peterson, with support from Amy Jarding and other artists across the country.\nAngela Zonunpari is an arts writer, based in Sioux Falls, SD. She moved to the United States from India in 2013 to get a masters in arts journalism from Syracuse University, NY. Over the years, she's written about visual arts, music, dance, opera, theatre, and comedy. Zonunpari worked with multiple arts and community organizations while living in New York, including Rubin Museum of Art, artnet News, BRIC Arts | Media, and Bonhams Auctioneers.

The agency houses Ipso Gallery, an art space that promotes ideas and creative thinking, while curating distinct art experiences for the community. Zonunpari plays a significant role in supporting the curator and gallery director of Ipso, in community outreach, media relations, and more recently, curation. Before No Business Magazine, she produced an arts publication, Sound + Color, with her partner / artist Eli Show in 2017.\n@angelazonunpari | angela.zonunpari@gmail.com\nHanna Peterson is a graphic designer based in Minneapolis, MN.

That\u2019s about 1 out of every 145 U.S. citizens. Each of these prisoners has a network of friends and family members that all have one question on their minds; \u201cWhen my loved one gets out, what will prevent them from reoffending and going right back into jail again?\u201d Get Out for Good gives practical, biblical advice to address this question.\n\nScott Stroud, was incarcerated in 1991 for four years as the result of an armed robbery he committed at the age of twenty-one. While in prison he placed his trust in Jesus as his personal Lord and Savior. Since his release he has successfully stayed out of trouble with the law, owned his own business, and is currently an ordained pastor. This did not occur by accident, but rather was the result of certain practices he was taught by mentors after regaining his freedom. He now desires to share these practical steps with those who are facing release from incarceration. \n\nHe also writes to their families and friends regarding pitfalls they can avoid as they encourage their loved ones upon reentering society. Drawing from his ministry experience of working with hundreds of prisons, Scott knows that by implementing these simple practices into everyday life the chances for success on the outside increase exponentially. Additionally, each chapter contains discussion questions for group study. \nPlease support this critical project! One pastor tried to help his uncle get readjusted to society upon his release from prison and couldn't find any resources available online. He even went to two prisons and spoke with the chaplains there. They just stared at him blankly never having heard of such a book.

The moment the words were out of her mouth the title came tumbling out of mine: Gaslight & Grimm! At the same time, I already knew exactly which tale I myself wanted to tell. Growing up, I had a record album that played an audio version of Beauty and the Beast on one side and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves on the other. I wore out the side with Ali Baba...and oh, what a rich tale to tell, with so much potential for a steampunk spin.\nI wanted to do it right, though. I wanted to capture the culture and the storytelling traditions of the Middle East. This is why I made the best decision of my literary career: I asked my good friend Day Al-Mohamed to be my cultural consultant. In the end, she turned into my co-author.\nThe irony? Between us, Baba Ali grew so large that it turned into a novel, one that published two years before Gaslight & Grimm. \nThe original cover by Autumn Frederickson.\nUnfortunately, the publisher who published it had some management issues and ceased to be...which means so did Baba Ali, at least from a commercial standpoint. \neSpec Books wants to rectify that, reissuing the book through our Paper Phoenix Press imprint. Could you help us make that happen?\nCome, Best Beloved, and sit you by my feet. I shall tell you a tale such as sister Scheherazade could have scarce imagined\u2026\nIn the Nejd there is nothing at all\u2026except secrets. A band of thieves wishes such secrets to remain hidden.\nIn England, far from his desert home, Ali bin-Massoud serves as apprentice to the famed Charles Babbage. One night a mysterious box is delivered by a clockwork falcon and Ali\u2019s world is never the same again. Heartache, danger, and thieves mark his journey as Ali is summoned home at the death of his father.\nIt will take faith, knowledge, and yes, love to realize his destiny, and more than a little skill with steam-driven technology. Can he unravel the mystery of the puzzle box and the clockwork djinn before it is too late? An ancient legacy and Ali's very life depend on his success.\nHear you the tale of Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn.\n___________________________________________\nPraise for Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn:\n\u201cRich with steampunk, magic, and an enchanting setting, this story casts a spell and won\u2019t let go until the very last page!\u201d \u2014Maria V.

There was a time when traditional publishers would happily go out on a limb, trying shared-world anthologies and other innovative approaches to the literature. These days, they have to play the game much closer to the vest.\nHowever, you and I--and writers and readers all over the world--aren't bound by the same limitations. We can create, support, and enjoy science fiction that goes directly from creator to audience, taking all the chances that audience can handle.\nAnd in Pangaea, there's plenty to enjoy.\nOne Land\nAt least four times in Earth\u2019s history, the continents have come sliding together. Over millions of years, separate and distinct landmasses have crawled across the planet's surface on immense tectonic plates to form a single mass--a super-continent. Geologists have dubbed the most recent such formation Pangaea.\nOf course, Pangaea broke up a long time ago, and because it did, mankind developed in drastically different climes and circumstances. But what if we twenty-first century types were living in one of the super-continental periods--those characterized by \u201clid tectonics\u201d rather than \u201cplate tectonics?\u201d What would it be like if all of humanity was confined to a single landmass...and had been so confined for all of our recorded history?\nThat's the ever-so-tantalizing axis on which our Pangaea anthologies turn.\nIt's an exciting and original idea, one that deserves the best shared world-building talent available. So to explore this world on your behalf, we've harnessed the word-smithing abilities of some of science fiction's most inventive writers.\nThe Pangaea Publishing Model\nIn a traditional publishing arrangement, less than 10% of the proceeds from a book go to the author. Hard to believe, isn't it, considering the author is the one providing 100% of the insight and wit? The lion's share of the cover price goes to the book store and the publisher, to cover both their costs and their profits.\nIn the case of this anthology, all proceeds after production and distribution costs go to the writers whose work drew you to the book in the first place--which, after all, is how it should be. When you support Pangaea, you're supporting a new and infinitely more equitable publishing model. You're saying that writers should finally enjoy the fruits of their labor.\nIt's a subversive idea, no question about it. But we believe it's an idea whose time has come.\nWho's We?\nSome of the most respected writers in science fiction and fantasy today. Ilsa J. Bick. Michael A. Burstein. Russ Colchamiro. Peter David. Keith R.A. DeCandido. Kevin Dilmore. Mary Fan. Michael Jan Friedman. Robert Greenberger. Glenn Hauman. Paul Kupperberg. Ron Marz. Aaron Rosenberg. Lawrence M. Schoen. Geoffrey Thorne. Tiffany Trent. Marie Vibbert. Dayton Ward.\nNot just great writers, by the way. They're also people who love and respect their craft and their chosen genre. If you get a chance to speak with them, you'll hear the excitement in their voices as they talk about their contributions to the Pangaea series.\nA La Carte Menu\nRather than ask you to read every possible combination of reward components, here's a handy menu for add-ons. Remember, these are additions to the rewards you'll see on the right side of the web page. All you have to do, when you pledge, is send me a message as to which add-ons you'd like and I'll take care of the rest.\nFor $11 more, you can add an 8\" by 10\" suitable-for-framing print of the cover of Pangaea III, which I'll autograph at no additional charge. \nFor $15 more, you can become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the book's Acknowledgements page.\nFor $18 more, you can add one of our two author sampler packages of five e-books each, culled from the best work of the writers contributing to Pangaea III. ($36 more for both packages. Packages to be announced.)\nPACKAGE #1\nDragon Precinct By Keith R.A. DeCandido\nCabal and Other Unlikely Invocations of the Muse by Michael Jan Friedman\nToo Tall for Small by Aaron Rosenberg\nLove, Murder & Mayhem: Cosmic Tales of the Heart edited by Russ Colchamiro\nThe Camelot Papers by Peter David\n\nPACKAGE #2\nUnicorn Precinct by Keith R.A.

Both books will be signed by at least three of our writers. \nFor $20 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of the original Pangaea anthology OR Pangaea II: The Rise of Dominjaron to your reward at the $25 level or higher. This book will be signed by at least three of our writers.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your Pangaea III trade paperback to a hardcover edition.\nFor an additional $20, you can add on a physical copy of one of my other Crazy 8 Press books: The Hammer and The Horn, The Seekers and The Sword, The Fortress and the Fire, Fight The Gods, Aztlan, I Am The Salamander, Lost Days, Cabal and Other Unlikely Invocations of The Muse, and Headless and Other Improbable Excitations of The Muse. Any two would be $40, three would be $60, four would be $80, etc. If you're outside the U.S., please add $23 to each book for postage. Of course, I'll be happy to sign these books at no additional charge.\nFor an additional $25, you can add on one of my bestselling hardcover Star Trek novels: The Valiant or Death In Winter. Together, they would be $50. If you're outside the U.S., please add $23 to each book for postage. Of course, I'll be happy to sign them for free. (These are limited to five of each title, so if you're interested don't wait too long.) \nFor $30 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of Altered States of the Union, Glenn Hauman's wild and wooly alternate history anthology. Positing a slew of Americas that might have been if history had taken a different turn here or there, it features the work of David Gerrold, Peter David, Keith R.A. DeCandido, yours truly, and many others.\nFor $22 more, you can name a business, a street, or a one-time bystander (phonetically, of course, since this is not our world)--and also become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the Acknowledgments page.\nFor $700 more, you or someone you love will receive a large print of an alternate cover to the anthology suitable for framing -- a one-of-a-kind, custom treat created with your input and signed by talented Brazilian painter Caio Cacau -- as well as smaller prints of the sketches that went into the development of the alternate cover. (No additional postage necessary within the U.S. Outside the U.S., add $50.)\nStretch Goals!\nAt $8,500, we add a fourth author signature to every copy of Pangaea III that we send out to our backers.\nAt $9,000, we send every backer from $8 on up a DRM-free e-copy of Tales of the Crimson Keep (the Newly Renovated Edition), a shared world anthology produced by the unlimited miscreants at Crazy 8 Press (a cadre to which I am proud to belong).\nAt $10,000, we send every backer from $8 on up a DRM-free e-copy of Fight The Gods, \"a contemporary fantasy with its roots sunk deep into the soil of Greek mythology.\"\nAt $11,000, we unlock an additional value: Caio Cacau, our cover artist, will provide a black-and-white illustration for each of our stories, to be included in every edition of the book.\nAt $12,000, every physical-reward backer from $25 up receives a 5\" by 8\" copy of one of Caio's black-and-white illustrations.\nAdditional stretch goals will be announced as we go along (It's more fun when we keep you in suspense)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done a bunch of these Kickstarter campaigns now and I've always sent out all the rewards I said I would. Barring worldwide catastrophe, that will happen again.

We're now trying to stretch go further goals (like a FOURTH anthology if we hit $30K), but the open call for submissions to our three current anthologies of APOCALYPTIC, GALACTIC STEW, and MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK is now...well, open!!! Go to  https://jpskewedthrone.dreamwidth.org/499730.html   to read the fine print on how to submit your story and possibly end up in one of our anthologies, including contract terms, payment, timeline, etc.  Then write, revise, polish, and submit!\nThis project will fund THREE science fiction and fantasy anthologies, titled APOCALYPTIC, GALACTIC STEW, and MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK, containing approximately 14 all-original (no reprint) short stories each from established SF&F authors in the field and new voices found through an open call. The books will be edited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier (APOCALYPTIC), David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier (GALACTIC STEW), and Crystal Sarakas & Joshua Palmatier (MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK). \nAPOCALYPTIC:\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good apocalyptic story? They come in all kinds, from the straight up SF/horror of Stephen King\u2019s superflu in \u201cThe Stand\u201d and the zombie apocalypse in \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d to the quieter, more reflective tales of loss and survival in \u201cOn the Beach\u201d and \u201cChildhood\u2019s End.\u201d Tales that feature people struggling through the end of the world--or fighting to survive in what remains--are always compelling. What better way for readers to safely explore the extremes of the human condition without actually having to fight off the ravening hordes themselves? For this anthology, we\u2019ll be looking for unique takes on how the world ends, both during and after the apocalypse. So bring on your asteroids, your plagues, your solar flares! And ask yourself, would you survive the apocalypse? Would you even want to?  \nEdited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier, APOCALYPTIC will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include: \nStephen Blackmoore, \nJames Enge, \nNancy Holzner, \nTanya Huff, \nViolette Malan, \nSeanan McGuire, and \nS.M. Stirling\nGALACTIC STEW:\nFood is an essential part of life\u2014not just for energy and exotic flavors, but as a unifier during social events, a focal point for establishing culture, and shared experience to put people at ease. In GALACTIC STEW, readers will sit down at the communal table and sup upon stories centered on food.  Whether it\u2019s a tense treaty negotiation over a full course meal or a trap devised by the fae to chain you to their realm, these stories are certain to be delectable.  Come and savor these delicacies\u2026and hope the taste doesn\u2019t mask a deadly poison!\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, GALACTIC STEW will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each. Anchor authors include:\nRod Belcher, \nAndy Duncan, \nEsther Friesner, \nD.B. Jackson, \nHoward Andrew Jones, \nGini Koch, and \nLaura Resnick \nMY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK:\nWhen NASA's Opportunity rover sent its last message from Mars--loosely translated by scientists as \u201cmy battery is low and it is getting dark\u201d--many of us paused in a shared moment of sadness and gratitude, aimed at a robot left alone on a faraway planet. That moment inspired this anthology. We want stories about technology that has operated long past its time, but we want to give these lost spirits new life, whether it be rescue, a new purpose, a new beginning, or a simple homecoming. What happens to the robots and rovers and AIs and more after their original purpose has faded? What is the next chapter of their story?\nEdited by Crystal Sarakas & Joshua Palmatier, MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include:\nJacey Bedford, \nTroy Carrol Bucher, \nJohn Hartness, \nJos\u00e9 Pablo Iriarte,\nAlethea Kontis, \nStephen Leigh, \nMerc Fenn Wolfmoor, \nKari Sperring, and \nEdward Willett\nBackers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade paperback edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run. \nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition! \nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors. Check out our current offerings: \nTemporally Out of Order  \nAlien Artifacts  \nWere- \nSubmerged  \nAll Hail Our Robot Conquerors!  \nThe Death of All Things \nGuilds & Glaives\nSecond Round: A Return to the Ur-Bar \nThe Razor's Edge \nPortals\nTemporally Deactivated\nAlternate Peace\nat https://squareup.com/market/zombies-need-brains-llc. You can also find them online at Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble; they are available in trade paperback format as well as on almost all ebook platforms (Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Scribd, etc.). \nWe offer professional pay rates and feature stellar cover art. As we did in our previous anthologies, we plan to include the very best stories we can find, spanning the gamut from bestselling authors to previously unpublished voices, including an open submission call if the Kickstarter is successful, where anyone can submit their stories featuring the current themes for a chance to be part of the final product. And Zombies Need Brains is officially a \"qualifying market\" for the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA)!  With your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you! Consider backing our Kickstarter and then help spread the word. Just as Zombies Need Brains, we need your support to make this new small press a success!  \nFirst Day Backers: Anyone pledging $7 or more during the first 24 hours of the Kickstarter will receive the ebook \"Cocoon\" by Joshua Palmatier.\nPre $5K Incentive: Anyone pledging $7 or more before the Kickstarter hits $5,000 will receive the ebook \"Seeds\" by Benjamin Tate (aka Joshua Palmatier).\nPre $10K Incentive: Anyone pledging $7 or more before the Kickstarter hits $10,000 will receive the ebook \"Bubba the Monster Hunter Season 1\" by John G.

The cover art for \u201cApocalyptic\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter. \n\"Apocalyptic\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nThe following is a Reward Level Rundown for most of the rewards where the backer will get all three of the three anthologies in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback format. There are a few reward levels not listed, such as those where the backer gets only one or two of the anthologies in either format, as well as a few special reward levels where the backer will get ALL of the currently-available backlist from Zombies Need Brains in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback--those three levels are ZNB Ebook Zombie, ZNB Kickstarter Zombie, and ZNB Ebook Kickstarter Zombie.\nKickstarter Reward Level Rundown\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2019. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of February 2020 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2020. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 8 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising. \nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far: \nStretch Goal: At $27,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"The Royal Scam\" by Gini Koch, the first installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Daughter of the Sands\" by Joshua Palmatier. \nStretch Goal: A FOURTH ANTHOLOGY!:  At $30,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FOURTH themed anthology, RAMMING THE RAMPARTS in ebook format. This anthology asks authors to explore these and other absurd, surrealistic alternate histories.  The inspiration comes from our current President's recent commentary on the Fourth of July, including the idea that our Army \"took over the airports\" during the Revolutionary War.  What if there had been airports during that war?  Absurd!  George Washington was not a fighter pilot!  There was no \"Battle at LaGuardia Baggage Claim\"!  And yet...  The anthology will contain 12 stories by Gerald Brandt, David B. Coe, Esther Friesner, Elektra Hammond, Nancy Holzner, Walter H. Hunt, Gini Koch, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Rhondi Salsitz, Steven H Silver, Alan Smale, and Harry Turtledove.  It will be edited by Joshua Palmatier.  Details about how to add the ebook version of this anthology to your reward level will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.  This anthology will NOT have an open call UNLESS we reach $35,000 in the Kickstarter.  It will NOT be produced in paperback UNLESS we reach $40,000 in the Kickstarter.  (See the later stretch goals.)\nStretch Goal: At $32,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"When Josie Comes Home\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the first installment of THE NEW WEST series AND every backer pledging $7 or more will receive the ebook \"An Alewife in Kish\" by Benjamin Tate (aka Joshua Palmatier).\nStretch Goal: At $35,000, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Three Card Monte\" by Gini Koch, the second installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.  In addition, we will do an OPEN CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS for the RAMMING THE RAMPARTS anthology for a minimum of four additional open slots (more than likely a few more), bringing the anthology up to a minimum of 16 stories.  Details about the open call will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.\nStretch Goal: At $37,500, every backer pledging $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Deacon's Ark\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the second installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $40,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology using the submissions from the open call, so each anthology will feature 15 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"A Bug's Life\" by Gini Koch, the third installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.  In addition, we will produce limited-edition Kickstarter paperback versions of RAMMING THE RAMPARTS.  Details about how to add this paperback version of the anthology to your reward level will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.\nStretch Goal: At $45,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.  \nStretch Goal: At $50,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FIFTH themed anthology, title and details to be announced as we approach the stretch goal. \nOther stretch goals will be added as the Kickstarter continues. \nAdd-ons are extra items that current backers can add to their current pledge level.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2020. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not

Born from the mind\u2019s eye of, award-winning artist, Jeff Sturgeon. Last Cities of Earth is a stunning collection of tales and imagery. For years, Jeff envisioned entire cities floating above the clouds. At first, a single metropolis emerged. Then, over time, more and more massive structures seemingly rose into the sky. As Jeff revealed his vision to colleagues in 2014 of lofty, floating civilizations, six fateful words were uttered: \u201cJeff, why aren\u2019t you painting them?\u201d After decades bringing other creators\u2019 dreams from aether to reality, Jeff picked up his brush to breath life into this new world swirling in his imagination. For the next two years, paintings were exhibited. Other creators fell in love with Jeff\u2019s vision and found inspiration to create within his mythology of Last Cities of Earth. There is no end to the creativity sparked by Jeff\u2019s striking images. Short stories, novellas, coloring books, illustrations, schematics, novels, digital fusions of his paintings\u2026 The World, it seemed, was endless. \u201cThe beginning stages of the project consumed me,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cIn creating Last Cities of Earth - the paintings and their stories - I found that there was no clearing my mind after creating a single image. The world was too big and the stories, too many.  \nHelping Jeff to tell those tales, the anthology will include stories by Kevin J. Anderson, Brenda Cooper, David Gerrold, Jim Wright, Mike Resnick, Andrea Stewart, Jody Lynn Nye, Steve Perry, Raven Oak, J.A. Pitts, Cat Rambo, Peter J. Wacks, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Steven Lee Sears, and Todd Lockwood, with editing by Manny  Frishberg and Jennifer Brozek. \nOn March 15th of 2085, a shocked world listens as global news sources report that the world is on a timer. Increased seismic activity beneath Yellowstone National Park heralds a pending volcanic eruption. In less than a decade, mankind will be facing an extinction-level event...   \nThe soil humanity relied on for its crops, fossil fuels, manufacturing resources would be covered in ash. Sunlight would barely penetrate the lower altitudes and the life humanity drew from the earth would be extinguished. With a six-year timer ticking down, governments and corporations set aside their conflicts and worked together to equip major population centers with massive anti-grav engines.  \nThose with the means headed for space, settling on Luna Prime or the Mars colony. Nations and powers that couldn\u2019t reach space turned their eye toward genetic manipulation, with the idea that they could adapt the human form to make it better suited for surviving the coming eruption. The tentative peace negotiated for the sake of survival broke. Those who couldn\u2019t make it into the floating cities, or find a path to salvation, used the coming eruption to settle old scores. Mankind fell into chaos as the super volcano erupted. The early post-eruption decades of 2090-2134 are considered lost to history.  \nFor the next 80-plus years the cities sent out newly designed airships, designed to have a low technology footprint for easier field repairs. Rebuilding civilization with intercity commerce and shared discovery, was a long, painstaking process. In the 2250s, America reconnected to itself, then reached beyond its borders and established trade routes to Europe. Global culture was finally reestablished.  \nIt is now YE (Yellowstone Eruption) 210, the Gregorian 2300 AD, and global trade routes exist. The 'golden age' of Lost Earth echoes in the modern day as more and more cities become connected. But the technology is beginning to fail, and many cities have lost the knowledge to repair their own anti-grav engines. Ideological wars are resurfacing. Threats are abundant from both ground and sky. If colonies still exist in space, they are silent....  \n...Welcome to the new world. Will humanity survive?  \nNOTE: The following images represent the original Last Cities of Earth artwork by Jeff Sturgeon that will be available as rewards for those who back at the Art Aficionado Pledge Level, on a first-come basis. If you select that pledge, message us immediately and let us know which of the paintings you would like and it will be marked unavailable. \n\n(If you would like to see a larger image of the art before selecting, please message us as there is limited space on the campaign page, so we had to keep these small.)\nDONE - FIRST DAY BACKER BONUS - All backers at the $5 or higher level will receive a DRM-free copy of Danielle Ackley-McPhail's science fiction collection A Legacy of Stars.\nUNLOCKED! $6500 - All backers at the $5 or higher level will receive a DRM-free copy of J.A.

His career spans over 30 years. He came up through the ranks as a young fan artist in the 80's before being hired in the first wave of computer game artists in 1990. A long career in the 90's as an artist, animator, concept artist, lead artist, game designer, and art director followed as he continued to paint, illustrate, and displaying his work at science fiction conventions around the country.    \nJeff left the game business and to paint full time with aluminum as his new canvas. Through the new millennium, Jeff's work became nationally known with increased appearances as an exhibitor, guest, panelist, and guest of honor at conventions around the country and as an illustrator and cover artist. Jeff's work is much sought after by art collectors, whether one of his classic science fiction/astronomical pieces or his beautiful renderings of the American West.  \nJeff's newest project is Last Cities of Earth. As his much-anticipated, shared-world project comes to fruition with an anthology featuring the top writers in the field, other platforms are in negotiation to bring this amazing world Jeff has created to life and Jeff is planning an art book of his amazing work including Last Cities of Earth art and concept sketches and designs.\n\nKevin J.

They were partly right: she had grander plans than a world, though, she was already creating the universe of the Sholan Alliance, where Magic, Warriors, and Science all co-exist.\nShe began writing when she was eight because she couldn't find enough of the books she liked to read.  How difficult can it be to write them myself, she thought with all the confidence of a child.  After all, the libraries were full of books.  It must be easy.\nReal life took over as she entered college and began to work for the first time, but thanks to the constant nagging of two very good friends, one of whom is the sister of her editor, she finished a novel she'd started back in 1979. It was called Turning Point, and her friend's sister at DAW bought it. The Sholan Alliance Series is now nine novels long.

Players can choose from all the beloved tropes of the genre. Will you be the Delinquent, the Elite, the Adorable, the Rep? Pick from 10 social roles to form your character's day-to-day life.\nNo one, though, is just their role. Everyone has a larger and more fraught destiny. Are you a Night Hunter, a Creature Summoner, an Alchemical Witch, a Secret Monster? 10 destiny playbooks await.\nThis is the playground where your Secret Monster can ask out the Reincarnated Soul to prom, while fighting on the moon for the fate of the universe. You can be an Apprentice Reaper trying to stay awake in class, or a runaway extraterrestrial princess who wants to make friends. You can even combine your powers in an ultimate showdown. Have you formed a giant pink skeletal unicorn summon, aglow with searing sparkles and wearing a jeweled crown of soul energy? Go you.\nThis game joins a constellation of great indie gaming options in the Powered by the Apocalypse family. Our small design team has enjoyed and drawn inspiration from Monsterhearts, Masks, Fellowship, and Monster of the Week, among others. \nWe have been inspired by more anime, manga and JRPGs than we can list, but a few are: Escaflowne, Digimon, Ressha Sentai ToQger, Little Witch Academia, Yu-Gi-Oh!, the Final Fantasy franchise, Sailor Moon, a lot of Gundam series, Ouran High School Host Club, My Hero Academia, Yu Yu Hakusho, Kill la Kill, and Cardcaptor Sakura.\n Here's some of the things that make Super Destiny High School Rumble!! fun:\nPlay your favorite anime type with moves like \"Proclaim your Feelings,\" \"Your Opponent is Me,\" and \"Believe in Yourself.\"\nFast character creation and rules-light play. It's an easy game to run and doesn't need a lot of prep time.\nMix and match your student and destiny playbooks for dozens of playable possibilities.\nYou and your fellow players create your world, starting with your classmates in homeroom, and expanding to the school, town, and beyond. Players make statements that become part of the truth of this world--\"We live on a floating island of skyscrapers,\" \"We're on a space station,\" \"Music creates magic,\" \"Powers are common\", or \"Powers are rare\", \"This is the afterlife\", \"This is Neo Okinawa,\" \"This is Verona Beach.\"\nForm Bonds with teammates and boost your own and others' abilities with the power of love, friendship, and teamwork.\nBalance student life with your super-powered secret identity.\nUnlock powerful limit breaks and expend them in extraordinary circumstances.\nCombine your team's powers to make an ultimate form and defeat evil. You get to describe what the combination looks like. Is it a giant robot? A special summon? An amazing mashup of your diverse power sets?\nFight villains in ascending tiers of power: minions, lieutenants (are there four god-generals? There could be!), and bosses.\nPlay in lots of different ways. You can all use different destiny playbooks, or you can decide to build an entire team of Mech Pilots or Transformation Warriors. You could be students at a magic school, or Otherworldy Royalty who use your powers openly in a multiverse crossroads station instead of having secret identities.\nWe are publishing Super Destiny High School Rumble!! in PDF and softcover Print on Demand versions, both fulfilled by DriveThruRPG, that trusty bastion of roleplaying game downloads. The book will have a color cover and black and white interior illustrations by Amanda Williams. It will contain sections for the students (the players) and the Principal (the DM) and have twenty playbooks, ten for student types and ten for destiny types. You will also get printable PDF versions of the playbooks, the homeroom seating chart, the Principal's cheat sheet, and a fill-in character sheet- everything you need to play the game. Except for a pair of six-sided dice. But what are the chances you have those?\nFor a preview of what the book will look like, head over to DriveThruRPG and download our free promo. It contains two sample playbooks to whet your appetite.\nHere's a mini-preview of two of the playbooks.\nCheck out Amanda Williams' awesome illustrations for the book! We'll be posting more art as the Kickstarter continues.\nOur design team is a found family of friends, gamers, and artists who have collaborated in past on two funded Kickstarters, a successful line of t-shirts, and a 16-year-old small geeky business called The Five Wits. You can find out more about us here!\nBesides the publishing end of things, we also sell nerdy tea blends and other treasures, and cosplay wigs!\nOur business takes us on long trips to and from conventions, and to visit out-of-state gaming friends. We constantly brainstorm new game and story ideas while driving. This project began in just such a way. We've been having the time of our lives playtesting it, and look forward to sharing it with more gamers. Thanks to all our playtesters so far!\nBesides the book itself, you can get rewards inspired by our playbooks, including hand-made one-of-a-kind creatures by Ruth Lampi, witchy gear, or cool hair. \nAll backers will have their names included in the digital thank-yous.\nShipping is not included and will be added to all reward tiers that involve a physical object.\nthe sorts of things you can expect as rewards from the tier \"Alchemical Witch\"\nthe sorts of things you can expect as rewards from the tier \"Creature Summoner\"\nThe art and layout for the book will be complete by the end of May, allowing the PDF to be up on DriveThruRPG by June 2019. The print on demand version will be ready by August 2019. We plan to have copies of it for sale at our booth at GenCon Indy 2019. Because one-third of the art is already done, the book is written, and we've done layout for six of the playbooks, we're confident that this is a reasonable timeline for the additional art and layout, plus the editing. \nOver half our funding goal goes toward the art (we love paying artists!), and the rest is for layout and for the cost of, and shipping for, the books we will be sending directly to backers in the wholesale reward tier and other tiers that involve additional physical objects.\nhandy chart of what the funds will be going towards\nGlad you asked! There sure are!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've funded the printing of two books in previous Kickstarter projects, so we're familiar with the process of editing, layout, and fulfillment. This project is a little larger than those were, but we're making fulfillment easier on ourselves by using DriveThruRPG's distribution channel for PDFs and for print on demand books. This will also make it possible to scale up easily no matter how many backers we get.\n\nThis is our first published game system, though we've been homebrewing all sorts of systems for years. We decided to use the template of Powered by the Apocalypse so that we can be confident we're building on a solid rule base. We've also been playtesting with many groups of varied backgrounds for the last half year.\n\nFor the wilder reward tiers, we have the fortune of being the same team working behind the scenes at The Five Wits, and having access to the costuming and apothecary supply chains that let us provide customized and magical reward options. We also have a daily shipping operation we can piggyback on, so backer fulfillment can dash along smoothly. The risks we are facing go hand in hand with the above. Our team doubles as the staff for a busy little traveling business, and rolling game design and distribution into our portfolio is no small feat. It is, however, one we have long been dreaming of and planning for. Our reputation is on the line to deliver, and we take that very seriously.

It was where some of the greatest writers of the 20th Century got their start and some of the most iconic characters made their debut, from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan and John Carter to Maxwell Grant's The Shadow to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. \nWithout the pulps, comic books may never have introduced the super-hero...and then where would we be today?\nThe pulp magazine era was bristling with brawny men and statuesque women globetrotting, and getting into and out of danger. Their exploits quickened the pulses of their readers, young and old alike. They gave rise to some of the most enduring heroes known the world 'round.\nTo honor and celebrate a bygone era, I have partnered with most of my Crazy 8 Press team. If you've loved Aaron Rosenberg's work on ReDeus or From this is Hell or Paul Kupperberg's super-hero comics and adventure stories or the intergalactic adventures from Mary Fan or the noirish stylings of Russ Colchamiro, then you know what you're in for. Aaron, Paul, Mary, the late Glenn Hauman, and Michael Jan Friedman are all signed on for the project. \nAdditionally, I have assembled a stellar line-up of other writers \u2013 Derek Tyler Attico, Jim & Becky Beard, Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Robert T. Jeschonek, Amy Lewanski, Karissa Laurel, and Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg \u2013 to produce new thrills and chills, spanning the traditional pulp realms of mystery, sword and sorcery, horror, science fiction, romance, and high adventure, in a volume appropriately titled...Thrilling Adventure Yarns!\nMeet Professor Ironheart! The Blue Mask! The Green Lady! Cannon Belle! And many more brand-new heroes that would have made pulp-era creators proud.\nAn Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished World War I aviator tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign. \nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns -- in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable British artist Alex Ronald. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $4,500, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package--to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't. Just take any existing package of $25 and up and add to it the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list. Then send us a message letting us know what additional reward or rewards you've qualified for. (International backers, there will be some additional postage; if you're interested in an add-on, shoot us a message and we'll figure it out.)\nGet listed as a patron on the acknowledgments page                                     10. \nReceive a one-time mention as a character, street, company, etc.             35.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #1                                                                                   20. \nCrazy 8 e-book package #2                                                                                   20.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #3                                                                                   20.\nPackage #1 includes Six Scarlet Scorpions (a Pat Savage novel) by Will Murray; No Small Bills by Aaron Rosenberg; In My Shorts (a short story collection) by Paul Kupperberg; Pulling Up Stakes by Peter David; ReDeus: Divine Tales, and The Fire Dragon by Mary Fan.\nPackage #2 includes The Camelot Papers by Peter David; Finders Keepers by Russ Colchamiro; Flynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil by Mary Fan; a collection of five short stories by Keith R.A. DeCandido; For This Is Hell by Aaron Rosenberg and Steve Saville, and Fight The Gods by Michael Jan Friedman.\nPackage #3 is a Crazy 8 Press Anthology pack that includes the entire Latchkeys series; ReDeus: Divine Lands; Love, Mayhem, and Murder; They Keep Killing Glenn, and Tales of the Crimson Keep.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition (after the option is unlocked, of course). \nStretch Goals!\n$5,000 will allow me to include stories from three long-time reader favorites: Keith R.A. DeCandido, Will Murray and Peter David.\nIn many ways, Will has been almost single-handedly keeping the pulps alive with his articles and short stories throughout the years. He's also been writing authorized novels featuring Doc Savage, Tarzan, and others. He knows his way around a good yarn.\nKeith is the award-winning author of more than fifty books, including some of the best Star Trek novels around. And his Dragon Precinct books have a cult following all their own.\nPeter is the famed Writer of Stuff whose pulp-inspired works include several Zorro stories. But really, we know and love him for his runs on The Incredible Hulk, Young Justice, and Star Trek. His original works range from science fiction to satirical vampire tales.\nNew! At $6,000, we unlock \"the hardcover option,\" allowing any backer whose reward includes a paperback copy on to upgrade to a handsome hardback version of Thrilling Adventure Yarns (see A La Carte menu above).\nNew! At $6500 we will upgrade those receiving one signature to three signatures from our illustrious cadre of authors.\n$7000 will allow me to hire a cadre of talented artists to render a black and white illustration for each and every story in the collection. \nAt $8,000 we can send everyone a digital art set of images, suitable for your digital wallpaper. \nNew! At $9000, we will send every backer a digital copy of Peter David's Sir Apropos of Nothing, his critically acclaimed humorous fantasy novel. It's the first in a series and the long-out-of-print second and third volumes will finally be available once more in the summer so now's a great time to get introduced to the series.\nNew! At $10,000 we will up our guarantee of three autographs per print edition to five autographs.\nWe'll be announcing other stretch goals as our campaign develops. We don't want to give away all our secrets!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript is nearly complete already, with 90% of the stories in and more than half of them already edited.

Awkwardly, of course, because this is me we're talking about. But then I said, \"No! If I become a publisher, I'll never have any time to write.\"\nShortly after that, I established the Realm Makers Conference, because that definitely hasn't cut into my writing time. But it's been worth every hour of planning, traveling, and instituting of plans B, C, and D, because Realm Makers has become so much more than an annual writers conference. We're a modern-day tribe, in the best sense of the word.\nAnd where writers gather, ideas for books grow. In 2016, we partnered with Brimstone Fiction to publish our first anthology of fantasy and science fiction, entitled Realmscapes. \nToday, we're stepping up our game to bring to you our first PAID anthology, RealmScapes: Heroes of the Realm. \nWith the assistance of editor Danielle Ackley-McPhail, we're looking forward to bringing you a collection of some of the best fantasy and sci-fi by authors of faith. RealmScapes: Heroes of the Realm will feature stories from established, bestselling authors from every corner of the genre.\nOur core book will feature stories from L. Jagi Lamplighter, Wayne Thomas Batson, Kathy Tyers, James Chambers, Steve Rzasa, Paul Regnier, and Jeffrey Lyman.Your pledges fund every detail of this anthology's production, since there's a huge investment of time and skill that make books a reality. A fully-funded campaign will pay for the anthology's flashy cover art by Kirk DouPonce, the skill and precision of our editor, Danielle Ackley McPhail, market-rate compensation to each author for their fine words, book formatting and layout, and the initial print run of the books, among other administrative costs associated with publishing. (They are small, but many, like a legion of goblins that creeps up on you and overwhelms you, even though you've got a massive sword and plate armor.)\nEspecially for our first 50 backers: You'll receive a digital, DRM-free ebook of Danielle's Yesterday's Dreams, (in addition to the perks that come with whatever backer level you choose) because early adopters are the people who make tomorrow's dreams come true! \nSo grab your cloak, your blaster, and a cup of coffee, and join us for the adventure of building the second Realmscapes anthology, Heroes of the Realm. The fates of multiple fictional universes are in your hands!\nWith gratitude\n-Becky Minor\nRealm Makers Executive Director\nAre you looking for swag to customize your support of the Heroes of the Realm Campaign?

To keep our editorial team from losing their minds, the call for additional story submissions will go out to backers as well as Published- and Professional-level members of the Realm Makers membership program. Full instructions on how to submit a story will be posted in our member portal/Slack community when it looks like we'll have the funding to add stories.\nFor now, if you're thinking of submitting, it doesn't hurt to work up that story of a hero or heroes. And if you're not yet a Published or Professional level member of Realm Makers, you'll want to investigate that. Check out the membership page on the Realm Makers website for those details.\n(Please note: Backing this project will not give any author a better chance at being selected for inclusion in the anthology.

Since September 2000, we have been publishing new issues every Monday, including fiction, poetry, reviews, essays, and interviews. In 2017, we published almost 1,000,000 words over 51 issues, all paid to our contributors, and all paid for by you, our supporters.\nWe're entirely funded by voluntary contributions. We pay all our contributors fair market rates for their work, but our (frankly enormous) volunteer editorial team does it out of love.\nWhy support Strange Horizons?\nBecause we believe that in the twenty-first century, speculative fiction must be an open, global tradition. For over fifteen years, we have showcased work that challenges us and delights us, by new and established writers from diverse backgrounds and with diverse concerns. \nBecause we have a record of finding and supporting exciting new voices in SF: writers who got their start in Strange Horizons include N. K. Jemisin (\"The You Train,\" from 2007), Justine Larbalestier (\"The Cruel Brother,\" from 2001), Ken Liu (\"The Algorithms for Love,\" from 2004), Nnedi Okorafor (\"The Palm Tree Bandit,\" from 2000), John Scalzi (\"Alien Animal Encounters,\" from 2001) and, in more recent years, G. V. Anderson (\"Das Steingesch\u00f6pf\", from 2016).\nBecause we're a multiple Hugo-shortlisted magazine (for six consecutive years!) and we've published stories that have been shortlisted for or won Hugo, Nebula, James Tiptree Jr., Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy Awards.\nWhat We Need\nWhat we need to raise:\nWe need $13,000 to fund the basic running costs of the magazine for 1 year\nAt $14,500 we'll run a special issue packed with international SFF \nAt $16,000 we'll run a special issue focused on web comics \nAt $21,000 we'll be able to \ud83c\udf89 pay our staff \ud83c\udf89for the first time in our history\nIf we hit $23,000 we'll unlock the first stretch goal \nAnd at $25,000 we'll unlock the second secret goal!\nWhat You Get\nWhat do you get out of this?\nIf you donate $25 you get access to all of 2018's Strange Horizons ebooks \nIf you donate $40 you get the above and digital wallpaper of our 2018 artwork for your computer/phone/device.\nIf you donate $50 you get the above and a mug, t-shirt or tote bag branded with the Strange Horizons logo\nIf you donate $75 you don't have to choose!

The books will be edited by Patricia Bray & S.C. Butler (PORTALS), David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier (TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED), and Steven H Silver & Joshua Palmatier (ALTERNATE PEACE).\nUnlike the first two Kickstarters run by Zombies Need Brains, we are NOT using the Kickstarter to help set up and solidify the small press. Backers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will still be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run.\nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition! Help the small press Zombies Need Brains LLC expand! ZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors. Check out our current offerings: \nTemporally Out of Order \nAlien Artifacts \nWere- \nSubmerged \nAll Hail Our Robot Conquerors! \nThe Death of All Things\nGuilds & Glaives\nSecond Round: A Return to the Ur-Bar\nThe Razor's Edge\nat https://squareup.com/market/zombies-need-brains-llc. You can also find them online at Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble; they are available in trade paperback format as well as on almost all ebook platforms (Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Scribd, etc.).\nWe offer professional pay rates and feature stellar cover art. As we did in our previous anthologies, we plan to include the very best stories we can find, spanning the gamut from bestselling authors to new, previously unpublished voices, including an open submission window if the Kickstarter is successful, where anyone can submit their stories featuring the current themes for a chance to be part of the anthologies. And Zombies Need Brains is officially a \"qualifying market\" for the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA)! With your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you! Consider backing our Kickstarter and then help spread the word. Just as Zombies Need Brains, we need your support to make this new small press a success. So what are the current projects? Here are the details:\nPORTALS:\nIn the blink of an eye, the familiar disappears as you step into the unknown. What new creatures will you meet? What strange planets will you explore? Will you find happiness, or doom? Open the pages of PORTALS, the newest anthology from the small press Zombies Need Brains, and you just might find out.\nFrom wardrobes to monoliths, wormholes to fairy rings, there is a rich tradition of stories in both science fiction and fantasy that explore what happens when--by accident or design--characters are transported from one world to another. Join fourteen of today\u2019s leading science fiction and fantasy authors as they offer fresh takes on this classic theme. Whether a routine trip or unexpected journey, each tale will explore new worlds of adventure, mystery, humor, and horror, with stories for every taste and fancy.\nEdited by S.C. Butler and Patricia Bray, PORTALS will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of up to 6,000 words each. It will include short stories by: \nJacey Bedford\nF. Brett Cox\nJames Enge \nEsther Friesner \nNancy Holzner \nGini Koch \nViolette Malan \nJaime Lee Moyer\nIan Tregillis\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nTEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED:\nIn our spam boxes today, we both received notices that our bank accounts required resolution, and the content of the spam contained the following sentence: \"We have noticed that you need to resolve important security issues on your account to prevent temporal deactivation.\" Of course, our immediate thought was of a new anthology called TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED!\nFor this follow-up to 2015\u2019s TEMPORALLY OUT OF ORDER, we are looking for stories that take a person, object, event, or phenomenon and somehow, during the course of the plot, \u201ctemporally deactivate\u201d it, whatever that may mean in the context of the story. \u201cTemporal deactivation\u201d should refer to something more than a simple death, malfunction, or termination, and instead should touch in some way on issues of time \u2014 its flow, distortion, dislocation, etc.\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, it will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of up to 6000 words each. It will include short stories by:\nC.S. Friedman \nFaith Hunter \nD.B. Jackson\nGini Koch \nStephen Leigh \nMisty Massey \nJenna Rhodes \nEdmund R. Schubert\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nALTERNATE PEACE:\nAll too often, alternate histories are based on a battle or assassination. We\u2019re looking for stories where change grew out of more peaceful activities\u2026science, business, and culture. Imagine a world in which the branch point from our own was caused by scientific endeavor, social change, natural forces, or other points of divergence which don\u2019t rely on military activity or violence.\nEdited by Steven H Silver & Joshua Palmatier, it will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of up to 6000 words each. It will include short stories by: \nD.B. Jackson \nStephen Leigh\nIan R. MacLeod\nKristine Kathryn Rusch\nKari Sperring\nHarry Turtledove \nRick Wilber\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nThe images that will be used to design the cover art are commissioned pieces created by Justin Adams of Varia Studios. The cover art for \u201cPortals\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter.\n\"Portals\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2018. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of February 2019 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2019. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 6 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far:\nStretch Goal: BOOKMARKS! At $27,500, every backer pledged at $20 or more will receive a free promotional bookmark for PORTALS, TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED, and ALTERNATE PEACE.\nStretch Goal: At $30,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology that is really a THREE-PART STORY cut up into three sections, each section written by the editors of the appropriate anthology (see Update #15 for more details), so each anthology will feature 15 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"The Royal Scam\" by Gini Koch, the first installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $32,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"When Josie Comes Home\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the first installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $35,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Three Card Monte\" by Gini Koch, the second installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $37,500, every backer pleding $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Deacon's Ark\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the second installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $40,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology using the submissions from the open call, so each anthology will feature 16 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"A Bug's Life\" by Gini Koch, the third installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $45,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.\nStretch Goal: At $50,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FOURTH themed anthology, title to be announced as we approach the stretch goal.\nOther stretch goals will be added as the Kickstarter continues.\nAdd-ons are extra items that current backers can add to their current pledge level.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2019. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

(And for those of you who Kickstarted Mermaid Precinct, that is still in progress, and should be done in the next few weeks, with the book itself ready some time after that. You'll be seeing more in-progress chapters this week.)\nOne of those stories I did via Kickstarter, entitled \"Gan Brightblade vs. Mitos the Mighty.\" The response to that story -- which didn't actually include any members of the Cliff's End Castle Guard -- was strong enough that I've wanted to write some more stories that look at the greater world of Flingaria beyond Cliff's End and the cops who maintain law and order therein.\nTo that end, I've written a story called \"The Fall of Iaron.\" It tells a story of the history of Flingaria, in particular a battle that took place in Iaron, one of the other human city-states that's is allied with Cliff's End under the rule of King Marcus and Queen Marta. \n\"The Fall of Iaron\" is about history, about storytelling, about political machinations, and about what makes a hero and what makes a tyrant and what makes a villain. I'm quite pleased with it, and I hope you'll enjoy it, too.\nThe story is already written, and the only changes still to be made to it are the names of up to ten of characters in the story who will be renamed based on who pledges at the $65 level. Aside from that -- and adding the acknowledgments to include all you kind folks who pledge -- the story is done and edited, so as soon as the project is funded, I can start sending out the main reward, to wit, the story itself. The eBooks should also go out in relatively short order as well.\nIf you just want the story itself, it's only two bucks, but there are other nifty rewards at higher levels, including swag, me reading the story, other books of mine, and a new one, offering my editorial services! I've been a professional editor for almost thirty years now, and I'm offering editing of either your short fiction (20,000 words or less) or your novel (100,000 words or less) at a lower rate than my usual.\nSo please, fund this project, and get a nifty new story in this fun universe I've created.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe story's already written, so the risks are minimal.

The best of games capture the tried elements of 40 years of fantasy roleplaying evolution: balance, flow of play, a smooth learning curve, and system that well-serves setting.\nIn 2007, Metal, Magic and Lore was introduced, with its powerful system with emphasis on realism and grit with speed of play. MML developed a loyal, passionate following that has stayed with it ever since. And NOW based both on the desires of those players and critics of the game, we are proud to integrate a number of upgraded improvements, and introduce the  Metal, Magic, and Lore Revised Edition.\nAre You One Of Us?\nFollowing the traditions of Tolkien, Howard, Brooks, and Abercrombie, in Metal, Magic and Lore nearly any literary character can be brought to life due to its class-less, level-less character system. Here you\u2019ll find Men, Dwarves, Elves, and others locked in struggle against adversaries common and fantastic. MML is for a particular kind of fantasy gamer: a lover of fantasy, but also a lover of the rich experience of simulation and realism; mature role-playing at its best.\nNew to the game? Eight reasons to try it -\nThis is traditional fantasy, a time of Men, Dwarves and Elves. There are 3 other offshoot races, which do not deviate far from these classic archetypes which shaped the very origins of the genre! \nCharacters are created by allocating Attribute points to nine attributes. Secondary attributes are calculated from these, so all of them are important; Min/Maxing has been proven to be nearly impossible within the MML architecture. Characters are class-less and level-less, and are created by selecting skills as negotiated by the player and GM to form the character composite. The revised addition adds clarity and definition to this to make it easier to start, as well as some pre-assembled templates. Characters get better by improving skills, making them more effective at interaction, better at attacking and defending, and casting spells.  \nSkill checks are a percentile-system based. Roll dice under the percentage for success. All task attempts in the game are given by the same universal formula: combat, magic and social interaction are all resolved as a combination of skill and the difficulty of the task attempted. GMs add/subtract modifiers as per situation. Characters skills are developed only by them being used, and all types of skills are needed for survival!\nEconomics in the game are dramatic as seen with character Social Class - the Commoner, the Merchant Class and the Lesser Noble, akin to the castes of Medieval Europe at about the 12th century, so coin and provisions are key to adventure. Travel is part of the adventure, as is the countryside and rumors that it contains.\nCombat is deadly. Initiative matters because striking first can mean not being attacked. Character A attacks, character B defends, then a position is chosen on the body, over which there may or may not be armor. And well, with a sword against no armor - you can imagine what happens. Hit Points are location based and never increase (only by a point or two in the advanced rules).  Characters become no tougher in the game, just harder to hit while they hit others better.\nMagic has lower power than many other fantasy games, but is as effective due to the game setting. Regardless of the type of magic, a point pool system is used to determine amounts of spells. The method of casting uses the same percentile system as is described above. Players do find this approach refreshing, though in the revised edition we will be correcting some scaling errors and rounding out the magic so that it better reflects the lore of the game as is intended.\nBeasts are creatures foul and feisty, but there are not many. We look to publish about 50. Beasts are tied to the ecology, which will be portrayed in future regional atlases. Most current fans and gamers have not gotten through using even 20 in a multi-session campaign. Orcs, Ogres, Goblins, Giants, and many traditional archetypes is what you will see here.\nIf you like mature storytelling, literary fantasy which can easily mimic any HBO episode of Game of Thrones, the idea that it only takes 7 or 8 orcs to present an experienced set of characters with a problem, then you will probably want to try Metal, Magic and Lore.\nPledge Levels\nEach Pledge Level includes all rewards of any of lower dollar value, so your collection will accumulate with your pledge!

It no longer even appears on the world\u2019s maps under the name it bore when I was born. This does not mean I ceased to love it \u2013 it is where the bones of my ancestors are buried, where their ghosts walk yet if such things can be; this is the place where the river I love so much runs eternally between shores of mud and thistle and weeping willow, the place where a sliver of my spirit lives still, lives always. And I understand, on that visceral level, what it means to be FORCED to leave a place one calls home.  \nI feel for the children whose early \u2013 whose *only* \u2013 memories involve bombs and fire and fury and guns and bullets and dust and blood and loss and grief. I feel for the emptiness I see blossoming behind their eyes, underneath the pain, the inability to understand why such things can be. I understand the way an older child might feel when torn apart from those first precious friendships with one\u2019s peers, from the security and warmth of a family home; when witnessing the carnage of a hot war blowing up around them, none of their doing, something that they can do absolutely nothing about and that is completely capable of destroying everything they have ever believed to be true, like a dragon breathing a plume of flame on their lives and leaving ashes behind.  \nI watch these driven people who have lost everything climb on overladen boats which threaten to sink under the weight of frightened women and children and the few men who are trying to save them. I can see pictures daily of the hungry, of the abandoned, of the families torn apart, of children sitting catatonic with pain and loss under streaks and smears of blood and dirt. I can see it all on the news, on social media, in headlines, across the world, every day.  \nAnd I wonder what I can do. What I, and those like me, can do.  \nWe can tell stories. Not THEIR stories \u2013 those are theirs to tell, some day, maybe. But stories like theirs. Stories which will reach out and tell other people about the truth of their lives, through the \u201clies\u201d of fiction, of fantasy. We can shine a light, we who create art, into the dark places of this world. That is what we are for. That is what we do. That is what the best of us do, anyway. What we want to do. What we NEED to do.  \nThis project is a collection of stories. Some by names you might recognize quickly; others, from writers who might have a more intimate, more visceral, connection with the subject matter, and of whom you might not have heard (yet). We are here to tell the stories. And when you choose to help us do this, with this book, with the collection of stories by the \u201cChildren of a Different Sky\u201d, you join us to learn, and to share, and to grieve, and to make sure that the least and the most bitterly lost amongst us are not \u2013 are NEVER \u2013 forgotten.  \nCHILDREN OF A DIFFERENT SKY\nThey change their sky, not their soul, who rush across the sea. \u2013Horace \nTwelve stories and two poems of power and powerlessness, of tragedy, of courage, of loss, of love, of regrets and of never looking back, of transition and transcendence. \nTwelve tales and two poems about the things that people fight to take with them when they are forced to run, and about the things they will never forgive themselves for leaving behind.  \nFrom the fantasy worlds of merfolk and witches to the almost-real worlds of people who are almost just like us, these are stories to touch everyone\u2019s heart...and a book which will go on to help those who are living similar stories every day.  \nWith stories by:\nSong For An Immigrant - Jane Yolen  \nAt The Crossroads Of Shadow And Bone - Aliette de Bodard  \nRiver of Stars - Seanan McGuire  \nThe Natural Order - Irene Radford  \nThe Pillars - Gregory L.

The first book in a four book series, it is a bold and disturbing story about growing up Other in a world where different is anathema; about six children finding their way in the universe when the world where they were raised proves too small for their potential.\nSilver Ship won the Endeavour Award and did well for a debut novel. The second novel in the series came out the day the economy died in 2008.  So only three books of the planned four were published. They are finding new life with Word Fire Press. Even better, they are edited a bit to remove the awkwardness of early books, and thus represent my current skill level better.  We're calling them \"Authors Preferred Editions.\" The first book releases August 19, with the others to follow, including the fourth, much anticipated volume.\nIn celebration, I am compiling Stories of Fremont's Children, a collection of short stories based on the Fremont's Children universe. Some are reprints (including one that was selected for a Best of the Year anthology), and some original to the collection.\nIn addition, if we reach the right stretch goals, there will be two bonus stories by guest authors Danielle Ackley-McPhail and J.A.

Orphaned by that war, the only remains of the children\u2019s heritage are an old woman like themselves who was left for near-dead at the end of the war, and a mysterious silver ship that appears to have no doors.  \nTo preserve themselves the children must leave the safety of the insular community and brave the wilds of Fremont, beautiful but dangerous. An echo of their own natures, or a proving ground of their genetic worth?  \nIn this battle of wills and principles, what does the future hold for Fremont\u2019s Children?\nThe First 100 Backers will receive a DRM-Free copy of Brenda Cooper's short story collection Beyond the Waterfall Door.   \nThe First 150 Backers will receive a DRM-Free copy of Danielle Ackley-McPhail's Transcendence.  \n200 Facebook Likes Bonus - https://www.facebook.com/Futuriter/ All backers will receive a DRM-free copy of Brenda Cooper's story \"My Father's Singularity.\" (Current count: 117 Likes)\nUNLOCKED! $1000 - We will add a bonus story by Danielle Ackley-McPhail to the book. \n$1300 -   All backers at the $5 and higher level will receive a DRM-Free copy of J.A.

It features an illustrated anthology, an art book, and multiple collections.   \nWith over 40 stories and dozens upon dozens of pieces of art by bestselling and award-winning contributors, Last Cities of Earth is a stunning collection full of tales and imagery of a brand-new world awaiting you as one of its first discoverers.  \nMaster storytellers and artists are building this world\u2014those whose imaginations helped shape Star Wars, Star Trek, and dozens of other fan favorite universes in sci-fi/fantasy, mystery, thriller, YA, horror... Last Cities of Earth is a collection of possibilities answering questions such as \u201cWhy are the cities floating?\u201d and \u201cWhat happened to force humanity into the skies?\u201d\nFor years, Jeff envisioned cities floating above the ground. At first, a single metropolis emerged. Over time, more and more places rose into the atmosphere. \nIt wasn\u2019t until 2014, however, at a small convention in Washington when Jeff told some friends about his floating civilizations that six fateful words were uttered: \n\u201cJeff, why aren\u2019t you painting them?\u201d \nAfter decades of bringing other creators\u2019 dreams from ether to reality, Jeff picked up his brush to breathe life into the world swirling about in his imagination. For the next two years as the paintings were exhibited, other creators fell in love with Jeff\u2019s vision and were inspired to create within the mythology of Last Cities of Earth. There was no end to the creativity sparked by Jeff\u2019s images. Short stories, novellas, coloring books, illustrations, schematics, novels, digital fusions of his paintings\u2026 it seemed endless. \n\u201cThe beginning stages of the project consumed me.\u201d Jeff said. \u201cIn creating Last Cities of Earth - the paintings and their stories - I found that there was no clearing my mind after creating a single image. The world was too big and the stories too many.\u201d \nIn order to tell all those possibilities within Jeff Sturgeon\u2019s world of floating cities, the Last Cities of Earth Kickstarter gathers more than 60 decorated authors and illustrators to present a new world.\nEach of the 16 stories in the illustrated anthology will take place in a different city. Every location will have its own geopolitical environment. This means every city will not only battle the environment and their own dwindling resources, but also will grapple with cultural and political pressures from within.  \nIn the skies above the ruins of New York City, an adventurer prepares to embark upon a quest to descend into the toxic milieu below to find a precious manuscript housed in the shattered remains of a Beaux-Arts-style building once known as the New York Public Library.  \nThe new civilization of London requires a permit to breed in the form of purchasing a genetic code. What started as a form of population control has spiraled into a form of enslavement, where the poorest denizens are never able to own their genetic code. Therefore, many individuals toil in poverty, unable to purchase their freedom. One young teen watches his paycheck dwindle as he works brutish, manual jobs without any hope of purchasing his own life back from his \u201cparents.\u201d  \nTwo floating cities descend into the chaos of war. Who will win? How will the victor be decided? What hope does either side have if the anti-grav units of their cities are destroyed in the battle? Is the other side even human?  \nMore chapter teasers will be revealed in the updates, so remember to pledge to get the inside scoop.\nLast Cities of Earth is too big to be contained in a single book. Thus, a digital expanded universe will be created alongside the illustrated anthology. Forty authors will provide content for micro-anthologies.  \nThe expanded universe will focus on the elements \u2013 earth, water, and air. \nStemming from the genetic experimentation in the desperate attempts to keep humans alive in the years after the Yellowstone Eruption, a whole range of human strengths and weaknesses is represented.  \nThe Yellowstone Eruption didn\u2019t manage to wipe out all the life on the planet. Rather, creatures have grown and mutated. These monstrosities lie in wait for those seeking the riches buried in the earth. In this harsh and cold world, the trapped heat of the time before the massive climate change has become an old tale to tell families clustered around dim fires trying to stay warm.  \nThe terrain is not only a hostile, but the weather also brings powerful storms that ravage the seas. Before the Yellowstone Eruption, some cities took refuge under the water as a response to the projected rise in sea levels, but violent tempests and tsunamis threaten their way of life as well. \nAbove the ground, swashbuckling and piracy abound as airships full of adventurers work to keep the hybridized technologies from crashing. These crews salvage whatever they can from the surface, always wary of the mutated horrors lurking in the crumbling capitals of yore. The economy is driven by sustainable energy and renewable resources, but that ideal often conflicts with the need for raw materials such as gold to make new microprocessors to keep the systems running.\nOn March 15th of 2085, a shocked world listens as global news sources report that the world is on a timer. Increased seismic activity beneath Yellowstone National Park heralds a pending volcanic eruption. In less than a decade, mankind will be facing an extinction-level event...   \nThe soil humanity relied on for its crops, fossil fuels, manufacturing resources would be covered in ash. Sunlight would barely penetrate the lower altitudes and the life humanity drew from the earth would be extinguished. With a six-year timer ticking down, governments and corporations set aside their conflicts and worked together to equip major population centers with massive anti-grav engines.  \nThose with the means headed for space, settling on Luna Prime or the Mars colony. Nations and powers that couldn\u2019t reach space turned their eye toward genetic manipulation, with the idea that they could adapt the human form to make it better suited for surviving the coming eruption. The tentative peace negotiated for the sake of survival broke. Those who couldn\u2019t make it into the floating cities, or find a path to salvation, used the coming eruption to settle old scores. Mankind fell into chaos as the super volcano erupted. The early post-eruption decades of 2090-2134 are considered lost to history.  \nFor the next 80-plus years the cities sent out newly designed airships, designed to have a low technology footprint for easier field repairs. Rebuilding civilization with intercity commerce and shared discovery, was a long, painstaking process. In the 2250s, America reconnected to itself, then reached beyond its borders and established trade routes to Europe. Global culture was finally reestablished.  \nIt is now YE (Yellowstone Eruption) 210, the Gregorian 2300 AD, and global trade routes exist. The 'golden age' of Lost Earth echoes in the modern day as more and more cities become connected. But the technology is beginning to fail, and many cities have lost the knowledge to repair their own anti-grav engines. Ideological wars are resurfacing. Threats are abundant from both ground and sky. If colonies still exist in space, they are silent....  \n...Welcome to the new world.

His career spans over 30 years. He came up through the ranks as a young fan artist in the 80's before being hired in the first wave of computer game artists in 1990. A long career in the 90's as an artist, animator, concept artist, lead artist, game designer, and art director followed as he continued to paint, illustrate, and displaying his work at science fiction conventions around the country.    \nAfter his fellow artist, longtime friend, and art collaborator Jeff Fennel convinced him to try painting on aluminum, Jeff left the game business and to paint full time with aluminum as his new canvas.

Jeff's work is much sought after by art collectors, whether one of his classic science fiction/astronomical pieces or his beautiful renderings of the American West.  \nJeff's newest project is Last Cities of Earth. As his much-anticipated, shared-world project comes to fruition with an anthology featuring the top writers in the field, an art book of Jeff's city paintings and concept art, other platforms are in negotiation to bring this amazing world Jeff has created to life.  \n                Kevin J.

I\u2019m the publisher of Fantastic Books. But I also write short fiction, and when I\u2019m reading, I love short stories.\nSo when Tom Easton approached me with his idea for an anthology of short science fiction stories, I was immediately interested. And as we discussed the idea, I became more convinced that many people like you and me would be just as interested in reading this book.\nAnd thus was born Science Fiction for the Throne: One-Sitting Reads, edited by Tom Easton and Judith K. Dial.\nWhile the overall idea is both fun and slightly quirky, don\u2019t let it distract you from the fact that the book is actually going to be chock-a-block full of good, short science fiction stories.\nAnd while I\u2019m publishing the book, it also means I\u2019ll get to read and enjoy it, just like you. In fact, my only regret in publishing Science Fiction for the Throne is that I can\u2019t be a writer in the book myself.\nTell me more\nEditors Tom Easton and Judith K. Dial provided this description of the book:\nWant something to read while you sit down for a few minutes on the bus or in a waiting room? Here's just the thing -- forty authors, forty stories, mostly under 2,000 words, mostly reprints. Grouped according to their themes -- artificial intelligence, technology, space, time travel, space aliens, the arts and media, religion, strange relationships, and reviving the past. There are even a few shaggy dogs.\nJust remember -- one sitting, one read! Others are waiting!\nIncludes first-time-in-print stories by film critic Daniel M. Kimmel, film-maker Douglas van Belle, mystery writer Brendan DuBois, SETI pioneer H. Paul Shuch, and software engineer Steven Popkes! Also, a bonus micro-story by David Brin!\nThe authors in this book have earned a combined 10 Nebula (from 60 nominations) and 10 Hugo Awards (from 118 nominations).\nWho are those authors?\nGregory Benford, Lloyd Biggle, David Brin, Michael A. Burstein, James L. Cambias, Brenda Cooper, Dave Creek, Robert Dawson, Paul Di Filippo, S.B. Divya, Brendan DuBois, Marianne Dyson, Michael F. Flynn, Jeff Hecht, Liam Hogan, Daniel M.

Paul Shuch, Alex Shvartsman, Steven H Silver, Bud Sparhawk, Douglas Van Belle, James Van Pelt, Jo Walton, Gerald Warfield, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Jay Werkheiser, and Fran Wilde.\nWill it happen?\nYou bet. Don't let this campaign fool you: Fantastic Books has already committed to publishing the book. It's happening. We've already paid the authors, sent out review copies, and we plan to have physical copies and launch the book at Readercon in July. The ebook will follow a few weeks later.\nThen why run this campaign?\nTo give you a chance to get involved, to get one of the earliest copies, at a discounted price, because you might not see us at Readercon.\nSeriously? That's a video?\nYeah, sorry about that. As you can see, I'm much more of a text editor/writer/publisher than a videographer (also, yes, I was reading from a script on my screen). But that's why this project is for a book, not a film. Thanks for understanding.\nStretch Goals:\n$1500 - All backers at the $14 or higher level will receive a limited edition chapbook with stories by Editor Tom Easton and Publisher Ian Randal Strock, and an essay by Editor Judith K. Dial.\n$3000 - We will offer a Limited Edition hardcover option for the book to be added to the add-on section and as an available pledge reward.\n$6000 - We will produce volume 2 in the series: Fantasy for the Throne: One-Sitting Reads, with 50 stories.\nAdd-Ons:\nQuick Explanation: Kickstarter doesn't really have an intuitive way to do add-ons, and the process can be confusing, so here's a quick explanation. To add one of the below onto your current pledge, just click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button at the top right of the page, click in the \"Pledge Amount\" box, and change the pledge amount to reflect the addition of the amount of the add-on you want.\nExample: if your current pledge amount is $10, and you want to add a $5 add-on, you would click into the \"Pledge Amount\" box and change the pledge amount to $15. At the end of the Kickstarter, we'll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for.\nNOTES: ebooks are available in .epub, mobi, or .pdf.\n$7 \u2014 Add a DRM-Free digital copy of our previous anthology, Trafficking in Magic, Magicking in Traffic, edited by David Sklar and Sarah Avery (with content by Pauline J.

It started as a quixotic idea of mine back in the dark ages of \"several years ago\" when a kerfluffle in the publishing industry outlined the need--nay, the demand, for more diversity in YA literature. Now, in the time since this project began, we've seen some tremendous advances in terms of diversity, with some truly magnificent anthologies, magazines, and novels coming out as a result. But there's always room for more. That's where we come in.\nFrom my call for submissions:\n\"Take high school. It\u2019s weird, confusing, complicated, and frustrating. It\u2019s a time of growth and change, when teens start discovering what they\u2019re made of and who they want to be. Now throw in magic. What happens? That\u2019s the premise of this new YA anthology. Schoolbooks & Sorcery is what happens when you take all the normal ups and downs of high school, inject a healthy dose of magic, shake, stir, and serve.\"\nFor this project, I collected a dozen YA urban fantasy stories which incorporate the themes of sorcery, magic, and enchantment. The magic comes from within, as an intrinsic ability or a family trait, and from without, in the form of talismans, training, or teaching. Protagonists are wizards, witches, sorcerers, magicians, shamans, apprentices, or practitioners of more esoteric traditions. Whether they pick it up on their own (accidentally or on purpose), learn from a master, or go to school for institutionalized training, they\u2019re involved with magic to some degree.\nI also insisted that \"Schoolbooks & Sorcery is also designed to be a queer-friendly YA anthology, embracing the full spectrum of sexuality and gender identification, while offering a wide selection of satisfying, entertaining, fascinating, powerful stories in which the mundane and the magical overlap and interact. Stories are encouraged to take place in the overlapping area between urban fantasy, high school, and LGBTQ issues and themes. Stories should send the message that it's not just okay to be gay, it's okay to be gay and to have the same crazy, wicked, scary, seductive, exciting, magical, strange, funny, romantic, dark adventures as everyone else. We\u2019re looking for stories which are all-inclusive, with the characters writers have been dying to write and readers clearly want to see, diverse and interesting, with an underlying current of tolerance and acceptance. Obviously, we\u2019re looking for a wide range of themes, tones, and voices.\"\nAnd my authors delivered, and they are, each and every one of them, wonderful storytellers with rich voices, passionate tales, and unique viewpoints. That's why this Kickstarter campaign is designed to not just bring this anthology to life, but to pay my contributors a professional rate of 6 cents a word.

Because sadly, a mere dozen tales isn't enough to cover an ever-growing, ever-changing spectrum, and I desperately want to see even more representation. I have an idea of what sort of stories I might seek out, based on what I've learned since this began, so the better we do, the more diverse we can become in the long run.\nAt $6500: An all-new Magic University story by Cecilia Tan, suitable for a YA audience.\nAt $7000: 2 more additional stories from as-yet-to-be-determined contributors, to increase diversity. \nAt $7500: Bonus payment for all contributors and the editor.\nAt $8000: Interior art for selected stories. Stories and artist to be determined.\nIn Conclusion:\nRight now, we all need stories of hope and acceptance, tolerance and strength, survival and triumph.

His peaceful childhood ends abruptly when bad news reaches his family. Lobel\u2019s brothers have perished in the war, his father is accused of treason and their tranquil life is shattered and thrown into turmoil. In desperation Lobel\u2019s father takes things into his own hands with terrible consequences.\nPanels from page 15\n  Panel from page 19\n  Panels from page 20\nAfter spending a long time in prison, Lobel\u2019s father dreams of escaping to his homeland. But war rages on, and it is forbidden to leave the city. The only way out is through building a gayeta, a small boat, but this is illegal. And it doesn\u2019t help that Lobel is in love with Ida, a girl whose father is a treacherous politician\u2026 \u2018DAN FADIL: First Light\u2019 is a story of love and loss, of war and the search for inner peace, a story of treachery and treason, and the quest for freedom.\nPanel from page 29\n  Panels from page 21\nTomislav\u2019s atmospheric storyline is lifted by his dramatic use of light and colour in his oil paintings. His colour palette and imagery perfectly captures each moment in the story, a testament to his command of the medium.\nPage 1\n  Page 7\n  Page 9\n  Page 11\nNotions of knighthood and chivalry, as well as contemplating the lives of ordinary people living on the coast in medieval times are explored by Tomislav. As he said, \u201cI tried combining parts of the history of the eastern Adriatic coast with my imagination and put them together in one book. The boat \u201cgayeta\u201d is the leitmotif throughout the story. That boat is an ineffaceable part of the history of my people. Not only for the Croatian part of the Mediterranean, but for the entire Mediterranean as well.

The panel was all about being a fan of problematic things, and the example of loving the work of an author who is not a good person came up, particularly Lovecraft and his Cthulhu Mythos. Many people love the Mythos and Cthulhu pervades a lot of geek culture, but Lovecraft himself was a rampant racist and anti-Semite, and based on how he portrayed his female characters (when there were any), whether or not he had misogynist tendencies has been the subject of feisty debate. An audience member jokingly suggested that there should be a collection of stories that would make dear old Lovecraft roll over in his grave \u2013 like a black lesbian Jew triumphing over the Unspeakable. And all the authors on panel and in the audience said \u2013 \u201cHeeeey, that sounds like fun!\u201d\n\nNow it's 2017 and a book is ready for the printer. We have cover art. We have 13 original short stories and a piece of micro fiction adding up to about 320 pages of delicious Mythos-y content ready for you. The protagonists are male and female, of a wide range of religious backgrounds and skin tones, and would most likely disturb dear old Lovecraft himself. Our authors are not just from American soil; we also have authors from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Greece. \n\nWhat we are looking for is the eyes for the words and the hands for the books... your eyes and your hands. We also hope to raise enough money to stimulate your aural centers as well. If we can hit a modest stretch goal, we will be able to produce an audio book copy.\n\nOur Stories and Authors:\n\nScars of a Certain Value by Christine Lucas\nThe Horror of the Atoll by DJ Tyrer\n\nWith the Dark and the Storm by John Linwood Grant\nThe Sisters Derleth by Michelle D. Sonnier\nA Singular Event, in Several Courses by Kris Dikeman\nThe Bath, Bottle, and Bar'nyeth Party by Lizz-Ayn Shaarawi\nInnsmouth Blues by Jean Roberta\nThe Black Magnolia on the Bank of the Night's River by Gordon White\nThe Thing at Akeley Farm by A.Z. Louise\nBut Who Can Catch Leviathan? by Chris Pearce\nNorth Bronx Nightmare by Andrea Stanet\nThe P'tulpa Cult by Daniel S. Duvall\nGolem by Jennifer R. Povey\nDreidel of Dread: The Very Cthulhu Chanukah by Alex Shvartsman\n\nThe Rewards:\n\nWe are planning on producing several different versions of the anthology.\n\nThe first is electronic, also known as an ebook. While many ebooks are produced with DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection to prevent piracy, we believe that we can trust you. DRM can cause hassles and we want our readers to have a hassle-free experience. You can choose between the three major formats: .mobi for Kindle, epub which most other ereaders use, and .pdf for everybody else.   DRM Free does not however mean Copyright free.\n\nThe second version is trade paperback. This format is approximately 9 inches by 5 inches. It is the larger standard paperback format with nice paper. \n\nThirdly we will be offering a limited number of books in hardback format. This will include a dust jacket with cover art similar to the paperback copy.\n\nFinally we are offering pairs of custom dice with the Otter Libris logo.\n\nStretch Goals:\nAddons: \naddon chart\nIf you are interested in adding something to your pledge, just increase the amount pledged. To do this, select <Manage Your Pledge> on the main EOM page, then select <Change Your Pledge> and add the total amount of the addons to the Amount Pledged box. I will send out a survey at the end of the campaign so you can tell me which addons you wanted.  \nWe will also be offering an additional book from Otter Libris as an addon. This collection, Charmed City: 13 Tales of the Peculiar and Obscure in Baltimore, is a book of dark urban fantasy stories. The Author, Michelle D. Sonnier, is one of the contributors to EOM. One ebook copy of Charmed City is already included in pledge levels Archivist and above.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks: We already have the stories and our editors are finishing the layout right now. Our cover artist is finishing her part of the project. The only part we don't have is the final count of print copies to order. We are planning to print in the U.S. Our greatest risks are mistakes that might cause us delay from the printer or from the postal service. And I guess we should worry about upsetting Ol' H.P. or one of the Elder Gods enough that one will rise up and smite us, but the Oracle says that is unlikely.\n\nChallenges: Requirements creep. Keeping on schedule. We plan on doing the order fulfilment in house, and we have experience with previous publications that will help us, but If we are wildly successful in this Kickstarter, we may experience delays but we will work very hard to keep to the schedule that we have set. If it looks like add-ons or stretch goals could delay us, we will ship the main rewards separately as soon as they are ready. We are of course at the whim of the printer, the internet, and the postal system, but we will work hard to beat our deadlines. We will also strive to provide bi-weekly updates.\n\nOtter Libris has no other active projects at this point. Our complete focus will be on this project until it is completed and fulfilled. We pledge not to start any new projects until this one is put to bed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Bystander", "descp": "I just want to help you make something awesome!

Instead she is dubbed a \u201cbrown bud\u201d\u2014one born of a witching family, but exhibiting no magical talent. When Arabella and her family are invited to a private viewing of a new technological wonder tensions erupt between the witching world and the inventors.

The hard-working, under-appreciated officers of the Cliff's End Castle Guard work day and night to maintain law and order as best they can.\n In 2004, my novel Dragon Precinct was published. It introduced Lieutenants Torin ban Wyvald and Danthres Tresyllione of the Cliff's End Castle Guard. Tasked with enforcing the Lord and Lady's law in the port city of Cliff's End, Torin and Danthres are detectives who solve the many crimes that are committed in the city-state.\nIn the intervening thirteen years, I've written three more novels (Unicorn Precinct, Goblin Precinct, and Gryphon Precinct) and more than a dozen short stories in this universe, including three that were initially released via Kickstarter (\"When the Magick Goes Away,\" \"Gan Brightblade vs. Mitos the Mighty,\" and the recent \"Baker's Dozen\").\nWe've seen Danthres and Torin learn the secret behind a designer drug spreading through the city-state like wildfire, deal with significant castle intrigue when Lord Albin dies unexpectedly, and solve murders ranging from a scion of a rich family to the members of a heroic quest to several wizards to who own magick shops. Plus they've dealt with perpetrators and suspects ranging from a succubus to a senile old dragon to a house faerie to a piece of animated furniture.\nHowever, it's been a few years since Gryphon Precinct, and it's past time I finally got up off my butt and did the next book in the series, Mermaid Precinct. But I've also found in my career as a freelancer that having firm deadlines is a good motivator, and I've never really had such for the \"Precinct\" books, as since 2011 they've been published by a small-press publisher, Dark Quest Books, who is unable to pay advances, and who has granted me perhaps a bit too much flexibility in my deadlines.\nNow, though, thanks to the magic of crowdfunding, I can give the fans of the \"Precinct\" series a chance to get in on the ground floor of the creation of one of the novels, help me get the project done, and also get some nifty rewards on top of that.\nWith this novel, I've run out of precincts for my titles. There are still stories to tell in the city-state of Cliff's End, however, and part of why I'm doing this latest novel via Kickstarter is to gauge interest in continuing the series. Crowdfunding has worked for short fiction -- will it work for novel-length fiction? Are there more stories to be told? Do people want to read them?\nAs an added incentive, there will be regular updates that will include excerpts of the novel in progress, which only backers will have access to.\nSo this is a multi-purpose Kickstarter. Do you want to read Mermaid Precinct? Do you want more \"Precinct\" stories? Do you like to support my work? What is the price of tea in China? Some of these questions will be answered......\nSo please do support the latest adventure of Torin and Danthres as they try to solve the murder of the legendary Pirate Queen!\nSTRETCH GOALS: We have achieved our goal! Thank you all so much!\nAnd now we've got a mess of stretch goals....\nNEW STRETCH GOAL AS OF 11 APRIL 2017: IF WE REACH $5300: Everyone who pledges $50 or higher will not only receive all the short stories, but also eBooks of all the previous novels: Dragon Precinct, Unicorn Precinct, Goblin Precinct, and Gryphon Precinct.

A worldwide collaborative storytelling project, we\u2019re offering core fans and supporters the chance to be the first to discover the secrets of the three factions who fight for control of magic beneath the surface of our mundane daily lives: the Arcanologists, the [spoilers!], and the Strowlers.\nSTROWLERS: PRELUDES takes place in Ireland and Mongolia. We shot the Ireland short last summer and now we\u2019re sending Samara, Dave, and Ben to Mongolia this March, where the shamans of Ulaanbaatar fell in love with the world of the Strowlers and have invited us out to create a short film with them.\nSTROWLERS: IRELAND is set in 1953 and tells the story of a mysterious woman who travels to Ireland to stop a magical invasion. Starring Lisa Coronado (Z-Nation) and Samara Lerman (The Gamers: Hands of Fate).\nFor STROWLERS: MONGOLIA we will arrive in March to write and shoot a story from their perspective, starring a local cast. Producer, translators, and crew are standing by for us to join them!\nIn addition to these two shorts, we\u2019ll also give everyone who pledges $25 or more an exclusive streaming preview of the STROWLERS pilot episode: our 45-minute introduction to the Seattle STROWLERS story starring Tanesha Ross (Hair) and Trin Miller (Captain Fantastic).\n$50 and higher backers will also receive a PDF of the STROWLERS WORLD BIBLE, which is full of all the secrets and information you need to get a head start on your own Strowlers stories, art, music, and collaborations.\nHow will your stories change the world?\nNow that we've achieved our initial goal, it's time to upgrade the world bible and make a few more key hires in Mongolia. Backers at $50 and higher will receive any stretch goal pages with their PDF, while backers at $100 and higher will receive any stretch goal upgrades to their print editions of the World Bible.\nLearn more about the stretch goals at this link: Update 3.\nWe are Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, the company behind JourneyQuest, The Gamers, and Dark Dungeons.

Set in the modern day, it tells the story of the dreamers, outcasts, artists, and activists who exist on the magical fringes of society. To be released under a flexible license\u2014which will allow any creator to make and distribute their own works based in the Strowlerverse\u2014we are currently producing the first round of short films and episodes from around the world that will introduce the fantastic, magical, and unexpected reality of the Strowlers.\nThe Strowlers shared cinematic universe is not our universe: it is one in which the fundamental laws of physics allow magic to exist. It is a warped mirror history that mostly parallels our world\u2019s evolution and historical progression, where the same events happened, but from different causes. Historical events, myths, and legends from our world can and often do inspire Strowlerverse stories.\nWhile 'magic' is defined by most governments as arcanology\u2014a predictable and inflexible branch of the sciences\u2014Strowlers know that true magic is wilder, less predictable, and sometimes even has a mind of its own.\nThree films set in the world of the Strowlers and a bonus documentary.\nIRELAND (22 minutes): Frankie (Samara Lerman) grew up hearing stories from her Irish grandmother about the Fair Folk, the people under the Hill. Now, she must travel the foothills of West Cork to gather the magical elements to perform one last spell, but a persistent American (Lisa Coronado) appears determined to stop her.\nMONGOLIA (~22 minutes): We will work with the shamanic community of Ulaanbaator when we arrive in March to develop and shoot their story. We plan to incorporate smoke and mirrors into the theme, as mirrors are not only a crucial part of Strowlers symbology, but are central to shaman regalia. Ulaanbaator is extremely polluted (we have to wear face masks while outdoors), which makes smoke an ever-present part of the visual landscape.\nPILOT (44 minutes): Whit (Tanesha Ross) and Amanda (Trin Miller) find their relationship stretched to the breaking point when a young girl who is manifesting magic for the first time goes on the run from the authorities. Meanwhile, the Arcanologists prepare a larger crack down on unlicensed magic users.\nDOCUMENTARY (~30 minutes): With three weeks scheduled in Mongolia, we also plan to shoot a short documentary about the life of the city shamans. They have offered us unprecedented access to their lives, stories, and rituals. With the help of a local producer and real-time translator, we will step back and listen to them tell their story, in their words. The documentary is NOT currently a reward for this campaign, as we will have to raise more money to cover its high post-production costs and it will likely not be complete until 2018, but if we are able to raise the funds for those expenses we'll be thrilled to add the digital download to the $25 and higher reward levels.\nB\u00f6\u00f6 M\u00f6rg\u00f6l or \"Mongolian Shamanism\" is the indigenous religion of Mongolia. Practiced by Chingis Khaan and his ancestors, B\u00f6\u00f6 M\u00f6rg\u00f6l is undergoing a surprising revival in Mongolia. However, while more and more young people become shamans, many people remain afraid of shamanism or view it as degraded and criminal, forcing shamans to hide their identities from the public, coworkers, and sometimes even their families. The universe of Strowlers, in many ways, is a mirror of the true experiences of young shamans in Ulaanbaatar, and the shamans who have heard of the Strowlers project feels that it resonates with them. They want these stories told because it's not just a good story, it's their story. \nOur primary collaborator, Manlai (pictured above) is a shaman who works in local government, plays basketball on the weekends, and does throat singing with Khukh Tenger.\nWhile in Mongolia, we will also be working with Khukh Tenger to record a unique album for our Kickstarter backers.\nKhukh Tenger, (Blue Sky) is an ensemble of musicians, vocalists and throat singers. The group performs a combination of traditional and modern pieces on traditional instruments, adding their own unique flair, incorporating Morin Huur (Horse head fiddle), flute, zither, jaw harp, and several styles of khoomei (throat singing). Khukh Tenger, and its members have performed across Mongolia and in several countries including China and Thailand. The members of Khukh Tenger, have agreed to make a custom album for STROWLERS and our documentary.\nThe Strowlerverse features a deck of cards, called a B\u00edspell deck, that is almost as ubiquitous as a standard deck of playing cards. A wide range of games are possible with the deck, from simple children\u2019s games that resemble Go Fish to complex trick-taking games along the lines of Bridge. A modern deck holds four numbered suits plus a trump suit. There are rumors of a fifth numbered suit\u2014a mystical one\u2014that has been lost, suppressed, or both.\nAn example R\u00fan card - \"The Storyteller\"\nIn addition to the regular cards in the standard B\u00edspell deck (called the d\u00e6l), many players collect R\u00fan cards. These are non-suited character and archetype cards and hundreds of them exist. No two decks will be the same, depending on which cards a player has collected.\nThese extended decks are used to play \u201cWalk the Labyrinth\u201d, a storytelling game. Each player constructs a narrative using the cards they are dealt. Players may choose to work together to tell cooperative tales or compete to help or hinder the heroes of the shared story. Beneath the obvious \u201cimaginary play\u201d element, this game features hidden levels of magical teaching and political intrigue. Many Strowlers identify with certain R\u00fan cards in the deck, and may construct their own identities and personal narratives around their interpretation of that card and its journey through the labyrinth.\nPledges of $50 and higher will receive an etched metal R\u00fan card that is unique to this campaign, featuring the labyrinth on the back and a unique archetype character from the Mongolia story on the front.\n We're designing a limited-edition world bible for our $100 and higher backers. Conceptualized as a premium art book, it will include everything you need to know about the world of the Strowlers, with gorgeous full-page art and photographs from Seattle, Ireland, and Mongolia.\nThe book begins as a deluxe softcover, printed on 80# silk text coated paper, but stretch goals could transform it all the way into a leather-bound hardcover with foil-embossed dust jacket, additional pages, and more.\n$1 \u2013 Tip Jar\n$12 \u2013 Early streaming access to PRELUDES: MONGOLIA & IRELAND\n$25 \u2013 Digital downloads of PRELUDES: MONGOLIA & IRELAND, early Streaming Access to the Pilot, Digital Download of the Album\n$50 \u2013 Signed DVD of PRELUDES: MONGOLIA & IRELAND, Digital Download of the World Bible PDF, Limited Edition Metal \"R\u00fan\" Labyrinth Card\n$100 \u2013 World Bible collector's edition art book, featuring full color photos from Ireland, Mongolia, and Seattle (eligible for stretch goals)\n$250 \u2013 30 minute consult with a member of the Strowlers Story Team to help develop your own canon piece of the story.\n$500 \u2013 60 minute consult with a member of the Strowlers Story Team to help develop your own canon piece of the story.\n$1000 \u2013 Associate Producer Credit on STROWLERS: PRELUDES\n$5000 \u2013 Executive Producer Credit on STROWLERS: PRELUDES\nThis is really important, so read carefully:\nWe will charge for all shipping after the campaign in BackerKit. In order for your rewards to ship, you will need to pay shipping fees at that time. Do NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now.\nThe Short Version\u2014\nInternational Backers: expect to pay less than $9.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\n\nDomestic Backers: expect to pay less than $5.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\n\n The Long Version, for people who like details\u2014\nInternational Backers: we are working with a third-party agency to fulfill your orders from warehouses in Europe, Canada, and Australia. This should help cut your typical U.S. shipping costs by a huge margin. Please be aware that you may still be responsible for import duties. We must comply with international law and can not mark your reward as a gift or as a zero value item. Duties will not be included in your shipping charge, with one exception... \nEU Backers: We will include VAT for EU members when we charge for shipping in BackerKit. That way your package should arrive with much less hassle and holdup. And a bit faster as well. \nDomestic Backers: we want to get the best-possible shipping and handling rate for you. Rather than over-estimating expenses now, we will charge actual rates when we are ready to ship. \nAll Backers: by handling shipping this way, we reduce unknown costs now, which means we know exactly how much we can put into the production budget, and then we can use economy of scale to make specific shipping orders with exact details. What will shipping cost, you ask?\nESTIMATING SHIPPING COSTS\nInternational orders will average $.99 handling per item, plus local shipping costs. This should still be much less than you have paid in the past. (For example, in 2013 our cost to ship a DVD internationally began at $8.59 and went up from there as the weight increased.) Unfortunately, we cannot calculate this more precisely until we know our volume and can negotiate for the best rate possible. Domestic orders will start at the current Media Mail rate for a five ounce parcel, plus a minimum of $.25 handling per item. You can estimate that shipping will begin around $3.99, plus more for larger or heavier packages that include more than a DVD. Again, we'll use our volume to negotiate for the best-possible quote.\nStrowlers is a shared cinematic universe. We want you to tell stories of the fantastic that are set where you live: whether fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or beyond, the possibilities are limitless. This section is for everyone who has questions about how to become an active storyteller within the Strowlerverse.\nAs we are \"soft launching\" Strowlers with this Kickstarter, with a focus on core ZOE fans and passionate storytellers, certain elements of the plan for the public release are still in flux. The following represents a summary of current progress. We welcome your input and suggestions.\nLICENSING AND RIGHTS (BETA VERSION)\nStrowlers\u2122 is an open world that everybody is invited to play in. Released under a license similar to Creative Commons, the heart of Strowlers is an open wiki containing a brief history of the world, the rules for how the world works, and a style guide. Fans and professionals alike are invited to create and distribute short films, novels, plays, and art set in the world.\nWhile anybody may sell their Strowlers creations, only the Strowlers Executive Story Team can label a work as \"Canon\". Canon works\u2014pieces that fit into the official Strowlers story\u2014must be approved in advance by the Strowlers Executive Story Team. While for-profit Strowlers creations and derivatives are asked to voluntarily contribute a percentage of their profits, canon-labeled works are asked to share at least 10% of their net. This helps us to support ongoing project management, for example offsetting costs for story support and project infrastructure.\nGUIDELINES FOR INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS\nProducing stories in the Strowlerverse requires an understanding of several key mandates, all of which are designed to help keep a focus on character-driven stories of the fantastic that can be produced using existing resources.\nScripts should: \nuse existing locations \nnot require massive construction or manufacturing \nfeature a small cast \nlimit special effects - one fantastic practical effect is better than 20 mediocre CGI ones \nfocus on stories that are personal and character-driven\nStories not intended to be produced for the screen, of course, can use larger special effects.\nWhile anybody is invited to tell a Stowlers story, in order for it to be declared Canon\u2014an official part of the story universe\u2014the story must complete the following steps:\npitch your concept to the executive story team for notes and approval \nif approved, the story editors will help integrate larger story and plot threads to build connections between scripts that can lead to a cohesive world \nif you plan to sell your work, the executive line producer will need to greenlight the project and budget and negotiate a fair profit-sharing agreement with you\n*And tell the story in your own language!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully funded seven Kickstarter campaigns and are now experienced in delivery and fulfillment, with thousands of happy backers.\n\nThis campaign does not have the best timing, as we are still completing reward fulfillment for JourneyQuest 3 and are in post-production for The Gamers: The Shadow Menace. (We just finished domestic fulfillment for Attacking the Darkness. Int'l rewards for that campaign are shipping on the pallet to the UK with JQ3 rewards.) While we would prefer to wait to run this until those fulfillments are complete, March is literally the last time that we could shoot the Mongolia project.\n\nThe Mongolia portion of the project is the biggest risk. We'll be in a country where we don't speak the language. We are mitigating these risks in the following ways:\n\n1) Working with Amalia Rubin, a long-time ZOE fan and Mongolian scholar, who we trust to manage the local logistics.\n2) Bringing Samara Lerman as a producer. She has also acted in numerous ZOE films and can fill in as an actor if we run into problems.\n3) We spent seven days in Ireland testing this production process. With over three weeks in Mongolia, we know we have the skill set and process to get the footage we need, even if the current plan changes dramatically when we land.\n4) The shamans with whom we are working already succeeded in shooting a Strowlers trailer, which shows immense dedication to and excitement about this project.\n5) Dave Richards, our third attendee on the trip, is an accomplished sound recordist and mixer with years of field experience in challenging working conditions.\n6) While Mongolian winters are extremely cold and the city air is quite polluted, we're traveling during a period when temperatures historically improve. But we hear that Mongolian boots, hats, and coats are affordable and excellent quality, should we need to bundle up. And we're bringing pro-quality air filters for outdoor travel and shooting.\n\nEssentially, we've planned carefully, we've tested the process, and we're prepared to improvise. Flights and lodging are already arranged.\n\nBesides the Mongolian element, this is not a risky campaign. The other rewards have already been shot and are currently in post-production. We know how to handle reward fulfillment efficiently. And we've successfully recovered from setbacks on past campaigns and managed to fulfill our responsibilities to our backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "TIP JAR", "descp": "Thanks for your support!\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Backer-Only Kickstarter Updates\nAccess to the BackerKit Pledge Manager for Add-ons", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "STREAMING ONLY", "descp": "See the STROWLERS: PRELUDES early!

Because we agree with Brian Froud...in nearly every culture, if you sort through the accounts of the fae most of them were not pleasant. Mischevious, Malicious, Warlike... those are the words used to describe fae creatures. Dark Fantasy aside, with the innundation of froo-froo fairies in today's media, we felt an overwhelming need to bring the root of the fae legends into the modern day...so clap your hands...NOW!\nIt is hard to believe that the Bad-Ass Faeries series has been around for a decade now. The original anthologies were edited by Danielle Ackley-McPhail, L. Jagi Lamplighter, Lee C. Hillman, and Jeffrey Lyman, but with the completion of Bad-Ass Faeries: It's Elemental, the editorial team has taken a hiatus. Sadly, during that time, due to issues with the previous publishers not paying royalties the books, as of this year, are no longer in active print. \nThey have always been near and dear to my heart, however, and we could not let this landmark go by without commemoration. This is also our opportunity to preserve highlights from this award-winning series through this anniversary edition.\nThe stories selected for inclusion, based on fan and reviewer response, are as follows:\nBad-Ass Faeries  \nBrian Koscienski & Chris Pisano - The Ballad of the Seven-Up Sprite\nKeith R.A. DeCandido - House Arrest\nAdam P. Knave - Futuristic Cybernetic Faerie Assassin Hassballah  \nJesse Harris - Hidden in the Folds  \nJust Plain Bad  \nJames Chambers - Way of the Bone  \nCJ Henderson - Do You Believe?  \nDanielle Ackley-McPhail - Within the Guardian Bell  \nJohn Passarella - Twilight Crossing  \nJeffrey Lyman- Grimm Necessity  \nBernie Mojzes - Moonshine\nIn All Their Glory  \nL.

To add one of the below onto your current pledge, just click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button at the top right of the page, click in the \"Pledge Amount\" box, and change the pledge amount to reflect the addition of the amount of the add-on you want.  \nExample: if your current pledge amount is $10, and you want to add a $5 add-on, you would click into the \"Pledge Amount\" box and change the pledge amount to $15. At the end of the Kickstarter, we'll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for.  \nNOTES: all ebooks listed available in .epub, mobi, or .pdf, unless indicated.

In 2014 she joined forces with husband Mike McPhail and friend Greg Schauer to form her own publishing house, eSpec Books (www.especbooks.com).  \nHer published works include six novels, Yesterday's Dreams, Tomorrow's Memories, Today\u2019s Promise, The Halfling\u2019s Court, The Redcaps\u2019 Queen, and Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn, written with Day Al-Mohamed. She is also the author of the solo collections A Legacy of Stars, Consigned to the Sea, Flash in the Can, and Transcendence, the non-fiction writers\u2019 guide, The Literary Handyman, and is the senior editor of the Bad-Ass Faeries anthology series, Gaslight & Grimm, Dragon\u2019s Lure, and In an Iron Cage. Her short stories are included in numerous other anthologies and collections.\n N.R. Brown has a passion for books. During the day she is a librarian, while at night she is a horror and dark fantasy writer and blogger. Her work has appeared in the anthology Clockwork Chaos and Chiaroscuro (www.chizine.com). An avid cook, geocacher, and improv performer, she lives in Maryland with her partner Day and two very spoiled labradors.\nJames Chambers writes tales of horror, crime, fantasy, and science fiction. He is the author of The Engines of Sacrifice, a collection of four Lovecraftian-inspired novellas published by Dark Regions Press which Publisher\u2019s Weekly described in a starred-review as \u201c\u2026chillingly evocative\u2026.\u201d He is also the author of the short fiction collections Resurrection House (Dark Regions Press) as well as the dark, urban fantasy novella, Three Chords of Chaos and The Dead Bear Witness and Tears of Blood, volume one and two in the Corpse Fauna novella series.  \nHis short stories have been published in dozens of anthologies including The Avenger: Roaring Heart of the Crucible, Chiral Mad 2, Clockwork Chaos, Deep Cuts, Dragon\u2019s Lure, Fantastic Futures 13, Gaslight and Grimm, In An Iron Cage, Qualia Nous, Reel Dark, Truth or Dare, TV Gods, Walrus Tales, Warfear, and the award-winning Bad-Ass Faeries and Defending the Future series as well as the magazines Bare Bone, Cthulhu Sex, and Allen K\u2019s Inhuman.  \nHe has also edited and written numerous comic books including Leonard Nimoy\u2019s Primortals, the critically acclaimed \u201cThe Revenant\u201d in Shadow House, and the original graphic novel Kolchak, the Night Stalker: The Forgotten Lore of Edgar Allan Poe. \nHis website is www.jameschambersonline.com.\nKeith R.A. DeCandido has been writing fiction professionally for twenty-three years now, which makes him feel very old. Well, that, and his arthritic knees. He has written more than fifty novels, almost a hundred short stories, a mess of comic books, and a bunch of nonfiction, both in various licensed universes ranging from TV shows (Star Trek, Supernatural, Sleepy Hollow, Doctor Who, and tons more) to games (World of Warcraft, Dungeons & Dragons, StarCraft, Command & Conquer) to movies (Cars, Resident Evil, Kung Fu Panda, Aliens, Night of the Living Dead, Serenity) to comic books (prose featuring Spider-Man, Thor, the Hulk, the Silver Surfer, the X-Men, etc.), as well as in his own original universes. The latter includes fantastical police procedurals in the fictional city of Cliff's End, starting with the novel Dragon Precinct, and including several more novels and a mess of short stories, one of which, \"House Arrest,\" will be reprinted in The Best of Bad-Ass Faeries, having appeared in the inaugural anthology in that series ten years ago. Keith also writes the Super City Cops series of cop stories set in a city filled with superheroes, urban fantasy tales set in Key West featuring Cassie Zukav, weirdness magnet, and 2017 will see the debut novel featuring Bram Gold, a nice Jewish boy from the Bronx who hunts monsters, A Furnace Sealed.

French has worked for over thirty years as a crime scene investigator and has seen more than his share of murders, shootings and serious assaults. As a break from the realities of his job, he writes science fiction, pulp, horror, fantasy, and, of course, crime fiction.  \nIn 1992 John began writing stories based on his training and experiences on the streets of Baltimore. His first story \u201cPast Sins\u201d was published in Hardboiled Magazine and was cited as one of the best Hardboiled stories of 1993. More crime fiction followed, appearing in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Mystery Magazine, the Fading Shadows magazines and in collections by Barnes and Noble. Association with writers like James Chambers and the late, great C.J. Henderson led him to try horror fiction and to a still growing fascination with zombies and other undead things. His first horror story \u201cThe Right Solution\u201d appeared in Marietta Publishing\u2019s Lin Carter\u2019s Anton Zarnak. Other horror stories followed in anthologies such as The Dead Walk and Dark Furies, both published by Die Monster Die books. It was in Dark Furies that his character Bianca Jones made her literary debut in \u201c21 Doors,\u201d a story based on an old Baltimore legend and a creepy game his daughter used to play with her friends.  \nYou can find John on Facebook or you can email him at him at jfrenchfam@aol.com.\nKelly A. Harmon used to write truthful, honest stories about authors and thespians, senators and statesmen, movie stars and murderers. Now she writes lies, which is infinitely more satisfying, but lacks the convenience of doorstep delivery. She is an award-winning journalist and author, and a member of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America. A Baltimore native, she writes the Charm City Darkness series, which includes the novels Stoned in Charm City, A Favor for a Fiend, and the soon to be published, A Blue Collar Proposition. Her science fiction and fantasy stories can be found in Triangulation: Dark Glass, Hellebore and Rue, and Deep Cuts: Mayhem, Menace and Misery.  \nMs. Harmon is a former newspaper reporter and editor, and now edits for Pole to Pole Publishing, a small Baltimore publisher.

His short story, Hidden In the Folds, proved to be a perfect launch point for bringing the two together.

A sister who turns out to be quite good with her sword, and ready to use it when faced with things like a dragon as long as her brother is at her side.   \nLiam begins to realize two things: it's going to be a very long day, and having a sister can be weird.  \nBut most unsettling of all, he's not sure he minds\u2026\nPOST\nby Brenda Cooper\nThe world, for some, has crumbled.   \nDisease and natural disasters have brought on social collapse in the Pacific Northwest.  \nFor Sage, born and raised in the safe haven of the Oregon Botanical Gardens, that has never been more than academic. What more could she ask for than to be safe and fed?  \nBut life in the Garden is static.  \nSage longs to experience the world beyond the Garden walls as society climbs from the chaos. Her reckless exploration forces her elders to give her a choice: Stay here, hidden in safety, or go and never return.  \nSage chooses to leave.  \nWill she learn soon enough on her journey that the world outside the Garden follows no law? \nThat there is no predator more dangerous than man?  \nWill she learn soon enough that to rebuild the world one must be ready to fight for it?  \nShe will need to if she chooses to live.\nNOTE: All ebook rewards and pledges are available in .epub, .mobi, and .pdf\nUNLOCKED!

Hemry) is the author of the New York Times best-selling Lost Fleet series, the Lost Stars series, and the \"steampunk with dragons\" Pillars of Reality Series. His most recent books are THE LOST STARS - SHATTERED SPEAR, THE LOST FLEET: BEYOND THE FRONTIER - LEVIATHAN, and the Pillars of Reality novels THE SERVANTS OF THE STORM and THE WRATH OF THE GREAT GUILDS. In May, VANGUARD will be published, the first in a new trilogy set centuries before the events in The Lost Fleet series. John's novels have been published in eleven languages. This year, Titan will begin bringing out a Lost Fleet comic series. His short fiction includes works covering time travel, alternate history, space opera, military SF, fantasy, and humor.  \nJohn has also written articles on declassified Cold War plans for US military bases on the Moon, and Liberating the Future: Women in the Early Legion (of Superheroes) in Sequart's Teenagers From the Future. At somewhat erratic intervals he presents his talk on Everything I Needed To Know About Quantum Physics I Learned From The Three Stooges, showing how Stooge skits illustrate principles of quantum physics.  \nJohn is a retired US Navy officer, who served in a wide variety of jobs including surface warfare (the ship drivers of the Navy), amphibious warfare, anti-terrorism, intelligence, and some other things that he's not supposed to talk about. Being a sailor, he has been known to tell stories about Events Which He Says Really Happened (but which cannot be verified by any independent sources). This experience has served him well in writing fiction.  \nHe lives in Maryland with his indomitable wife \u201cS\u201d and three great kids (all three on the autism spectrum).\nBrenda Cooper writes science fiction and fantasy novels and short stories, and sometimes, poetry. Her most recent novel is EDGE OF DARK, from Pyr and her most recent story collection is CRACKING THE SKY from Fairwood Press. SPEAR OF LIGHT was released from Pyr in June of 2016 and POST will be out from eSpec Books in late fall 2016.  EDGE OF DARK was a finalist for the PK Dick Award and is a finalist for the ENDEAVOUR Award.\nBrenda is a technology professional and a futurist, and publishes non-fiction on the environment and the future. Her non-fiction has appeared on Slate and Crosscut and her short fiction has appeared in Nature Magazine, among other venues. See her website at www.brenda-cooper.com. \nBrenda lives in the Pacific Northwest in a household with three people, three dogs, far more than three computers, and only one TV in it.\n    Richard P. Clark - Zippy Studio (The  Sister Paradox)  Born in a crossfire hurricane (actually Cleveland, OH), Richard P. Clark's illustration career began in 1993 while still an undergraduate at The Columbus College of Art and Design. Working in a variety of styles, his clients include HBO, Playboy, The Wall Street Journal, Duke University, Marvel, DC and Dark Horse comics among many others. \nMr. Clark currently resides in Upstate NY with his wife, daughter and more pets than he\u2019d like to have. \nYou can find out more about Richard at zippystudio.com and follow him on Twitter @zipyrich.\nCynthia Radthorne - (POST) Cynthia\u2019s illustrations have appeared on book covers, web sites, trading card games, and at art shows at science fiction and fantasy conventions.

Apologies for any confusion.\nSPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT - Man and Machine Dedication -Today it is the anniversary of CJ Henderson's passing. \nCJ is the reason The Defending The Future Anthology Series exists. Before CJ passed he wrote something of a farewell to the DTF family. It spoke of his pleasure and joy in being among the DTF rank of authors and his experience writing for the series. It's not a story, but it is deeply personal and a fitting final word from the grandfather of the series. \nIn tribute to him and his involvement, Man and Machine will be dedicated to CJ Henderson and the book will include this final farewell from our friend. Also, for those short on funds or who are CJ fans rather than DTF fans, we are adding for this week a special $1 pledge level that will get backers at that level a digital copy of CJ's farewell and their names in the back of the book on a CJ Henderson memorial page. \nPlease share the word on this if you know anyone who might be interested: http://tiny.cc/DTF7 \nThank you all for being a part of this journey and helping to keep CJ's legacy alive.\nThe plan had been to un-man the battlespace; replacing flesh and blood with steel and carbon fiber. Machines, both remote-guided and autonomous, would fight and be destroyed in the name of freedom, sparing the troops. However, as with all arms races, the opposing side\u2019s technology eventually catches ups to yours, resulting in the need to put lives back on the frontline to deal with the unknown.\nGear up! This fight is far from over in 13 new stories of the struggle to survive, the new machines of war. \nWith stories by Bud Sparhawk, Jennifer Brozek, Ronald Garner, Aaron Rosenberg, Brenda Cooper, James Chambers, Nancy Jane Moore, Patrick Thomas, Jeff Young, Eric Hardenbrook, Robert E.

We intend to deliver a professionally designed book, not only as an e-book, but as a trade paperback. This Kickstarter is designed to raise money to pay for new artwork, new editing, cover and interior design work, and printing costs.\nWe anticipate needing approximately $1500 for art, $400 for editing, $500+ for design work, $1000 for initial printing costs, $750 for advertising and promotion, and at least $400 in misc. taxes and fees for this Kickstarter. So, if your calculator is up to snuff, you'll see the $4000 we're asking for doesn't QUITE cover anticipated expenses, but we'd be well within the ballpark.\nFor artwork, we intend to deliver not only this gorgeous cover by Shane Braithwaite (more about Shane in a bit), but also ten black and white interior digital paintings as the front pieces for each story.\nWe hope you'll give this project your support and share the word with your friends and other fans of dark fantasy, warped fairy tales and sarcastic protagonists. We look forward to the successful completion of this journey.\nThe cover art to For a Few Gold Pieces More\nPreview of The Demon's Head front pieces\nI\u2019m a science fiction and fantasy author, but I have credits in non-fiction, action-adventure, and new pulp. I\u2019ve also written media tie-in works for the Star Trek, Incredible Hulk, and Doctor Who franchises. I also did a novel based on the video game, Gauntlet Dark Legacy, which was a best-selling title for my publisher and am currently writing an on-line short story series called Strikeforce Falcon, which is historical action-adventure. My latest work was Terra Incognito, a non-fiction book, on the subject of world building for both writers and gamers. \nOne of my reviewers summed up the stories as \u201cLord of the Rings if filmed by Sergio Leone\u201d, which is appropriate since over ten short stories, I never name, nor do I ever describe, the protagonist, which was a lot harder than it sounds. He is an unreliable narrator at best, so he never feels the need to name himself. If you\u2019ll humor me for a minute, he\u2019s really \u201cThe Rogue with No Name\u201d. I intentionally avoided naming the character outside of the stories too. Even now, I get asked what his name was at conventions, and I honestly reply, \u201cI have no clue. What do you want his name to be?\u201d \nThe stories draw deeply from folktales and legends from around the world and my unnamed rogue allows me to put a fresh spin on these stories and occasionally mash tales together. I like to show how tales can be universal in nature. For example, one of my stories mixes a Norse tale about a cursed sword with Yorban mythology from Nigeria. I also have one tale that is based on the Swan Maiden, but it\u2019s the Chinese version. The object for these tales was to try and find stories the readers might find familiar but put my own spin on them.\nI\u2019ve been very lucky to work with Shane Braithwaite on this project. He\u2019s an Australian artist who\u2019s looking to break in to the American book scene as a cover artist. I think after you see the work he\u2019s done for the cover of For a Few Gold Pieces More and my other book, Terra Incognito, you\u2019ll agree he shouldn\u2019t have any problems finding more work. But please, don\u2019t swamp him down with too many request. One of the stretch goals we have is to do even more art for this book.  \nYou can find more of Shane\u2019s artwork on his Deviant Art page http://sbraithwaite.deviantart.com/\nExamples of Shane Braithwaite's work\nI\u2019m also going to be working with Steve Roman, who\u2019ll be doing the editing for this book. Steve is a former editor-in-chief for a New York publisher and he currently works as a freelance editor for various publishers.  \nI know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cRich, why do you need an editor if these stories were previously published.\u201d It\u2019s simple. I want another set of eyes on this because I owe it to you to make this the best it can be before we go to press.\nThe series has gotten uniformly good reviews from both individuals and review sites. Here are a few of the comments people have had about the series:  \nFor a Few Gold Pieces More:\n\"Entertaining, old-school sword and sorcery, in the tradition of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.\"  - Jim C. Hines; Author of the Magic Ex Libris, Jig the Goblin,and The Princesses Series\n\"Richard C. White knows how to spin a great yarn. These stories do not disappoint.\" - Bobby Nash; Author of Evil Ways, Domino Lady: Money Shot, and Alexandra Holzer's Ghost Gal: The Wlld Hunt\nThe Demon\u2019s Head\nWhile the book was short it was amazingly well written. The character didn't have a name but while reading it felt like I was the character. Strange huh? Super awesome writing and story. - Reese\u2019s Reviews\nRichard C. White knows how to write a story! Wow, I saw what he saw, heard what he heard, and felt what he felt. I was walking in the swamp with him and I didn't even know his name. Yes, you read it correctly... I just read a short story that never mentioned the main character's name and loved it! Who knew? Well-paced and flowing nicely... this is a sign of an awesome writer. I was hooked very early in my reading and before I knew it the story was over and leaving me wanting more. - http://cloeyk.blogspot.com\nThe Mountain of Ice\nThis is fast paced story filled with surprises. I admired our hero, empathized with the Queen\u2019s slave, and hated the bad men, just like the author wanted me to. He kept my interest, made the story a bit spicy, and made me hope I might read more by him. - Long and Short Reviews\nShades of Blue\nDespite clocking in at 20 pages Shades of Blue feels like a full length novel. I finished it wishing there could be more to this tale \u2026 Shades of Blue is the perfect choice for anyone who loves surprises. - Long and Short Reviews\nThe Black School\nI am quite interested in learning more about the backstories of the main characters in this piece. The brief glimpses of their earlier lives that show up in this book have whetted my appetite for more \u2026 I sense that there is a lot we don\u2019t know \u2026 and I think that figuring that out will make their adventures unforgettable. The Black School piqued my interest right away. - Long and Short Reviews\nSword of Fate\nSword of Fate by Richard White was a great read that had the main character learning that he is a better man than what he thinks he is. I enjoyed this story \u2026 It was easy to visualize the characters and find yourself rooting for them. I have no problem recommending this book to those that like this genre. - Drue's Random Chatter's & Reviews\nThe rewards are getting to professionally produce a book my readers will be happy to own . . . Oh, you mean the rewards for the people who contribute to the Kickstarter.  \nWell, the rewards obviously vary. They run from e-copies of the book, to physical copies of the book, to art work by Shane, chain mail jewelry by Wishweaver Creations, and even a copy of every work of mine currently in print. There are also a couple of chances to see yourself in print. At one donation level, I\u2019ll be happy to write you or a character of yours into one of my stories and at the ultimate donation level, I\u2019ll add a new story into the collection where you are teamed up with (or perhaps the antagonist of) my rogue.\nWe also have stretch goals we hope to reach which will unlock additional things for the donators. One which we mentioned will be having Shane add more art to the book. The others will be released as we achieve those goals.\nWe anticipate the book release (and reward release) for Spring 2016. We\u2019ll be posting updates on Kickstarter to keep everyone in the loop. Also we\u2019ll as posting information on my web site, www.richardcwhite.com, and also on my Facebook page, which will be linked to on the Kickstarter page below.\nIf we hit $5000 in pledges, we'll offer those who've made a $25 pledge or higher an opportunity to upgrade their books to a slip-covered hardback, featuring art by Shane for $15. Those who've pledged less than $25, can still up grade for $25. (Locked)\n If we reach $6500 in pledges, we'll insert additional black and white art into the book by Shane. So, more art for no additional cost, just additional pledges. Now, if that's not an excuse to bug your friends and neighbors to support this Kickstarter, what is?

Totally sharing this!", "time": "over 5 years ago"}]}}, {"backer": "Danielle Ackley-McPhail", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi, I'm Mike Friedman. Last year I worked with 13 of my favorite writers to bring you Pangaea, an anthology of great science fiction stories. You loved the campaign so much that we blew past our funding goal here on Kickstarter. This year we\u2019re at it again, bringing in more great writers...for Pangaea II: The Rise of Dominjaron.\nHere's what some of our Kickstarter backers said after our first Pangaea campaign...\nI've been a fan of many of these authors for many years; getting the chance to read their exploration of a new Earth was a no-brainer. This was a fun read from beginning to end. --Chuck May, Pittsburgh, PA.\nGot the books today. They look fantastic. Love all the signatures. Make sure I know about any other Kickstarters you get going. --Tasha Turner Lennhoff, Highland Park, NJ.\nI'm happy to say everything was delivered as promised and on time, and the book itself exceeded my expectations. I cannot wait for Pangaea II. --Jim Arrowood, Kearney, NE.\nThe Pangaea team was fantastic and collaborative, responding to requests and questions promptly and with the can-do approach that made it a fun to be part of. The result was a collection of stories that was a delight to read and hard to put down! Thank you all! --Roscoe Fay, New South Wales, Australia\nOne Land\nAt least four times in Earth\u2019s history, the continents have come sliding together. Over millions of years, separate and distinct landmasses have crawled across the planet's surface on immense tectonic plates to form a single mass--a super-continent. Geologists have dubbed the most recent such formation Pangaea.\nOf course, Pangaea broke up a long time ago, and because it did, mankind developed in drastically different climes and circumstances. But what if we twenty-first century types were living in one of the super-continental periods--those characterized by \u201clid tectonics\u201d rather than \u201cplate tectonics?\u201d What would it be like if all of humanity was confined to a single landmass...and had been so confined for all of our recorded history?\nThat's the ever-so-tantalizing axis on which our Pangaea anthologies turn.\nIt's an exciting and original idea, one that deserves the best world-building talent available. So to explore this world on your behalf, we've harnessed the word-smithing abilities of some of science fiction's most inventive writers.\nThe Pangaea Publishing Model\nIn a traditional publishing arrangement, less than 10% of the proceeds from a book go to the author. Hard to believe, isn't it, considering the author is the one providing 100% of the insight and wit? The lion's share of the cover price goes to the book store and the publisher, to cover both their costs and their profits.\nIn the case of this anthology, all proceeds after production and distribution costs go to the writers whose work drew you to the book in the first place--which, after all, is how it should be. When you support Pangaea, you're supporting a new and infinitely more equitable publishing model. You're saying that writers should finally enjoy the fruits of their labor.\nIt's a subversive idea, no question about it. But we believe it's an idea whose time has come.\nWho's We?\nSome of the most respected writers in science fiction and fantasy today. Kirsten Beyer. Ilsa J. Bick. Michael A. Burstein. Peter David. Kevin Dilmore. Michael Jan Friedman. Robert Greenberger. Glenn Hauman. Paul Kupperberg. Ron Marz. Kelly Meding. Aaron Rosenberg. Lawrence M. Schoen. Geoffrey Thorne. Marie Vibbert.\nNot just great writers, by the way. They're also people who love and respect their craft and their chosen genre. If you get a chance to speak with them, you'll hear the excitement in their voices as they talk about their contributions to Pangaea.\nAnd others have agreed to come aboard if we hit some of our stretch goals--which, of course, is all the more reason to hit them!\nA La Carte Menu\nRather than ask you to read every possible combination of reward components, here's a handy menu for add-ons. Remember, these are additions to the rewards you'll see on the right side of the web page. All you have to do, when you pledge, is send me a message as to which add-ons you'd like and I'll take care of the rest.\nFor $10 more, you can add an author-signed print of Brazilian artist Caio Cacau's Pangaea or Pangaea II cover to your reward at the $25 level or higher.

Both books will be signed by at least three of our writers.\nFor $20 more (plus international shipping of $20 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of the original Pangaea anthology to your reward at the $25 level or higher. This book will be signed by at least three of our writers.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition.\nFor an additional $20, you can receive one of my other Crazy 8 Press books: Fight The Gods, Aztlan, I Am The Salamander, or Lost Days.

Any two would be $50, any three would be $75, and all four would be $100. If you're outside the U.S., please add $20 to each book for postage. Of course, I'll be happy to sign each book for free.\nFor $35 more, you can name a business, a street, or a one-time bystander (phonetically, of course, since this is not our world)--and also become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the Acknowledgments page.\nFor $700 more, you or someone you love will receive a large print of an alternate cover to the anthology suitable for framing -- a one-of-a-kind, custom treat created with your input and signed by talented Brazilian painter Caio Cacau -- as well as smaller prints of the sketches that went into the development of the alternate cover. (No additional postage necessary within the U.S. Outside the U.S., add $50.)\nStretch Goals!\nAt $9,000, we add a story to the anthology by rising sci fi star Tiffany Trent!\nAt $11,000, we add yet another story to the anthology by an as-yet-unrevealed science fiction writer!\nAt $12,000, we add three more author signatures to each book we send out--a total of at least six signatures.\nAt $13,000, we unlock another added value: Caio Cacau, our cover artist, will provide a black-and-white illustration for each of our stories, to be included in every edition of the book.\nAt $16,000, each backer from $25 on up will receive a set of 5\" by 8\" prints of the black-and-white illustrations described above.\nAdditional stretch goals will be announced as we go along (It's more fun when we keep you in suspense)!\nThe Ground Floor\nOur collective intention is to make this anthology the second of many in the world of Pangaea. We want to make it the kind of place to which you'll return time and again, glimpsing some new and intriguing aspect each time.\nOur Writers\nKirsten Beyer\nKirsten Beyer is the New York Times Bestselling author of several Star Trek Voyager novels, including String Theory: Fusion, Full Circle, Unworthy, Children of the Storm, The Eternal Tide, Protectors, Acts of Contrition, Atonement, and A Pocket Full of Lies.

The moment the suggestion left her mouth the title Gaslight and Grimm popped out of mine. Little did Diana know what she was getting in to... I agreed to do the collection as long as she joined me as co-editor.\nIf we would have been able to produce the book back then we would have broken the trend. Sadly, life happened. We did all the work and even had one of the stories outgrow the collection and become a novel, but the project sat the shelf for much longer than we would have liked. \nSince the anthology's inception loads of steampunk faerie tale novels and collections have come out. Does that matter to us? NO! It was a cool idea then and it is still a cool idea now. We can\u2019t wait to bring you this wonderful, fully illustrated collection in the fine tradition of all those classic fairy tale books we all grew up on, not because of any trend, but because we believe in it and our authors believe in it. Because we enjoy taking amazing ideas and making them a reality.\nAfter all\u2026books are the magic we make.\nOnce upon a time... ageless tales were told countlessly from one generation to the next. Tales of brave heroes and common men. Of beautiful princesses and good-hearted youths. Tales of danger and caution and magic...classics that still echo in our hearts and our fondest memories even to this day, told from worn, cherished books or from memory at Grandmother's knee.\nOh yes, tales have been told...but never quite like these.

It will contain approximately 20 all-original (no reprint) short stories each from established SF&F authors, actors, cartoonists, and personalities in the publishing world and media industry\u2014including Elena Beloff, S.C. Butler (SF&F writer), David B. Coe (SF&F writer), Julie E. Czerneda (SF&F writer), Barry Dutter (DC Comics), Ron Ferdinand (Dennis the Menace), Esther Friesner (SF&F writer), Jim C. Hines (SF&F writer), Tony Isabella, Susan Jett (SF&F writer), Liana K (TV personality), Barbara Randall Kesel, Amy Lago (Washington Post syndicate), Jessica Lahr (Mrs. New York), Laura Magnusson (graphic audio), Jeff Mariotte & Marcy Rockwell (SF&F writers), Lee Nordling, Jody Lynn Nye (SF&F writer), Aprilynne Pike, Scott Roberts, Tony Sokol (Den of the Geek), and Bobby and Peter Timony (cartoonists). The books will be edited by John Zakour & Joshua Palmatier, both authors published by DAW Books Inc.\nBackers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce this anthology\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, payment for artists providing the illustrations for each story, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. The reward levels for the anthology have been set to closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthology. This anthology will be produced only as a trade paperback (unlike Zombies Need Brains\u2019 previous anthologies for adults that had a special Kickstarter edition in a smaller format).\nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors (check out our two current offerings\u2014\u201cClockwork Universe: Steampunk vs. Aliens\u201d and \u201cTemporally Out of Order\u201d\u2014if you have any doubts), offering professional pay rates and featuring stellar cover art and illustrations. With your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you! Consider backing our Kickstarter and then help spread the word. Just as Zombies Need Brains, we need your support to make this new small press a success. The backers of the \"Clockwork Universe\" and \u201cTemporally Out of Order\u201d anthologies helped set up the press. You can help solidify that foundation! So what is the current project? Well, as you\u2019ve already seen, something slightly different. Here are the details:\nFuntastical Bedtime Stories:\nOverview: Reading a bedtime story has been a time-honored tradition for parents and their kids since the dawn of the universe. Evening story time allows for bonding, entertainment, and relaxation. There can never be too many bedtime stories.  That\u2019s where this anthology comes in. We will present at least twenty brand new fun and fantastic (funtastical) takes on the bedtime story, each with its own unique, perhaps even modern, twist. Stories will be written by a talented collection of SF & F writers, cartoonists, media people, and actors/writers. It will be loaded with entertaining reads for the entire family (even if they\u2019re not sleepy . . .)\nWhat it is: An anthology of 20 or more 1,000 \u2013 6,000 word fun fantasy bedtime stories. Each story will revolve around sleep or bedtime or a related matter with a fun fantasy twist. The stories will be written by an assortment of SF & F writers, cartoonists, actors, actresses, sports stars, and TV personalities, and will target an audience of parents with children ages 3-8. Each story will have an accompanying illustration. The anthology will be edited by John Zakour and Joshua Palmatier and will include short stories by: Elena Beloff, S.C. Butler (SF&F writer), David B. Coe (SF&F writer), Julie E. Czerneda (SF&F writer), Barry Dutter (DC Comics), Ron Ferdinand (Dennis the Menace), Esther Friesner (SF&F writer), Jim C. Hines (SF&F writer), Tony Isabella, Susan Jett (SF&F writer), Liana K (TV personality), Barbara Randall Kesel, Amy Lago (Washington Post syndicate), Jessica Lahr (Mrs. New York), Laura Magnusson (graphic audio), Jeff Mariotte & Marcy Rockwell (SF&F writers), Lee Nordling, Jody Lynn Nye (SF&F writer), Aprilynne Pike, Scott Roberts, Tony Sokol (Den of the Geek), and Bobby and Peter Timony (cartoonists).\nCover Art: The image that will be used to design the cover art is a commissioned piece called \"Funtastical Bedtime Stories\u201d created by Justin Adams of Varia Studios. The art has already been completed (see below for the image). The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter.\n\"Funtastical Bedtime Stories\" by Justin Adams, Varia Studois\nTimeline: If the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of March 2016. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of May 2016 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of November 2016. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing trade paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 7 cents per word), payment for interior illustrations, and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors and illustrators, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch Goals: \nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far:\nStretch Goal: BOOKMARKS! At $25,000, every backer pledged at $25 or more will receive a free promotional bookmark for FUNTASTICAL BEDTIME STORIES.\nStretch Goal: At $30,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.\nStretch Goal: At $40,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.\nOther stretch goals will be added as the Kickstarter continues.\nAdd-ons:\nAdd-ons are extra items that current backers can add to their current pledge level. These would include t-shirts and hats with the Zombies Need Brains LLC logo, etc. Add-ons can be added by backers at any reward level by simply clicking \u201cManage My Pledge\u201d and adding on the amount of the add-on to their initial pledge.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by December 2016. Also, there is always a chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author or artist to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author or artist cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with another published author or artist. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors, artists, and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors and artists will not deliver, but it does happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Joshua Palmatier\n10 created \u00b7 71 backed\nA professor of mathematics at SUNY College at Oneonta, Joshua Palmatier has published nine fantasy novels\u2014the \u201cThrone of Amenkor\u201d series...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "And It's Official!", "update_content": "FUNTASTICAL BEDTIME STORIES did not fund.  *sigh*  Not unexpected, but still disappointing.\nAgain, heartfelt thanks to everyone who backed our project.

With this achieved, we can guarantee the 10-minute short film next year. We're so excited to see what we can accomplish in the time remaining. $7,776 is the minimum we required to produce 10 minutes, but that's just the beginning. We've still got tons more we want to add to make Invalid Corps Film even more awesome. Take a look at what can be done if we reach our STRETCH GOALS!\nScroll down to learn more! \nWant to see a trailer for the film? Click on the video above!\nMEET UNSUNG HEROES OF THE CIVIL WAR\nHi! My name is Day Al-Mohamed and I\u2019ve spent the last year working on this documentary. I'm sure most of you are pretty familiar with the Civil War. What I want to tell you about is the story of the Invalid Corps.\nThat's me!\nIt\u2019s okay if you haven\u2019t heard about them. That\u2019s the problem, nobody has. The Invalid Corps was a corps of men with disabilities who fought in the Civil War. Men who were injured in battle or who acquired chronic illnesses \u2013 men missing limbs, and eyes, with rheumatism, epilepsy, bullet injuries, those with what we would now call PTSD, and many others. Rather than be discharged, they continued to serve the Union cause.\n10th Veteran Reserve Corps (Invalid Corps) in Washington DC\nIn July 1864, Confederate General Jubal Early launches a surprise raid that takes him to the very gates of Washington DC. The city is in panic. Almost every able-bodied soldier from the Union has already been sent south with General Grant for the siege of Petersburg, more than 100 miles away. The only defenders remaining are clerks, government officials, and the Invalid Corps. With Lincoln himself on the ramparts, they cannot afford to fail.\nWHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME\nUncovering these heroes is a personal passion of mine. As a woman with a disability, and as a volunteer with the US Coast Guard Auxiliary, I feel a kinship with their need to serve and their desire to do what they could. After more than 15 years working on disability policy issues and working with youth with disabilities, I have seen how important it is to see people like yourself - models and mentors. Disability doesn't just exist today, but existed in the past. \nThis is a lost history of men who sacrificed for their country and then chose to remain on duty; of men who chose to continue to serve with a disability. It is a story that should be told, not just from a historical standpoint but to understand and recognize the efforts of men and women in uniform today. \n\u201cThere are lots of people with disabilities who want to serve their country, and can serve\u2026they may not be able to do exactly everything everyone else can do, but they can do within their abilities, and they can provide a lot of support.\u201d \u2013 Senator Tom Harkin (2013)\nHOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED\nWe're raising money for our pre-production. So far, I\u2019ve been able to fund the initial film start almost entirely out of my own pocket, with assistance from an amazing group of producers, editors, and friends who have given their time and talent for little more than my eternal thanks and praises. (By the way, thank you all!) I've gone a long way on this kind of support from people who really believe in the project, but eventually I need to, you know, pay people.\nOur next step is to provide a 10-minute short film. Because there's an opportunity to uncover some amazing history, we need to cover fees for the processing/handling of the old print archives like images and letters to finish our rough cut this winter. We\u2019ll use that rough cut to pitch the film to grants, theatrical distributors, and TV programmers, and to move into production. To that end, we need to raise $7,776 by pre-selling the short film at $25 a piece, and offering really cool rewards and incentives if you want to donate more.\nBudgeting for Expenses\n*Chart does not include 10% Kickstarter and credit card processing fees.\nIf we exceed our Kickstarter goal (how awesome would that be?) the money will go to covering the future production costs: cinematographer, equipment rental, sound edit/mix\u2026and we\u2019d really love to pay for some interns!\nREWARDS\nSome of our rewards are self-evident such as screeners and digital copies of the short film, but I do want to tell you about some of the other amazing items: the Carte de Visite, the Challenge Coin, and the Union Case.\n$50 Backer Level \u2013 Faces of the Invalid Corps (Carte de Visite or CDVs)\nCDVs were a small photographs printed using a glass negative, allowing for multiple copies. These were very popular during the war as they offered an inexpensive way for soldiers and family members to send and receive photographs of loved ones. We don\u2019t want to just tell the story of the Corps and the battle but of the individuals who were a part of it. So we will find images of these men, discover their story and tell you how they contributed to history.\nYou can see the detailed example here:  http://invalidcorpsfilm.nrbrown.com/2015/07/16/what-are-carte-de-visite-or-cdvs-2/\nAR \"Stovepipe\" Johnson, mustachioed older gentleman in suit and dark glasses. Photo courtesy of Archives Division, Texas State Library\n *Final CDVs/Postcards will have information on the back \n$100 Backer Level - The Challenge and the Cause (Challenge Coin) \n There are many examples of traditions that build camaraderie in the military, but few are as well-respected as the practice of carrying a challenge coin\u2014 This is a small coin or medallion, bearing an insignia or emblem and carried by the organization\u2019s members. It is a symbol of pride and of unity. The story of the challenge coin goes back to World War I. You can learn that story here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dayalmohamed/the-civil-war-invalid-corps-and-the-battle-of-fort/posts/1395083\nCoin Proofs - Cannon on Front, Capitol with Crossed Crutch and Enfield Rifle on Back\n  *Final coin design may differ slightly \nThese custom, limited-edition coins are designed specifically for the Invalid Corps documentary project and come from Eric Perez at Challenge Coins Plus. Celebrate the unity and pride; become a part of the brotherhood that is the Invalid Corps and donate at the \u201cChallenge and the Cause\u201d level. \n $200 Backer Level \u2013 The Union Case (Replica Photograph Case) Hand-made by Rick Brown these replica Gutta Percha/Union cases are designed to appear similar to original Civil War cases where soldiers carried images and/or sent them home. Using a photo you send to us, it will be converted to black and white, put on glass and inserted into the case. This makes it appear closer to an original ambrotype photo. It is a great, one-of-a-kind beautiful item. \nWood case with velvet lining and metal framing of black and white photo of John Wilkes Booth\nHopefully, in addition to supporting the project on its own merits, you\u2019ll find something for yourself or a friend or family member with an interest in history. \nSTRETCH GOALS\nAt its heart, this project is about the story, so any additional funding will be put towards direct production to bring you the best film possible. This means being able to afford things like a professional sound editor; some compensation for musicians (we have a composer so this project will have an original score but musicians have to eat too); and being able to send a full crew out for additional interviews with historians and descendants of Invalid Corps members.\nStretch Goal #1 - $8,000: We are close enough to this goal that we hope to entice more folks to back this project and/or folks to consider backing at a higher level. In addition, as a reward, because of the role that letters played during the Civil War - connecting families to loved ones - we will send each of you (at the $25 and up level) an actual piece of PHYSICAL mail. You'll receive a custom postcard of Invalid Corps imagery via the US Postal Service. Sent the same way families mailed letters more than 150 years ago, this is our \"letter\" to you in thanks. \nYou can learn more about the importance of mail during the Civil War here:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dayalmohamed/the-civil-war-invalid-corps-and-the-battle-of-fort/posts/1406298\nPatriotic Cover - Image: Postal Museum\nStretch Goal #2 - $8,500: This allows us an opportunity to offer some compensation for a professional sound editor and mixer. \nStretch Goal #3 - $9,000: This helps us offer some compensation to the musicians who will be recording the score for this short film. In addition, as a reward, we will send you (at the $50 level and up) a replica civil war coin. \n2 Cent Coin back\nThe Two Cent coin was produced in 1864-65. It was the only 2 cent piece ever made and also the first coin to have the motto: \"In God We Trust\" on the front in a banner with a shield and two arrows that cross it. Below it says 1865. The reverse has the number 2 within a thick wreath tied with a ribbon and the words for USA. Handcrafted exact replica made in Bennington, Vermont. \nStretch Goal #4 - $10,000: This helps us cover the cost for a full crew to complete filming for 2 additional interviews with historians and Invalid Corps descendants.\nWHERE WILL THIS SHORT FILM BE SCREENED\nI want to show this short film to as wide an audience as possible. The goal is to be able to present it at festivals, museums, historical societies, disability programs, veteran groups, independent film houses, and community screenings. With the increased visibility I hope to be able to secure enough support to develop the full length documentary for potential broadcast options.\nMEET THE TEAM\nMeet the Invalid Corps Team: Day, Julia, Renee, Jon, Marissa, Steven\nOne of the great things about film is that, just like regiments of Invalid Corps soldiers, to do the best possible job takes a team of committed people. The INVALID CORPS team is made up of researchers, musicians, filmmakers, and writers, many of whom are also people with disabilities and/or have personal connections to disability. We are committed to capturing the depth and complexity of this story.\nDay Al-Mohamed (Director, Executive Producer) - Day is an author of narrative fiction. Her most recent Young Adult novel, \u201cBaba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn\u201d and her co-edited anthology, \u201cTrust & Treachery\u201d were published by Dark Quest Books in September 2014. Day has written several comics and short film scripts. She is an active member of Women in Film and Video, a graduate of the VONA/Voices Writing Workshop, and most recently, and a Documentary Fellow with Docs in Progress. Day has worked as a policy advisory, a lobbyist, and political analyst for more than 15 years on national issues relating to disability. \nThis is a lost piece of history. Not just disability history, or veteran\u2019s history, or Washington DC history, these men\u2019s stories belong to all of us. - Day\nJulia Marie Myers (Editor) - Julia Marie Myers graduated from Yale University in 2012 and currently works as a post-producer and editor at Discovery Communications. Julia actively writes, directs and edits narrative films in her free time. Her directorial and editorial work spans over fifty short films, numerous music videos, a web series, and two feature films. Her current film project, Union, features elements of the Invalid Corps story, and is also inspired by the life of Mary Walker, the first woman surgeon to be officially employed by the US Army.  \nFear, discrimination, bravery, grace: no matter how different we may think we are from these men so long ago, there is a piece of each of us in their story. I want to make this film because it gives those that made a difference, a voice \u2013 one that if we keep telling and add to it our own, can only get louder. - Julia Marie Myers\nN. Renee Brown (Researcher) - N. Renee Brown is a Library Assistant at the University of Maryland and University College. She also serves as Archivist for the Lead On Network, a non-profit focused on disability issues and intersectionality. During weekends from 2011 to 2013, she also volunteered in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History\u2019s Forensic Anthropology Lab for the Written in Bone Exhibit.\nDisability has such a rich history\u2026but we know so little about it! I feel like this project takes one step into history to pull back the curtain on how much people with disabilities can do when given the chance. - N. Renee Brown\nDavid Ackerman (Composer) - David Ackerman is a composer, poet, and roustabout native to the middle-west of the United States. He presently resides in a modest college town in the approximate geographic center of Missouri, where he studied music composition and theory under Dr. Thomas McKenney. His music has been featured by organizations ranging from local orchestras to radio theatre companies. He has also spent much of his career working in theatre in one capacity or another. Whatever art he might attempt, he is generally most happy when crafting some kind of story with that medium; be it music, literature, photography, theatre, or things less long haired and respectable (or easily categorized, for that matter.)  \nI\u2019m excited about this project. Very often we hear stories of triumph in adversity, but this is more than that. It\u2019s a story of people that were left behind; people that were scorned, sometimes ridiculed, and often forgotten. While Grant was advancing with the Army of the Potomac on Lee near Petersburg, it was in large part the Invalid Reserve Corps that manned the defenses around Washington DC. Not surprisingly, given the fluid and bitter nature of the fighting, this was no mere ceremonial posting. Before Day asked me to help with this I knew nothing of the Invalids Corps. It turns out that theirs is a remarkably compelling story and it\u2019s been a pleasure to learn it as we work on this project. I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I. - David Ackerman\nJonathan van Harmelen (Researcher) -  Jon is currently studying American History at Pomona College, and has conducted research with Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History. He also works at Pomona College as manager for the Orchestra and as assistant to the History Department. He enjoys collecting military antiques, playing drums, and attempting to learn French, German, and Dutch all at once.\nThe history of the Invalid Corps represents a crucial aspect of American history. As historians, understanding the narratives presented by the Invalid Corps helps us to understand both the disability and military history of the United States, and contribute a unique perspective to American history that should never go unnoticed. - Jonathan van Harmelen \nMarissa Stalvey (Outreach and Social Media Coordinator) - Marissa is a disability advocate and public relations/communications professional in the DC area. She received her BA in History and her Master\u2019s in Disability Studies. Marissa is especially passionate about disability history and making museums accessible to all. A total history nerd, Marissa loves visiting museums and historic sites with her husband on weekends. She also loves her lemon beagle, Butters, her cats, and eating more bacon than is probably healthy.  \nThe history of people with disabilities is something that often gets skewed in our society. I care about highlighting their abilities, especially when our very own Veterans played such a pivotal role in defending the U.S. Capitol. - Marissa Stalvey\nSteven A. Rodriguez (Strategist, Crowdfunding Coordinator) - Steven is a Digital Marketing Strategist who works with small business and entrepreneurs to unleash their online marketing potential. He focuses on being a community builder who enjoys learning about other businesses, brainstorming, collaborating, and promoting the success of others.\nThe history of people with disabilities is something that often gets skewed in our society. I care about highlighting their abilities, especially when our very own Veterans played such a pivotal role in defending the U.S. Capitol. - Steven A. Rodriguez\nHERE'S HOW YOU CAN HELP\nI am passionate about this subject and will finish this film no matter what, but without your support, it will be a longer, harder road.\nPlease help support independent women's media; support media made by people with disabilities by backing \u201cThe Invalid Corps\" at any level.\nYou can also help by spreading the word.

As you know, Neil Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit will be temporarily displayed in time for the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing in 2019, but in the long-term, it will be a centerpiece of a brand new exhibition, Destination Moon, at the Museum in Washington, DC. Planned to open in 2020, Destination Moon will show those who remember the 1960s, as well as generations born afterward, how an extraordinary combination of motivations, resources, and technologies made it possible for people to walk on the Moon. The new gallery will explore how Armstrong\u2019s \u201cone small step\u2026\u201d in July 1969, in the context of the bitter, global Cold War taking place at the time, became not only a triumph for the United States, but an accomplishment that resonated around the world.\nWe have shared many of the artifacts planned for display in Destination Moon on our project page below. For our next goal, we are headed from $500,000 to $700,000 to tell the story of the first American in space, Alan Shepard. We plan to conserve, digitize, and display the Mercury suit Shepard wore during the first American manned space flight in 1961. Along with Armstrong\u2019s suit, Shepard\u2019s -- and many other suits planned for display in the new gallery \u2013 will show the progression of spacesuit technology during the space race era.\nLet\u2019s keep this incredible momentum going! Next stop: $700,000!\nAlan B. Shepard, one of the original \u201cMercury 7,\u201d wore this suit on the first flight of an American astronaut in 1961.\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin poses for a photograph beside the deployed United States flag during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface. Astronaut Neil Armstrong, commander, took this picture with a 70mm Hasselblad lunar surface camera.\nJuly 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, a feat so breathtaking in its scope and ambition that it captured the collective imaginations of audiences around the world. At the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum, we use the power of real objects to tell stories like this one \u2013 stories of the vision, intellect, and courage of men and women who have overcome challenges and pushed boundaries to take the next giant leap for humankind.\nFor the Smithsonian\u2019s first-ever Kickstarter campaign, we are proud to announce plans to conserve, digitize, and display Neil Armstrong\u2019s Apollo 11 spacesuit in time for this milestone anniversary. We want to preserve Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit \u2013 and the story it tells of its incredible journey \u2013 down to the particles of lunar dust that cling to its surface. Just like the Apollo program, we will accomplish this in collaboration of thousands of people across the country and around the world. And that\u2019s where you come in.\nIsn't the Smithsonian federally funded? Good question! Federal appropriations provide the foundation of the Smithsonian's operating budget and support core functions, such as building operations and maintenance, research, and safeguarding the collections. Projects like Reboot the Suit aren\u2019t covered by our federal appropriations, which means we can only undertake them if we can fund them some other way. In other words, we won\u2019t be able to do this project without the participation of Kickstarter backers.\nKickstarter gives a wide audience the chance to be a part of this project. We're inviting you to go behind the scenes and be a part of the process \u2013 from fundraising through conservation to display. All backers will receive regular updates on the process and can follow along each step of the way.\nNeil Armstrong's spacesuit \u2013 like most of the spacesuits in the Museum\u2019s collection \u2013 is currently being stored in a climate-controlled collections storage area that is not accessible to the public.\nYou may be surprised to learn that spacesuits are among the most fragile artifacts in the Museum\u2019s collection. The Apollo suits were made to take astronauts to the Moon and back safely -- not to last hundreds of years in a museum.\nTo provide public display and access, Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit requires conservation to stop current deterioration and a state-of-the-art display case that will mimic the climate-controlled environment where it is currently being safeguarded.\nMoving the draped spacesuits into climate-controlled collections storage.\nLisa Young works on Neil Armstrong's spacesuit in the Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory.\nWill the suit look dramatically different when the project is complete? Not to the naked eye. Conservation is the process of documenting, stabilizing and protecting an artifact, not modifying it to make it \u201clike new.\u201d\nSo why does it take so long? We\u2019re allowing plenty of time to get this right.The research and documentation we do now will literally write the book on the proper techniques for spacesuit conservation for every suit in our collection. Along the way, we\u2019ll be consulting with those who contributed to making the suit and its materials, those who cared for it during the Apollo program, and materials experts throughout the world. Research, meetings, and mastering new techniques take time.\nAs we complete this research, we\u2019ll be using state-of-the-art techniques in 3D scanning, photogrammetry, chemical analysis, CT scanning, and other means available to create a detailed map of the suit that will document its condition in the most complete way possible. This work will inform a condition assessment that will help us create the appropriate environment for public display while preserving the suit in its current condition.\nDigitization team working with Abraham Lincoln's life mask\n3D scanning the Armstrong spacesuit gives us the chance to put the suit directly into your hands. With a 3D scan of the suit, you can take a self-guided tour and explore the functions of each of the suit\u2019s 21 layers (check out 3D models of other iconic Smithsonian collection objects). You can make a 3D print of Armstrong\u2019s glove and slip it over your hand. Teachers will have a dynamic new tool for talking about the technology required for living and working in space. 3D scanning also ensures that our conservators and curators have an accurate picture of the suit in its current condition, helping to monitor and preserve the suit and protect it from further deterioration.\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s Digitization team is doing work that will revolutionize the way we interact with and learn from the artifacts in our collection. The team has already scanned a number of the Smithsonian\u2019s iconic artifacts, from the Wright Flyer to the Bell X-1, and is currently in the planning stages to scan the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia. Check out this clip from \u201cCBS Saturday Morning\u201d to see how the team digitizes everything from the Spirit of St. Louis to a sitting American president.\nTake a look at our list of rewards to learn how you can get priority access to 3D scans and 3D prints of the suit!\nThe suit will be put on display at the Museum in Washington, DC, in time for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission in 2019. The suit will eventually be permanently displayed as a centerpiece in the future Destination Moon exhibition, a completely redesigned and updated gallery that will bring the exciting story of lunar exploration to a new generation.\nIn addition to the Armstrong spacesuit, Destination Moon will feature several other significant artifacts, including a huge Moon mural painted by the famous space artist Chesley Bonestell in 1957, the Freedom 7 Mercury capsule in which Alan Shepard became the first American in space, the Gemini 7 spacecraft, the giant F-1 rocket engine, the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia, parts of the Apollo Mission Simulator, and many small artifacts. The exhibition will also display the Ranger, Surveyor, and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft currently hanging elsewhere in the Museum, and at least one other robotic spacecraft from a more recent mission.\nEarly rendering of Armstrong suit display in \"Destination Moon\" gallery\nThe Apollo 11 Moon landing was one of the single greatest achievements in the history of humankind. Bringing Armstrong's spacesuit back not only helps honor the accomplishments of a generation who brought us from Earth to the Moon in less than nine years, it also inspires the next generation of bold space explorers.\nThe suit is a part of our cultural heritage, and safeguarding it recognizes its importance in telling the story of a remarkable accomplishment. And because it is the real thing, seeing the suit provides a tangible way of touching history.\nAstronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Apollo 11 Commander inside the Lunar Module as it rests on the lunar surface after completion of the Extravehicular Activities. Image Credit: NASA\nWe're offering some fantastic rewards, most of which are exclusive to this Kickstarter project. Backers can receive rewards such as a \"Reboot the Suit\" cling-on, a mission patch designed by graphic designer Michael Okuda, a \"Reboot the Suit\" poster, membership in the National Air and Space Society, which includes a subscription to Air & Space Magazine, behind-the-scenes experiences at the Museum, and much more. \nYour pledge is tax deductible! The amount of your contribution that is deductible for federal income tax purposes is limited to the difference between your pledge minus the fair market value of the reward. If our project is completed and the goal is met, you will be asked to fill out a survey so that we can send you your rewards. The Smithsonian Institution is unable to recognize your gift unless the informational survey is completed.\nPlease allow an additional 2-6 weeks for your reward to ship internationally. Note: we are not responsible for international custom fees.\nSome of the rewards are experiences (tours, events, lectures) offered at a specific time and place. The Smithsonian and ILC Dover are not responsible for any backer\u2019s travel or costs to participate in such experiences. Further, if a cause beyond the Smithsonian and ILC Dover's control requires rescheduling or cancellation of an experience, the Smithsonian and ILC Dover are not responsible for any additional travel or costs a backer may incur in order to participate at the new time. The Smithsonian and ILC Dover cannot guarantee that experiences occurring on dates yet to be announced, or that must be rescheduled, will occur on a date that is convenient for all backers.\nCosts for research, materials, and tools for conservation work\nConstruction of a custom-built mannequin to support the suit\nState-of-the-art display case\n3D scanning and production of online 3D model\nA webcast educational program, STEM in 30\nPublication on the suit, history and conservation of spacesuit materials\nBoeing Milestones of Flight Hall at the Museum in Washington, DC and Space Shuttle Discovery at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.\nThe Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum maintains the world's largest and most significant collection of aviation and space artifacts, encompassing all aspects of human flight, as well as related works of art and archival materials. It operates two landmark facilities that, together, welcome more than eight million visitors a year, making it the most visited museum in the country. It also is home to the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies.\nThe Museum's two buildings house thousands of artifacts showcased in exhibitions on aviation, space exploration, and planetary science. At both of its locations, the Museum presents programs, educational activities, lectures, and performances that reflect the American spirit, and the innovation, courage, and optimism that have led to triumphs in the history, science, and technology of flight. At the Museum in the nation's capital, which opened in 1976 and is located in the heart of the Smithsonian complex in Washington, DC, some of the most awe-inspiring icons of flight are on display. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, located near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia, is a massive structure with open, hangar-like settings that accommodate large aircraft and spacecraft, as well as entire collections of aviation and space artifacts.\nSome of the Smithsonian project team with Armstrong's suit.\nFINE PRINT:\nThe Smithsonian is using Kickstarter, a third-party online funding platform.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo matter the outcome of this project, Neil Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit will be cared for and safeguarded for as long as the Smithsonian Institution exists (and we\u2019ve been around for 169 years so far). But we want to do more than keep the spacesuit safe \u2014 we want to display it for all to see. The only risk we have is not meeting our deadline to have it conserved, digitized, and on display in time for the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing. There is very little that stands in our way of meeting this goal once we have the funds in hand. We have an actionable plan, a realistic timeline, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the in-house expertise to get the job done well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Andrea Suhaka", "content": "There was scam data & a boot decal????

Coe, David Farland/Dave Wolverton, C.S. Friedman, Walter H. Hunt, Faith Hunter, Katharine Kerr, Gini Koch, Sharon Lee, Gail Z. Martin, Larry N. Martin, Seanan McGuire, Juliet E. McKenna, Steve Miller, and Jean Marie Ward, plus others. The books will be edited by Joshua Palmatier & Patricia Bray, both editors of the DAW Books anthologies \u201cAfter Hours: Tales from the Ur-bar\u201d and \u201cThe Modern Fae\u2019s Guide to Surviving Humanity,\" and the Zombies Need Brains LLC anthologies \"Clockwork Universe: Steampunk vs. Aliens\" and \u201cTemporally Out of Order.\u201d\nUnlike the previous two Kickstarters run by Zombies Need Brains, we are NOT using the Kickstarter to help set up and solidify the small press. Backers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these two anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been lowered to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will still be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run. So get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition! Help the new small press Zombies Need Brains LLC expand!\nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors (check out our two current offerings\u2014\u201cClockwork Universe: Steampunk vs. Aliens\u201d and \u201cTemporally Out of Order\u201d--if you have any doubts), offering professional pay rates and featuring stellar cover art. As we did in our previous anthologies, we plan to include the very best stories we can find, spanning the gamut from bestselling authors to new, previously unpublished voices, including an open submission window if the Kickstarter is successful, where anyone can submit their stories featuring the current themes for a chance to be part of the anthologies. And with your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you! Consider backing our Kickstarter and then help spread the word. Just as Zombies Need Brains, we need your support to make this new small press a success. The backers of the \"Clockwork Universe\" and \u201cTemporally Out of Order\u201d anthologies helped set up the press. You can help solidify that foundation!\nSo what are the two current projects? Here are the details:\nAlien Artifacts:\nLife is out there. Alien civilizations have grown and died and been reborn again since the dawn of the universe. Some of those civilizations have left behind signs of their existence, hidden in the ruins on unexplored planets or floating in space in the form of ghost ships. In this anthology, 14 of today\u2019s best short story writers will tackle what could happen if, in our exploration of space, we run across some of these ancient alien artifacts. Will they catapult humanity to new technological heights . . . or reveal our darkest secrets and destroy us? Edited by Patricia Bray and Joshua Palmatier, this anthology will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of 6000 words each. The anthology will include short stories by: Jacey Bedford, David Farland/DaveWolverton, C.S. Friedman, Walter H. Hunt, Gini Koch, Sharon Lee & Steve Miller, Gail Z. Martin & Larry N. Martin, Seanan McGuire, and Juliet E. McKenna. All other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nWere-:\nWe\u2019ve all read hundreds of stories about werewolves . . . but what about the less famous of the were-clans\u2014the werelions, wereducks, and wereferns? These underrepresented families need to come out of the dark, full moon or not! From light and humorous to dark and serious, this anthology will explore other varieties of were-creatures and tell their stories. No werewolves allowed! Edited by Joshua Palmatier and Patricia Bray, it will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of 6000 words each. The anthology will include short stories by: Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Phyllis Ames, Patricia Bray, David B. Coe, Faith Hunter, Katharine Kerr, Gini Koch, Seanan McGuire, and Jean Marie Ward. All other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nCover Art:\nThe images that will be used to design the cover art are commissioned pieces called \"Alien Artifacts\" and \u201cWere-\u201d created by Justin Adams of Varia Studios. The cover art for \u201cAlien Artifacts\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for \u201cWere-\u201d will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter.\nFinal Cover Art for \"Alien Artifacts\" by Justin Adams, Varia Studios\nTimeline: If the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2015. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of January 2016 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2016.\nFunding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 6 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch Goals:\nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far:\nStretch Goal (UNLOCKED!): BOOKMARKS!

The mean streets of Detroit get a whole lot meaner after supernatural destruction tears the city to shreds! Now the survivors have to eke out a living as a war for power draws super powered beings from around the world! \n\"Doomtown\" has ties to future Lightweight stories!\nJust over a year ago with the help of Kickstarter, I made the first year of the superhero prose fiction project Lightweight a reality. But the novels Lightweight: Senior Year and Lightweight: Black Death were just the beginning of the adventures of Kevin Mathis, the young man inside the Lightweight costume. \nNow Lightweight has found himself lost on the alien world of Nill, unsure how he arrived and unsure how to get back home to Earth. He is stuck in the middle of a three way war for supremacy of the planet, even as outside forces seek to take his power for their own. Prepare for the rise of a new major threat to Kevin and the entire universe as the Grand Magister makes his presence known.\nWhile Lightweight is busy in space, that doesn't mean we lose his friends. Millie and Andy are back as they struggle to keep the legend of Lightweight alive even as they try to solve the mystery of Kevin's disappearance. But their own lives come in the way of their quest as Millie deals with the ramifications of lost love and Andy must figure out his place in the world free of the sect that raised him. But despite their fragile peace with one another, Millie and Andy will have to work together if they want to unravel the mystery of the Golden Age Lightweight! \nLightweight: Black Death continues the amazing adventures of the gravity-defying hero of super powered prose while also serving to be new reader friendly. Readers can start right here or order the full series of books without worrying about missing half the story. \nTwo Kickstarters have taught me how to tightly budget my projects on the site. $600 is the minimum I need to ship rewards and pay my contributors, cover artist Brent Sprecher and editor Lisa Matthews Collins. That will fund only the first volume of the next year of releases. Stretch goals will unlock the next two volumes that will complete the second year of stories. \nFree preview chapter offer!\nWe don't expect anyone that hasn't read Lightweight before to buy in without any preview of the book. Because of this we are glad to present Lightweight: Dreams free on Smashwords for the length of this campaign. \nJust click here to grab a copy and start reading!\nAdd-ons: \nThe following add-ons are available to anyone who purchases any print release above. \n$8 = Get a copy of Lightweight: Senior Year or Lightweight: Black Death added to your order. You can add multiple copies if you prefer. \n$10 = Get an extra copy of Lightweight: Beyond or any stretch goal releases. Multiple copies can be added this way. \n$25 = Get an extra t-shirt featuring the Lightweight logo! Due to international shipping restrictions this reward can only be added for United States customers. \nTo get an add-on just include the extra amount of the items listed above to your reward level. When surveys are issued after funding ends, we will request any information about additional add-ons. \nBonuses and stretch goals:\nAbout the author:\nNicholas Ahlhelm has been creating super powered fiction professionally for five years now, but has lived with the adventures of his heroes for many, many more. His writing can be found in anthologies from Metahuman Press, Airship 27 Books, Pro Se Press and Flinch Books. His original novels A Dangerous Place to Live, Epsilon and Living Legends: Old Soldiers all share a world with Lightweight's adventures. \nAbout our artist:\nBrent Sprecher is a writer and artist located in Southern California. Besides being the character designer and cover artist for Metahuman's Lightweight series of novels, Brent has provided artwork for over a dozen comic books from publishers such as Caliber Comics, Penny Farthing Press, Bluewater Comics and Neko Press.

Cover artist Brent Sprecher should deliver the next cover around the end of this Kickstarter.

After all, vampire and werewolf and monster tales can be plenty creepy, too. Perhaps it's because we always know, deep in the back of our subconscious, that vampires and werewolves and monsters aren't real. They're fiction. But, the same isn't true for ghost stories. Almost every culture believes in ghosts and has myths and tales about them. Almost everyone has had, or personally knows someone who has had, a ghostly or supernatural experience. We believe in ghosts, so we believe in ghost stories. And that makes it so much harder to go to sleep after we've read what those familiar spirits may be up to in the midst of deepest night in the woods, down the street, and in our own homes.\nMagician and story-teller William Pack conceived of Familiar Spirits as an outgrowth and supplement to his spell-binding performances of magic and ghostly tales. Connecting with Writer on Demand Donald J. Bingle, they have invited a specially selected group of extremely talented writers to craft short tales and vivid manifestations to unsettle, spook, terrify, and haunt you in your dreams and in brightest day.\nJoin with these authors to bring Familiar Spirits to life ... or, perhaps, unholy afterlife from beyond the grave. Death is only the beginning for a familiar spirit, but it may be the end for those it seeks out on the mortal plane.\nFamiliar Spirits may contain tales of the unknown, but its publisher, editor, and authors are all known for quality story-telling. The only thing that should disturb you, as a potential backer, are the chilling tales of horror contained in the pages of this anthology, not the uncertainties and frustrations associated with anthologies from unknown entities and amateur writers.\nFamiliar Spirits will be available in ebook and print form, with an audio version available if certain funding requirements are met. The stories are already written, the editing and formatting already in progress. All you need to do is pledge and steel yourself for the disquieting terror of the stories, themselves.\nBacker levels encourage early participation, but provide all backers with great value. Grab a package of other products from the publisher, editor, and featured writers, or add-on specific collections and books to make this Kickstarter an even better bargain. The post-Kickstarter suggested retail price of the print version of Familiar Spirits will be $19.95.\nDigital rewards and ebooks can be sent to any valid email address which accepts attachments.

Through the ages, we\u2019ve given various forms to our fears. Vampires. Werewolves. Zombies. MONSTERS!\nBut are we really afraid of the monsters, or of ourselves\u2026?\nSilence in the Library Publishing is excited to bring you our latest anthology, MONSTERS!, a collection of short fiction about things that creep, crawl, bite, go bump in the night, and make us wonder \u201cHey, who turned out the lights?\u201d\nInside the pages of MONSTERS!, you'll find stories from authors including Aaron Allston, Michael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Addie J. King, Aaron Rosenberg, Janine K. Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many more.\nWhile you\u2019ll find plenty of traditional horror stories in this anthology, you\u2019ll also find that many of our authors decided to approach the genre in a different manner. \nA Greek hero faces the brute strength of a cyclops with only his wit - but is he really a hero, and is the cyclops really a brute?\nA demon who can only curse people if doing so will make them happy. If his nature is to curse, how can he solve his dilemma?\nYou'll find stories like these and more in the pages of MONSTERS! We've used this anthology to ask some intriguing questions.\nWhat would the traditional horror story look like told from the monster\u2019s point of view? What is the relationship between monster and victim? Is the monster really the monster, and is the victim really the victim? \nAs part of this Kickstarter, you'll also be able to purchase the companion anthology, Soothe The Savage Beast, featuring stories by Beth Revis, Carrie Ryan, Michael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Janine K. Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many of the other authors in MONSTERS!\nOf course, the stories in this anthology are amazing, but no Silence in the Library anthology would be complete without illustrations. Artist David Montgomery lends his immense talent to MONSTERS! to produce disturbingly beautiful illustrations for every story in the anthology. \nillustration for \"The New York One\"\nillustration for \"Til Death Do Us Part\"\nIn addition to illustrating each story in MONSTERS!, we've developed a beautiful original art cover for the anthology. Also created by David Montgomery, this cover captures the monstrous spirit of the book.\n\nThose of you who have backed past Silence in the Library projects will know that we like to produce unique items that relate to the project as add-ons. In keeping with the theme of this anthology, we\u2019ve offering MONSTERS! flashlight keychains, so that you can shine a light under the bed when you get that uneasy feeling. We can\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t get eaten, but at least you\u2019ll see what\u2019s eating you.\nFor those of you who just have to have the extra protection, we\u2019ll also be offering necklaces of garlic cloves handmade by author Janine K. Spendlove. They\u2019re 83% guaranteed to ward off vampires, and come in wooden presentation boxes.\nWe're also offering a necklace of garlic cloves that's 96% guaranteed to ward off vampires. It's exactly like the one that's 83% effective, but costs more. Why would you spend the extra money? We don't know. Why are you buying a necklace to ward off vampires in the first place?\nFinally, we\u2019ll be offering MONSTERS! zombie targets for those of you who want to practice your zombie killing skills. Cause, you know, the apocalypse is coming eventually\u2026\nSo, at this point, you probably are interested, but want the complete list of authors. Right? RIGHT? Well, we're going to give it to you whether you want it or not. So there!\nAaron Allston - As many of you know, sadly, Aaron passed away last year.

We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work.\nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce the anthology\u2026to print the book, pay the authors and artists, and to fulfill your rewards. There is no profit built into this for the publisher. As part of our model, the authors share with the publisher in any profit from the sale of books. That includes sales through Kickstarter. We're not out to get wealthy on the back of this book, but just to make enough money that it is financially viable for us to continue to put out great projects like this. It is more important to us that this book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nWe also want to ensure that readers have a voice in the publishing process. Ultimately, readers make all of this possible, and we feel that you should have a say in what gets published and what doesn't. Kickstarter provides the platform that makes this possible.\nSo, take a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the MONSTERS! experience.\nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAs with all of our projects, we've lined up some really great stretch goals that are free to backers. So, after you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live. Please join the team.\nThe way the add-ons will work is that you choose the level at which you wish to contribute, add the price of what you want from the list below, and contribute that amount (or, if you've already contributed, just add the amount from the list below to your current contribution). When the Kickstarter is complete, we will look at each of your selected contribution levels and the amount you have contributed, and if you have contributed more than the selected level we will contact you to find out which of the add-ons you would like.\n$5 - The eBook of Soothe the Savage Beast\n$10 \u2013 The MONSTERS! keychain flashlight\n$15 - A signed 8x10 print of an illustration of your choice from the MONSTERS! anthology (if you're an international backer, please add $3 for shipping)\n$15 - Upgrade your trade paperback copy of MONSTERS! to a hardcover copy.\n$15 - A trade paperback copy of Soothe the Savage Beast (If you've backed at an electronic reward-only level, please add $5 for shipping. If you're an international backer and have backed at a print reward level, please add $5 for shipping. If you're an international backer and have backed at an electronic reward only level, please add $25 for shipping)\n$20 \u2013 An extra trade paperback copy of MONSTERS! (same rules for shipping as above)\n$20 - A signed 11x14 print of an illustration of your choice from the MONSTERS! anthology. (if you're an international backer, please add $3 for shipping)\n$20 \u2013 A 10-pack of MONSTERS! zombie targets. Be prepared for the apocalypse.\n$83 \u2013 The garlic necklace 83% guaranteed to ward off vampires. Yep, that's a dollar for every percent of effectiveness. Is it expensive? Sure. But let's be honest, Janine really doesn't want to have to make these and we really don't want to have to ship them, so you're paying for making us do it. The necklace will come in a wooden box...you know, just in case you need to break the box apart and use it as stakes.\n$96 - The garlic necklace 96% guaranteed to ward off vampires.

We've actually managed to minimize them with this project by having the book ready to go before launching the Kickstarter. It is written and edited, and the cover is complete. Artist David Montgomery is still working on the story illustrations, and adding stories will add some complexity, but not a great deal.\n\nThe biggest challenge for a publisher, other than getting the content in and formatted, is generally timely printing. We have solid relationships with our printers, and are generally able to get proofs back and books printed within 30 days of sending them the book, but there is always a chance that the printer will take longer than expected.

We're so excited at the prospect of creating each version. The ebook, the trade paperback, the premium hardcover, the limited edition hardcover, and the 1894 Sangorski & Sutcliffe Peacock tribute edition. Each one will be crafted with the utmost care and attention.\nIf you discovered this Kickstarter after the official funding period has ended, fear not! You can still order the ebook, the trade paperback, the sketchbook, and the premium hardcover at the links below. \nAnd sign up for the Silence in the Library email newsletter, so you don't miss any of our future projects!\nThis iconic line begins Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice, one of the great romances of all time. Our goal is to bring this wonderful work of literature to life in an edition beautifully illustrated by award-winning artist Janet Lee, with a cover by award-winning artist Jean Masetti.\nWe\u2019re incredibly excited to have Janet on board for this project, and she\u2019s been turning out some amazing illustrations for this book. A recipient of the Eisner Award for her work on the graphic novel Return of the Dapper Men, Janet\u2019s subsequent work includes the Marvel Classics comic book series Emma and Northanger Abbey.\nWe\u2019ve married Janet\u2019s immense talents with the immortal words of Jane Austen, and we think you\u2019re going to fall in love with the result.\nFor our initial goal, Janet is producing twelve full-color, full page illustrations of critical scenes from Pride and Prejudice.\nShe\u2019s also producing twenty partial-page black and white illustrations that will flow with the text of the book.\nFinally, Janet is individually illustrating the beginning letter of the text of each chapter, like this:\nWe\u2019ve also enlisted award-winning artist Jean Masetti to produce a beautiful original art front and back cover for the book. We think you'll agree with us that Jean has managed to capture the spirit of the book wonderfully.\nBut there\u2019s more! As we reach stretch goals, we\u2019ll be adding full-color, full-page illustrations and black and white partial page illustrations to the book, until we\u2019ve reached a total of twenty-four full-page illustrations and thirty partial page illustrations.\nEveryone working on this project has a passion for Pride and Prejudice, and we want to produce a beautiful book that\u2019s going to be accessible to as wide an audience as possible. Toward that end, we\u2019re producing several editions of the book.\nThe eBook will feature custom cover art by artist Jean Masetti. It will also contain all of the illustrations created by for the project by Janet Lee.\nThe trade paperback will also feature the custom cover art by Jean Masetti and contain all of the illustrations created for the project by Janet Lee. All illustrations in the trade paperback will be in grayscale.\nEach premium hardcover edition of Pride and Prejudice Illustrated by Janet Lee will be printed by an off-set printer and bound in a high-quality cloth. They will feature the custom cover art by Jean Masetti. The full-page illustrations will be found on illustration plates throughout the book, with a full-color illustration on each side of the page. These illustration plates will be separated from the text-printed pages by tissue paper to maintain the beauty of the artwork. This edition of the book will also have a ribbon bookmark.\nThe pages of this book will be Smyth Sewn. Smyth Sewn book bindings are the highest quality book binding available on the market today. The pages are physically sewn into the book using binders thread and further reinforced with fabric backing and adhesive to create the most usable and durable books available.\nEach Limited Edition hardcover of Pride and Prejudice Illustrated by Janet Lee will be printed by an off-set printer. The book will be hand bound in Morocco leather, with hand marbled paper sides with gold-tooled edges. The top edge of the pages will be treated to protect from dust and make the presentation really stand out. The spine will have headcaps and raised bands to create a truly classic look. The full-page illustrations will be found on illustration plates throughout the book, with a full-color illustration on each side of the page. These illustration plates will be separated from the text-printed pages by tissue paper to maintain the beauty of the artwork. This edition of the book will also have a ribbon bookmark. The pages of this book will be Smyth Sewn.\nThe 1894 Sangorski & Sutcliffe Peacock edition of Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beautiful books ever made. Obviously, the price and extreme rarity of that binding make it impossible for most people to ever even touch one. We\u2019ve searched extensively and found a binder to recreate that iconic book.  The cost of production is high, but the result is a true masterpiece whose price is many multiples lower than the original.\nThis will be a truly fine binding, with handsewn headbands, gilt inner dentelles, leather joints inside, formed headcaps, corner mitered and filled, and more. Each book will come in a cloth-covered clamshell presentation box. The full-page illustrations will be found on illustration plates throughout the book, with a full-color illustration on each side of the page. These illustration plates will be separated from the text-printed pages by tissue paper to maintain the beauty of the artwork. This edition of the book will also have a ribbon bookmark. The pages of this book will be Smyth Sewn.\nWe\u2019re all very excited to be a part of this. With your help, we can create a book that everyone will be proud to have in their library. So, please take a look at the add-ons and stretch goals below, then look at the reward levels to the right and decide how you\u2019d like to become a part of bringing Pride and Prejudice to life.\nTo select an Add-On, you would just increase your current pledge by the amount of the item(s) you wish to add on. There's no need to message us about the add-on right now UNLESS you're adding on one of the limited editions of the hardcover (The Rosings or The Pemberley). After the Kickstarter is over, we'll send out a survey and ask you if you contributed for anything additional. At that point, you'll let us know what item(s) you added on.\nIf would like one of the other limited rewards, like original art or the ornament, you can add a Rosings or Pemberley to your pledge, but you'll need to send us a message to let us know you're doing that so we can reduce the number of those available.\nIn addition to the books, there are other goodies you can get by looking at the rewards to the right:\nLizzy Bennett Christmas ornaments from Janet Lee.\nThis exclusive ornament is created using an original design which is decoupaged by hand to its painted base using the same technique Janet Lee employed to create her award-winning book, Return of the Dapper Men. These ornaments will only be available as part of this Kickstarter campaign.\nA handcrafted fan by Gloria Sheu (In The Long Run on Etsy) featuring artwork from the book.\nAn original black and white \"drop cap\" chapter letter illustration from the book signed by Janet Lee\nAn original black and white illustration from the book signed by Janet Lee\nAn original color illustration from the book signed by Janet Lee\nYou and a guest will have a breakfast, lunch, or dinner meeting with Janet Lee at one of the following conventions: Comicpalooza (Houston, May), Derby City (Louisville, June), ALA (San Francisco, June), SDCC (San Diego, July), NYCC (NYC, October).  **Please note: travel & accommodations are NOT included.\nTrade paperback copies of Marvel\u2019s Emma and Northanger Abbey signed by Janet Lee\nWe're going all out to produce a truly collectible book, and we want to ensure that it makes its way to you in excellent condition.

Scott has been writing stories since he was a kid. We launched Sea Urchins at The [Myrtle Beach] Sun News in 2001. Scott planted the idea for a comic strip by sending me a copy of Hogan\u2019s Alley Magazine and disappearing for a few months. By the time he'd resurfaced, I'd talked to my editors (thanks Denny, Trisha, and Mike) about about the possibility of a comic strip and a vague notion of its premise. I promised the strip if the writer, Scott, could commit to it. When Scott returned, we set sail.\nAbout Sea Urchins\nThe Sea Urchins story as told by Rudy the Red, from Book One\nHalf obscure early 1900s comic strips, half Popeye, half Little Rascals, and half Scott and Jason, Sea Urchins is a comic done in the classic adventure comics style.\n\"Olie Unrun always wanted to live a life at sea. Instead, he worked at his dad's fish-oil factory and began the life of a family man. One day, something in Olie snapped and he built a ship in his yard... then he relocated his house to the deck of that ship and christened the whole shebang \"The Banana Moon.\" All Olie had to do was wait for the right storm to lift his house to the sea.\"\nNow adrift, the Unruns piece together each day through a host of uncommon creatures and comic calamities.\nSea Urchins Book One is the first in a series of books collecting the comic-strip adventures of Olie and Ali Unrun, their children: Cuss, Sherfew, Ella, and Darla. \n\nA Sea Ape watercolor\nSea Urchins also appeared in Penn State's Blue newspaper, and was one of Hogan's Alley's top 25 undiscovered gems. Plan 9 Publishing printed the first Sea Urchins comic strip collection in 2003. Though the print edition sold out long ago, Book One is now available for Kindle.\nSea Urchins Book One\nAbout the Campaign\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to provide us with the means to bring you Book Two, In The Shadow of the Sea Apes. Book Two digs deeper into the Unrun family mythos by introducing the Nauticles, the Eel-Riders, and an adventure focusing on the Sea Apes.\nStretch goals\nEvery $500 increment will unlock a surprise digital goal.\nEvery $1000 increment will unlock official swag for everyone donating $50 or more.\n$3,850 prints the book, allows for a small advertising budget\n$5,000 stretch goal = book plus full color ebook\n$10,000 stretch = full color print book two\n$15,000 stretch = full color print book two and black and white book three\n$20,000 stretch = full color print book two, black and white books one and three\n$30,000 stretch = full color print books one, two, and three\nThe Sea Urchins launch from The Sun News, and Book One in print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe didn't need a Kickstarter for Book One, because the Sea Urchins book series was being published by Plan 9 Publishing.

By building it and creating community around it, I can\u2019t wait to see the next level of cosplay emerge.\u201d -Samantha Cook, for GeekMom\nStudio Cosplay is changing the world of cosplay and makerspaces by creating the first ever community-operated workspace designed specifically for cosplayers!  The \"Cosmakerspace\" will be a place where costumers have access to the right tools and equipment and can exchange ideas while collaborating on projects.   We will host on-site instructional classes and hands-on workshops for members to expand their skills. We welcome cosplayers, costume designers, LARPers, photographers, artists, and anyone interested in learning about costuming.  \n\nA community space like this is needed because creating a costume in a confined space is frustrating. It can smother your creativity and cause you to make mistakes or force you to cope with taking out an elaborate element of your costume or prop because you just don't have the resources to bring your imagination to life. In DC, like most metropolitan areas, space is at a premium. Most people don\u2019t have the luxury of garages or workshops in their homes.\nA Makerspace is a community-operated workspace where people with interests in computers, machining, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialize and collaborate.  \nUnlike other Makerspaces, we cater to costumers.  Our Cosmakerspace will have multiple stations specifically for designing and constructing costumes, fabricating armor, and creating props. These stations will include sewing, painting, fabricating, wig styling, and 3D printing. Studio Cosplay will offer all levels of classes for students to improve their costuming skills. We will have a green screen for taking pictures of finished costumes or for meeting up with photographers for photoshoots. Studio Cosplay is creating an environment to make cosplayers' lives easier.\n                                                                                                                                        EXTRA REWARD!! \nWe are overwhelmed with gratitude for the support we\u2019ve received for this project so far! As an extra thank you, we\u2019re sending all of our wonderful backers a sticker of our mascot, Notion, when we fund!      \nWe have established ourselves as a 501(c)(3) Non-profit organization, Studio Cosplay Inc, to administer the workshop. Our $24,000 Kickstarter goal directly funds start-up costs and operating expenses for one year. Most of this will go to rent, utilities, and deposits for a 1000+ square foot studio in the Washington, DC Metro area. The remaining funds will go towards purchasing equipment and paying Kickstarter fees. To meet the needs of interested cosplayers and to fund subsequent years of operation the organization will offer multiple cosmakerspace membership tiers. For pricing and membership information please visit our website.\nWe've toured spaces of various size and location from Falls Church, VA to Rockville, MD.  Where we end up will be determined by this Kickstarter. Our ideal location will be Metro accessible, inside the DC I-495 Beltway, and large enough to house all our stations and classes comfortably.\npotential search locations\nWith funding you could work on your cosplay projects in a space like this!\nWith this Kickstarter, we have budgeted for basic supplies: safety equipment, sewing machines, a dress form, a serger, a ventilated paint area, wig stands, basic fabricating tools (including heat guns and a Dremel set), one 3D printer and a basic photography set up (including a green screen). We would like to do so much more and hope that with stretch goals and donations we will be able to get many of the additional items we need.\nWe hope our cosmakerspace will serve as a sustainable model that can expand to more areas.

We\u2019ve signed a lease for a 1460 sq. ft. warehouse space in Silver Spring, MD, just a mile from the Forest Glen Metro station. There is ample parking, a roll-up door, a bathroom, high ceilings for photography, office space, handicap accessibility, and the capacity for heat and AC. The walk from the Metro is through nice neighborhoods with an overpass to cross over I-495. We\u2019ll be super busy over the next several weeks preparing the space for a summer opening \u2014 cleaning, painting, building out the space to our needs, procuring equipment, installing systems, etc. \u2014 so look for updates and opportunities to help out very soon!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Studio Cosplay Update", "update_content": "The last several weeks have been an intense hunt for the future home of our workshop and we are grateful for all the leads people were kind enough to send us -- thank you!  The last week has been very exciting and were preparing an official announcement that we had finally found a fantastic spot with plenty of space, good ventilation, heat & AC, abundant parking, a pleasant walk to the Metro station, with very affordable rent!  Unfortunately, we received word this week that at the last minute the landlord gave the space to an existing tenant who happened to raise their hand for more space during our lease-signing process, so we lost the opportunity.  It's been an extremely disappointing setback for us, but only a setback.  We may not be able to sign paperwork and start building out the workshop as early as we originally planned but we are still doing everything we humanly can to open this cosplay makerspace before the end of the summer.  Despite the disheartening blow our team dived right back into the location search and came up with an even longer list of candidates than we had found in the last few months.  The market looks to be picking up and we continue to focus our daily efforts on securing the best spot possible for the community.  This is happening!  :)\n\nWe can still use your help.  First, don't stop believin'!  Crowdfunding is hard and you all not only made this campaign successful but you blew our funding goal out of the water!  That in itself has opened possibilities for Studio Cosplay's future location that we wouldn't have otherwise had access to.  Finding the right commercial space is hard too, but we have no doubt it will present itself soon.  Feel free to keep sending us leads -- even if we can't respond to each and every note we absolutely appreciate any information we receive and we look into each tip -- whether it be warehouse space you work near, heard about, or a \"For Lease\" sign you saw while driving by something.  The only places we would really have difficulty occupying would be medical offices that can't allow materials like the ones cosplayers might use, business offices in office complexes that probably wouldn't want us modifying the space for ventilation, or tiny retail places with low ceilings.  But we're certainly willing to be creative with a variety of spaces!  Another area where we can still use help is getting the workshop prepped once we sign a lease.  Many have offered to pitch in and we will definitely need to hit the ground running to make our August grand opening, so please keep an eye out for Volunteer Opportunities and Calls for Action.\n\nThank you all for your patience and for believing in us.  We are very eager to open our doors so local cosplayers can finally have the space they need to make epic costume and prop projects!  Together we are doing this!\n\nEasy way to stay in touch!

Desperate to find a way to stop the Pendragon, Emilia is forced to seek answers from someone who hasn't been seen in seventeen years . . . Her mother. Embarking on a magical journey filled with witches, wizards, centaurs and a dangerous and powerful Siren, Jacob and Emilia must take a leap of faith to a land neither could have ever imagined . . . and hope they can then find their way home.\n     East Country upheld the laws. Mid destroyed them.\n     In the year 2185 Earth is rebuilding after climate change created a global eco-crisis. Countries maintain complete isolation so there is no warfare over scarce resources. One Elected family is chosen to lead each country for 100 years to ensure stability. Women aren\u2019t allowed to take office and must reproduce at all costs. Technology use of any kind is banned to preserve what\u2019s left of the environment.\n     And yet, I\u2019m my country\u2019s Elected. I\u2019ve just sanctioned technology use to ready us for war.

I\u2019m a girl.\n     Shhhh . . .\nThe ELECTED series is a Mulan-inspired story that delves into some of society's most complex issues of gender equality, technological overuse, genetics, and even climate change.\n     Something sinister has slithered into Spirit.\n     Seventeen-year-old Bristol Blackburn is still adjusting to life in her new home. In the last six months, she lost both her parents, revealed her psychic abilities to a small, select group, and found the boy of her dreams. Literally.\n     Payne McKnight has no problem telling Bristol he loves her, but something is stopping her from saying it back. Maybe it\u2019s the generations-old feud between their families heating up again. Or maybe it\u2019s the vision she has of Payne\u2019s grandfather killing the new girl in town.\nWorse than that, it could be the ominous black snake Bristol keeps seeing in her dreams. Since it arrived, many have died and the Shadow Creatures have returned to kill her.\n     You\u2019d think the bright spot for Bristol would be the vision where she\u2019s finally able to say those three little words: I love you.\n     If only she was saying them to Payne . . .\n     The elf queen motioned from the two Seasons back to the elf by her side. \u201cThis is Ealis.

Her silver eyes, while maintaining the typical elvish aloofness Morrigann had come to expect over the years, narrowed as she glared, actually glared at him.\n     \u201cMother, I must object.

If you are easily offended, you will find we will keep you busy without even trying.\nI have gathered an amazing group of people from diverse ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds to laugh and talk about fun topics or serious issues. We laugh a lot and include our live listeners in the conversation via a Facebook event page, Twitter, or even email.\nWe have covered topics ranging from silly and comedic (such as conspiracies, cryptozoology, Fairy NaughTEA Parties, \"Stress relief\", etc) to serious and hard hitting, (such as Feminism, Gay Lesbian and Transgendered people in our community, racism, as well as the psychology and sociology of human nature), all with a drink in our hands.\nTalk of the Tavern is a community oriented show. We have supported countless authors, artists, artisans, musicians\u2026 the list goes on. Now, we need your help. Listener support is invaluable, and it doesn't matter how much you can give, just that we all work together to continue to get the show we all deserve.

Now, I need a permanent solution. My new home only has satellite internet, which comes with up to a twenty second delay when on Skype, and that is without video or running constant streams to my radio station servers.\nI am going to train my co-hosts, Ed Summers and Daphne Dewell, to run the technical and software side of things. And to get a decent signal so I can join in the show without the delay, I am going to get a signal booster installed in my home.\nThe money are seeking is enough to get the hardware and software my co-hosts need to efficiently run the technical side of the show, replace worn equipment of my own, get a zBoost TRIO Xtreme REACH for my home studio, cover the fees associated with a Kickstarter campaign, the rewards offered, shipping, and other business costs such as the website, business cards (and other minor office supplies), and other annual fees.\n$10 - Just Slip Us the Tip: ...and we will toast to your good health on an upcoming episode of Talk of the Tavern.

I have ran this show for well over two years now, and all technical glitches are gone and done. I am now initiating my two co-hosts into the wonders of running the technical side. They are both very experienced and skilled at computers, recording, etc. I don't foresee any issues, but we usually don't, do we? \n\nWhen dealing with technology there are always risks of delays. To counter such possibilities I have a team of experienced and expert eggheads waiting in the wings. I call these folks... my friends.

He lost his battle with cancer, but he did not go quietly and he will not be forgotten. His work is immortalized in over 40 novels or works of non-fiction, and at least as many collections, anthologies, and magazines. In fact, new works by CJ Henderson will publish for years to come thanks to his heroic efforts to finish and find homes for those projects as-yet unpublished at the time of his illness.\nCJ always did what he could to give other authors a boost. Encouraging them, mentoring them, sending opportunities their way. With that in mind those of us who called him friend feel there is no better tribute we can raise in his memory than an anthology filled with people he has helped over the years, writing stories inspired by CJ or his work.\nWe are running this campaign a little longer than usual, primarily because December 26th was CJ's birthday and we plan to celebrate that along with the landmarks we hit with this campaign.\nHe touched our hearts and now we share that with the world because he will not be forgotten. Will you help us share this amazing man with the world?\n CJ's collection of works is vast and varied. Everything from hard-boiled detectives to military science fiction. He's written comics for Marvel and flash fiction for the annual Boris Valejo calendars. He's know for writing pulp and writing Lovecraftian mythos. We wanted to capture some small cross-section of that scope of work.\nWith that in mind, the authors in this collection--Jean Rabe, James Chambers, Patrick Thomas, Greg Schauer, Leona Wisoker, John L. French, Jeff Young, David Boop, Robert M. Price, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, and CJ Henderson himself--have lent their own voices to CJ's worlds, sought to capture a glimmer of him through his beloved written word.\nThis collection is currently comprised of the following stories:\nWhat Tales He Knows by John L. French\nHenderson Rising by Patrick Thomas\nShadow of the Infinite by Leona Wisoker\nEvery Second of Every Day by James Chambers\nFinder by Jeff Young\nIn the Dying Light by Danielle Ackley-McPhail\nStar Lights by Jean Rabe\nScorn and Jealousy by CJ Henderson and David Boop\nDigging Doomsday by Robert M.

At the end of the Kickstarter we'll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for. \nPlease note, for each of the authors in this book this is a for-the-love anthology. Each has elected to not take payment for their stories, so as our thanks we have included their other works in the Add-Ons section of this campaign, along with titles from CJ's backlist. Please browse through and see if any of the titles catch your interest.

Her work is fueled equally by coffee and conviction. She often chooses reading material alphabetically rather than by subject or author, which has led her to read about aardvarks, birds, child-warriors, dragons, eggs, faeries, ghosts, horses, and many other random subjects.\nLeona's science-fantasy series, The Children of the Desert, is set in a world still struggling through a number of basic moral and developmental issues. The beliefs and strengths of each character are tested to the limit in the course of multiple intersecting story arcs. And, of course, there's a mysterious ancient race in the background that could destroy all life on earth if they get sufficiently annoyed. Anything less would just be boring.\nHer short stories have appeared in Futures: Fire to Fly, Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine, Galactic Creatures anthology, Sha'Da: Pawns anthology, and more. She has lived in Florida, Connecticut, Oregon, New Hampshire, Las Vegas, Alaska, California, and Virginia; has experienced the alternate realities of Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, New York, Long Island, and Italy; and believes that \"home is wherever my coffee cup is filled.\"\nShe lives in Virginia with an extraordinarily patient husband and two large dogs.\nJeff Young is a bookseller first and a writer second \u2013 although he wouldn\u2019t mind a reversal of fortune. He received a Writers of the Future award for \u201cWritten in Light\u201d which appears in the 26th L.Ron Hubbard\u2019s Writers of the Future anthology. Jeff has contributed to the anthologies By Any Means, Best Laid Plans, Dogs of War, In an Iron Cage: The Magic of Steampunk, Clockwork Chaos and Fantastic Futures 13, as well as the upcoming anthologies Gaslight and Grimm and The Ministry of Extraordinary Weapons. He is the editor for the Drunken Comic Book Monkey line for Fortress Publishing as well as the anthology TV Gods. He has led the Watch the Skies SF&F Discussion Group of Camp Hill and Harrisburg for thirteen years.\n The Weird Wild West is an anthology of fantastic stories of the Wild West as it never was\u2014and in all the weirdest ways that can be imagined, featuring some of the best writers in the speculative fiction world.

Women of all ages and races, abilities and physical attributes, unified by a love for art and literature. \n For the second installment of the series, Silence in the Library Publishing issued an open submissions call, intent on populating the anthology with the best speculative fiction from up and coming women authors, including Emily Lavin Leverett, one of the editors of The Weird Wild West. After reading hundreds of submissions, the editors, Janine K. Spendlove and Maggie Allen, have put together a group of stories that we know their readers are going to love. \nTo support their campaign and get even more great fiction visit: http://tiny.cc/athenas2.\n An independent publishing house drawing on decades of experience in the industry.

And so we set out to produce an anthology where women were involved in all aspects of the creative process, from the artists to the authors, the editors to the project managers. Women of all ages and races, abilities and physical attributes, unified by a love for art and literature.\nIn January 2014, we ran a Kickstarter that was successful beyond our wildest dreams. In just one month, the Athena's Daughters campaign raised $44,350 \u2014 521% of our initial goal. During that campaign we achieved stretch goals that not only funded a companion anthology, Apollo's Daughters (stories about women, but written by men), but also funded the production of a second volume... Athena's Daughters 2 which would have an open call for submissions from any woman who wished to be included. Silence in the Library Publishing immediately began the work of putting together this second collection full of stories about a diverse assortment of female protagonists, all written by women.\nSubmissions for this volume opened in June, and we were flooded with great stories. After a difficult deliberation, we accepted stories by: Tiffani Angus, Antha Ann Adkins, Sarah Brand, Elizabeth Bridges, Megan Chee, Liz Colter, Janice Croom, Ellen Goodlett, Emily Lavin Leverett, Alison J. McKenzie, Megan O'Russell, Tish Pahl, Carrie Ryan, Rori Shay, and Tess Tabak. We'll tell you more about each author below.\nBecause payment to authors, artists, editors, and layout professionals has already been completely covered by the previous Athena's Daughters Kickstarter, we can keep the initial goal very low\u2014enough to cover the costs of printing and shipping. This will allow us to set some really cool stretch goals at very low levels. \nAs we hit stretch goals we will be adding more stories (and more art!) to our anthology. Our stretch goal authors are Jordan Frederick, Lindsay Kitson, Nicole Givens Kurtz, Gerri Leen, Janine A. Southard, and JY Yang. Additionally, backers will receive extra stories and other free downloads as we hit these goals.\nThere is a whole team of us here at Silence in the Library that will be working to bring this anthology to life. Kelli Neier created the cover and will be doing the print and eBook layout, as well as managing the Kickstarter campaign. Ginger Breo has created all the internal art attached to each and every story. Autumn Frederickson will be doing a special cover for the print version of the book, if we hit her stretch goal. Tanya Spackman will be the copyeditor, and last but not least, Maggie Allen and Janine Spendlove will be the content editors and overall project managers.\n\"Athena's Daughters 2\" theme lyrics written by Chris Russell:\nSomething romantic\nNothing pedantic\nSomething for everyone\nAthena's Daughters 2!\nSomething that's tragic\nSomething with magic\nSomething for everyone\nAthena's Daughters 2!\nSomething that's grim,\nSomething that's Greek!\nOk, we're sold!\nOur Interest is piqued!\nStunning surprises!\nNear missed demises.\nStories determined to delight!\nFairytales and death plots!\nOuter space and robots!\nLove stories and chases!\nWe covered all the bases!\nPanderers!\nPhilanderers!\nCupidity!\nTimidity!\nMistakes!\nFakes!\nRhymes!\nCrimes!\nWriters!\nFighters!\nArtists!\nFarces!\nMaybe a curse, written in verse,\nAnd a few happy endings, of course!\nGoodness and badness,\nPanic and madness--\nPlease help our stories see the light!\nDon't wait 'til tomorrow\nBack the book tonight!\nFirst 100 Backers - Will receive a free digital download of an exclusive story by Elizabeth Bridges, \"Run\" which is the prequel to \"Breathe\" her story in AD2.\nFirst 200 Backers - Will receive a free digital download of Janine Spendlove's short stories \u201cGirl\u201d and \u201cWhite Flag\u201d from the Songs of the Seasons series.\n$5,000 - ACHIEVED - We will add the short story \u201cRed is the Colour of Mother Dirt\u201d by JY Yang.\nJY Yang is a lapsed scientist, a former journalist, and a short story writer.

She started writing when she was thirteen, but actually started telling stories at was five years old in a friend's basement, using cardboard boxes as props. Her parents and teachers complained that she always had her head in the clouds, and they were right.

Women of all ages and races, abilities and physical attributes, unified by a love for art and literature.\nFor the second installment of the series, we issued an open submissions call, intent on populating the anthology with the best speculative fiction from up and coming women authors.

It's no surprise that the girls there are smitten with the handsome young soldier, but as they start to leave their jobs--and no forwarding addresses--Rosie Ransom begins to suspect there's more to Johnny's homecoming than believed.\nWhen Johnny tries to turn a vampiric bite on her, Rosie kills him in self defense--and sees his soul, pure and uncorrupted, rise into the ether. Within hours, she's approached by handsome, dangerous Hank Turner, who believes her to be a Redeemer--a rare talent who can save a lost soul even after demonic possession has taken place. \nRosie, facing the loss of her factory job as men--and her fiance Rich Thompson--come home from the war, is eager for any future that grants her the independence she's come to cherish as a working woman. If there are monsters to slay, she'll embrace the opportunity. Because without Rosie's help, the scare started by Johnny may turn into a full-fledged nightmare...\nRead the first 3 chapters!\n***\nThe \u20ac8K initial goal is, frankly, a low-ball: it'll buy me enough time to write the novel, which is, of course, the whole point. It's not a get-rich scheme. :)\nConsequently, the initial stretch goals are ruthlessly pragmatic: they'll help to cover editing, copy editing, digital formatting and cover art. I'll lay them out below, but excitingly, I've already spoken with artist Lindsey Look, who has done the covers for Tim Pratt's Marla Mason novels. Lindsey is on board for doing the cover art, and her style is perfect for what I have in mind, so I'm VERY HOPEFUL that we'll reach the cover art stretch goal and I'll be able to hire Lindsey as the cover artist.\nRuthlessly Pragmatic Stretch Goals:\nat \u20ac9500, REDEEMER will undergo professional structural editing (hopefully by my former Del Rey editor Betsy Mitchell), which will make it a Much Better Book.\nat \u20ac10K, I'll be able to hire a copy editor who will save me frm embarrassing myself. And I swear I didn't type \"frm\" there on purpose, but I shall leave it for illustrative purposes. :)\nat \u20ac10.5K, I'll hire someone to do the conversions to DRM-free digital format, which will result in vastly superior quality than if I did it myself. :)\nat \u20ac12K, we get gorgeous Lindsey Look cover art!\nIf we reach that stretch goal, I will 1. make incoherent noises, and 2. post some less pragmatic goals. :)\n***\nSo the Redeemer Chronicles are an idea I had a while back, and I was surprised to discover that 1945 is a really difficult era to sell a book in. Apparently it's too recent to be Historical, too Historical to be Contemporary, and too Politically Fraught to be worth the risk.\nNaturally that just made me want to write REDEEMER all the more. I've written a lot of contemporary(urban) fantasy over the past decade, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little burned out on it (which is why you're not seeing a Walker Papers spinoff happening).\nBut setting the Redeemer Chronicles in a different era opens up a whole new aspect of the genre for me. For me, it's not just writing urban fantasy. It's world building in a whole different way: post-war America was a society undergoing massive upheaval politically, socially and emotionally. It's near enough to us, historically, that in a way we think we know it...but at the same time it's shocking how incredibly different things were.\nAnd really, that'd probably be enough, but of course, I'm a fantasy novelist, so I have to throw monsters in on top of it. So what I have here is--well, heck.\nIt is your grandmother's urban fantasy...!\n(Thanks due to J.

This is one of many reasons I'm not promising it'll be delivered to backers by March. :)\n\nBeyond that, and barring personal disasters, there's little doubt I'll deliver in a timely fashion; I have, after all, done this before, both in crowdfunding and in traditional publication. Besides, I'm all excited about the project and want to get writing. :)\n\nREDEEMER is a full-length novel, which means it's something like 3 months of writing, plus edits, copy edits, production, and I have two projects to finish (both of which I anticipate completing by the end of 2014) before I can tackle it full-on.

Bingle. Frame Shop is a 42,000 word mystery thriller novella set in a writers' group. Unlike a traditional who-dunnit, Frame Shop mixes violence, humor, and occasional writing advice in a format that will keep mystery lovers, aspiring authors, and established writers turning the pages. Frame Shop will be made available in the digital format of your choice: Kindle (mobi) or Nook (epub).  Both DRM-free formats can, with a free app, also be read on any PC, iPad, Mac, smartphone, or phablet.\nYou can get Frame Shop alone or in combination with a number of different novels, stories, or packages by award-winning genre author, Donald J. Bingle.\nAbout Frame Shop\n(Minor spoilers in this section, so skip ahead to the next section if you don't want to know anything else about the plot.)\nHarold J. Ackerman thinks his latest cat mystery proves he is the best writer in the Pleasant Meadows Writers\u2019 Guild and Critiquing Society, not that the motley assortment of poets, poseurs, and wannabe writers in the PMWGCS provides much competition. But then Gantry Ellis, the NYT best-selling author of the Danger McAdams mystery thrillers, joins the group and wows everyone. Still, Harold hopes to leverage his connection to the famous author into a big break, agreeing to help his mentor with some crime research. But when Harold interviews a real-life hit man, he decides to keep the information and contact for himself. Soon, he\u2019s just not writing about crime, he\u2019s a co-conspirator, but he\u2019s such a hack writer, he can\u2019t even do that by himself. Instead, he submits his \"plots\" to the rest of the PMWGCS and its members unwittingly assist.\nCritiquing another writer can be murder, especially when he\u2019s working for a hit man.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from Frame Shop in which the hit man, Guy, is berating Harold (who he calls \u201cSweater Vest\u201d) for attending the funeral of one of Guy\u2019s victims:\n\u201cWhat if they figure out who you are and that you have no connection whatsoever to the deceased? What if they come to your door and want answers?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sweater Vest temporized, \u201cI guess I\u2019d just tell them ...\u201d\nGuy interrupted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say you\u2019d just tell them you read about the murder in the paper and wanted to express your condolences. Nobody crashes graveside services. They crash weddings and wakes, cuz that\u2019s where the free booze is. Besides, I may not know you all that well, but even I can tell that you\u2019re not the kind of guy who has a reputation for spontaneous expressions of sympathy to random strangers. If this was a Lifetime movie, you\u2019d get cast as the creepy dude who spends too much time watching kids at the park.\u201d\nGuy could see Sweater Vest\u2019s blood pressure was rising, too. The fellow\u2019s face was flushing red and his jaw was clenched tight for a few moments before he responded. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be insulting. I had ... I have ... a perfectly good reason to give should anyone ask me why I was at the funeral. It\u2019s the same reason I can give for being anywhere, anytime, watching anything from bums urinating on the subway platform to young women walking by in thin summer dresses.\n\"I\u2019m a writer. My job is to observe things, notice them, experience them, memorize them, and keep them in my mind\u2019s eye for later use. Everything, everywhere is grist for my mill and I grind my flour into a soft, smooth, silky silt. Characters, settings, emotions, storylines, places, things, clothing, arcane bits of description and poetry. A writer has an excuse for knowing everything from nuclear weapon yields to whether college girls typically wear thongs to avoid panty-lines on their tight, tight jeans when they\u2019re attending a kegger at the local frat. I can go anywhere on the excuse of gathering atmosphere. I can ask questions about a building\u2019s security system or untraceable poisons or what knots are best used for S&M bondage sessions without blinking because I can always say it\u2019s research for a book.

Sure, Dick's tough and he knows a few tricks to help him get out of a tight spot, even if his boss accuses him of over-reliance on an abundance of explosives. But he's also got a mortgage, a wife upset by his frequent absences on \"business\" trips, and an increasingly alienated teen-age son who spends way too much time playing in gaming worlds on the computer.\nWhen a mission to bust up an arms exchange in New Zealand goes spectacularly bad, Dick is forced to partner with an espionage neophyte to battle evil on multiple fronts, leading to a final confrontation that incorporates real-world conspiracy theories and cutting-edge technology.\nIn the end, Dick can save his partner, save his marriage, save his son, or save the world, but he can't do it all.\nForced Conversion (Five Star; 2004):\nForced Conversion, gripping near future military scifi.\nEveryone can have heaven, any heaven they want, but some people don\u2019t want to go.\n\"Visceral, bloody -- and one hell of a page turner! Bingle tackles the philosophical issues surrounding uploaded consciousness in a fresh, exciting way. This is the debut of a major novelist -- don't miss it.\" Robert J. Sawyer, Hugo and Nebula Award-Winning Author.\nMankind has largely retreated to the realms of virtual reality, where resources are unlimited and the problems of the real world--violence, conflict, sickness, and pain--can all be avoided. Unfortunately, those who stay behind in the real world pose the only risk to the immortality of those who have converted to virtual existence.\nDerek, a soldier in the Conversion Forces (ConFoes), seeks to enforce the Mandatory Conversion Act on the remaining mals (malcontent Luddites, gangbangers, and religious fanatics). He just wants to put in his time and join his family on one of the virtual worlds. But until then, he is forced to deal with his psychotic squad-mates, the increasingly brutal tactics of the ConFoes, and a mal ambush. And that's just the beginning of his journey.\nWhile most speculative and science fiction deals with worlds transformed by technological advance, Forced Conversion highlights the troubling and chaotic process of that transformation, itself. It combines the adrenaline-soaked action of military fiction with the extrapolation of current scientific trends of the best speculative fiction, while dealing with the moral and religious implications of both war and technology.\nIf large scale transcendence could occur, this novel explains how it would come about and what the real world would be like in the aftermath.\nWhen Moore\u2019s Law meets God\u2019s Law, the result is forced conversion.\nSays Ed Greenwood, Creator of The Forgotten Realms\u2122 and Author of the bestselling Elminster novels: \"I loved it! Many writers have explored hard-hitting and brutal possible futures for Earth, and told colorful tales of people trying to stay alive in them, but few have brought such imagined futures as vividly to life as Don Bingle -- and no other book I can think of examines how and why such a future might just happen as well as FORCED CONVERSION does -- or provides half the breath-catching twists and turns of Bingle's yarn. A 'good read' of the old school, coupled with all-too-plausible reasons for everything. A grim warning and a fast action adventure tale, all in one! Highly recommended!\"\nGREENSWORD (Five Star; 2009):\nGREENSWORD, a darkly humorous eco-thriller.\nThey\u2019re about to save the world; they just don\u2019t want to be caught doing it.\nZeke, Milo, and Brandon are struggling to keep their environmental protest group, GreensWord, alive. It impresses chicks and sure beats getting jobs as corporate serfs in the real world. But their chief benefactor, movie star Matthew Barrington, threatens to cut off funding unless they stop global warming before his Malibu beach house slides into the storm-tossed ocean. In their desperate effort to save the beach house and their organization, the GreensWord trio is willing to try almost anything. No plan is so illegal, so risky, or so stupid that they won't lend it an ear. But nothing is fast enough to stop global warming in time ... until they think of the unthinkable solution.\nAnd although they may be crazed fanatics, they've watched enough T.V. to think they know exactly what to do to foil any investigation of their noble crime. And if their drastic solution to global warming means they also take out the reigning internet tycoon and his monopolistic software company, that's just organic frosting on the vegan cake.\nOne person can make a difference in the world.\nOf course, three people with a plan to stop global warming overnight can make a big difference.\nGREENSWORD is a dark comedy about the environment, extremism, stupid criminals, and the lengths to which people will go to avoid getting a real job.\nSays USA Today Bestselling Author of the Warlands trilogy, Elizabeth A Vaughan: \"GREENSWORD is a darkly humorous, gripping thriller that combines environmental imperatives, terrorist activities, and sex in ways that still make me wake up in a cold sweat, months after reading the book, convinced that it could happen.\"\nWriter on Demand TM story collections:\nTales of Gamers and Gaming (Writer on Demand Vol. 1)\nTales of Gamers and Gaming includes three stories, one of novelette length:\n\"The Quest\" (approximately 8,000 words) tells the story of what happens when a group of MMORPG gamers get together in real life. \"Loser Takes All\" (approximately 5,000 words) tells the story of a man always looking for just one more world to conquer. \"Gaming Circle\" (approximately 4,100 words) explains what it is about our real lives that makes us want to game.\nTales of Humorous Horror (Writer on Demand Vol. 2)\nTales of Humorous Horror includes three stories:\n\"BunRabs\" (approximately 3,500 words) tells the story of the real truth behind the connection between Easter and bunnies, at least from a unique point of view. \"Hell to Pay\" (approximately 3,050 words) tells the story of the recording industry's ultimate solution for illiegal downloading of music. \"Cursory Review\" (approximately 4,200 words) shows that demons really don't find it that easy to create cursed objects.\nTales Out of Time (Writer on Demand Vol. 3)\nTales Out of Time includes three stories:\n\"Standing Still\" (approximately 4,600 words) tells the story of one man trying to help another deal with the reality in which he finds himself. \"Knowing She Would\" (approximately 3,600 words) tells the story of a girl visited repeatedly by those who need her help in their journeys. \"A Passion for Time Travel\" (approximately 3,900 words) deals with the problems of a company that sells vacations throughout time.\nGrim, Fair e-Tales (Writer on Demand Vol. 4)\nGrim, Fair e-Tales includes four dark or downbeat stories, two of which are set are fairs or carnivals:\n\"Suburban Legend\" (approximately 6,400 words) rips from the headlines and twists the classic tale of a suburban husband accused of murdering his beautiful wife. \"Artists Only\" (approximately 3,500 words) tells the tale of a little girl who goes unwillingly with her brother to the local traveling carnival, tires of the garish distractions, and becomes lost. . \"Stew\" (approximately 3,900 words) deals with a boy who decides it is right to go to war, but later regrets his decision. \"Grok\" (approximately 4,000 words) is a the story of the mud-man of the local Renaissance Faire.\nTales of an Altered Past Powered by Romance, Horror, and Steam (Writer on Demand Vol. 5)\nTales of an Altered Past Powered by Romance, Horror, and Steam includes four stories:\n\"Dashed Hopes\" (approximately 4,250 words) is a tale of invention, romance, and tragedy set in the coal fields of England. \"Rejecting the Anthropocene\" (approximately 2,400 words) is a cautionary tale about the dangers of ignoring science, no matter how unpopular it may be. \"Gentlemanly Horrors of Mine Alone\" (approximately 7,100 words) is a tale of love, gold and monsters.  It was the ninth story in Mike Stackpole's The Chain Story Project. Each of the stories in the chain begins with a scene set in The Wanderers' Club in London, where patrons take turns telling stories of their adventures and derring-do. Though the plots and characters of the various tales differ and each adventure is self-contained and independent, every story-teller starts out by referencing the story before his in some fashion before telling his own tale Mike Stackpole's character, Rogers, is used with permission. \"Foggy Goggles\" (approximately 4,200 words) is a tale of an adventuresome reporter, two world-changing inventions, and unintended consequences.\nNot-So-Heroic Fantasy (Writer on Demand Vol. 6)\nNot-So-Heroic Fantasy includes four stories:\n\"Fellow Traveler: (approximately 3,040 words) is a tale a bard who makes the most of his limited skills to impress a horde of barbarians of limited intelligence and less hygiene. \"Means to an End\" (approximately 4,950 words) is a cautionary tale about getting exactly what you planned and schemed and worked and wished for, but with unforeseen results. \"The Eye-Candy of Argon\" (approximately 2,300 words) is a critical and satirical re-telling (from a different perspective) of \"The Eye Of Agron\"--widely regarded as the worst published fantasy story of all time. This parody is best enjoyed by those who have already read Jim Theis' original tale in all of its un-copyedited glory, yet lived to read again. \"MAKESHIFT\" (approximately 5,100 words) mixes fantasy and magic with imagination and the science of noetics in the tale of a very special young man recruited to a world of wonder and weighty responsibility.\nShadow Realities (Writer on Demand Vol. 7)\nShadow Realities includes five stories:\n\u201cPsycho Physics\u201d (approximately 6,000 words) slipstreams a hard-boiled detective through a world of science into a world that he can only pray is science fiction to get his man and avert an unimaginable catastrophe. \u201cFor Every Time, A Season\u201d (approximately 2,000 words) reveals a mirror world where everything is exactly the same as our world, except for one crucial dimension that makes all the difference in the world--a life and death difference. \u201cRural Route\u201d (approximately 4,600 words) reveals the shadows of another reality and their plans for bringing their patterns of darkness to our reality in an unconventional assault that almost no one sees coming. \u201cDay of the Shadows\u201d (approximately 4,000 words) captures what happens when our darkest fears become reality. \u201cwww.karmassist.com\u201d (approximately 4,300 words) teaches us to be wary when our dreams come true, because darkness is concealed inside every wish come true.\nWhile all digital copies of material by author Donald J. Bingle will be DRM free, certain other items in the reward levels and stretch goals may or may not have DRM protection, depending on the policy of the individual author or publisher.\nShipping, International Orders, etc.\nOnce the Kickstarter is completed, you will receive an email/survey asking for shipping information, etc.  For those of you disappointed by the lack of international shipping for physical books (digital is no problem, as long as you have a valid email address), please note that I plan to be at both Origins Game Fair and at GenCon in 2015 and you may choose to pick up your physical books from me there.  Of course, you can always have paper copies shipped to a friend in the United States and arrange for shipping directly to you with them.\nThanks\nSpecial thanks to Randy Martin for his assistance on the audio portion of the Kickstarter video for Frame Shop and to the many friends and fellow writers who commented on the format and contents of this page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince Frame Shop is already written, there are few risks except for the technical aspects of password protected transfer of e-book files and the timeliness of performance, which is dependent on third parties like cover artists, printers, and the US Postal Service. Accordingly, I have attempted to make the scheduled dates of delivery conservative, but hope to beat such deadlines, especially on electronic content. In the event that Frame Shop gets picked up by a publisher prior to any applicable delivery dates, dates might be extended to allow that publisher's edition to be delivered in lieu of the version being created and published through my company, 54-40' Orphyte, Inc.

There's a whole world of science fiction stories published in other languages. We never intended to stop with China, so we've added stretch goals (below) to help us get started on the other languages. The first goal funds at $12,500 and we're very close!\nChina has one of the largest science fiction reading populations in the world and has produced a significant body of work that has remained relatively unseen by English-speaking audiences. In recent years, a few stories and novels have made their way to English language publication, but we are unaware of any project to regularly feature Chinese works in a science fiction magazine.\nClarkesworld Magazine has always aspired to publish stories from a global pool. It's our opinion that different perspectives make the genre stronger. We've published authors from all over the world, but quality translations have been few and far between. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of writer/translators Ken Liu and John Chu, it's been our privilege to publish five. These stories include:\n\"The Fish of Lijiang\" by Chen Qiufan (2013 Science Fiction & Fantasy Translation Awards Winner)\n\"A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\" by Xia Jia (2013 Science Fiction & Fantasy Translation Awards Honorable Mention, 2012 Locus Recommended Reading List selection, and reprinted in The Year's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy, 2013 Edition, Rich Horton ed.)\n\"Grave of the Fireflies\" by Cheng Jingbo\n\"Pepe\" by Tang Fei\n\"Spring Festival: Happiness, Anger, Love, Sorrow, Joy\" by Xia Jia\nand we'd like to bring you even more.\nI've recently signed an agreement with Weixiang (Storycom International Culture Communication Co., Ltd.) to add a translated Chinese science fiction story to each issue of Clarkesworld. Each month, Storycom's team of experts will send us a list of stories they think would work well for us\u2014much like we use our slush pile to choose our current fiction offerings. I'll select one from that pile and then work with the author and translator to get the story ready for publication. Every story will appear in all editions of Clarkesworld\u2014our free online edition, podcast (audio fiction), ebook and digital subscriptions, print issues, and annual anthologies\u2014and provide these authors with significant English language exposure. (They'll be paid too.)\nWe believe that providing markets that actively publish translated fiction is good for readers, authors, translators, and the genre as a whole. Our past experience tells us this is something we are qualified to and should do.\nI'd like this feature to be a supplement to the existing fiction we're publishing at Clarkesworld. Our goal is to raise the funding we need to launch this feature for the first year: three stories in the first six months\u2014our ramp-up period\u2014and six stories in the following six months. This will provide us with the time we need to make this project self-sustaining through subscriptions and other avenues (such as advertising, ebooks, anthologies, Patreon, etc.) \n$5800 to be paid to authors at our standard pay rates for original fiction.\n$450 in increased costs related to creating the audio versions of these stories for our podcast.\nThe remaining amount covers the fees and overhead associated with this campaign (Kickstarter and Amazon fees, print reward costs).\nNote: Translation costs have already been covered.\nNeil Clarke (neil-clarke.com) is the Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of Clarkesworld Magazine. He\u2019s a current and three-time Hugo Nominee for Best Editor (Short Form).  In 2012, Neil suffered a near-fatal \u201cwidow-maker\u201d heart attack which led to the installation of a defibrillator and a new life as a cyborg. Inspired by these events, he edited Upgraded, an all-original anthology of cyborg stories scheduled for publication this month and fully-funded by a Kickstarter campaign. He currently lives in NJ with his wife and two sons. \nClarkesworld (clarkesworldmagazine.com) is a monthly science fiction and fantasy magazine first published in October 2006.

We are a three-time winner of the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine, winner of the 2014 British Fantasy Award for Best Magazine, and a four-time World Fantasy Award nominee.

Stories acquired through this fund will be published on an irregular schedule as extra content in Clarkesworld Magazine starting in 2015 and continue until the budget is depleted. \nStretch Goal #2a: $15,000\nDigital anthology\nWe will publish a digital anthology featuring all the stories funded through this campaign (Chinese and Translation Fund fiction). If we reach this goal, the ebook will be added to ALL reward levels. (Money will used to pay authors, cover artist, Kickstarter fees, and ebook design.)\nStretch Goal #2b: $21,000\nPrint anthology\nWe will publish a print edition of the anthology in 2a. If we reach this goal the print edition will be added to all $40 and higher reward levels. Money will be used to pay authors, cover artist, Kickstarter fees, designer, shipping and printing. Note: Additional shipping will be required for international supporters to receive this book.\nStretch Goal #3: $21,000-23,500\nThe Clarkesworld Translation Fund: Non-Fiction \nThe translation fund will expand to include translated non-fiction content.\nAll ebook rewards will be provided in DRM-free EPUB and MOBI/KINDLE formats.\nAnyone contributing at the $10 or higher level in this campaign will be listed in the annual Clarkesworld Census as a citizen. This list is published in print and digital formats as an appendix in our annual anthology.\nOur plan is to launch this new feature in January 2015, which will be our supersized 100th issue. All reward tiers will receive this issue in digital format.\nSince we're giving you issue 100, we're starting all subscriptions rewards in February 2015, with issue 101.

We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work.\nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce all three books\u2026to pay the authors, artists, and editors, and to pay for printing and shipping your rewards. As part of our model, the authors share equally with the publisher in any profit from the sale of books. This means that there is no built-in profit to us as the publisher. It is more important to us that these book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nWe also want to ensure that readers have a voice in the publishing process. Ultimately, readers make all of this possible, and we feel that you should have a say in what gets published and what doesn't. Kickstarter provides the platform that makes this possible.\nMany of you will have backed our past projects: Time Traveled Tales, A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination, War of the Seasons, Athena's Daughters, Icarus, ELECTED, and HEROES! If you have, you are aware of our dedication to fulfilling our projects on or ahead of schedule. We've worked through out some recent logistical kinks and are now even more prepared to meet our deadlines and exceed your expectations.\nQuick Explanation: Kickstarter doesn't really have an intuitive way to do add-ons, and the process can be confusing, so here's a quick explanation.\nTo add one of the below onto your current pledge, just click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button at the top right of the page, click in the \"Pledge Amount\" box, and change the pledge amount to reflect the addition of the amount of the add-on you want. Example: if your current pledge amount is $10, and you want to add a $5 add-on, you would click into the \"Pledge Amount\" box and change the pledge amount to $15. At the end of the Kickstarter, we'll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for.\nFor this particular Kickstarter campaign, add-ons are a way to customize your chosen backer level.\nExample: Say, you chose THE PAPER TETHER level, which gets you The Tethering ebook and paperback for $15. But maybe you also want an ebook version of Cloak. Solution: Increase your pledge to $20 total and send us a message that you want Cloak ebook in addition to The Tethering.\nAdd-ons also grant you access to some of the previous Silence in the Library releases if you haven't backed one of our past projects.\nEbooks\nNovels\nCloak by Timothy Zahn - $5\nThe Cauldron by Jean Rabe - $5\nThe Tethering by Megan O'Russell - $5\nELECTED by Rori Shay - $5\nVision of Shadows by Vincent Morrone - $5\nSerpent\u2019s Head by Bryan Young - $5\nOperation: Montauk by Bryan Young - $5\nA Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination by Bryan Young - $5\nWar of the Seasons: The Human by Janine K.

We spend a lot of time on the road going to conventions and trade shows around the country, and there's nothing better for a long road trip than a good audiobook. The folks over at My Audiobook Library have a Kickstarter project going right now to expand their audiobook offering to 55,000 titles. By supporting this project, you help to foster selection and competition in the audiobook world, which can only be good for us as consumers. Right now, Amazon controls about 90% of the market. At 55,000, My Audiobook Library becomes a real contender, and can help to normalize pricing at a reasonable level. Please go take a look at this project by clicking on the image or title above. We've backed it, and feel that the long and short term rewards are well worth the money. \nLost Days by Michael Jan Friedman\nMany of you will know Michael Jan Friedman from his work as an author in the Star Trek universe. We, of course, love that work, but we're really excited about all of the stories he's been telling in his own universes. We backed the Kickstarter project for his book I am the Salamander, and are incredibly excited to find that he's back with another project for his new book Lost Days. If you're a fan of good science fiction and fantasy, please go take a look at this project by clicking on the title or image above.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks and challenges with any project, but as with our previous Kickstarters we\u2019ve minimized them considerably. All three books are already written and in the process of being edited. The covers have been designed. The eBook version of one of the books is already complete, and the other two are in progress.\n\nThe biggest challenge for a publisher, other than getting the content in and formatted, is generally timely printing. We have solid relationships with our printers, and are generally able to get proofs back and books printed within 30 days of sending them the book, but there is always a chance that the printer will take longer than expected. If that happens and it causes the project to run past the promised date, we will send out regular status updates until the books have arrived.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Now's The Time!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Our MONSTERS Anthology is LIVE!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Only 38 Hours Left on Our Current Project!", "update_content": "This is it!\nWe're entering the final hours of our Kickstarter for Pride and Prejudice Illustrated by Janet Lee."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Rewards Completed & News on our Current Project", "update_content": "By now, everyone should have received their rewards.

You can also upgrade your trade paperback at any level by adding $15 to your existing pledge.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSilence in the Library Publishing is excited to bring you our latest anthology, HEROES!, a collection of short fiction about superheroes, not-so-super heroes, and everyday people who find the hero within. \nInside the pages of HEROES!, you'll find stories from authors including Aaron Allston, Michael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Jaym Gates, Addie J. King, Jean Rabe, Aaron Rosenberg, Janine Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many more. \nAs part of this Kickstarter, you'll also be able to purchase the companion anthology, A Hero By Any Other Name, featuring stories about sidekicks, off-beat superheroes, and hapless villains by Aaron Allston, Michael A. Stackpole, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Jean Rabe, Janine K. Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many of the other authors in HEROES! Several of the stories in these two anthologies are directly tied to each other.\nOne of the things that we're particularly happy about with respect to this anthology is its diversity. Diversity with respect to gender, ethnicity, age, body type, and life experience. The heroes in HEROES! come from all walks of life. Some have superpowers that make them something more, or less, than human, but others are facing a dangerous world with only their wits and willpower to aid them. We have some of the \"perfect\" comic book heroes, but most of our heroes would be considered flawed by those standards. They're past their physical prime, or seemingly too young for the task at hand, or not in perfect shape, or slightly bumbling, or have any number of other quirks. In other words, they're actual people.\nPlease, let us introduce you to just a few of them:\nKiara Bell is an African American woman in her late twenties who goes by \"Panthera\" when fighting crime. She wears black leather biker gear and rides a Suzuki motorcycle. Her superpower is her chitinous shell, so she is tough, not quick. She gives the impression of gentle strength and fearlessness.\nThunderbolt is a Caucasian male in his mid 20s. He has the ability to shoot incredibly destructive lightning bolts from his hands. His costume (dark blue motocross leathers with a bright orange lightning bolt logo on the chest) does not hide the fact that he is out of shape and slightly pudgy. He has serious body-image issues, and recurring problems with static cling.\nThe unnamed hero from \"By Blood of Fang and Song, We Call You\" by Jaym Gates is an old soldier turned rancher. She is of Hispanic/Native American background, moderate height, strongly built, gold eyes, black hair, dark skin. She lives in a post-apocalyptic world that\u2019s being eaten by monsters and she talks to dragons.\nShade is a twelve year old girl who lives in a swamp called the \"Shake\" by people who live there--she speaks in a somewhat bayou-ish dialect, and the story centers around her search for a man named \"the Caretaker,\" who is supposed to help residents in trouble.\nAs with all of our projects, one of our goals with HEROES! is to prove that there is no \"standard\" face to a protagonist (in this case, a hero), or an author of speculative fiction. Talent and strength know no race, sex, or other artificial boundary. \nWe want to both entertain you and engage you in the discussion of what it actually means to be a hero, and how that burden affects the person who carries it. \nEach of the stories in this anthology is beautifully illustrated by renowned artist Mark Dos Santos. Mark's popular Gotham Evening Post illustrations, which pay homage to the great Norman Rockwell, have been featured on Buzzfeed and io9. Published credits include issues of Grimm Fairy Tales from Zenescope Entertainment, Fall of Cthulhu: Godwar, Cthulhu Tales and Eureka: Dormant Gene for Boom Studios, a comic adaption of The Book of Five Rings for Smarter Comics, and a cover for Hack/Slash from Image Comics. Mark has also illustrated sketch cards for various card sets including, Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Hellboy Animated and Mars Attacks.\nIn addition to illustrating each story in HEROES!, we've developed a beautiful original art cover for the anthology. Created by artist Denis Loubet, best known for his work on computer and video games and pen & paper role-playing games, this cover captures the spirit and diversity of the characters found inside.\nThose of you who have backed past Silence in the Library projects will know that we produced custom \"challenge coins\" for the Time Traveled Tales Kickstarter. Those coins turned out so well, and were so successful, that we've decided to bring them back for the HEROES! Kickstarter. We'll start off with a single challenge coin featuring the HEROES! logo on one side and one of the characters from the book on the other side, and, if we reach the stretch goal, we'll expand that to a full run of 3 challenge coins featuring different characters. As with Time Traveled Tales, you will get to vote on which characters are on the coins. \nAt this point, you're probably asking yourself: \"Okay, self, this sounds great, but what's the entire list of authors?\"\nOr maybe not. But we think you're probably going to want it eventually, so here it is:\nAaron Allston - As many of you know, sadly, Aaron passed away a few months ago. He was incredibly important to all of us here at Silence in the Library. Aaron was instrumental in us getting our feet off the ground as a company, but he was also a dear friend and mentor. As much as we miss him, we are very happy to be able to say that he was able to complete a story for HEROES! before his passing. \nMichael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Janine K. Spendlove, Patrick S. Tomlinson, Dylan Birtolo, Donald J. Bingle, Sheryl Nantus, Sarah Hans, Daniel Myers, Bradley P. Beaulieu, Jennifer Brozek, Gregory A. Wilson, Bryan Young, Addie J. King, Aaron Rosenberg, R.T. Kaelin, Jaym Gates, Steven Saus, Tracy Chowdhury, and Kelly Swails.\nBut wait, there's more!\nWe'll also be adding stories and authors to the anthology as we reach stretch goals. Our stretch goal authors include: Alan Dean Foster, Gail Z. Martin, Jean Rabe, Jim Bernheimer, Steven Jordan, Maggie Allen, Rori Shay, and Ron Garner.\nBUT THERE'S EVEN MORE!\nAs we reach certain stretch goals, backers will get free digital downloads of amazing novels and short stories from a variety of authors, some of them in HEROES!, and some not. Authors providing digital stretch goals include: New York Times bestselling author Carrie Ryan (author of The Forest of Hands and Teeth), New York Times bestselling author Michael A. Stackpole, bestselling author Gail Z. Martin, Jim Bernheimer, Donald J. Bingle, Dylan Birtolo, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Vincent Morrone, Megan O'Russell, Rori Shay, Janine K. Spendlove, and Bryan Young. With even more to come!\nSilence in the Library was founded by a group of authors based on the notion that it is important to make the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work. \nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce the anthology\u2026to print the book, pay the authors and artists, and to fulfill your rewards. There is no profit built into this for the publisher. As part of our model, the authors share equally with the publisher in any profit from the sale of books. This means that the publisher will get a share in any profits equal to the share of one author in the anthology. We're not out to get wealthy on the back of this book, but just to make enough money that it is financially viable for us to continue to put out great projects like this. It is more important to us that this book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nWe also want to ensure that readers have a voice in the publishing process. Ultimately, readers make all of this possible, and we feel that you should have a say in what gets published and what doesn't. Kickstarter provides the platform that makes this possible. \nMany of you will have backed our past projects: Time Traveled Tales, A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination, War of the Seasons, Athena's Daughters, Icarus, and Elected.\nAll of these projects have been launched since June of 2013, so in the last year or so.\nWe have sent out the last items (the signed copies of the print books) necessary to have fulfilled 100% of our obligations for Time Traveled Tales, Volume 1. We have completed fulfillment of War of the Seasons, both print and digital, aside from a couple of short stories that are currently being written by stretch goal authors. We have fulfilled print and digital rewards for A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination. Athena's Daughters is on track to be fulfilled ahead of schedule, and Icarus is on track to be fulfilled on schedule. We have fulfilled digital rewards for Elected, and expect to have print rewards fulfilled well ahead of schedule.\nThe reason we mention these things is to let you know that we are dedicated to fulfilling all of our projects on time, and early if at all possible.\nSo, take a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the HEROES! experience.\nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAs with all of our projects, we've lined up some really great stretch goals that are free to backers. So, after you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live. Please be a part of the team. Together, we can all be heroes.\nThe way the add-ons will work is that you choose the level at which you wish to contribute, add the price of what you want from the list below, and contribute that amount (or, if you've already contributed, just add the amount from the list below to your current contribution). When the Kickstarter is complete, we will look at each of your selected contribution levels and the amount you have contributed, and if you have contributed more than the selected level we will contact you to find out which of the add-ons you would like.\n$5 - The eBook of A Hero By Any Other Name\n$5 - The eBook of In Hero Years I'm Dead by Michael A.

His is a graceful being with wings and incredible powers that he has no memory of how to use.\nJellinek is a four-foot hard-scrabble flamepetal prospector with tough red skin, a gruff disposition and general dislike of everyone around him, and a two-tailed lava-resistant creature called a \"solar\" as a companion.\nOn the day that their lives collide, everything about their world changes, and they discover that they have more in common than they can possibly imagine.\nTogether, Icarus and Jellinek will battle the tyranny of the Magisters, who have enslaved an entire people.\nGregory Wilson's story Icarus introduces us to the incredibly visual world of Vol, and the stunning array of characters and creatures who call it home. It takes us on an amazing journey in which Icarus and Jellinek fight for their lives and the freedom of a people while trying to unlock the mystery of Icarus's past. To Jellinek's surprise, Icarus's mystery becomes his own, as well.\nAnd it all started with a single piece of artwork.\nIllustration by Matt Slay for Time Traveled Tales\nYou see, Icarus started out as a novel. Gregory Wilson submitted the prologue of that novel to the Time Traveled Tales anthology. While another of Gregory's stories was ultimately used, Matt Slay drew the illustration you see above for Icarus. When Gregory saw it, he knew he had found an artist who could translate his book into a graphic novel in a way that would bring it to life.\nWe here at Silence in the Library agreed, and this project was born.\nThe Icarus graphic novel is planned as an 80-page, full-color book. In its pages, you'll be introduced to the stunning visuals and fantastic creatures of the world of Vol.\nYou'll experience the excitement as our two heroes face unimaginable dangers and delve into unfathomable mysteries.\nIf you're anything like us, Matt Slay's artwork will pull you into the story, and spit you out, gasping, at the end.\nYou'll get all of this if we reach our initial goal of $8000, but the book, and the project as a whole, gets even better as we reach our stretch goals. \nWe've brought on authors like Ed Greenwood, Gail Z. Martin, Michael A. Stackpole, Jean Rabe, Maxwell Alexander Drake, and Aaron Rosenberg to write short fiction that, if we reach their stretch goals, will be illustrated and added to the book as bonus stories. \nWe've also teamed with game designer Kris Siuda and his team to develop a 3D first-person RPG based on Icarus. While the full game will be developed and funded in a separate Kickstarter, there are several rewards related to it, like a concept art book, web playable companion level, and even the first module of the game, that we'll make available as we reach those stretch goals.\nWho Is Gregory A. Wilson?\nI'm an author of speculative fiction and a college professor; my first novel, a work of epic fantasy entitled The Third Sign, was published by Gale Cengage in 2009. I have two other novels, Icarus and Grayshade, in pre-publication, and have works of short fiction published in recent anthologies. I have three articles published in the SFWA Bulletin and am in the planning stages for a proposed anthology considering speculative fiction and politics, co-edited by two-time Hugo nominee John Helfers; a number of well-known authors are already on board. I am also the co-host (with fellow speculative fiction author Brad Beaulieu) of Speculate! The Podcast for Writers, Readers and Fans, a critically acclaimed show which discusses and interviews the creators of all sorts of speculative fiction. See and hear the details at www.speculatesf.com. Finally, I regularly read from my work and serve as a panelist at conferences across the country, and I am a member of Codex, the Writers' Symposium, and several other author groups on and offline. \nOn the teaching side, I am currently an Associate Professor of English at St. John's University in New York City, where I teach creative writing, science fiction and fantasy fiction along with various other courses in literature. I have published numerous articles and book chapters on a variety of academic subjects; my first academic book, The Problem in the Middle: Liminal Space and the Court Masque (Clemson University Press), was published in 2007. \nI live with my wife Clea, daughter Senavene \u2014 named at my wife's urging for a character in The Third Sign, for which I hope my daughter will forgive me \u2014 and dog Lilo in Riverdale, NY. My virtual home is www.gregoryawilson.com.\nIn keeping with Silence in the Library's goal of making authors and artists partners in the entire publishing process, I will be intimately involved in every step of this Kickstarter and in the fulfillment process. I'll also be giving you regular updates about the project over the course of the next 30 days.\nWho is Matt Slay?\nMatt Slay for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nBorn and raised in Maryland, Matt learned early that the best way to eat anything is with a mallet. Chesapeake folks understand this. His approaches to Art are not that far behind. Utilizing not only brushes, but quills, sponges, sandpaper, salt, razor blades, his fingernails, the souls of his enemies, and empty Tic-Tac boxes, Matt has a wonderful time sparing the general populace by working from his studio home somewhere on a mountain top in Virginia where he occasionally screams out of the third story window that he \u201cwas right\u201d and that \u201cnobody listened\u201d.\nMatt Slay for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nMatt Slay has been in production art for the better part of a decade having generated images for IDW\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Image Comics, The CBLDF, Upper Deck\u2019s \u201cMarvel Premiere\u201d, \u201cMarvel Beginnings series 2\u201d, and others; as well as Cryptozoic\u2019s Tarzan 100th Anniversary sets. \nMatt Slay for Time Traveled Tales\nMatt was the illustrator for Silence in the Library's popular Time Traveled Tales Anthology. He has also worked on \u201cCharnel House\u201d with Wes Huffor and Broken Voice Comics and produced countless designs for Record/Album covers, Logos, Book jackets as well as posters, patches and T-shirts for any number of companies. From time to time, he\u2019s been known to dabble in video game character design for companies such as Flamero on projects such \u201cNaystar: The Beginning\u201d and \u201cJourney Through Naystar\u201d. \nMatt Slay for Time Traveled Tales\nMatt studied Illustration and Design at VCU, The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, and completed his Bachelor\u2019s in Illustration at Radford University and later completed his Masters with endorsements in Art History and Art Psychology. He now puts that experience to use as a freelance illustrator bouncing back and forth between comics/comic books, advertising and marketing.\n\u2026And What About This Silence in the Library?\nSilence in the Library was founded by a group of authors based on the notion that it is important to make the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work. \nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce the graphic novel\u2026to pay the artist, to print the book, and to fulfill your rewards. There is no profit built into this for the publisher. If we reach stretch goals, we will first make sure that our artists and authors are appropriately compensated and that our staff are paid. We expect to make a profit from this book from long term sales. It is more important to us that this book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nMany of you will have backed our past projects: Time Traveled Tales, A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination, War of the Seasons, and Athena's Daughters.\nAll of these projects have been launched since June of 2013, so in the last six months or so. \nWe've completed fulfillment on about 90% of Time Traveled Tales, having sent out all rewards except the signed copes of the book (the bulk of our rewards were eBook or unsigned copies). We expect to have those out in the next few weeks. We've also completed fulfillment of all electronic rewards for War of the Seasons, and expect to have print books and other physical rewards out in the next couple of weeks. We're on track to fulfill A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination on time. Athena's Daughters just finished a week ago, but the first of the digital stretch goal rewards just went out, and we expect to have the rest out in the next couple of weeks. We also expect to have that project fulfilled in the promised timeline.\nThe reason we mention these things is to let you know that we are dedicated to fulfilling all of our projects on time, and early if at all possible. We carefully planned our projects for the year to ensure that we could make our fulfillment deadlines. \nOversight and fulfillment on this project will be a joint venture between Greg Wilson and Silence in the Library. We feel that this cooperative work flow will allow us to bring you a quality product in a timely manner.\nSo, take a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the Icarus experience.\nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAfter you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live. Please be a part of the team, and travel with us on this incredible journey.\nWhat's the Deal with this 3d RPG?\nGame designer Kris Siuda has put together an amazing team of game developers including Ken Swails and artists Justin Bintz, Alex Bond, and Darren Geers. While we'll be doing a separate Kickstarter for the full-fledged video game, you'll be able to get some really cool elements of the game and related material as we reach stretch goals in this Kickstarter.\nAdd-Ons\n$5 - Add an eBook copy of the original Icarus novel on which the graphic novel is based.\n\n$20 - Add one print copy of the Icarus graphic novel.

We feel that readers have the right to demand everything, that they shouldn\u2019t have to settle for one or the other. \nAthena\u2019s Daughters was born of that mindset. While we love our male science fiction and fantasy authors, we wanted, in this project, to provide a platform by which our female authors, artists, graphic designers, and editors could showcase their incredible talents. \nTo that end, Athena\u2019s Daughters is a project conceived, developed, and driven by women. All of the authors in this anthology are women, as are the artists, the graphic designer, and the editor. \nIn this anthology you will find authors you know and love like Mary Robinette Kowal, Gail Z. Martin, Cleolinda Jones, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Jean Rabe, Sherwood Smith, Janine K. Spendlove, Vicki Johnson-Steger, Cynthia Ward, and Jean Marie Ward and new and exciting talents like Maggie Allen, Conley Lyons, Doris Stever, and C.A. (Christine) Verstraete. \nWe're incredibly excited to have an introduction to the anthology by retired astronaut and Space Shuttle Commander Pam Melroy.\nAthena\u2019s Daughters is a collection of diverse and engaging science fiction and fantasy stories (clocking in right around 100,000 words with more to come when we reach our stretch goals!) with one unifying theme: all of the protagonists are strong women that exhibit a wide range of physical attributes and abilities. And by strong we don't necessarily mean physical strength (though we have those characters too), but ALL kinds of strength. The strength to stand up for what you know is right, the strength to make an unpopular decision, the strength to be a calming voice in a contentious situation. ALL forms of strength. \nWhile many of these stories feature central characters who fit the prototypical \u2018hero\u2019 mold, that does not hold across the board. You\u2019ll be entertained by a whole cast of female protagonists from your traditional \u2018good guy\u2019 to the villain you just love to hate (or even hate to love). \nIllustration by Autumn Frederickson for Athena's Daughters\nSilence in the Library believes strongly in the concept of bringing the artistry back to publishing. To that end, every anthology we produce features illustrations for each and every story. When we are putting an anthology together, we search for the right artist for the project. \nThis anthology carries on that tradition. And we\u2019ve been lucky enough to find two amazing artists who will be providing the illustrations for the stories in Athena\u2019s Daughters. \nAutumn Frederickson has been creating fantasy worlds since childhood.   In addition to commissioned art and conventions, Autumn still continues to work on a personal body of illustrations that draws from numerous mythological and fairytale sources as well as her own brand of humor. \nCheck out some of her amazing artwork:\nIllustration by Autumn Frederickson for Athena's Daughters\nillustration by Autumn Frederickson for Athena's Daughters\nBest known for her covers for Janine K. Spendlove\u2019s War of the Seasons Trilogy, Betsy Waddell\u2019s work brings an ethereal beauty to the project that helps the reader more fully connect with the emotional heart of the stories.  \nAs you will see when you take a look at the reward levels, Betsy and Autumn have graciously offered their original art as rewards for this Kickstarter. By contributing at the appropriate level, you can own an original piece of one of our stories. \nIn addition to illustrating the stories, we are offering this work in trade paperback and, if we reach the stretch goal, limited hard cover editions. \nWe have also developed some really exciting stretch goals, as you will see below. In particular, if we reach the initial goal of $8,500, our cover will be a very attractive graphic design cover (as seen above). If, however, we reach the $13,000 stretch goal, we will have a beautiful original art cover created by artist Tietjen Alvarez. \nHeres a some sample of Tietjen\u2019s work: \nWe also have an amazing artist, Bright Copper Penny, who has created one of her popular \"Penny Blossoms\" exclusively for Athena's Daughters . These beautiful hair accessories are a wonderfully subtle way of letting your geek flag fly no matter the setting. \nThe authors who have contributed to Athena\u2019s Daughters and the staff at Silence in the Library Publishing believe strongly that any good project should contribute something to improving the human community. We are pleased to announce that a portion of every book sold will go to RAINN. RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) is the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization. \nIn this project Silence in the Library continues its dedication to making the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work. To that end, as the Kickstarter makes more above the initial goal, the authors and artists will make more. \nTake a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the Athena\u2019s Daughters experience. \nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAfter you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live. Please be a part of the team, and travel with us on this incredible journey. \nUPDATE:\nWe've passed the $24,000 stretch goal, and that mean's we're producing a companion volume to Athena\u2019s Daughters titled Apollo\u2019s Daughters. This anthology features stories with female protagonists by some of the best male science fiction and fantasy authors in the business. We're really excited about the line-up of authors for this anthology. Aaron Allston, David Mack, John Jackson Miller, Michael A. Stackpole, Jim Bernheimer, Jamie Chambers, Ron Garner, Elias Pate, Aaron Rosenberg, Christopher Ruz, Neal Shaffer, Brian Shaw, Jon Skovron, Alan Smale, Jason Young, and Bryan Young have all signed on for the project. Artist Joe Corroney will create an original art cover of the anthology, and Brian Miller of Hi-Fi Color Design will provide the color. You can get Athena's Daughters bundled with the eBook or eBook and trade paperback of Apollo's Daughters at the $10, $45, and $60 levels, and the hard cover at the $75 level, or add it on to your existing reward level by adding $5 (eBook) $20 (eBook and trade paper back), or $35 (eBook and limited edition hard cover) to your pledge.\nThe introduction will be by Dr. John Mather, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work in confirming the Big Bang theory and NASA's Senior Project Scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope.\nSTRETCH GOALS: \nFIRST 100 BACKERS: *ACHIEVED* Okay, this one's not really a stretch goal.

As a member of Steven\u2019s writing group, I\u2019ve had the privilege of reading many of these pieces as they grew from nascent drafts through publication. In his stories, as in his life, Steven wants the weird, strange, even the horrifying, to be shot through with a thread of hope. Though the stories evolved across revisions, one constant was that his stories never lost their fundamentally optimistic undercurrents\u2013even the Sophie\u2019s choice of \"Broken.\" That doesn\u2019t mean Steven\u2019s work isn\u2019t darkly thought-provoking as in the alternate history of Sherman\u2019s march to the sea in \"The Burning Servant\" or off-beat, as with the love-struck zombies of \"Kicking the Habit\"\u2013it is. Yet without being preachy or saccharine, these stories manage to discomfit readers before ultimately leaving us a little more hopeful, a little more alive than before. At his desk, Steven has a sign that says \"get excited and make stuff.\" He does, and he has.\nWhat happens if we get full funding?\nOur initial goal is enough to pay everyone involved a professional rate. - the authors, the editor, and the cover artist - a professional rate.

In 2008, eighteen year old William Snell died in a single car accident. Will and Katie had a very special relationship, and both of them left a lasting imprint on the lives of everyone they touched.\nAs mentioned in the video, Will and Katie were very important to author Janine K. Spendlove, and their loss motivated her writing of War of the Seasons, Book 1: The Human. Driven by a desire to express her feelings of loss in a way that others could understand, Janine worked feverishly on the project until it\u2019s completion in 2011.\nThe result was a best-selling fantasy novel. The Human has all of the things that you expect from and love about fantasy: mythical creatures, adventure, magic, heroes, and villains. But it has something even more than that. It has heart.\nThe protagonist of The Human, Story, starts out as an angry teenager battered by the loss of loved ones. As is usually the case with this type of loss, in her anger she strikes out unreasonably against those who love her and want to help her. Through the course of an epic adventure in which Story finds herself thrust into a magical world she does not understand and wants to escape, and called upon to be the savior of that world, the reader gets to see her development from an angry, confused, lonely teenager to a human being who learns and grows from the loss she has experienced. \nStory is the type of strong character that all of us want to see in good fiction. Though she is young, her journey will appeal to youth and adults, men and women, boys and girls.\nThe War of the Seasons Trilogy brings us character development at it\u2019s finest. And it wraps that character development in a tale rich in adventure, magic, and a touch of romance.\nIn 2012, Janine Spendlove followed up The Human with the publication of War of the Seasons, Book 2: The Half-blood. \nThe second book in the series brings us a more mature and confident Story who has accepted and come to love the magical world of Ailionora. When evil threatens to destroy the life she has built and take the elf she has come to love, Story embarks on another exciting adventure. \nJanine has described The Half-Blood as her \"The Empire Strikes Back\", in that Story makes choices that reverberate through the rest of the trilogy, and she must ultimately deal with the consequences of those decisions.\nNow, Janine has completed the third and final book in the series, War of the Seasons, Book 3: The Hunter, and we\u2019re excited to be able to offer it in this Kickstarter. In The Hunter, Story must face an evil greater than any she's encountered before. As darkness looms over Ailionora, Story, her companions, and all of the races of Ailionora band together to fight for their very survival.\nBy day, Janine K. Spendlove is an officer and KC-130 pilot in the United States Marine Corps. The experience gained in her training and multiple combat tours shows through in the vivid combat scenes you will find throughout all three War of the Seasons books.\nEach of the novels in the War of the Seasons Trilogy has beautiful cover art by artist Betsy Waddell. There will be opportunities in the rewards section of this Kickstarter to have Betsy draw you as a mythical creature from the War of the Seasons. You could become an elf, a faerie, a dwarf, a gnome, a dryad, or a troll.\nMany of you have read the first and second books of the trilogy. Many of you have not read any of the books. That\u2019s okay! We have something for all of you. In the reward levels to the right, you\u2019ll find opportunities to get just the final book of the series, or all three books. For those of you who already have The Human, we also have an add-on for book two, The Halfblood, below. Please remember that at any level at which you get a print book, you also get the eBook version of that print book.\nBecause Will and Katie were so important to the creation of War of the Seasons, we wanted to do something to recognize them, the things they loved, and the impact they had on all of our lives. \nTo that end, we have created an exclusive Will and Katie patch that you will only be able to get at select reward levels as part of this Kickstarter. The patch features Will posing in Stormtrooper armor and Katie in Rebel uniform. We\u2019d like to thank talented artist Juan Jose Matamoros for developing the patch. As you can see below, it is pretty awesome, and captures the spirit of both Will and Katie: \nOur 501st and Rebel Legion friends out there who love to collect patches will already know the deal with these patches. For everyone else, this is a great chance to get into the excitement of patch collecting and to help keep alive the memory of Will and Katie. \nWill was an incredible artist, and a member of the 501st who loved wearing armor. A couple of years before his death, he created the poster you see below using a picture of himself in Stormtrooper armor. \nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will be offering a limited run of 11x17 prints of this poster created by Will. Of course, we expect that all of our 501st friends will love it, but we also think its appeal as art is more universal. \nAny funds from add-ons involving Will and Katie will be used in a responsible philanthropic manner, and will not be taken as profit from this project. \nTake a look at our stretch goals below. We have some amazing authors lined up to create short stories in the War of the Seasons universe. Authors you know and love, like Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston. Rising stars you'll recognize from multiple genres like Bryan Young. And writers you know from other venues, like Cleolinda Jones, Albin Johnson, and Maggie Allen. Artist Betsy Waddell is standing by to create illustrations for each of those stories. If we hit those stretch goals, everyone at the $5 and above level will receive electronic copies of all of the short stories at no additional cost. After the Kickstarter is over, we will bundle the stories together with some of Janine\u2019s short stories and publish them as a print anthology. \nThose of you who have contributed to our recent Kickstarters for Time Traveled Tales and A Children\u2019s Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination will know that we have a few general goals here at Silence in the Library. \nFirst, we want to bring to market books that we love and that perhaps might not make it to market through the standard publishing process. We like books that are quirky, that don\u2019t fit in an easily defined categories, but that entertain, edify and touch us in important ways. Janine K. Spendlove\u2019s War of the Seasons Trilogy easily fits that definition. Her exploration of the subject of loss and growth amid adventure and danger harkens back to some of the greatest works of the fantasy genre. \nSecond, we seek to make authors more fully partners in the publishing process. We want the original creative drivers who came up with the stories we love to be fully involved in the creative process all the way through to publication, and we want them to more evenly share in the financial rewards of their work. To that end, Janine K. Spendlove was intimately involved in the cover design for this book, as well as layout and editing processes. Further, she will be running this Kickstarter once it is launched. When you get an update, it will come from Janine. When you post a comment or ask a question, responses will come from Janine. And, Janine\u2019s contract with Silence in the Library ensures that she receives the lion\u2019s share of any profits made from the sale of her book. While it is important for Silence in the Library to make a profit to continue operation, it is equally important to make sure that good authors can make a living off of their work so that all of us can continue to enjoy it. \nThird, and finally, we want to continue to use Kickstarter as a funding platform for our projects because we believe that it gives you, the reader, the most direct control over the process possible. Publishing is a relationship between reader, author, and publisher. We believe that this relationship should be viewed by publishing companies as an equal partnership in which all parties get a say in the final product. Kickstarter allows us to make this type of relationship a reality. \nI know I\u2019ve said it before, but we\u2019re really excited about this project. We\u2019ve got a great trilogy of books, some really cool extras, and amazing authors lined up to write short stories that we want to read. We hope you\u2019ll join us in this journey, and help us bring these stories to life. \nSTRETCH GOALS\n$3500 - UNLOCKED - Each backer at or above $5 gets a free copy of the eBook of Bryan Young's Operation Montauk.

It's about people  and a love of what they enjoy. It is about every person that ever picked up a comic book, or watched a western or enjoyed a good yarn be it fantasy noir or sci-fi. It's about making people smile and making happy. Mead is a drink of legend and fantasy but real something you can experience and taste. \nWe already have a growing fan base up and down the east coast from bringing our samples to the Steampunk and SCI Fi/ Fantasy conventions. \nWe are one of the if not first themed meaderies. Our theme is a Steam Punk ascetic. \nWhat is mead?  \nIt has been described as nectar of the gods. It is the origin of the word Honeymoon, Simply it is honey and water fermented. It can be dry or sweet depending on your taste.\nWe specialize in two types of mead Methoglins (Herbal infused blends) and Melomels (fruit infused mead)\nOur Mead\nHere are some examples of what we have produced and will continue to produce. We will always look to expand our lines as we grow and have several new recipes that we will introduce as we grow. \nThis is early bottle of what would become Freya sent by a fan who wanted to introduce her friends to Mead. (She said it also went excellent with the cheese which she neglected to tell me what it was. Her description was \"This was effing delicious.\")  \nEarly label and Name.\nThe next one is our 21 a Ginger Cinnamon Blend\n21 Because you've waited long enough\nHere is our mead on display at a tasting we hosted. \n21 our Ginger Cinnamon, Freya a Chamomile blend, Black powder with a touch of Black Pepper and other spices. Odin St\u00f6k fully Fermented Buckwheat honey Mead. \nSo much deliciousness!\nMead isn't just for drinking!\nThat's right you can use it for cooking!\nMead Marinated Chops with Mead cheese Sauce & Shells\nBeef in And Chicken in a seasoned Mead sauce and Rice with Mead added during the cooking.\nCurrently we are also working on Cheese Cake Made with our 21 mead a ginger cinnamon Mead Cheese cake. That sets my mouth to water just thinking about it. \nThere are so many things you can cook using our mead many of the herbal blends work very well with many dishes. The Melomels can make excellent deserts and can compliment many types of meat. Yes you can even use it in vegetarian dishes. \nOne thing on our agenda is when we get to a certain point we are looking to produce a Kosher mead to expand it's cooking potential. \nWho are the Miracle Mead Men?\nJon,Jason, and Darkan are the face of the Miracle meadery those three strapping lads in the video. We travel around to spread the word about our mead at conventions, that go along with our Steampunk theme as well as other genres we like. \nMore then Mead a whole universe is what your helping build!\nWe have created a fictional universe to play in where we will be  featured in books, comics, song, and eventually video. \nOur fictionalized selves are a major plot twist in a new novel. \nThe Red Caps Queen by \n\u2014Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Award-winning author and editor of the Bad-Ass Faeries Anthologies\nWe have also been approached to help produce an Anthology of the fictionalized adventures of the Miracle Mead Men. \nWho Likes our Mead?\n Well lets take a look shall we? \nProfessor Phil Foglio\nYes the good professor and his lovely wife Kaja like our mead. \nSo much he did this for us \nDOT'S GOOT SCHTUFF!\nIt's a Sparky kind of thing!\nWhat this is for? \nWe are raising the funds for the home stretch covering all of the state and federal requirements to operate Meadery in our home state and more importantly having the ability to ship when all is said and done. \nWhat do you get? \nBesides all the great stuff to the right. \n* You get to be part of history, Mead is making a come back in a big way and our efforts and efforts of those like us will make it happen. \n* You are supporting small business making something that can grow and help employ people. \n * You get to help create something that hasn't been done this way before. \n* With your help we will raise awareness of the plight of the honey Bee and how seriousness the problems that can cause. \nOk I think this fits in this section here is the mock up of the Minion patch. \nOrignial Minion Patch\nThe Digital Wanted posters\nThis is a fine looking crew of Reprobates.\nThese will be full size 8.5 x 11 digital images. \nThe fantasy book we are currently in and part of our reward tiers\nby Danielle Ackley-Mcphail yes we are in it.\n\n\nStretch Goals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom the events we've hosted there is a huge demand already for our product. One of the biggest challenges we will face is keeping up with that demand and future demand. This is something we have considered from the outset. We have a clear plan on how to upscale and produce to meet that demand within 2 years or sooner depending on the level of funding. Our brewing methods allow for a relatively short turn around time without a loss of quality. \nWe also use a local wholesale honey distributor so we can scale up to demand with access to raw ingredients, this includes bottling and labels. Each one of our stretch goals that we meet we have a business plan in place to optimize our funding to use it to grow and expand. \nFor distribution we have been working on a variety of venues that are all ready to carry our product once we have the capacity.\nOn the themed side we have to keep the stories interesting we are working with artists and writers to continue to expand our fictional adventures and also help promote our product. \nWe know the delays that we will face for label approval before we can ship. We have taken this into account by making sure we have the proper legal help to minimize any delays from production to retail. We will also make sure that we have the ability to stock our mead so as soon as we have label approval we get the labels get them on the bottles and into the hands of people that love our product.
