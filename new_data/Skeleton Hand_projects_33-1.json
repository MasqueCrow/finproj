Do you love affirmation decks, inspirational quotes, and motivational sayings to help get your through your day? Are you looking for a coach to walk you through your goals and next steps?  \nIf so, then we created this deck for you. This deck is a passion project from coaches Heather Vickery and Rachel Swanson. Together we have spent a year designing and developing this manifestation deck, all with the goal of give you the tools you need to source your next steps in life and career. \nThe Deck:\n48 Cards printed on luxuriously thick 400 GSM card stock\nCards finished with soft matte lamination and colored (or glitter) edges. (See stretch goals!)\nBeautifully designed box with a lid.\nPaper guidebook that fits inside the box \nAbout the Deck:\nOur goal was to design a deck that was like having two coaches in your corner. Heather is in the business of BRAVE, helping people find their most courageous and brave paths. Rachel is in the business of CREATIVITY, helping people build lives that engage their creative spark. Together, we want to help you CREATE BRAVE. \nThis deck has 48 cards. Each card has a different word and image that you can use to guide your work for the day or week. Under the word there is a phrase that you can use as encouragement as you live into the message of the card. \nIncluded in the deck is a guidebook. The guidebook will give practical support and ideas as you live your creatively brave life. Each card will have a description, ideas for next steps, and a question to use as a prompt for journaling and reflection. \nThe card artwork is beautiful, abstract enough to let you make your own associations with the words on the cards. \nHere are the cards: \nUsing the Deck: \nYou can use the deck in many ways! Here are a few of our ideas: \nDraw a card each day to use as a frame to guide your day\nLook through the deck and choose the card that most resonates with you and reflect on how that idea is showing up in your life\nLeave a card on your desk as a conversation starter with colleagues or clients\nChoose a card each day as a journaling prompt\nRead the guidebook cover to cover and make a collage out of the cards.

It's published in 4 flavours to help you filter out the stuff that doesn't interest you much and leave you with the stuff that does.\n4 great flavours\nThe magazine is a great resource for everyone involved with games on Kickstarter, whether you are a potential backer, a media bod or a project creator. You really have to see the magazine to understand how helpful it is.\nThe archives go back to August 2020\nThe Bulletin was launched in August this year, and since then I have had an overwhelming amount of praise from people including project creators and super-backers. Despite this, not many people have even heard of it.\n\nIt's going to take time for the magazine to build some traction and the word to spread, but based on the 100% positive and frequent feedback I'm receiving each week, this magazine is useful and wanted. \n\nSo now I'm asking for your help to keep the magazine going into 2021. If I can raise just a small amount I can keep on putting the work into producing the magazine each week. \n\nIf we make the funding goal I will publish future issues and the back catalogue to DriveThru RPG as PWYW (Pay What You Want) which means you can still get it for free.\nI figure people may find this easier than bookmarking the website.\nAvailable as an A4 Wall Calendar or an A5 Desk Calendar\nAs a little thank you I am producing a 2021 Kickstarter Bulletin calendar. Each month will display a selection of project images from the same month in 2020 as a reminder of just how much stuff is going on every month on Kickstarter.\nYou can choose an A4 Wall Calendar or an A5 Desk Calendar, or just make a donation to support the project. Whichever choice you make will contribute about \u00a310 to help fund the magazine into 2021.\n\nIf you haven't seen the magazine, scroll down to read more and find out why this is worth supporting.\nProbably the greatest Kickstarter games resource in the world, probably.\nEach week The Bulletin collects the crucial information for every project launched on Kickstarter in the Games category (or one of it's sub-categories).\n\nA new category is assigned to each project to allow us to group similar things together.\nThe results are split into 4 magazines with projects going into the most logical fit and some projects going into more than one magazine.\n\nMore than 600 games projects are launched each month, now we can browse them like we would in a shop or a catalogue.\nThe content page from the RPG Bulletin\nAs the Contents page shows, The Bulletin gives us an awesome overview of the projects which might interest us and are Live right now.\nAn example of a Live Project listing\nThe clear, concise project listings, along with the categorisation help you to skip sections, skim others and zero-in on the stuff that really interests you, making the whole experience quicker and more enjoyable.\nAn example Upcoming Project listing\nThe Live and Upcoming listings include links to to the project on Kickstarter, so if you see something that interests you, just click to visit the project.\n\nA 2-page spread from the Video Games Bulletin\nLive projects are collected up to midnight on Monday\nThe magazines are published to the website early on Tuesday morning (usually by 6am GMT).\n All magazines are available for free download from the website,\nThe archive goes back to the 3rd of August 2020.\nThe Kickstarter Bulletin is\ngood for creators,\ngood for backers,\ngood for Kickstarter,\ngood for everybody,\nand it's free.\nWhy is this worth supporting?\nBy making a donation you help to support the production of the magazine and ensure it keeps going as a free resource into 2021.\n\nI first started to compile Kickstarter data for my own research into miniature projects. I realised straight away that this data could be enormously helpful to others in the community. Over the last year I have streamlined the data collection process and refined the publications to produce The Kickstarter Bulletin.\n\nI believe The Bulletin is an invaluable resource to the whole gamer community on Kickstarter (which is a significant portion of Kickstarter as a whole).

A serendipitous find was in the person who felt that they were not creative.  Whenever he wrote a simple prompt, apologetically because he felt he was not creative, those turned out to be incredibly funny and garnered the most laughs.  It's a great game with a simple learning curve.\"   - Dr. Andrew W.     Rating: 10 / 10\n\"A varied game of humor and creativity. Great for any group, easy to setup and highly replayable.\"  - Jacob B.     Rating: 8 / 10\n\"This game is hilarious. It is as family appropriate and/or raunchy as you want it to be. You create the scenarios as you play. Switchuations is a must-have for every family game room and house party.\"  - Scott H.     Rating: 10 / 10\n\"Some of the most original laughs I have ever had!

If they can survive this automatically-advancing onslaught, then they win as a team.\nEach player controls one hero. Each hero represents a different theme: chaos, order, harmony, or discipline. Their hero choice decides their starting deck of cards. Each different theme has a different playstyle, but also informs what future cards they can add to their deck.  \nAcross from the party line-up is the deadly dungeon itself. Whenever a card is removed from the dungeon, be it by killing a monster, the dungeon automatically shifts towards the players. This  game is incredibly fast-paced: no moving, exploring, or down-time.

Miniatures come unpainted.\nAltar Quest is a cooperative game of fantasy adventure inspired by the classic dungeon crawling board games that many of us grew up with. Using the Modular Deck System (MDS), introduced in Street Masters and Brook City, the game features incredibly modular gameplay using several different types of decks. Hero decks, threat decks, villain decks, and quest decks can all be mixed and matched along with altar cards, feature cards, and other game elements to create countless combinations of unique adventures. With an engaging one-off experience and narrative campaign play, Altar Quest offers players endless adventure in a unique fantasy setting with years of support planned for the game.\nWhether playing an individual quest or part of a campaign, each quest is made up of a combination of several different decks and other game elements. Heroes must complete the goal set out by the chosen quest deck in order to win the game. They must overcome several obstacles during the quest determined by the chosen threat deck and villain deck, as well as the deck of lurker cards. If any hero is defeated, the heroes lose the game.\nAll Original Fantasy Setting\nAltar Quest takes place mainly in a realm called Aridika\u2014a land of high fantasy and Gothic horror. As players dive deeper into the game, they\u2019ll learn about the deep lore and many mysteries that hide within the shadows of Aridika and the world of Rhuna. Designers Adam & Brady Sadler have been developing the world of Rhuna since their early days of playing Dungeons & Dragons, and are excited to share it and expand it with Altar Quest.\nAltars\nThe world of Rhuna was created by powers called \u201crhunes\u201d\u2014godlike essences that came together to create all existence. Mortals were never intended to wield the untempered powers of rhunes, so they were crystallized deep within the earth to keep the lands above in balance. Unfortunately, evil finds a way, and deep below Aridika where the lich queen Szera slumbers, the rhunestones have been corrupted and forced to the surface. These altars are worshipped by power-hungry opportunists that use the rhunic energies surrounding them to further their own nefarious plans\u2026 \nDuring each quest, the chosen altar card will constantly affect the state of the altar pool. The altar pool is made up of 5 altar dice that are rolled at the start of the quest. Each altar die has 6 unique sides, each one containing a rhune symbol. These rhunes are used by the heroes, as well as the enemies, to trigger special effects. After an effect is triggered by a rhune symbol, the altar die showing that symbol is rolled and the new symbol is added to the altar pool. Players will have to balance using their rhune effects with making sure they aren\u2019t empowering the enemy too much.\nIncredibly Modular\nFeaturing the versatile Modular Deck System (MDS) that the Sadlers first introduced with Street Masters, the variability of Altar Quest is one of its key features. Players will have a world to explore by mixing hero decks, villain decks, threat decks, and quest decks with fluctuating feature decks to keep the environments fresh. Players can create their ideal game scenarios by matching up decks of their choice, or leave it to fate and embark on a randomized quest!\nTruly Solo, Truly Cooperative\nAltar Quest features an elegant player scaling solution built into the core design of the game, which means one player can play the game as easily as up to four, with no exceptions or special rules. \nThree Great Ways to Play\nWhile Altar Quest is designed to be a satisfying one-off adventure, players can also embark on an epic campaign by linking their quests together, earning upgraded cards for their decks, finding new equipment, and facing new challenges with enemy upgrades. Additionally, stories allow players to explore the vibrant setting of Aridika by playing through a story deck using the campaign rules.\nFor more information on the add-ons, click here.\nShow your support for Altar Quest by donning one of many avatars available here: https://www.blacklistgamesllc.com/altarquest\nShipping Info \nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping varies from region to region and doing so will allow us to provide more stretch goals for you during the campaign!\nDepending on what region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers),  Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world). \nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates and costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional buys you get.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below). \nASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $25-$35 to Australia and New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries (see below).  \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter. \nTHE LOOMING TARIFFS: We have spoken to our factory and shipping logistic reps and until anything officially changes, nothing will change or affect us cost-wise. If things do start having a financial impact, Blacklist Games, LLC will be absorbing what we can, so we can keep overall costs and shipping as familiar to what you're normally used to with our campaigns. If there are any increases at all, it will be minimal and only be set by any fulfillment costs outside of our control, since we do not intend to randomly up-charge our products for the sake of doing so.\nPOST PLEDGE MANAGER NOTICE: Any pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs since it would be out of our normal fulfillment cycle. For non-US backers that will likely incur import taxes as well. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally due to the size of each package and the risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nRefund Policy\nWe can refund you within 2 weeks (14 days) of the campaign\u2019s end date, fees included. All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. After that, we will accept returns minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot get back from them) up until our pledge manager is closed. At that point, refunds will no longer be possible. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.

They may play these goblins in their Encampments however they like. (1 / 3, 2/2, 4/0). Players may also purchase upgrades at this time.\nMovement Phase: Starting with the player with the King's Ear, all players in turn order move their goblins one hex toward the castle. If the goblins are next to a castle unit at the beginning of the movement phase they will not move. At the end of each player's turn if that player has a goblin next to a castle unit, count the total number of goblins surrounding it. If the number meets or exceeds the goblin icon number on a castle unit, that unit is destroyed and that player gets a stone.\nCastle Phase: The player with the King's Ear flips the top card of the Castle deck and takes whatever action is shown. (For instance, if they flip a Castle Unit, they would put a Castle Unit hex into play.) Then starting with the player with the King's Ear, players may purchase castle cards with stones that they may play or hold in their hands. Each castle card costs +1 stone for a player to buy, so the first player to buy a card costs 1 stone, the next costs 2 stones, until all players pass.\nConflict Phase: In the conflict phase, the castle will kill 1 goblin in each hex adjacent to it. All castle units will also kill goblins based on their attack regions and range. (See above, the archer kills 2 goblins in each hex in a straight line of 5 hexes. The knight kills 2 goblins in each hex adjacent to it in a 3 region arc.)\nVictory: At the end of your movement, if you have at least 1 goblin next to the castle, and there are  5x the number of players in goblins surrounding the castle, the castle is destroyed. (If there are 3 players and I have 5 goblins next to the castle at the end of my movement, and the other players have 10 or more, we have hit the victory condition of 15 and I win because I was the last player to end my movement phase at the target number.)\n\"The game is an enjoyable Experience.

We were afraid too BUT we took that fear and decided to do something about it!\nFor anyone who may have missed it, the US has proposed a new tariff/tax on toys coming from China of up to 25%. That means companies could have to pay up to 25% on the manufacturing cost (not the MSRP or KS pledge price) to have the games released from US customs. \nWe discussed and debated this new challenge thoroughly and have come up with a plan to move forward.\nVesuvius Media  is making a commitment to absorb the cost of up to 25% new US tariffs that may be implemented following this Kickstarter campaign. Each company must do what is right for their specific circumstances, and we are making this right for us.\nVesuvius Media is a small game development company. Make no mistake, if the tariffs go into effect, they will eat into any profits we hope to make; BUT we are committed to our community of players, we are grateful for your continued support, and we want to keep our games as accessible as possible.\nDue to our collaboration with VFI we will also be able to provide \"Brazil - Friendly\" shipping! This means that there will be no extra customs charges to receive your game!\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping of the basic pledge. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional add-ons you choose. All prices are listed in US dollars.\nHawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other remote states are not part of the \"US\" category. They are included in the \"Rest of the world\" one.\nPlease note, the core game and stretch goals will be in separate game boxes. We expect the shipping box will be 29 cm x 29 cm x 16 cm.

This means that if you backed us only in one campaign, even if you added all three games in a bundle, you will receive $5 credit. We do this to be fair to backers who have paid more shipping costs by supporting us in multiple campaigns.\nIf you have Loyalty Credit from previous campaigns and choose not to use it in this one, then you will have an additional $5 for the next one.\nTo be eligible for the Loyalty credit, you must pledge for a reward during this campaign. Late-pledges and pledges of $1 will not qualify for any type of Loyalty credit (credit from past campaigns or credit for future campaigns).\nVesuvius Media is a small (but mighty!), Canadian, indie development company. Starting off by producing online strategy games, Vesuvius Media has branched into new areas of production and currently boasts online games, mobile games, graphic novels and board games in its portfolio.\nWhat makes Vesuvius Media different from all the other companies? Vesuvius Media is community-driven. Whether online or on the table, its game designers and developers interact with players, listen, debate, and continually gather feedback.

We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\n\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nWhen this campaign is over, you will be requested to complete a survey in our pledge manager through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order.

Big Bad Con has become a transformative event that connects people together and builds communities while ensuring that we hold space for folks from marginalized groups and amplify their voices.\nThis year, we realized that this goal required a more direct effort. We partnered with DC, who launched the Babble On Equity Project as a separate fundraising effort to bring more people of color to Big Bad Con. BEOP was amazingly successful! In just two days, it had surpassed its funding goal, and will be able to bring over 30 people to Big Bad Con.

Play as Runika and her friends as you collect elemental dice, solve puzzles and cast spells!\n Winning depends on strategy, not luck. Dice rolls give you interesting choices, rather than punishing you. Clever use of your dice will determine whether you win or not.\n Cool rotating boards and spatial puzzles. Create runes on a 4x4 spell grid surrounded by a rotating elemental disk. Use the disk to correctly position your elemental dice and match the patterns on the rune cards to earn points and powers.\n Interaction without player hate. Compete for the favour of your professors and to be the first to solve each rune. Player interaction comes from drafting the right dice and occupying worker-placement slots instead of attacking your friends.\n* Due to the unreliable nature of some postal systems, I had to increase shipping to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. I'm really sorry about this. :(\nOr let Meeple University lead you through the game (using Lucidity dice as prototypes):\nWhether you'd like to try the game before you buy it, or you've backed Day One and can't wait for Runika to be delivered, we've put together a couple ways for you to play right now. \nTo play Runika right now, you can use:\n Tabletopia: By clicking here, you can play in your browser with your friends, totally free. You don't even need to sign up!\n Lucidity: Six-sided Nightmares: You can use the dice from our last game, Lucidity, to play a print-and-play version of Runika here. Runika's final dice will have different symbols, but this print-and-play allows you to use the ones from Lucidity in their place. Or use this set and about 480 stickers to make your own dice!\n Substituting cards for dice: The print-and-play here allows you to use generic pipped dice to play. It takes up a lot of table space because it replaces 12mm dice with 68mm cards, but it should give you a good sense for the gameplay.\n Solo mode: You can also check out our draft solo mode rules here.\nDuring the campaign, we ran an online narrative for backers to vote on! This story gives you the chance to decide the fate of Runika and her friends.\nTo begin with the prologue, click here. \n\n\n\n Social Media Avatars\nYou can use these banners on Kickstarter, Instagram, Facebook or Twitter to show your support for Runika. They have been designed to fit within a cropped circle (eg on Kickstarter and Instagram). \nTo use one on Kickstarter, click on it to go to the enlarged file, right click to save that image to your computer, click on the bubble in the top right corner of your Kickstarter page and go to Settings > Edit profile. You can upload the avatar to there from your computer (look under \"Picture\").", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second campaign, and so while some of the risks and challenges are the same, I am better informed this time around!\n\nHow much is shipping?\n\nIf you scroll up in the campaign, you should find a list of shipping options. I've subsidised most of the options, and given free shipping to the major Kickstarter backing countries, where there are hubs available that reduce shipping costs.\n\n\"Why is this in AUD?\":\n\nAs I live in Australia, my campaigns must use Australian dollars (AUD). You might know it better as \"monopoly money\". Exchange rates are always going up and down, and I have added a buffer to accommodate for currency fluctuations over the course of the campaign. After the campaign concludes, I will convert the AUD to the various currencies they need to be (USD and GBP mostly). That should cover any further risk, short of Australia becoming a dystopic, Mad Maxian world and abandoning plastic money in favour of gasoline and water.\n\nShipping:\n\nThings can always happen: ships sink or disappear completely; packages get stuck in customs, only to wash up on lost islands (or in purgatory?) years later; and variations in seasonal freight pricing can lead to drastic increases in shipping costs. I will be ordering excess stock in order to cover lost packages, and there is a buffer in the goal for any increases in shipping.\n\nA note on shipping to certain countries:\n\nWhile I have made every effort in the past to make sure every backer got their game, sometimes it doesn't happen and I've needed to refund a pledge. I've found this to be the case in countries such as Argentina and Brazil. Because I lost so much money posting to South America in the last campaign, I have to increase the shipping costs to these countries. This also does not cover import tariffs, which are your responsibility, sorry! While I feel terrible to have to do this, I'm just one person and I can't afford to cover the local tariffs that exist in some countries, or account for packages going missing in dodgy postal systems. Rather than exclude shipping to these countries, I've left it available, but with shipping rates reflecting the reality of the situation.

But not any miniatures. Our expert team of Gnome Wizards work tirelessly to bring the most customizable and powerful figures for your character. Our sleek, seamless, flash-less miniatures are unrivaled in appearance and each is blessed by a team of Clerics. \n    Can\u2019t find the perfect miniature for your Dwarven Fighter?  \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Are the only miniatures available carrying a broadsword instead of a warhammer? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Is the figure\u2019s beard too short for your perfect avatar? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Through dark and forbidden rituals, we have given you, the player, the ability to select everything about your character. Complete customization is now in the hands of the player. Whatever hands, head, tail, wings, clothes, weapons, and practically anything else you can think of, we can do. Even the most mundane of coin purses will look amazing on your character \u2013 through our high-quality 3D printing.  \n This project combines everything you want from a miniature - the original creative art, with the best quality that can be found for a customized unique printed miniatures.\n*Warning: Miniatures may contain bonus Experience Points \n     The Eldritch Foundry has partnered with the leading US 3D printer manufacturer, 3DSystems, and our in-house printers utilize the most advanced technology available on the market. As such, we are printing at a quality that is substantially higher than anyone else. We print at about 40% higher definition than anyone else on the market.\nMost miniatures currently available on the market are printed at around 50 microns. An Eldritch Foundry miniature is printed at around 32 microns. In addition, we use wax supports. This process means your miniatures will have no flash, no mold lines, and no seams. \n       Our character creator interface is like nothing you\u2019ve seen before, except perhaps in video games. We have developed a one-of-a-kind character creator to a look and feel that closely resembles the character creators in Baldur\u2019s Gate, Planescape, Torment, or even Skyrim (well, at least the starting bit). The interface is intuitive and easy to use, while providing for a maximum level of customization for your miniature.\n    Each and every character choice, from race and class, to armor and weapons, has a unique lore associated with it. We have partnered with several brilliant writers (most notably- the amazing Patrick Stuart!) to create a lore that is as unique as our character creator. \n    This process, from the unique character creator to the expansive and in-depth lore,  makes creating a high quality and custom miniature more immersive and helps create a world-building experience.\n       We have developed the first and only conditional marker base for your miniatures. This base allows for the quick and easy identification of conditional statuses of your character, without the need for conditional rings or milk jug rings. The conditions available on your unique Eldritch Foundry miniature base include poisoned, restrained, concentration, deafened, petrified, grappled, blinded, and frightened. We have even provided conditional marker bases that are blank, if you prefer to draw your own. We\u2019ll even have an option where you can choose which conditions you want on your base (but that\u2019s a bit more down the line).\n      In order to bring you the finest quality miniatures, every piece is first individually drawn by gentle hands of our Tiefling concept artists. Then, these sketches are animated, given sentience, and turned into 3-dimensional models.  Our miniatures are then crafted from these models by an expert team of Gnome Wizards. This process is designed to bring you the highest-quality, unique, and magically enchanted miniatures possible. \n      To bring you more, we must first provide offerings to the lords of darkness and miniatures, who enslave hapless concept artists for no less than 99 years. These concept artists provide us with all the exquisite art, in order to bring the most realistic and beautifully rendered miniatures to you, the player.  Through this project we intend to bring you more items, races, mounts, perhaps a campaign setting, and even a little thing we think of as \"the bits box\".\n       The Eldritch Foundry's founders are gamers, like you. We would like to let gamers take their character from the imaginary and make them a reality. To provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of the model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing quality available. More than that, table-top gaming is a community experience.

We are committed to improving your games. And we are enthusiastic about our mission.\nThe Eldritch Foundry loves the TTRPG community- and acts on it with a business model that is geared towards helping your local gaming store thrive. We incentivize foot traffic by offering free shipping if you send your avatar to your local gaming store. We share in every miniature sale made within store grounds, and for every miniature sent to stores.\nRetailers- feel free to reach out, we'd love to discuss this in person!\nOur partner FLGS, Knight's Watch Games:\n  \"Eldritch Foundry is a revolutionary company that bridges the gap between producers, retailers and customers.  The ability for a customer to design, purchase and pick-up their customized miniature at the brick and mortar store facilitates better relationships between buyer and seller, guarantees a better shopping experience, and higher customer satisfaction. The immersive process of personalizing a character and reading the powerful descriptions for the various options makes building your dream character super entertaining!\" - Brenda and Paraic Mulgrew of Knight's Watch Games\nThe Eldritch Foundry is a firm believer that the TTRPG community is just that- a community. We strive to work with everybody- from stores, to local artists, to gaming streams, and beyond. As such, we've begun partnering with the D4 D&D stream (go check them out!) to provide their gaming miniatures.\nWe've also started working with artists from the community which we love- first and foremost- the Griffon's Saddlebag (you can see his Retaliating Shield on some of our minis, even!).\n      Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nUS shipping (to your local gaming store)- FREE!\nRest of the world - shipping will cost $10.\n What is the Eldritch Foundry?\n      We are two friends, who quit our day jobs, and founded Eldritch Foundry. We provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of your miniature\u2019s model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing technology available. This process will give your miniatures a sleek, seamless, flash-less appearance not available in any other product on the market.\nHow do the miniature coupons work?\n      All rewards for \u201ccustom miniature coupon(s)\u201d are presented as coupons, and as such, are good indefinitely. This allows you to redeem at any point and even for future releases and features.  \nWhen will the Miniatures Ship?\n      Tricky question! Our full Character Foundry will be up and running August 1st, when we debut at Gen Con. We are currently gunning for a weeks turnaround (1-2 days to print, 3-6 days of shipping in the US), but a two week turnaround is a bit more likely (especially if we have a huge backlog). \nIt should be noted that we will be adding more and more items, races, weapons and\u2026 stuff(?) as time progress, so if you have a specific idea for your mini, look up our development schedule on our site!\nWhat about international shipping?\n      Shipping to the US is free of charge. Shipping to Western Europe is going to add about 10$ on top of your pledge level.\nHow do I select more than one pledge goal?\n     In Kickstarter you can only really select one pledge goal, but no worries. If none of the pledge levels are just right, pick the one closest to what you want, and you can adjust upwards later in our backer kit. \nRetailers - What are the typical cost of an Eldritch Foundry miniature in a retail store?\n      Our current pricing point for a single miniature is about MSRP 35$. The conditional marker base should add another 10$ on top of that. Oversized models will run you about 10$ extra. \nWe\u2019re still looking into \u201cbits\u201d pricing and quantities, so that\u2019s a big WIP right now.\n     New to Kickstarter? No problem! Just follow these simple steps: \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) Development challenges\n\n We have been accepted as exhibitors at Gen Con 2019. As such, we have a hard deadline to have our character creator site up and running by August 2019. With this in mind, our current plan is to launch as soon as possible, with various additional features being introduced later on in the development phase. These additional features, which are being considered non-essential for initial launch, are thus marked down as a phase 2. For example, these additional features consist of features like \u201cbits\u201d purchasing and social media sharing with cool filters are lower on our priority list.\n In all regards, development of the product is largely complete with high-quality highly detailed miniatures. This project is intended to raise capital in financially reasonable way.\n\n\n2) Asset creation:\n\n Our asset creation timeline is very much dependent on how successful the Kickstarter campaign is. Our current funding is enough to let us reach Gen Con 2019 with an already assembled asset library of high Fantasy weapon and armor sets, and the base races of Humans, Elves (& half-Elves), Dwarves, Goliaths and Halflings.\n The greater our success, the faster we hope to add additional assets and features to the system. However, there is an upper limit to how fast we can add additional assets, while still maintaining a high-quality of production. We will have a production schedule posted on our home website once we see how far ahead, we are. This will allow Eldritch Foundry fans to come and see new products and plan ahead for when their favorite race and genres come online.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "",

You'll command one of Earth's six most advanced space agencies, racing to deploy Telescopes, Payloads, and your fleet of Spacecraft (Orbiters, Landers, and Shuttles) to discover, orbit, and land on worlds before your competitors.\nMake shrewd decisions about how to spend your research budget, strategize how best to deploy your fleet, and be the first to discover what's really out there!  In Brave New Worlds, you can explore every single world ever visited up close by spacecraft.  That means you can send orbiters to Jupiter, land rovers on Hyperion, or set foot on the rocky surface of Ceres - if it exists out there, it's represented in here.\nHumanity is counting on you to lead your space agency to glory - are you up to the challenge?\n  We're packing a ton of stuff in the Brave New Worlds box!  Over 100 punch-out tiles allow you to build a massive game board for up to 6 players, or a smaller one for shorter games with 2-4 players. You can start with a level playing field (symmetric starting conditions for all players), or try playing with the Advanced Rules, which give every space agency unique, asymmetric abilities inspired by their real-life counterparts (like moon-landing bonuses for the Americans, giant telescopes for the Europeans, and Solar Sailing capabilities for the Japanese). And in every game box you'll get a beautifully-illustrated companion book, packed with real science, describing every world you'll visit.\nHere's everything you'll get by backing at the \"Discoverer\" level, all laid out:\nThis gif shows a shorter preview version of the companion book. The version included with Brave New Worlds will be about twice as long. To read this preview version of the book, click on the image above!\n    Plus all unlocked stretch goals! \nYou can check out a preliminary version of the rulebook in PDF form by clicking right here. (Note that these rules and their presentation may be tweaked a bit as the campaign progresses with feedback from backers.) For an overview of the structure of gameplay in Brave New Worlds, check out the section below!\nThe Playing Surface of Brave New Worlds is divided into 4 regions of randomized tiles, and can be made smaller or larger depending on the number of players:  \n\nEach round, players receive a set budget of 6 Tokens which can be distributed among three different technologies: \n\nAfter collecting income, players take turns performing different actions:\n SURVEY: Dropping a telescope on a tile allows you to learn its identity before any other player. But this secret knowledge is only temporary - after one round, all white telescopes flip to black. After two rounds the black telescopes are removed, and the tile is flipped for all players to see.  \n MANEUVER: After dropping telescopes, players can choose to launch spacecraft, move across the placing surface, and land on worlds.  Points are earned by bringing Payloads to the worlds you\u2019ll visit.\nAt the end of each turn comes SCORING.  Every tile possesses symbols which indicate how many points can be earned for different kinds of missions:  \nWhich worlds should you target for exploration?  You'll get more points for discovering worlds farther from Earth, but fueling up your spacecraft to reach them can be expensive.\nCareful, though - you\u2019re not alone in trying to pry secrets from these worlds!  If another player sends a more complex spacecraft, or one carrying more Payloads, they can knock you from your spot on that world!\n\nAt the end of each turn, players advance their marker along the score track. The first player to reach 100 points wins!\nAdvanced Play - Unique Abilities For Different Space Agencies!\nIn Brave New Worlds, you can choose to play with either Basic or Advanced rules. In the Basic version, every player starts with the same abilities, and the playing field is even. In the Advanced version, each space agency possesses unique abilities informed by the historical successes of their real-life counterparts:\nFor a more detailed description of these special abilities, and the real science that inspired them, check out pages 20-26 of the rulebook by clicking on the gif below:\nTo read these rules for Advanced Play (along with the rest of the rulebook) in detail, click on the image above! (The rules for advanced play are located on pages 20-26.)\n  Want to see the game in action? Check out this video from Lance Hinkel at  Learn to Play Games:\nWhat about that book? Brave New Worlds: A Guide to the Solar System \n  Every copy of \"Brave New Worlds the Game\" comes with a copy of \"Brave New Worlds the Book\" - a guide to our Solar System, illustrated in high resolution and full color, with amazing facts about every Solar System world ever visited by spacecraft (and all the worlds you'll discover in this game): \n  I've spent nearly as much time working on this book as I have on the game, because I want players who land on worlds they've never heard of to able to say \"Wow, Iapetus! I wonder what it's like there...\", and then go read about it right away.  You can check out a preview version of this book on the game's facebook page  by clicking this link. \nInterested in knowing what other people are saying about Brave New Worlds? Check out these reviews:\nWritten \nClick the image above for Gaming With Sidekicks' written review of Brave New Worlds.\n  Video\n   \nI've worked hard to make Brave New Worlds as accessible as possible, because I really want to share with as many people as I can the joy of space exploration and discovery. So in addition to trying to raise money to make this game a physical reality, I've made a digital version that I can give away for free! Click on the image below to get access to files you can print yourself at home in order to make a paper version of Brave New Worlds.\nClick the image above to access the preliminary print and play files!\n  This version contains everything you need to create and play a version of Brave New Worlds on paper in its prototype form. If you'd like to try 3D printing your own spacecraft, or would like access to the finalized design files when the campaign concludes, consider backing at the $10 Observer Level for access to the premium print-and-play version.\nBrave New Worlds is an experience designed not only to be a ton of fun, but inspiring too. We live in an amazing universe, a gigantic place filled will crazy wonders. And it's easy to get excited about that when you start to discover what humanity has learned about it over the past few decades. There's this scene in Carl Sagan's Cosmos where Dr. Sagan visits his old middle school and begins handing out pictures of all the worlds humanity has visited, and it's just so great:\nI love seeing how excited those little kids are getting about the solar system! And the amazing thing about that clip is that Dr. Sagan isn't giving a lecture, he's just handing out pictures, inspiring kids to ask their own questions and get excited all on their own.\nI think everyone, no matter what age, can feel a bit of that childhood joy when they discover something new about the universe. My initial motivation for making this game wasn't to give an astronomy lesson, but rather was just to say \"Hey, look at all these crazy worlds! Imagine what it would be like to discover them for the first time! And wouldn't it be cool if we landed humans on Pluto?\" And I thought that wrapping that around a game, and making that game as fun as I could, might be a great way to reach out to as many people as possible.\nIf you support Brave New Worlds, you'll be getting a great game that is undoubtedly a ton of fun. But you'll also be getting something that will show you how amazing and exciting space really is. Here, let me tell you more:\nPLAY\n\nThanks so much for supporting this project!\nIf we exceed our funding target, we can put the extra money into making this game even better! Here are some things we'll be able to add if we hit the funding targets shown at left:\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nAfter the campaign concludes, we'll reach out to you in order to collect your shipping info, after which you'll be asked to pay shipping costs for whichever pledge level you backed at.\nWhy not just collect shipping information as soon as you pledge? By waiting until the campaign concludes, we can give hard numbers to our fulfillment partners and make sure you're getting the best possible price! As the campaign progresses we'll keep you updated about what the expected shipping prices should be depending on where you live. But we've worked hard to develop estimates that we expect will be close to what we'll ask for when the campaign concludes:\nBut do note that the numbers above are estimates!  They could rise or fall a bit as the campaign progresses and we get a clearer picture of the number of backers we'll have.  But we'll make sure to keep you informed throughout, and give you plenty of advance notice if any of these numbers changes too dramatically.\nThis project is customs friendly in the US, the EU, Canada, Australia, and China, meaning the game will ship to you from within these countries and you won't be on the hook for extra customs fees! If you live outside of these regions and would like to order a game, you may have to pay extra fees when the game is delivered.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks in creating something new and releasing it to the world, and I've worked hard to minimize them as much as I can.\n\nOn the logistical side, I've been in constant communication with my Chinese manufacturer DoFine Games in order to establish accurate prices for creating each of the components shown on this page. I've also been in contact with several distributors and shipping companies in order to get accurate estimates for how much it will cost to get these games from the factory to my backers' doorsteps. Unexpected costs *can* crop up, and surprises can lead to delays in getting these games into backers' hands, but I've built in a bit of a buffer - I fully expect to be able to deliver games by January 2020 (and hopefully sooner than that!), but rest assured that if delays crop up I'll keep you in the loop by posting regular updates.\n\nOn the creative side: the game is 95% done! What remains is to improve the design of a few components, especially the player reference cards and the scoring track. I expect that the design files should be complete by 1 month after the campaign concludes, and if this schedule slips I will post updates.\n\nFinally, there is some work still to be done on the companion book, which is currently still missing several moons and many of the worlds of the asteroid belt. If creative delays pop up it will likely be because of my desire to make this book as beautiful and as detailed as possible. I expect to have the book complete by June, but have agreed with DoFine Games that manufacturing of the other game components can begin earlier than that. I don't expect that delays in producing the book will affect production of the game, and I will keep you informed with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Observer Level (Print and Play)", "descp": "Print out the game yourself!

As the maelstrom fades and the threads pull together, knots are formed...\nThe haunted Tower of Ravingspire sits upon a prime nexus of this entropy, and its immortal lord has haunted the peoples of the Vorpal Realm for generations. The Dark Lord of the Tower was defeated long ago, but time doesn\u2019t work like it should in the Tower, and those who should have succumbed to mortality\u2026 have come back.\nReturn to Ravingspire is a cooperative questing game for 1-4 players. Take on the roles of Heroes climbing the ever-shifting Tower to the Spire and face its Dark Master. But beware! For the Tower lies upon a nexus of space-time, and its portals may as easily lead to other dimensions as they will up the Tower.\nReturn to Ravingspire\nRETURN TO RAVINGSPIRE is a cooperative questing board game with dice-battle mechanics, based in a land of Swords and Sorcery in a Tower built upon the remains of a crashed far-future space station. The Tower is ever-shifting in space and time, and wielding the Vorpal Artifacts the Heroes may open Portals into other parallel realms and times that the Tower also inhabits. The challenges are encountered utilizing a series of beautifully-illustrated oversized Tower cards, each representing one level of the labyrinthine Tower of Ravingspire and containing a diverging path for the party each turn. Players control a party of 1-4 heroes who will collectively choose which path to take to defeat or bypass each level guardian. They may choose to face it head-on, battling it with magic and might, or they may decide to avoid its wrath and escape through a nearby Portal, seeking their fortunes in the mysterious lands beyond before returning to the Tower, equipped with hard-fought weapons and treasure.  \nEach 5\" x 8\" Tower Card presents you with a choice about how you want to face the Encounter.\nReturn to Ravingspire is a stand-alone adventure game, and does not require the original RAVINGSPIRE to play.  It comes beautifully packaged in an embossed, leatherette, wooden book-shaped box. When placed upon a bookshelf, the game will resemble the leather-bound spell book of the original Dark Master of the Tower, Lord Ravingspire.  \nAn elegant box for a more civilized age\nPLAY\n\nVorpal Chainsword Games is three guys, passionate about gaming. For years we were making custom games for our friends. Now we would like to share them with the world. VC Games' members are Cory Scanlan, author of The Vorpal Chainsword Blog, writer and photographer Joshua Carlson, and graphic designer Cullen Bright. We are the creators of Ravingspire: Assault on the Tower of Madness, the Deck-Building, Rotating-Dungeon Boardgame. Now we want to bring your Heroes back to the Haunted Tower, this time in a fast-play, choose-your-path cooperative adventure that can thrust the heroes through both space and time!\nReturn to Ravingspire is a beautiful addition to any shelf. The adventure may be experienced by a single player, or with up to three additional player companions. We want to bring you a beautiful game made with high quality components and custom dice, housed in an embossed, leatherette, wooden book-shaped box. We can only hope to craft this elegant boardgame through the funding mechanics of Kickstarter.   \nIts solo play-ability, plus the robust and compact size of the boardgame box tome (which is approximately ~10 inches tall, ~7 inches wide, and ~2-1/2 inches thick) allow for it to easily be taken along by a traveling player when they journey to far off lands. And it will look just as good when they set it back upon the bookshelf after returning from their quest.\nThe game design is finished, and your donations will go toward high quality manufacturing. We\u2019re regular backers of projects on Kickstarter, and we are intimately aware of how some Kickstarter projects can over-promise but under-deliver. We delivered our Kickstarter for the original Ravingspire ahead of schedule because of our diligent planning and design work we did before launch, and have once again taken the time to work on this game and line up the logistics for this Kickstarter to be delivered before Christmas of this year.  We do have some longer-term dream stretch goals we\u2019d love to hit, but any stretch goals that would extend the production time of the game will ship to you separately and after you\u2019ve already received the main game by December.\nPLAY\n\nReturn to Ravingspire is a cooperative questing game with dice-battle mechanics. At the beginning of each turn, a Tower Card is drawn. This Tower Card will present the Heroes with two or three choices on how they wish to proceed. The party decides which path to choose, which could mean doing battle with a denizen of the Tower.\nEach Hero in Ravingspire has two custom Hero dice. The first is their Character Die, which is unique to them and is inscribed with their Hero name on one face. The second is their Class die, which is dependent on their character class. There are three classes in Return to Ravingspire: REAVER (Red dice), who solves challenges head-on though blade and bloodshed; ROGUE (Blue dice), who prefers cunning and guile to blunt tactics to win the day; and RUNELORD (Green dice), who have mastered the mystic runes left by the ancients to perform feats of wonder. \nWhen doing battle with the guardians of the Tower, or exploring the Portals to lands beyond, the Heroes will utilize three primary statistics: Fight, Skill, and Charm. Each creature or challenge will have some amount of these three characteristics on its Battle Matrix that must be eliminated before it can be overcome and the heroes can push forward.\n\nWhen an enemy is encountered, their Battle Matrix of Fight, Skill, and Charm statistics are recorded on the Combat Board. The Heroes may then roll their Hero dice to try and defeat the Foe or challenge presented. Each face of an Hero die may have a Fist, Key, or Orb on its face, which when rolled reduce an enemy or challenge\u2019s Battle Matrix value (recorded on the Combat Board) by one for each stat rolled.  If an enemy is not defeated at the end of the turn, then each Hero will take damage from the enemy\u2019s attacks!\nThere are also three other faces the die may have, unique to each Hero Class, which are Dodge, Critical Strike, and Vorpal Magic.\nAll Heroes have two Dodge symbols on their Class die, which reduces any damage they take from the enemy that turn. Thanks to their dexterous abilities, Rogues have a third Dodge on their Class die, allowing them to survive combat more often than any other Class.\nReavers can Critical Strike using their Class die, which counts as two Fight in a single die face. This allows them to more easily take down the beasts and heavy-hitting monsters of Ravingspire that rely on brute force to overpower their victims.\nRunelords are the only class that may roll a Vorpal result, which the Player may use as any type of attribute in an encounter. This makes Runelords the most versatile of all the Hero Classes.\nReaver, Runelord, and Rogue Heroes. The Battle Matrix on their Hero Battlemat displays their ability in each Attribute.\nThe Hero Battlemats also contain three item slots showing what kind of the magic equipment the Hero is trained to utilize. These may be weapons, objects, relics, armor, or potions. At the top of each Battlemat the Hero's Vigor card is slotted. This card is illustrated with the Hero's image and numbers 1-16 across it, and can be rotated to display the Hero's current health, similar to how it is used in our card battle game, ReaverQuest.\nThe party begins the game equipped with four magic items to help them in their quest that will protect them from becoming lost forever in the mystic Portals. These they will disperse among the party, such that each Hero carries at least one Vorpal Artifact. Each Player will slot the associated card into their character sheet and take the corresponding Vorpal die and add it to their Character and Class Hero dice for every test.\nThe Hero Battlemat and Vorpal Artifact Cards are made of thick heavy cardstock and possess a dice-shaped opening to provide each Player with a convenient place to store their dice between turns.  \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nWhen Heroes engage in Combat with the denizens of the Tower or during their adventures in the portal realms the damage they take will be dependent on their marching position. This is because each enemy fights in a different manner, and running up front to face them in melee or hanging back to pepper them with arrows or spells can lead to different levels of damage the Hero takes the battle. To easily illustrate and track this, before each Tower card is drawn the party chooses in what order they wish to enter the chamber in, known as their marching position. One Hero must take the lead position, but any other players are free to choose where to stand. Once their position is chosen, it generally cannot be changed until the end of the turn. When the Tower card is drawn, it will show which Heroes are in vulnerable positions and will take extra damage if they engage in battle, and which Heroes are in shielded positions and will take reduced damage from the Foe. \nPLAY\n\nA Hero\u2019s equipment slots allow them to equip special Loot cards. Loot cards when slotted may let a Hero re-roll dice, add bonuses to their attack, or heal them in the nick of time. Each Hero can only keep and equip three Loot cards between turns, so they must choose wisely what to keep if they find more Loot than they can carry!\nThe Heroes will likely only find a few treasures carried by enemies within the Tower itself, but they can find vast riches when exploring the Portals to the Other Realms!\nTravel through the Mystic Portals!\nThe Tower levels are only one of many places the Heroes may find themselves, as on each level lies a Portal the Heroes may take into another World, represented by a separate Portal Deck and Portal Book. If the Heroes choose to escape through a Portal rather than face the Tower Level\u2019s Guardian, they draw a Portal card which tells them what place and time they end up. They could find themselves in the Den of Thieves known as Peltgrande\u2019s Folly, fending off Dinosaurs in the steaming jungles of The Lost Lands, or even battling insane mutants and crazed robots in the post-apocalyptic city of Singularity.\nThe adventures in Other Realms are contained within the Portal Book, which has over one hundred different storylines for the Heroes to encounter, each with multiple Outcomes depending on what paths the Heroes choose and how they decide to face the challenges.\nPLAY\n\nThe Other Realms that may be reached from Ravingspire are rich in treasure and equipment that can help the Heroes when they return, and they can find many allies in those realms who can heal them or grant them extra equipment.\nBut the Heroes should not tarry long exploring the otherworldly Portals, as every time they utilize those Portals the stability of the nexus magics will slowly seep out of the Tower. This is represented in-game by a Foe marker that travels down the Tower as the Heroes travel up it. If the Foe marker ever reaches the Tower entrance, then the Dark Lord is unleashed into the world and the Heroes lose the game.\nPLAY\n\nThe Vorpal Artifacts the Heroes carry anchor them to the Tower and will always eventually pull them back, preventing them from getting lost forever in the other dimensions. How long they roam the dimensions each jaunt will depend on what paths the Heroes choose while encountering the fantastic creatures that wander the beyond.\nPLAY\n\n\n\nUltimately, the Heroes seek to reach the Spire of the Tower and face its dark master once and for all. One of three Final Boss Spire Cards is randomly chosen when the Heroes enter the Spire Keep and outlines the final battle they must face to win the game and defeat the Tower\u2019s evil forever!\nWhat dark lord will you find at the top of the Tower?\nIf you look at the Pledge Levels you'll see a few that include the QUEST bonus (REAVER BACKER and RUNELORD BACKER). These pledge levels include a copy of our fast-paced battle cardgame of brawling and swordplay: REAVERQUEST (for 2-3 Players), which is set in the same world as Ravingspire. Reaverquest is already available along with the original Ravingspire, but we didn't use Kickstarter for it and think a copy of Reaverquest would be a fun addition to anyone getting a copy of Return to Ravingspire. You can get more information about Reaverquest and find tutorial videos at www.vorpalchainswordgames.com.\nReaverquest can be played in just a few minutes and is a great pick-up game to play when traveling or when waiting for the rest of your friends to show up for game night. As an added bonus, we've gone ahead and included separate Quest bonus stretch goals into the goals below that are only for our QUEST backers. These Quest bonus stretch goals when reached will also give any Quest backer copies of our two other (but as yet unreleased) card battle games, RunelordQuest and RogueQuest!\nReaverquest\n\nPLAY\n\nWe have an initial funding goal of $7,500 in order to bring Return to Ravingspire to market. Any Stretch Goals achieved will take the game to the next level, and offer more to our backers. \nAt $7,500 Return to Ravingspire has been funded! We\u2019ll be able to high-quality manufacture all the components and ship the game to you in a beautiful embossed-leatherette wooden book-shaped box! Thank you!  \nPLAY\n\n\nStretch Goal Unlocked! Marcus the Runelord added to the game!\n\nAt $10,000 a Fifth Hero will now be added to the game, with a new Character card, player piece, and Character and Class dice: Marcus the Runelord. Marcus's mastery of rune magics allow him to re-roll any Vorpal dice from the Vorpal Artifacts he equips. This means if Marcus dares face the tower alone, then he\u2019ll be able to re-roll all four Vorpal Dice each round!\nFlorence Haymaker, Village Hero Unlocked!\nAt $15,000 a Sixth Hero has been added to the game, with a new Character card, player piece, and Character and Class dice. Florence Haymaker, Village Hero, is a Reaver who has plenty of brawn but very little in the way of brains. He makes up for this one-sided nature with his mastery of weapons, and may discard any weapon Loot card he carries to add two Vorpal (wild) to his attack roll!\nFallen Heroes Tower Adventures Unlocked!\nAt $17,500 we now can add five additional Oversized Tower Level Cards, themed toward the Fallen Heroes from the original Ravingspire boardgame. Encounter your old friend Garsome Cinderheart, once an ally but now blacksmithing weapons for his new Dark Lord, or help noble rogue Shayla Nimblenook steal some Loot from the Dark Tower...\n\nAt $20,000 another five Oversized Tower Cards will be added, each with encounters based on the eldritch works of H.P. Lovecraft. Try to bargain with a clutch of Deep Ones residing near the black pool, or gird your steel and battle a mind-shattering Star Spawn face-to-face!\nAt $22,500 we will be able to engrave all the dice in the game. The engraved dice are a VERY a cool upgrade and just feel more epic in your hands as you do battle within the tower, over regular painted dice. I think they look and feel great and am really hopeful we can produce them engraved!\nAt $25,000 we can add a whole grip of new Loot cards in the game. Each Loot card gives the Hero wielding it a boost to their combat or defense, and they each have a colorful and unique illustration of the treasured object to help bring the game closer to reality.\nAt $27,500 we can nearly double the size of the Portal Book and increase the Otherworldly Options and will bring three new Portal Worlds into the game. This adds 6 new Portal Cards and their associated Challenges and Outcomes added into the Portal Book. These new other realms include the Steampunk City of Looking Glass Port, the Vampire-haunted halls of The Dark Cathedral, and the Old West Town of Purgatory.\nAt $30,000 we get New Final Battles! We will add two new Final Boss Spire Cards to the game. The oversized Spire cards are beautifully printed on heavy cardstock and the threats upon them present the ultimate level of challenge to a party of any size. \nThis stretch goal level also grants our Quest backers (those who also picked up ReaverQuest in their pledges) a copy of our upcoming quickplay Spellcaster's dueling game: Runelord Quest!\nAt $40,000 we will have an audio track playlist created for all of the Tower Cards and every Portal Book adventure. You will become even more immersed in the Vorpal World when you have the Tower Card you draw read out loud.

I've personally backed a number of projects on Kickstarter that have ended up being very late or not bearing fruit, and it disappoints me to no end because the promise of what Kickstarter allows creators to bring to life is limitless. Our first Kickstarter, Ravingspire: Assault on the Tower of Madness, was delivered to virtually every backer on or before the promised date, and we have done our homework to make sure we can deliver a beautiful game on schedule once again.

You and your fellow tacticians will lead Freedom Squadron by  recruiting the best and brightest soldiers to join your team. Your  multinational force has one purpose: Defeat VENOM before they unleash  havoc upon the world. The original launch in 2016 was met with great success and has sold out. Now we are re-releasing a new print run with an all new expansion: Villains & Valor!\nIf this is your first time joining the battle, then take a look at what VENOM Assault has to offer. You can even see our first Kickstarter here. Below, see what comes in the base game:\n\nIf you already own VENOM Assault, or you already know you want the full experience, see what Villains & Valor has to offer to the base game below: \nThe year is 2065 and Freedom Squadron and the Global Operations Force are the best hope for defeating VENOM once and for all. Just when the world believed they had succeeded, VENOM has re-appeared stronger than ever to prove evil never dies. This time VENOM is not alone, because Chameleon's criminal organization, the Terrornauts, have roared onto the scene, bringing a new kind of warfare to the battle! To fight back, Freedom Squadron has unleashed their own batch of reformed elite  soldiers; the Carnage Corps. These elite members have been hand-picked by Corporal Carnage and reformed in his Carnage Dome to be the best of the best, steeped in the importance of teamwork to bolster the greater good. Now enhanced on both sides, the battle has truly become more epic between Freedom Squadron and VENOM!  \nIn VENOM Assault: Villains & Valor, players can add all new VENOM Leaders and  Support Cards from the Terrornauts to the game that bring new Failed Combat mechanics to the game. Players must now be more careful about charging into battle, or risk crippling losses. New Freedom Squadron soldiers from the Carnage Corps bring the Teamwork ability with them, which allow them to be played out of turn to bolster the active player. Brand new Event Cards can be used to create a different Event Deck every game, featuring all-new Dual Event Cards and Enhanced VENOM Strikes! Cards to bring an even greater challenge to the game. The fight for freedom is just heating up!\nWill you join General Steel and the new Global Operations Force?\n \u2022 The Carnage Corps: Freedom Squadron's newest elite team has been trained to be vigilant at all times. Each member brings with them a Teamwork ability that can be used to bolster other players' turns, and potentially strike a blow to VENOM that can shatter an impenetrable defense. \n\u2022 The Terrornauts: VENOM's newest batch of evil comes slightly unhinged, chaotic, and full of havoc. Due to their unpredictable nature, the Terrornauts make VENOM more dangerous than ever, and even entering into combat could mean risking members of Freedom Squadron. With the Terrornauts around, any failed combat could have disastrous effects. \n\u2022 Dual Events: As VENOM steps out of the shadows, the events caused by the war have been far more reaching, with impacts that seem to drastically affect both sides.

Unfortunately, at this time the shipping routes of the world are in a state of flux, experiencing US/China trade complications and possible Brexit implications. Because of all of these variables, please understand that the following prices are rough estimations. As we see it, the absolute best way to make sure that you are only paying what you should be for shipping is to not charge shipping at this time at all. When we are in the shipping stages of our distribution, we fully intend to use a Pledge Management Fulfillment service, to reach out to acquire shipping that is accurate and fair to each backer. We are excited to provide the highest level of accuracy for your shipping, but we also know that you want to have some idea of pricing, so we have reached out to our network to get the following charts. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to ask, because we are here to help!\nTiming: We are also dedicated to making the Steel Level Backer cards a priority to add additional cards for everyone backing this expansion. To allow time for these cards' creation, we have extended the shipping date out very conservatively. Of course, if we complete everything sooner, we fully intend to deliver as soon as possible.\nHere at SpyGlass Games we love our FLGS, and we know that retailers would like an opportunity to stock our games. Our goal is to make purchasing our titles easier for you, so we work with major distributors to ensure our games will reach your store without any issues. You can work with your current distributor or you can reach out directly to us to inquire on availability and pricing. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVENOM Assault: Villains & Valor is our 4th project, and we have gained a great deal of experience along the way.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).

We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

As a leader of one of humanity's four ideological Paths, your goal is to prepare for an asteroid impact bound to happen over the course of the game, and become the dominant power on New Earth once the dust has settled. At your disposal are not only your loyal workers and high-tech Exosuits, but also the ability to open Time Rifts, implemented as an innovative game mechanism.\nSince its release, Anachrony has been widely acclaimed as one of the best games in the worker placement category, currently ranking #49 overall on BoardGameGeek, and #37 in the Strategy category.\nAnachrony is now back on Kickstarter with Fractures of Time, its biggest expansion to date, and we are also offering an option for collectors old and new: the Infinity Box.\nWhether you're a backer of our original Kickstarter campaign, bought the game in your local game store or completely new to the world of Anachrony, this campaign has you covered!\nDiscover the alternate storyline of Fractures of Time, where secluded areas of New Earth have survived the Day of Purgation. The Amethynia Valley is one of them, where the mysterious flora crystallized in the wake of the cataclysm, fusing with the Neutronium dust. In the following decades, the enigmatic survivors in the Valley learned to extract the precious Flux liquid from these crystalline plants and discovered its ability to create fractures in time.\nExplore the Amethynia Valley, the expansion's new main location. Enlist the help of the Operators, a new Worker type specialized in Flux technology, acquire upgrades from the people of the Valley, and most importantly, harvest Flux for yourself and unleash its immense potential! \nAs the Paths learned about the Valley and the Flux, they soon realized that the Temporal Fractures can double the efficiency of their deployed Exosuits, essentially enabling them to be present in two places at once. In the new expansion, instead of placing a new Exosuit on your turn, you may spend a Flux Core to move (Blink) an already placed Exosuit from one action space to another.\nHowever, the Fracture Devices developed by the Paths to process Flux are far from perfect. Unless they are properly maintained by the skilled Operators of the Valley, overusing them has an increasing chance to cause temporal Glitches, hindering you in various ways. Fortunately, the Operators are no strangers to these peculiar phenomena, and can also be used to remove Glitches before they overwhelm you.\nFormed over the course of the first Era following the discovery of the Time Rifts, the Path of Unity joins the struggle as a fifth faction to save New Earth from the impending cataclysm. Consisting of dissidents from the four other Paths and unified by a common vision, the Path of Unity advocates tolerance and cooperation above all. \nAurora, the sublime, hovering capital of the Path of Unity is futuristic not only in its looks, but also in its nature. As the first Time Rifts opened, the very foundations of the city have been sent back from the distant future by the collapsing Path of Unity itself. To ensure a flow of events that corrects the course of their history, the Path's finest few, trained for this sole purpose, also emerged from the Time Rift to unite the foreign dissidents following the vision of Aurora, and lead the Path of Unity to a brighter future.\nEldrin: A scientist of unmatched intellect, Eldrin dedicated his life to perfecting the Fracture technology for the Path of Unity. He developed his own methods for keeping the dangers of the Fracturedevice at bay, something only the Valley\u2019s Operators have been capable of.\nCastien: The stalwart Castien was raised in the Valley from a young age, and is a living embodiment of the alliance between the Amethynians and the Path of Unity. Under his command, the Operators are willing to risk an incredibly dangerous feat: traversing the same Fracture more than once. \nThalia:  As the third member of the Triumvirate, the first generation Leaders of the Path of Unity, Thalia was raised to lay the foundations of Aurora. Thanks to her social skills, charisma and information network, she always finds a way to achieve her goals by manipulating her political opponents. \nFind out more about the new Leaders in the New Leaders section at the bottom of the campaign page.\nIn Fractures of Time, we continued to develop Anachrony's popular solo mode, the Chronobot. You will find a double-sided solo board with two new solo opponents in all three pledge levels:\nThe Chronobot Omega version of the Chronobot is very similar to the original one, but works with less randomness. Just like the last version, it is only playable with the base game.\nThe Chronossus is a whole new, reworked and slightly more complex iteration of the Chronobot. It is better at simulating passing, it has more customizable difficulty levels, and by using Flux and the Blink mechanism, it is compatible with Fractures of Time. It can also be played with the Doomsday and the Pioneers of New Earth modules.\n\nIf you are interested in the rules in a greater detail, check out our current work-in-progress rulebook, and the latest Gaming Rules! Video, where you can watch David explain the rules in detail followed by a full three-player playthrough of Anachrony: Fractures of Time. If you want to try it out yourself, check out the free digital version on Tabletopia!\n\n\n\n\nThis is the retail version of the expansion, but this pledge level will include some stretch goals that may not be available in retail.\nIf you are new to the world of Anachrony, the Infinity Box pledge level was made for you! It includes the base game, all expansions and modules released up to and including Fractures of Time, and all stretch goals.\nIf you own a Leader Box form the original Anachrony campaign, or the base box and the Exosuit Commander Pack from retail, the Infinity Upgrade Pack allows you to seamlessly upgrade your copy to the Infinity Box. If you only own the base game but would like to upgrade to the Infinity Box, you will also need the Exosuit Commander Pack add-on (see the Add-ons section).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above items are optional purchases in addition to your current pledge. To add them to your pledge, simply click Manage your Pledge, then increase your pledge amount by the total cost of the items you wish to add. In the Pledge Manager following the campaign, you will be able to allocate the funds added this way to the respective add-ons.\nPlease note that the Exosuit Commander Pack add-on can only be added to the Infinity Upgrade Pack pledge level, and only once per Infinity Upgrade Pack pledged.\n\nIn this campaign, we introduced a slightly different, thematic take on the Stretch Goal system, diverging from the ones you may be used to. For more details on our Journey through Time, check out Update#1!\nThe discovery of the final Origin Timeline introduced Future Imperfect, a whole new expansion consisting of three modules with various scopes and complexities, adding more variety to the time travel and endgame scoring mechanisms.\nThe Origin timeline is the final destination of our Journey through Time, and with it, we have unlocked all stretch goals we planned for this campaign. Thank you very much for your amazing support!\nIf you are interested in the previous timelines, the content they unlocked, and their story, check out Updates 1, 2, 6, 8, 10 and 15!\nUpdate #1: Water-Rich Timeline\nUpdate #2: High-Tech Timeline\nUpdate #6: Industrious Timeline\nUpdate #8: Revamped Leader Artwork\nUpdate #10: Unstable Timeline\nUpdate #15: Utopian Timeline \nFor a full playthrough video, check out Tom's Youtube channel, Slickerdrips!\nIn this campaign, we have committed to a transparent and clear standpoint regarding our exclusivity policy on Kickstarter and beyond.\nThe Infinity Box, Infinity Upgrade Pack, and certain stretch goals are marked with the MCG Exclusive badge on the campaign page. Items with this badge will only be printed once, following this Kickstarter campaign. We will be printing approximately 15% more of these items than what we'd normally need to fulfill the Kickstarter pledges and the Pledge manager orders. This additional quantity is primarily a safety buffer for the fulfillment. Once the fulfillment is 100% complete, we will be selling the remaining copies only on conventions and on our webshop.\nWith this exclusivity policy, we commit to the following:\nWe won't sell any of our MCG Exclusive items into retail after the Pledge Manager is closed. The only way for these items to enter retail is if a retailer pledges for them during the Campaign or the Pledge Manager.\nWe guarantee that the current Kickstarter price of these items is lower than it will be in the Pledge Manager for new late pledges*, at our convention booths and on our webshop.\n *If you pledge during this campaign, you will still be able to add more items in the Pledge Manager for the same prices you see on the campaign page.\nAnachrony and all of its modules and expansions are completely language-independent - once you know the rules, you don't need any English knowledge to play the game.\nThe process of translating, quality controlling and printing multiple rulebooks in the Infinity Box would add several weeks to the lead time of the project, and would increase the box weight significantly which would incur increased shipping prices for you. For these reasons, the game will only ship with English rulebooks, but we will be working on translating the rulebooks and the player aids to the following languages:\nThese rulebooks and player aids will be available as digital PDFs as a free download from Boardgamegeek and our new website.\nThe retail version of Anachrony is available localized in several languages, and we are in talks with those publishing partners to release the Fractures of Time expansion later. Note that the Infinity Box itself will not be released in localized versions, as promised in our exclusivity policy.\nIf you are a brick-and-mortar retailer or organizing a private group pledge, please contact us at balazs.horvath@mindclashgames.com for our retail and group pledge offers. Thank you!\nAs with our previous campaigns, we will be working with shipping partners within the EU, US, Canada, Australia and Asia to provide region-friendly shipping in each of these zones. If you live in these regions, you will not have to worry about paying additional taxes or duties.\nThe shipping cost will be charged after the campaign, using the pledge manager. We will be charging the actual shipping cost with a small subsidy to be able to offer you the best possible value in pledge prices. The table below contains the expected shipping cost of one copy of each pledge type. If you pledge for multiple copies, the per unit shipping cost will be lower than this. Please note that the Exosuit Commander Pack add-on will increase the shipping cost slightly.\n\nPlease note that while we will do our best to stick to these prices, the fulfillment is still several months away, and events beyond our control may cause the final prices to be slightly different from the ones in this table.\n\nClick on the image to get your badge", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Mindclash Games' fifth Kickstarter campaign. Three of those campaigns have already shipped, and the fourth is already in production, allowing us to fully focus on the successful execution of this project.\n\nThis campaign is slightly bigger in scope than our previous one (Trickerion - Dahlgaard's Academy and Collector's Edition), but since the end of that campaign, our core team has doubled in size. We now have fully dedicated people working in customer service, community management, operations and creative direction, ready for the new campaign and everything it entails.\n\nWe have launched Fractures of Time on Kickstarter in a much more advanced state than any of our previous games. We've been known for going above any beyond in polishing our games, even after the Kickstarter is finished, which sometimes resulted in a slightly different end product than what you saw on the Kickstarter page. That won't be the case now - we are not cutting any corners this time either, simply most of the said polishing is already done! With the Infinity Box being as complex of a product as it is, we have also added more safety buffer to our delivery estimates than before. We are very confident that we will deliver this project on time.\n\nIn manufacturing, we will continue to work with Panda GM. They have been excellent partners for all our projects so far, and our four-year partnership is a guarantee for smooth communication and an inside-out knowledge of their processes and deadlines. We are certain that the quality of the new expansion and the Infinity Box will more than meet your expectations!\n\nWe highly value transparency in all our campaigns.

(See below)\nBag of Dungeon: a mini-roleplaying adventure in a bag!\nBag of Dungeon, the game...\n... is a dungeon crawler tile-based game harking back to the good old deadly days of adventuring, exploring dungeons, slaying monsters and stealing treasure. It's a simple-to-play tabletop game where a party of 1-4 players explores the ever-changing catacombs in a quest to find the Ring of Creation before escaping with their lives and their loot.\nBut can you trust your fellow adventurers? As you embark on your adventure and set foot in the dungeon, you are all loyal to the quest and each other. But once the Ring is discovered it will cast a shadow of doubt and deceit over those who seek to steal it. You may decide that being a lone wolf is a far smarter choice than loyalty, even if it means the death of your former companions.  \nYou will encounter monsters, find treasure and use items to stay alive and hopefully escape with the Ring before the dungeon seals itself shut, imprisoning for all eternity anyone who remains.\nThe game has a simple but clever mechanic; great for young and/or new gamers to learn fast and take  part while still giving more experienced gamers a satisfying time at the table. The game takes 20-60 minutes and changes every time you play. \n\u201cKeep your friends close, and your enemies closer.\u201d\nPlaytesting BOD at our games club was received with great enthusiasm, even before the beer started flowing!\nHit points... \nPlay alone or with up to four players\nWork as a team or turn on your fellow adventurers\nDelve deeper and deeper into the dungeon to find the Ring\nDefeat monsters and receive loot\nCollect spells, potions, weapons and armour\nUse bows and spells to fight from afar or get up close with your trusty weapon to defeat the dwellers that lurk below\nSimple set up and easy to play\nLightning fast combat, simple but rewarding\nBroad appeal across different ages and experience\nSmall, lightweight and great for holidays, travel or gaming clubs\nCreated with a simple black, white and red design so as to fuel your own imagination and encourage roleplaying\nEverything an adventurer needs... in a bag\nGameplay\nThe object of the game is to get in, get the Ring of Creation, and get out.\nPlayers take turns to move their character deeper into the dungeon, fighting monsters and gaining weapons, armour, potions and spells that will aid them in discovering the Ring and escaping the dungeon. As soon as any character reaches the exit with the Ring, the dungeon seals itself shut forever, along with any adventurers still inside. \nEvery game is different, every turn a challenge!\nWork as a cooperative party but watch your back!\nMany players prefer the loyal approach, working together and helping each other towards shared success. But once the Ring is revealed it can play on the weak-minded. Will you stick together, fight back to back and drink to a successful alliance in the tavern that night, or will you attempt to escape alone, slaying any who stand in your way?\nAllegiances can be made and broken, lies and mistrust become the new enemies, and no-one will truly know who is for or against them until they emerge alive into the sunlight once more.  \nOne ring to woo them all, but be careful: it may sow discord and death among the players\nHeroes, monsters and loot\nThe characters are based on the classic adventure types : dwarf, elf, human and healer. All character cards have a male/female version. We will produce more add-ons and characters in the future.  \nFill your backpacks with items and weapons\nThe dungeon is packed with monsters, each hell-bent on slaying the characters who dare enter their domain. Monsters are drawn randomly from the Monster Bag and remain in the dungeon until killed. From goblins to trolls, zombies to snakes, mad monks to the legendary red dragon... you'd better hope that you've found the famed Dragon Lance when you meet her!\nPlayers also receive items from the Loot Bag, providing weapons, armour, spells, potions and magic items to aid them in their quest.\nAnd... action!\nPlayers roll a dice to determine the number of Action Points (APs) for their turn. They then use their APs to explore a new dungeon space, move or use items in any combination until all their APs are used up.\nExploring the dungeon\nDungeon tiles are drawn from the pile. They are laid so that an open edge joins another, creating a logical path through the dungeon. Every game is different. Finding your way in is easy; getting out is a different matter - avoiding or slaying more monsters, finding the safest and quickest route, and oftentimes doing battle with your former comrades to survive and escape.\nBuild your dungeon as you play, find the ring and escape!\nCombat\nCombat is quick and dirty with a simple but rewarding mechanic, pitting a character's armour and items against its opponent's. Fighting is played out simultaneously, reducing health with each roll until one or other of the combatants is dead or the character escapes. Defeat a monster and the character gets an item from the Loot Bag. Lose and your character drops all its items and is sent back to the entrance, losing one of its three lives. Lose all three lives and your game is over. You have failed in your quest.\nRange weapons allow you to fight from afar. But beware, monsters will give chase and hunt you down. \nMake those ranged weapons count or these monsters will be upon you!\nCombat is quick and deadly!\nSolo game\nBag of Dungeon can be played solo. You can control up to four characters but you only get one life each. Try an easier version with all four characters or test your luck and skill by taking a lone adventurer into the darkness of the dungeon. \nPlaytesting the game\nThe game prototype has been reprinted and tested many times with young and older experienced players and has been received with great enthusiasm:\n\"It started as a simple adventure with a friendly group of dungeoneers, until one player decided to take the Ring for himself and leave the rest of us to die. Then things got really interesting, and the whole game went up a gear.\" Russ, Playtester \nWe have ironed out all the dead ends, slow downs and game breakers and streamlined the game play to give a slick hour of hacking, slaying, chasing, lying and dying.\nGame design\nBag of Dungeon is designed to be the kind of retro gaming experience that takes a nostalgic trip down memory alley, but we also wanted to introduce the popular contemporary mechanics of traitors and back-stabbing. The distinctive black, white and red visual style is a modern take on simple cards and cardboard counters that typified game production of the 1980s. As we launch new expansions, cards and counters, the Bag of Dungeon family will have a distinctive and instantly recognisable identity. \nYour backpack space is limited so choose your items carefully!\nGame contents\nBag of Dungeon comes in a printed cotton bag, and contains:\n1 Monster Bag and 1 Loot Bag\n40 floor tiles\n30 monster tiles\n40 item tiles\n8 double-sided character cards with backpacks (male and female)\n2 limited edition Kickstarter only, double-sided character cards (minotaur and hobbit)\n16 coloured cubes\n4 coloured meeples\n2 six sided dice \n1 metal Ring of Creation\n1 large cotton bag\nAll comes in a fancy and original printed box for storage and stacking\nKeep BOD in the box for easy storage or just take the bag with you on your travels\nBag of Dungeon: everything you need to go adventuring... in a bag!\nOfficial BOD dice tower reward!!!\nIf you like the clickety-clack of dice during your game, the BOD dice tower is a must reward. You will not only receive the full boxed BOD game but also an exclusive branded wooden dice tower bearing the Bag of Dungeon logo. The dice tower comes flat packed but is easily slotted together (no glue needed) to make a towering must-have for your new game.\nBehold! The BOD wooden dice tower, an exclusive Kickstarter reward\nBranded with the BOD dragon logo, the tower is easy to build, needs no glue and folds flat for easy travel\nStretch goal!\nThis is what you're going to receive in every game box if we achieve a campaign total of \u00a328,000.\nThe Dragon Scrolls: get 'em while they're hot!\n11 (not 10), new challenges and quests to add to your BoD world!\nJoin us on our adventure\nIf you'd like to help us make Bag of Dungeon a must have item for gaming shelves around the world, please pledge your support, join the party and grab yourself some lovely loot.\nIf you have any questions please get in touch.\nNote: The game shown is a prototype. Some illustrations, stats or floor tiles may change slightly.

He runs a small independent design company called Gunpowder Studios (but basically he's an inventor who plays too many board games;)\nThanks to everyone from the gaming and kickstarter community for your support so far. What a loyal bunch you are!\nFinally thanks to my very special gaming friends for all your help and support on BOD, Andy, Russ (the mechanic), Julian, Mick (the monk) for working out the numbers, and especially brother Paul for proof reading and editing the game over and over again and letting me play his copy of Tunnels and Trolls back in 1983.\nNote: Bag of Dungeon is in prototype form only (we have had a small number printed for testing) and it's not for sale anywhere in the world yet. If we get funded it will literally Kickstart us for the first time ever into production, which is very exciting!\nAbout the printer\nLudo Fact are a well established game printing company based in Germany. They have many years experience in the board and card game arena and have some of the best selling titles onboard such as: AZUL, CODENAMES, CARCASSONNE, 7 WONDERS and many more...\nSee here for other great titles Ludo Fact have worked on: https://www.ludofact.de/en-gb/products/references/\nWe are excited to have them onboard and love the fact Bag of Dungeon will soon become another in their excellent portfolio!\nSee you all in the tavern!\n\u00a9 Gunpowder Studios - All rights reserved\nGame design and concept by Tim Sharville\nGaming in other languages!\nIf we are funded we will release online rules in German, Italian, French and Spanish.

The Fun's Not Over!\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar is an RPG inspired by the classic console greats, featuring deep dungeon diving, turn-based combat presented in a classic JRPG format, and tons of secrets, story and randomly-generated replay goodness.\n\nNightwar is currently planned for release on PC and Mac, both on Steam and DRM-free on GoG, as well as Xbox One and PS4. (Look for other platforms to possibly show up in our stretch goals!)\nThe game is being created by ex-Vigil Games veterans, including two of Vigil's co-founders, Joe Madureira and Ryan Stefanelli.\n\nLike the greats that came before, the soundtrack will be something special.\nDigital Artist Edition Battle Chasers #10\nWe are about to drop some additional items to the add-on store, one of which will be an awesome new pencils-only \"artist edition\" of Battle Chasers #10, featuring a full book of Joe's beautiful and uncolored pencil work. This new add on is now automatically included in the COMPLETE DIGITAL EDITION and above! So if you've pledge for the Complete Digital tier or beyond, you're already covered. The digital book is yours when released!\nNew Tier - Signed Battle Chasers #10\nThose keeping an eye on the page may have noticed a new tier with a signed copy of Battle Chasers #10. This book is also included in the Landmark Edition and above! Unfortunately we can't edit the tier descriptions to reflect this, but if you were one of these supporters, you will now also get this signed book!\nJoe Mad Originals!\nDarksiders Crossover Exclusive!\nIn partnership with our friends at Nordic Games, and for our Kickstarter backers only - a unique weapon skin for Garrison featuring the one and only CHAOSEATER from Darksiders! Every backer will get one, and ONLY our backers.\nSpecial shout out to Nordic Games for doing this for our fans!\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar is a love letter to one of our favorite genres of gaming: the JRPG. We grew up playing legends like Final Fantasy, Suikoden, Chrono Trigger, and Phantasy Star. While many greats continue to come from Japan, very few western developers are creating them. \nWith your help, we're going to change that.\nPlan for survival. The desolate town of Harm's Way is your only place to prepare. Choose three of the many heroes you've unlocked, fill your travel backpack with items from your stash, make sure you've chosen the best equipment and abilities for each hero... and then strike out.\nExplore an overworld presented in classic form, peppered with hidden dungeons, rare bosses and randomly appearing friends and foes.\n  Old-school combat inspired by the console RPG greats, with a unique two-tiered mana system and turn-based initiative, featuring random buffs and debuffs on initiative slots\nAction oriented, randomly-generated dungeons loaded with traps, puzzles and secrets. Use each hero's unique dungeon skills to survive!\nNon-linear story driven by the discovery of lore on items, landmarks and secret elements in the world. Discovering these will both provide deeper insight into the mysterious Lost Vale, and also reward lore points, which are used to upgrade the heroes' different abilities\nTruly key story moments will be depicted in gorgeous, traditional 2D animation from Powerhouse Animation Studios. For these, sit back and enjoy.\nThe Lost Continent\nThe Grey Line. An impenetrable wall of mist hovering over the West Waters, stretching endless from north to south, and towering from ocean crest to dark sky above. \nNothing has ever come from, or survived entering, the historic monolith. The great hero Aramus felt a calling from the Grey Line and crossed, despite the dangers. And like countless warriors, vagabonds, fugitives and fortune seekers before him, never returned. Now, his daughter Gully and her unlikely band of adventurers venture into the mist to uncover her father\u2019s mission. \nAlong the way they'll meet friend and foe alike while piecing together the silent history of the Grey Line, and the dark secrets within.\n\nLearn a bit about the heroes of Battle Chasers!\nThe turn-based combat in Battle Chasers is inspired by the great JRPGs of years past, with three major features: the Dual Mana system; an  Active Initiative Bar with random buffs and debuffs; and momentum-shifting super attacks called Battle Surges.\nAbilities\nAbilities are unlocked when a hero levels up. Each can eventually unlock more abilities than there are slots to equip them, so choosing can be difficult. \nBlue and Red Mana\nThere are no basic attacks in Nightwar. All abilities either consume mana, or generate red mana.\nBlue mana is the core resource pool, with red mana acting as a backup or bonus pool.\nIf a hero runs out of blue mana, they can generate red mana as a way to perform their most powerful attacks. But red mana can take time to generate, and is lost at the end of a battle. Using it carefully can preserve the core blue mana pool or allow a spent hero to continue fighting.\nEach hero reacts to red mana use in a unique way. Garrison's abilities are more effective when using red mana, so building it is encouraged (though his base mana pool is much smaller). Knolan is better off using blue mana and suffers penalties for using red. Calibretto is healed slightly when using red mana. \nThis is the primary strategy of resource management in Battle Chasers: Nightwar. \nInitiative\nKey to survival is managing position on the initiative bar. Initiative determines order, but the slots can also appear with randomized effects which activate when a hero performs an action in that slot. These can be beneficial or harmful, and even be based on the environment you're in. Deep swamp? Beware the poisoned gas debuff that may appear on slots.\nAbilities have different speeds which affect initiative position, making it possible to strategically position yourself (or your enemy) into a slot that's helpful. This is most important in the highest dungeon difficulties.\nDungeons are a random arrangement of hand-crafted rooms, overflowing with traps, treasure, puzzles and lore. Monsters are visible on the map and exhibit unique behaviors when aggressive.\nTouching a monster initiates the turn-based combat system, featuring big and bold characters on gorgeous 2D backgrounds.\nRandomness and Rarities\nThe enigma of the Lost Vale means no two dungeons are alike.\nRooms move, yes. But so do monsters, traps, treasure, secrets, rare vendors, shrines, NPCs, puzzle elements and resources.\nReturn to a dungeon after successfully surviving once, and the option to change the difficulty is unlocked. This increases the difficulty as well as the reward... and the chance for rare artifacts and NPCs to appear.\nBeating each dungeon on the highest difficulty setting is the only way to truly see everything Nightwar has to offer.\nSurviving\nPrepare carefully before entering a dungeon. Death means losing everything not equipped on your characters. And when every dark corner leads to another menacing creature or lethal trap, death may not be so infrequent.\nNot all is so bleak. Every dungeon has a single rest point, where you are given the chance to replenish all your resources and stash a few items for safekeeping, so they aren't lost upon death.\nYou can do this once per dungeon. Good luck.\nDungeon Skills\nFortunately each hero is equipped with a unique assortment of dungeon skills to aid in the adventure. These skills include the basic but necessary - lock picking, treasure finding, and dashing - to the less ordinary: invisibility, teleportation, blinding and more.\nLore\nEverything from landmarks to torn scraps of paper have a story to tell in Nightwar. Finding these will reveal more and more layers of the narrative, but they also provide lore points of varying value, which are used to upgrade abilities on the heroes. \nKey Cutscenes & Traditional Animation \nKey moments will be depicted with killer 2D animation from Powerhouse Animation Studios. It's the Battle Chasers heroes like you've never seen them before!\n\nAbilities \nAbilities unlock as heroes level up. Players can choose which abilities a hero leaves town with, however the slots are limited so choices will be difficult and based on overall party makeup. \nPerks\nPerks award passive bonuses and are arranged in a tree. As players move into a new tier of the perk tree, ability slots are unlocked.\nPerk points can be earned a number of ways: leveling up, finding rare lore relics, and as rewards for killing rare bosses to name a few.\nArmor and Weapons\nThe world is littered with rare and powerful items. Weapons, armor, trinkets, and more are dropped in combat, found in chests, or found tucked away in dark and powerful corners of the world.. Vendors, some rare and hidden, can offer up some of the most powerful wares.\nThe Legendary Comic Series continues!  \nYou thought it would never happen. So did we. Alongside the release of Battle Chasers: Nightwar, new issues of the classic comic series will continue where the story left off. \nWritten and drawn by original series creator Joe Madureira, these new books mark his long-anticipated return to the most cherished and iconic work of his career.\nVisionary comic artist Joe Mad and design veteran Ryan Stefanelli were two of Vigil's founding members, creating and shipping Darksiders and Darksiders II. \nSteve was one of Vigil's first hires, where he instantly proved himself invaluable as an animator. He worked on almost all of the bosses in Darksiders, so if you were cursing and throwing your controller, you can partially blame him. \nBrooks has a long history in programming, having written entire game engines from scratch and performing as a lead programmer on Vigil's MMO, Dark Millennium online. His first company, Professor Fog's Workshop, gave Ryan his break into the industry - hiring him as an intern over 15 years ago.\nJesse was an environment artist at Vigil before heading to Digital Extremes to further cut his teeth on Warframe. He rejoins his old comrades at Airship to help make our \"moving concept art\" philosophy a reality.\nOur history working together allows us to develop games instinctively, making quality stuff quickly. \nWe love this stuff.\nWhy We're On Kickstarter\nEvery member of the Airship team has shipped big, AAA titles, many from soup to nuts. We understand the trials and tribulations of game development at every stage.\nWhat you are funding here is the core experience for Battle Chasers: Nightwar; the foundation for a great RPG. We hope that by reaching our true fans and hitting through some stretch goals, we can take the game even further.\nWe've gotten this far using a combination of our own sweat equity, personal investment dollars, and some savvy angel investment. So you aren't paying for the entire thing: we've already put a lot in.\nWe've had faith from day one that our team, plus support from our fans, can take us across the finish line. We believe the goal of true independence can become a reality through the power of Kickstarter.\nDelivering a great game to our backers will always be the number one goal, however. And should there be unexpected challenges, we have a number of options at our disposal, including taking on more investment or a even a publisher. We will do whatever we must, without ego, to make good on our promise and reward your support.\nSpecial Thanks!\nA shout out to a few of those who've helped us tremendously!\nOMNOM!

So we'll keep it short: making games is a creative business where nailing \"fun\" is a subjective art form rather than exact science. Change is a natural and necessary part of building a game, and with change during development comes inherent risk.\n\nHow do we mitigate these risks? By leaning on our experience. We've made games before, games much larger than this one, and understand when change is necessary and when it isn't. We've been through the exercise of finishing a game and taking things the last mile - and while no one can ever guarantee success in game development (let alone any business), we've done this before.

You make it Epik.\nWe believe the Apple Watch will become a seamlessly integrated and indispensable part of our everyday lives. But for many highly active and adventurous lifestyles, the Apple Watch will require enhanced protection. LUNATIK Epik transforms your Apple Watch into a bold, iconic and just plain badass wearable companion, ready for anything. With Epik you can enjoy your adventures without worry, knowing your investment is safely protected.\nAlways Use Protection\nYou might ask, does a watch really require additional protection? Typically not. But the Apple Watch is not typical, nor is it designed to perform in extreme situations where a true sport watch might. While designed perfectly for everyday fitness, would you wear your expensive Apple Watch snowboarding, cross-training or even at the beach like your old school G-Shock, Timex Ironman or Nike Triax?\nWe know Epik is not for everyone. However, for those who rely on their gear while participating in extreme scenarios as well as the harsh realities of everyday life, it offers more rugged protection when you need to dig deeper, go bigger or just plain man-up.\nThis Is Epik\nEpik is the rebirth and evolution of the LunaTik Watch Kit. An instant global crowdfunding success in the technology and lifestyle industries, the original LunaTik Watch Kit has been the icon for Apple\u2019s wearable technology for the last 4 years. Now that the Apple Watch is here and poised to change the industry, LUNATIK is focused on developing epic solutions that enable users to use the Apple Watch and wireless technology in any situation. \nMeticulously designed by Scott Wilson, former Global Creative Director of Nike's watch and technology division and recipient of the Smithsonian's prestigious National Design Award, Epik was inspired by the precision details, functional design and durable materials of outdoor gear. Epik is a distinctively masculine statement crafted for those who appreciate a more rugged aesthetic.\nForged from aluminum alloy and premium performance materials, Epik will transform your Apple Watch (42mm) into conversation-starting, high tech gear that is as comfortable in the boardroom as it is on a mountaintop.\nEpik's rugged case encloses and protects the Apple Watch's more sensitive and delicate areas. The premium, anti-dust and dirt coated silicone sport strap or aluminum link bracelet with silicone sub-links and butterfly clasp, are designed for long term comfort and durability, even through your toughest workouts. Epik's highly tactile Active-Control Crown couples seamlessly with Apple's Digital Crown to enhance grip, making interaction with your apps more efficient in highly active moments.\nFeatures | Specs\nForged and machined aircraft-grade aluminum case (for Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport 42mm) surrounds and protects the device.\nEpik\u2019s slightly raised aluminum bezel protects the glass face and most vulnerable edges. \nStainless steel perforated filters provide added ingress protection against dirt and water.\nPremium, anti-dust/dirt coated silicone sport strap or aluminum link bracelet with silicone sub-links and butterfly clasp provide comfort and durability.\nFull use of all watch controls and features, including recharging, heart-rate monitor, digital crown and side button.\nAcoustic ports amplify and enhance audio performance.\nStainless steel hardware components.\nActive-Control Crown provides enhanced control of Apple's Digital Crown in extreme conditions. \nShock-absorbing internal core suspension system for impact protection.\n Why Epik?\nGlass is typically weakest on the edge, and while tough, a naked Apple Watch is still prone to damage. As more and more damaged Apple Watch stories surface, it is going to be painfully clear why adding Epik protection is a smart move. But don\u2019t just take it from us, check out this video from Cult of Mac editor Leander Kahney. Looks like Epik protection would have come in handy for him.\nEpik Protection for the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport 42mm\nFor our Kickstarter campaign, we are focused on creating Epik for the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport 42mm. The Epik system will also be compatible with our original LunaTik watch straps, including the leather Chicago Collection and metal Lynk Collection straps. \nRewards\nAn Epik Journey\nWe are the design team that kickstarted it all. Four years ago, we changed the entrepreneurial world when we simultaneously sparked the global crowdfunding and smartwatch movement with TikTok+LunaTik. We built a loyal community of Kickstarter and LUNATIK fans that believed a small group of passionate designers and product developers could create something pure and uncompromising. At LUNATIK, our mission is to develop solutions that enable and enhance mobility in any environment\u2014mobility without limits.\nGood Things Come To Those Who Wait\nSince last fall we have been studying the limited information available on the Apple Watch in regards to dimensions, sensors and other critical items. When the watch launch date and more details were officially announced we focused on design refinement, engineering and the manufacturing strategy. Once we had a device in hand on April 24th, Scott Wilson jetted to Asia to join his team on the ground and begin an intense two week development effort focused on Epik while his team focused on other high priority projects, the Aquatik and flagship Taktik 360. We are now locked on the design and engineering and beginning the tooling development this week. Based on a May 11th kickoff, the following is our development schedule for Epik Aluminum:\nUpdate all stamping molds and testing for the forging process\n20 days > 01 Jun 2015\nKickoff the aluminum blank production\n25 days for the first 5000pcs > 06 July 2015 \nCreate machining fixtures, CNC, polishing, sandblasting\n20 days for the first 5000pcs > 03 Aug 2015 \nWe will increase the output from 300/day to 900/day after the first 5000pcs.\nAnodizing\n10 days > 17 Aug 2015 \nFinal assembly and packaging\n15 days > 08 Sep 2015 \nShipment schedule for first 20,000 units\nFirst 5,000pcs > 11 Sep 2015 \nNext 15,000pcs > 25 Sep 2015\nWe Need Your Help And Feedback\nWe've been wear-testing prototypes and pre-production units, and mass-production stamping tool & CNC machining fixtures are being created. Our team is engaged and on the ground in Asia, overseeing development and quality control on Epik. We have done a ton of upfront work on this project prior to launch and are in the process of coordinating all the backend logistics to make this a reality. Our next step begins with you. \nYour backing will help us estimate how much tooling we need to make Epik. Each tool and CNC setup produces about 300 units a day due to the time it takes to craft each case. Based on your interest and support, we can predict both Kickstarter and market demand and calculate how much tooling we need to invest in creating this product.  \nAs you can see, Epik is a very unique product that is precisely crafted to complement and transform your Apple Watch into a durable, long-term companion. As with all of our products, quality and design are at the forefront of our efforts. We want to exceed your expectations and in turn allow you to exceed your own expectations of what you can do with your Apple gear.\nSpecial Thanks\nWhile designing watches is a personal passion and hands-on therapy for me, none of this would be possible without support from my amazing MINIMAL design, brand and engineering team as well as our external partners. Special thanks goes out to Gina, Greg, Justin, Keith, Vera, Kevin, Jerry, Rob and Matt at MNML as well as Lawrence Cheng, John NG, Fred, Mr. Lee at our watch factory as well as Adam Melton and Shirley Ran at our packaging partner. You guys truly are Epik.\n- Scott", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has a wealth of experience in product development, as well as designing a variety smartwear including industry pioneering products like Nike+, Motorola Bluetooth audio and smart watches, Misfit wearables, Samsung accessories, Microsoft Xbox, and many body-worn health and medical devices. We have run several highly successful crowdfunding campaigns (this is our 4th project on Kickstarter). But no project comes without challenges and unexpected learnings.

Its game play hearkens back to old school point and click, inventory-based adventure/puzzle games but uses third person analog controls for a more updated, immersive feeling. \nEach chapter is meant to be the video game version of a short story, a quick, enjoyable digital romp that can be played in a dedicated day or a lazy weekend. When taken together, the chapters assemble a narrative that roams across a world of distinct cultures and intriguing lore with a story that can be enjoyed and appreciated by all ages.\nNot many epic adventures begin with a broken fence, but Kiba's does. Kiba begins his journey as a young man on the verge of adulthood, and along the way, not only does he find friends among the game's cast of unforgettable characters, he also touches many lives that will ultimately change the face of the world in which he lives. He's not a savior or a genius. He's a pretty average kid with a talent for music, a big heart, and a knack for being in the right place at the right time\u2014or the wrong place at the worst possible time, depending on your point of view.\nThe Song of Seven's first chapter begins in an isolated, walled village nestled in the bottom of a forested valley. Kiba goes to fix a broken fence and meets Emma, an exuberant but odd young inventor. The two of them accidentally collide with a sacred, mystical bull, and in trying to make sure it's all right, they stumble across the ruins of an ancient and forgotten temple that once housed the avatar of Ami the Hunter's energy. Once inside, the doors close behind them, and the only way out is forward through three levels of puzzles, riddles, and challenges called the Pilgrim's Path.\nFeatures :\nInventory puzzle mechanics\n3rd person Analog Controls\nConversation Trees\nUnique challenging puzzles\nStory driven Character development\nCharacters\nKiba\n Kiba is the sixteen year old son of the village chieftain, T'lor. He likes to play his lyre, climb trees, taunt Jandals, and sleep in. Kiba shows a distressing lack of interest in taking over as village chieftain when his father steps down and has lately developed something of a restless streak. His mother, Arda, worries that Kiba may have come down with a terrible case of brain spots, since sufferers can't hold still, but so far, Kiba's skin remains its normal color and hasn't developed the purple tinge associated with the terrible malady. She remains vigilant while Kiba rolls his eyes and works on his new lyre solo.\nEmma\n Emma, Kiba's newest friend, is something of a mystery. She just appears one day outside the village fence and introduces Kiba to the world beyond the walls he's known his entire life. She likes inventing and alchemy, and has only blown her own eyebrows off ONCE, and that was a long time ago, due to a very subtle miscalculation, and Johu has never let her forget it.\nWe spent the last couple years - developing our workflow, designing, writing, and prototyping. All of our major game mechanics are implemented. We spent as much as we could of our own capital on the game, so, at this point we just need to finish the art, animation, and wiring up all the VO/puzzles. We are Nintendo and Sony developers, and were recently Greenlit on Steam in just 6 days!\nSteam Greenlight\nWe're only asking for help to develop Chapter One at this time. While we're committed to developing the full, seven-chapter game, we don't feel comfortable soliciting funds for a chapter that may not be available for a year or two yet.\nObviously, if we exceed our funding goal, we'll put that money as well as capital from Chapter One's eventual sales towards developing Chapter Two.\nSoundtrack\nLore Trailer \nTeaser Trailer\n Kami Village\nJohu's House\nAmi's Temple\nEric Blomquist (@thewillofb) - Founder Enlightened Games, Designer, Animator, Passion Tornado\nEric has been creating digital art and animation for almost a decade. He has a Bachelors in Game Design and is a semester away from a Masters of Fine Arts in Game Design with an animation focus. He is an adjunct animation and game art instructor for the Art Institute in Schaumburg, IL. He worked for Sleepy Giant, High Voltage Software, and an international technology company as a designer/animator. \nJonathan Yandel (@Jyandel) - Composer, Grumpy Battle Mage\nJonathan Yandel began his music career at the tender age of 3, when he started playing melodies from his favorite television shows by ear. It took a while before he realized it was much easier to use his hands. His parents enrolled him in a music conservatory where he received his classical training until college, where he broadened his horizons to include jazz, choirs, percussion, guitar, and sitar. He also studied art and finished his degree in multimedia arts. While pursuing his graduate degree in music for visual media he met Eric Blomquist and they began discussing ideas that would eventually lead to Song of Seven...\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoys cooking, working out, playing with his cats, and games (his favorite game of all time is Thief). He is currently working on his solo album.\nZach Kruse (@Enlightgames)  - Producer, Marketer, Party Starter, Dualshock wielding Dominator.\nZach has been in business, sales, management and marketing for nearly a decade, and a gamer for life. Walking to home plate in his business management-marketing emphasis degree, Zach has a passion for marketing and video games, so having the ability to combine the two is a lifelong dream. Sometimes the voice of reason, Zach is at Enlightened Games to keep the train on the tracks and turn ideas into revenue. \nJenni Hart - Writer/Designer, Frolicker, Giggler, Cat-lady.\nJenni is an adjunct instructor of English at three different Chicago area colleges. She holds a Masters Degree in Literature, Rhetoric, and Composition, which is the academically fancy way to say \"reading and writing.\" When she isn't wandering about northern Illinois correcting other people's grammar, she writes, games, and pursues other esoteric hobbies that no one in their right minds would bother with. Working on The Song of Seven is her first foray into letting other people actually see what she's written.\nWe chose to do another campaign with Kickstarter. Why? Because of the community. In the first place, trading funding for unique items and opportunities is a great practice. It lets people support the products they want to see. In the second place, even though our first funding goals weren't met, we got a lot of support and sound advice from the people who visited our page, so we're trying again to win your love and approval. In the third place, that last six months to a year of production can be quite expensive. We need Kickstarter capital to finish making our game. But wait, there's more! Help us get funded, and this time, you get super nifty stuff! Games, soundtracks, art books, and maybe even the chance to create your own NPC. We also have some of the coolest reward tier names ever. Who wouldn't want an Epic 'Stache? \nWhat will we spend Kickstarter funds on? I'm glad you asked. The money will go towards console publishing costs, a better user interface, voice actors, additional software, food, Internet (specifically for a static IP address that is required for console dev kits and can be quite pricey), and contracting a couple of extra hands to help polish. We are confident that the best way to adequately fund the final phase of The Song of Seven's development (without anyone having to auction off bodily organs) is through Kickstarter.\nThe Jandel says you should back The Song of Seven. I would seriously listen to him...he can be...well just take my word for it. \nBUDGET: \nLegal (copyrights and lawyer stuff) : $1000  \nContract Artists (Modeling, Sound FX) : $2000\nHigh Quality Audio Samples for Sound FX : $1000  \nUser Interface Design (contracted through Fully Illustrated) : $1500\nVoice Acting : $2000\nKickstarter Fees - est. $500+ (5% and 3% + $.20 per pledge)\n Rewards Breakdown", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Song of Seven will be the first commercial release here at Enlightened Games. As our second attempt at launching a Kickstarter, we've learned so many things in the 15 months of development since our initial campaign. It made us realize that the amount of money was too extensive for an untested developer, and that we would have to all work on this project part time on our own to gain trust and quite frankly, an audience. In an industry rife with constant change and required adaptation, we have overcome a slough of obstacles including continuing to develop without outside funding help and willingness to put our own time and resources into this project for over a year and a half. \n\nThough there will surely be many inevitable, exciting, and terrifying challenges along the way - the challenge right now is paying those fees we need that are required to complete development and publish the game on schedule. The game has evolved from our original idea(Project Bliss) into so much more, while retaining the original emotion and mystique we were aiming for. We have reached the 'point of no return' in development, and have so much invested already that the risk this at this point for the game to go unpublished is a non-issue. Everyone on this team loves this game and where it's going, with excitement building daily towards release.

After more than a year of attempting to tweak, re-tweak, re-create, and optimize, we have run out of options for being able to make the game work on the Wii U console. This means we will be cancelling the game's Wii U specific version, which we first thought of all of our Wii U backers before making this tough decision. We found that there is no feasible way to transition the game to that specific console without rebuilding the game from the ground up. Don't fret, though, Nintendo faithful backers. We will continue to work with Nintendo on the possibility of release on future Nintendo platforms with new hardware better aligned with our game engine. We sincerely apologize in regards to our unforeseen obstacles, but there is a slight silver lining. In addition to releasing on the Playstation 4, we are currently working with Microsoft to add release on the Xbox One, with both versions releases slated in 2017, bringing you more options to play the game on..

This Kickstarter project is to fund MUCK: Feast of Saint Patrick, the prequel that promises to be even bigger, bloodier and better than the original!\nMUCK movies boast dangerous stunts, practical effects, no CGI, and are shot in \"Bloody Stunning\" 4K Ultra HD! \nWhy not use CGI? Because I have no interest in directing computers. CGI never looks as good as when real people are putting it all on the line. Like this...\nPractical effects are more of a challenge for me as a director, like a problem to be solved. How can we do this full-body burn, make it look realistic, but not actually burn my lead or his stunt double? How can we throw this actress through a picture window and make it look awesome without sending her to the ER? With CGI there's basically nothing you can't do with a sophisticated enough computer. That's great, but there's no challenge for me there as a filmmaker. \nThat's why all our stunts, all the blood, and all the effects are done in-camera and with practical effects. It just plain looks better. It's more authentic. That's my vision for MUCK. \nThe Creepers of MUCK\nThe bad guy. Every horror movie revolves around the villain.\nSay what you will about the heroics of an Ash Williams or an Ellen Ripley. Truth is, there's not much to them until the Necronomicon shows up to ruin everyone's day, or some face-hugging perfect organism volunteers to redecorate your chest parts.\nThat\u2019s why it's no surprise that the most frequent question we\u2019ve been getting during the Muck Kickstarter campaign is \u201cWho/what is you bad guy?\u201d And while we can\u2019t say what they are exactly, we can tell you what they are not.\nThey\u2019re not sluggish zombies, weepy vampires, cartoonishly macho werewolves, or ghosts bitter at a life misspent. They don\u2019t lurk in your nightmares or inside your television, and they aren\u2019t alien clowns in the storm drain under your sleepy East coast town.\nEven if we can\u2019t tell our fans everything about our bad guys, we can show them with the above exclusive, never-before-seen clip from MUCK.\nBut don\u2019t just take my word for how awesome MUCK is and how great the prequel will be. Listen to one of our exciting new cast members, cosplay superstar LeeAnna Vamp!\nPLAY\n\n Why Choose This Cast?\nKane Hodder is one of the most respected names in the horror community, and that's the public that Muck serves- true horror fans. As soon as I finished my script I knew I had to get Kane Hodder to play the Grawesome Crutal character. \nFor the other cast members, it was important to me to cast young, hungry, up-and-coming types, because that's who we are as a production company. Bryce Draper and Lachlan Buchanan are perfect examples of guys on the make that as a film franchise we want on our team. I wasn't going to overpay for some name that was big three years ago but sacrifice the quality of my film for a little more name recognition. When people see Muck I think they'll agree that every casting choice fits their role perfectly and they'll appreciate that we chose to go in that direction.\nWhat Makes 4K Ultra HD Different?\nThe difference between 4K Ultra HD and previous gen HD is almost as great as between Standard and High Def. A film in 4K is noticeably more immersive than inferior technologies, but not in that hokey or cartoonish way that 3-D sometimes looks. Every color is richer in 4K. The blacks are deeper, too, which really lends itself to horror. \nMUCK movies are filmed on the same cameras used to film The Avengers, and we mix our sound at the same studio where they do the X-Men movies. \n4K is the next iteration in digital, so if this technology is available, why not utilize it? \nHorror icon Kane Hodder and \"MUCK\" girl Constance model a few of our exciting rewards:\n\"MUCK\" Kane Hodder Jersey, Autographed Limited Edition Poster and Autographed Hockey Mask\nThe \u201cMUCK\u201d trilogy is sexy, hyper-violent, and original; playing out like a love letter to horror fans everywhere. ANCHOR BAY ENTERTAINMENT will distribute \u201cMUCK\u201d next St. Patrick\u2019s Day. The three \u201cMUCK\u201d films bookend each other, as they all take place on Cape Cod over just three days, the middle day being Saint Patrick\u2019s Day. At the core of these movies is a commitment to practical effects, incredible stunts, no CGI, and all those involved take some kind of risk, whether getting thrown through a huge picture window or giving some spare cash to be part of a new movement in horror.\nNew members of the \"MUCK\" cast - Playboy's Playmates of the Year 2013 and 2014 Raquel Pomplun and Kennedy Summers proudly display our rewards:\nLimited Edition Prop Axes Used in \"MUCK, Womens \"MUCK\" tops and bottoms\nWe didn't just complete the filming of \u201cMUCK\u201d ... we \u201ckilled\u201d it! No green screens, no stages, we really dragged our 2 RED Epic cameras out into the swamps, through the mud, water, and vines with bugs, critters, marsh sharks (yes, there are sharks in the marsh) to shoot in native 4K for Ultra HD. \u201cMUCK\u201d boasts dangerous stunts: in-water fighting, full-body fire burns, and high-impact falls.\nNow, it\u2019s time to take the \u201cMUCK\u201d trilogy to hotter fires, higher falls, and deeper into the mud. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here, to keep pushing the boundaries of independent filmmaking and the horror genre into the next chapter of the \u201cMUCK\u201d trilogy. Despite numerous offers from production companies and studios, we won\u2019t accept any \u201cstudio money\u201d for the prequel, because, in the words of the \u201cMUCK\u201d creator, \u201cStudio horror movies suck and I won\u2019t take easy money that will force me to make horror movies for studios; I want to make horror movies for horror fans.\u201d\nOne of the smaller, yet equally awesome rewards we offer.

Many apps get millions of downloads and with your help and support we think this app will also, which would allow us to donate a significant amount to children's causes.\nWe need your help not only in contributing to get this app developed and marketed but also in choosing the most worthy children's causes for us to donate the proceeds the app generates. So after you have contributed please message us with the charity you think is most deserving and once the funding is done we will pick the top ten charities to receive 50% of the revenue generated from the downloading of the Monster Checker App.\n\nWe will be keeping detailed tracking of how much money the app has raised at MonsterChecker.com, so you will be able to check in at anytime and see how much money has been raised. \nThe app uses the phones camera and scans your child\u2019s room, under their bed, in their closet or wherever they believe there might be a monster and when done scanning a message says \u201cNo Monsters Found.\"\nThis app has been tested with children ages 2 to 8 years old and in every case the child that was scared of a monster in their room went to sleep after using the Monster Checker app.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR CONTRIBUTION...\nWe are seeking funding from Kickstarter so we can finalize development of both the Android and iPhone versions of this application. The development will take approximately half our goal and we plan on using the rest of the funding to market the app and get it out to the parents and children who need it. \nFUNDING BREAKDOWN...\nDevelopment of Apple version $2,000\nDevelopment of Android Version $2,000\nOnline Marketing $3,500\nOffline Marketing Materials so we can promote at events $1,500\nFulfillment of Kickstarter Rewards and Fees $1,000\nWe understand that a lot of people might think that $5,000 dollars is a lot of money for marketing but we are trying to not only educate parents about a new type of applications which is tough, we are trying to get Millions of downloads so we can raise a lot of money for children's charities. \nThere are so many applications in the app stores and we need to make sure that Monster Checker is visible and available to those who need it. Please contribute to our project and help children not be afraid of monsters anymore.\nWHO CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA..\nMeet my daughter Arianna\nI thought up Monster Checker when my three year old daughter Arianna was constantly waking up in the middle of the night scared and wanting to sleep with my wife and I. I knew that if my phone said there was no monsters it would reassure my daughter, kids believe technology. So I developed a prototype app and tested it. The first night I used the prototype my daughter slept through the whole night in her room and the following week before bed we would scan her room with the Monster Checker app and sure enough she would sleep through the night. \nBottom line the MONSTER CHECKER APP worked. I knew I had to share my inventions with other parents so they too could reassure their children that there were no monsters in their room and help them sleep through the night.\nPlease contribute today to help bring the Monster Checker App to all the parents needing a good night sleep.\nThe Rewards we are offering are...\nThe Win Win Package (Help us to reach our Goal and Advertise your Website, Business, or Yourself)\nMonster Checker is getting a lot of attention from our funding on Kickstarter, we were recently featured on a CBS morning news broadcast and we have more media coverage in the works. We have been contacted by tons of companies wanting to either advertise or cross promote with us. \nFor a $50 dollar contribution we will put a 200 x 200 ad on the MonsterChecker.com home page for 3 months. When the Monster Checker App launches we will be directing everyone there to download it so this will be a great place to advertise.\nWe will also personally thank you in one of our Updates to our Backers. This is a great way to show you supported Monster Checker and to advertise your business, website, blog, Facebook, or even an image of yourself.\nArianna's Reward Package\nOur 3 year old daughter says every day that she wants to help, so this package is dedicated to her. For $250 dollars Arianna will make you a custom video which we will post on MonsterChecker.com, Youtube, and our Kickstarter page. We are getting all types of media attention so this is a great way to advertise your business, website, blog, your Facebook or just yourself. \nArianna is 3 so she will do her best to say your name or company correctly and will also hold up a sign with your info so that it is clear to everyone.

Turn-based combat with swift play, over-the-top animations, action point based movement and attack system, environments and battles that gradually affect your team, crew-buffing Dozer upgrades, and tide-changing Dozer weapons!\nBattlefield Equalizers that affect overall movement and attack strategy.\nRandomly generated world! Unpredictable environments!\nRoguelike influences and RPG features, including randomly generated encounters and discoveries, meaningful permadeath, three different supplies to manage, crew veteran rankings and incredible replay value.\nDozers, the gargantuan rolling fortresses covered in armor and weapons to protect passengers and crew during the journey through Bedlam.\nFour class-based crew member types: Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle and Melee all with their own strengths, weaknesses, movement and attack ranges.\nFour unique enemy factions: Marauders, Mutants, Cyborgs and the A.I. - all with their own appearances and behaviors.\nEvolving Crew -- battle survivors will evolve into Elite and Veteran units!\n\u201cDouble-Down\u201d (a New game+): Travel back through Bedlam for the opportunity to defeat merciless overlord King Viscera and his minions for untold riches... or the sacrifice of everything!\nYour goal is to travel from the futuristic metropolis of Bysantine through the chaotic realm of Bedlam to reach the rumored utopia of Aztec City with as many of your passengers and crew intact as possible.\nYou will constantly consume supplies as you travel across Bedlam. Meat, Metal and Crude are what you will need to keep your passengers fed, your Dozer repaired and your engines running. These critical resources can be collected through random events, salvaged from defeated enemies, or received after completing quests or prevailing in battles.\nBut keep in mind that all territories, Points of Interest, NPCs and events are randomly generated at the start of each new game, encouraging multiple playthroughs for a fresh experience each time! We want to focus on the fun of finding something different in every game. The unpredictability of Bedlam is both its biggest challenge and its greatest appeal!\nIf you successfully navigate through Bedlam, you will be given an option to \"Double-Down\". This is the BEDLAM version of a New Game+ (unlockable video game mode), offering a chance to transport your crew and Dozer (with all upgrades and weapons) back across Bedlam for subsequent journeys - but remember, it's double-or-nothing!\nUpdate #10 goes into detail about the gameflow of BEDLAM!\nCheck out these jaw-dropping, ear-melting BEDLAM tunes composed by none other than Kevin Riepl (GEARS OF WAR)!\n* Hit play and continue reading to get the whole BEDLAM experience!\n\"Drifters\" by Kevin Riepl\n \"Marauders!\" by Kevin Riepl\nOur battle system is called blitz because the battles are swift, aggressive and intense \u2013 it\u2019s an all-out attack from the very beginning! Opposition beware!\nThe battles in BEDLAM will offer plenty of depth and variety! A battlefield is similar to a chessboard, with an isometric view and each opposing side taking turns. Battlefields can be a variety of sizes and many special battles will take place on larger or irregular-sized boards. Certain battlefields will also feature protective cover, making every battle different!\nDuring a turn, each side has two action points to expend. Because there is no forced character turn-order or action order, these action points can be used in many ways. During each turn, you will decide which crew member(s) to move and/or attack, or which Dozer Upgrade or Weapon to use. Each turn gets you closer to ultimately destroying the enemy and overcoming that territory!\nYou also have the option of retreat! It just depends on how much of your crew and resources you are willing to risk versus the possible rewards you could acquire!\nA significant strategic element during combat is the inclusion of battlefield Equalizers! These items and objects are randomly inserted onto battlefields and can take many forms: atomic waste barrels, dead creatures, scrap containers, vendetta contraptions, or even packages of coveted resources! Some Equalizers can be used as temporary cover, but you\u2019ll need to be cautious as they can also be destroyed by incoming weapon fire, resulting in the loss of any valuables they might hold!\nIn order to gather the riches that may result from various Equalizers, you will need to maneuver a crew member to that position -- which means weighing the risk of those rewards against coming under attack from foes. The caveat is that you must collect these bonus items BEFORE each battle ends!\nYOUR BATTLE CREW\nYour Battle Crew is the first and last line of defense against the hostile enemies that roam the wasteland trying to claim territories throughout Bedlam, threatening the progress of your Dozer and the safety of your passengers. Your crew can be deployed in teams of up to six members, including one Elite or Veteran.\nCrew member death is permanent! Those who survive will gain higher levels of experience and status, allowing them to equip deadlier weapons against the ferocious enemies in Bedlam!\nCREW MEMBER CLASSES\nFrontliner (Melee)\nThe Melee class is both the sturdiest and most agile combatant, ready to dash directly into hand-to-hand combat and inflict punishment as well as absorb it. Another strategic use of a Melee combatant is to treat them as a human shield for more vulnerable Rifle crew members.\nTrencher (Shotgun)\nAs the close-combat weapon specialists on the Dozer crew, the Shotgun class is fairly resilient and packs whopping firepower when the enemy is near, but is much less effective at a distance.\nGunslinger (Pistol)\nThe Pistol class is a great balanced soldier with moderate endurance, movement and weapon range. These hand-cannon hotshots are also the only class with run-and-gun ability.\nDeadeye (Rifle)\nThe long-distance engagement expert in your crew, the Rifle class has the lowest health and movement range but also deals the greatest damage at the furthest distance. These sharpshooters are integral to any good battle plan and should be protected!\nELITES\nA variety of Elite characters from various Factions can be discovered and recruited during your travels through Bedlam... or they can be promoted from existing crew members through in-game events.\nOver time, as crew members survive brutal battles and toxic environments, their bodies may show signs of heavy physical damage or radiation effects. These are tracked by meters on each crew member, and when the corresponding levels reach a certain plateau, you will have a chance to convert that crew member to an Elite class as a Cyborg or Mutant!\nCyborgs are considered a \u201cHeavy Weapons\u201d class, which has greater health and inflicts more damage. Mutants are the \u201cMega Melee\u201d class that can deliver a tremendous amount of melee brutality, but also has access to powerful grenades and healing abilities.\nIf you decide not to convert your crew member into a Cyborg or Mutant, they will remain human and have the opportunity to reach the coveted Veteran Status... if they can survive long enough!\nVETERANS\nThese tried-and-true crew members have survived more battles and seen more horrors than they\u2019d care to remember. They have shunned ALL cyborg enhancements or biological improvements and have embraced their own humanity as the strongest weapon in their arsenal. These rare and legendary characters live by their own rules, and can help turn the tide of battle in an instant!\nYou can usually only have ONE Veteran or Elite crew member on the battlefield at any time, so choose your team wisely!\nDOZER UPGRADES\nDozer upgrades are technologies that can be purchased through NPCs, discovered by exploring locations, or acquired after successfully negotiating a hostile situation. You never know what you'll find on any given playthrough!\nDozer Upgrades (like the Dreadhound Kennel above) can be used during battle with major effects, giving your crew members various buffs and powers, calling in reinforcements, or even raising the dead! Possible upgrades and technologies include an Alchemist laboratory, robotic research department, nuclear engines, science facility, cloning vats, agricultural center, meat processing plant and sick bay.\nUpdate #3 has more information about Dozer Upgrades!\nDOZER WEAPONS\nLast but not least are the devastating Dozer weapons that can be discovered during your journey through Bedlam. Only a single weapon can be installed on your Dozer at a time, and each has a specific impact and recharge timer. Spin up the Gatling cannons to deal vicious area-of-effect damage, or trigger a laser strike to blaze a lethal line of light across the battle board! \nDuring your navigation through Bedlam, these primary Dozer weapons can also unlock inaccessible areas if you have the proper tool for the job -- with lasers equipped, you could cut through a crashed spaceship's hull to search for extraterrestrial technologies, while missiles could demolish that landslide blocking your path, revealing a new route through Bedlam.\nWhile forming a battle strategy, you must factor crew member positions, relative health of all friend and foe combatants, control of key battle board areas, crew-impacting Dozer upgrades and, of course, the primary Dozer weapon.\nIf you plan your battles effectively, triumph is assured! On the other hand, a few wrong choices could result in grisly death... and once a crew member falls in combat, they are lost for the remainder of the game (\"permadeath\"). The wasteland is a cruel and unforgiving place!\nSuccessful outcomes in battle earn resources that can be used for barter, upgrades, or Dozer improvements. However, enemy victory can result in game failure \u2014 a Dozer is defeated once its armor is obliterated or when all passengers and crew are eliminated, sending you back to the beginning for a fresh start.\nThe realm of Bedlam is the result of the catastrophic clashes of black science that caused the Barren Age... and the impact of those terrible wars still linger after centuries.\nCivilization survived and ultimately flourished in the spectacular walled metropolis of Bysantine... but as this technological marvel begins to fall victim to overcrowding, class distinction, corporate conflict and organized crime, there is a new hope in the distant utopia of Aztec City!\nYour travels through Bedlam may take you into tachyon mists that can distort time before your very eyes, hallucinogenic squalls that can present literally unreal threats, alternate-dimensional bleeds that can drop legendary parallel-reality champions into battle with (or against) you, or ancient necrotech that can reanimate the skeletal remains of long-fallen warriors... with a vengeance!\nThe unpredictable environment can even affect battles. Because of Bedlam's constantly fluctuating climate, your combatants may have to fight during blinding blizzards of crimson ash, near patches of homicidal vegetation, or in confounding fields of X-ray wavelengths. Or a corrosive enzyme cyclone could suddenly swirl through the middle of an encounter, which may prompt the enemy (or your own crew) to flee or risk molecular degeneration!\nTemporal anomalies, freak storms, bone soldiers and deadly apparitions? It's no exaggeration to say that anything can happen in these bizarre lands -- Bedlam truly earned its namesake!\nRandom Events\nYour path through Bedlam will take you through a series of Faction-controlled territories, and your Dozer traverses each of these areas by navigating and visiting separate Points of Interest.\nArriving at a Point of Interest may lead to a Boomtown -- settlements like Gluttonhold and Trudgefoot dotting the charred domain -- or you could be sent immediately into battle with the dominant Faction of the territory. But it could also initiate a Random Event, delivered to you via NPCs through the Dozer's Communications Window.\nKing Viscera\nThe massive and merciless tormenter who proclaims himself the overlord of Bedlam, King Viscera is known mostly for his fearsome blood-streaked armor and complete lack of compunction.\nThough he rarely handles matters personally, he dispatches his infamous (and particularly vicious) patrols to eliminate his competition, harass the denizens of independent Boomtowns, and generally disrupt any semblance of peace. All the while, he scours the blackened sands of Bedlam for valuable artifacts to help him gain the dominating power he seeks. During your journey through Bedlam, you will become keenly aware of King Viscera's notoriety. And there's a very good chance you will encounter his scouting parties, because despite the expanse of Bedlam, it would be all but impossible to hide your rolling fortress from his attention... and it's just the kind of thing he would desire.\nBut will you also have the opportunity (or misfortune) to actually face him? Even the mighty Dozer may not provide protection if you cross his path or draw his wrath!\nSimply put, we want to be completely in control of both the design and execution of the game! We at Skyshine have all spent years working at large companies, which in turn have large publishers behind them - and it is always the same story. The publisher will flex its muscles and insist the game design bends to 'current trends', while demanding the game ships on their schedule (even when it's not ready) just to meet quarterly numbers. Been there, done that! Now it is our turn!\nBut... we need your help! So we are asking you for your support in raising enough money (or more) to escape the metaphorical shackles and bring to market our vision of BEDLAM!\nKickstarter also empowers us to go directly to you, the gamers who love to play role-playing games, to get your support, input and feedback that would normally be impossible. We look forward to working with enthusiastic fans to make the game of our dreams together.\nSo come aboard this journey and become a backer and future BEDLAM player!\nDigital downloads of the game (ALL TIERS) are your choice of Steam keys for the PC or Mac version.\nWe are aiming to release BEDLAM in Late Summer 2015 (with a few months possibly added for polish based on beta results).\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in creating fun and captivating role-playing games.

Our new product Rhino Shield Crash Guard is about to change that. Rhino Shield Crash Guard is unique, as it offers extreme protection without any bulk.\nDesign details\nThe Crash Guard bumper features a minimal design approach. Our goal is to cover up as little of your device as possible while adding maximum protection. Our Crash Guard bumper- style case allows for as much exposure of your device and Apple\u2019s original design as possible. The Crash Guard bumper has a matte finish, which is not only fashionable, but also serves as a means of enhancing your grip on your device. The finish also serves to make the bumper more durable as it is harder to scratch (unlike cases and bumpers with a glossy/ candy shell finish, which scratch very easily).\nCrash Guard prototype for iPhone 6 (Actual product photo)\nCrash Guard prototype for the iPhone 5 (Actual product photo)\nIPhone 6+ with RhinoShield crash guard and screen protector\nThe bumper uses hard and soft polymer construction to perfectly fit and wrap your iPhone. The Rhino Shield Crash Guard bumper will not slide around like many silicone, TPU or some snap-on cases. We also pay special attention to ensure all the buttons (power, volume, etc.) are fully accessible, and all the ports have sufficient openings so they are easily accessible and compatible with headphones (including Beats by Dr. Dre) and third-party charging accessories.\nSchematic drawing of iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 plus\nTechnology:\nThe Rhino Shield Crash Guard is packed with new technologies. There are two levels of innovation in our bumper case design. The most important is the Egg Drop material, which provides more than 90% of its impact absorbing capability.\n24ft-drop test\nThe product, while similar in design to current bumpers, is much stronger than anything ever created in the space. Based upon our R&D in developing the polymer formulation used in our Rhino Shield impact resistant screen protectors, we created a new polymer blend, capable of absorbing tremendous impact without adding any bulk, as you will see in the video.\niPhone 6 bumper with honeycomb structure\n The bumper used with our screen protector is fully capable of providing at least the same level of impact protection as many leading brands or any other brick-like case product, and our product adds almost ZERO bulk. The polymer used in the manufacture of our bumper differentiates it from everything else currently on the market.Anybody can wrap a phone in a brick to protect it from being damaged. We think the real skill is in developing materials fully capable of providing the highest levels of protection while shrinking that protection down to the form factor of the device.\nEggdrop technology could save that egg\nWe push the impact protection boundary even further by utilizing an innovation in structure, the \u201cHoneycomb Structure\u201d within the inner lining of the bumper. This will add an additional 10%-15% of overall impact absorbency to that of just the materials alone. This property has been known to have an excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio, which helps to improve the overall effectiveness of the material by spreading the area of impact across a larger physical area, in effect reducing the force at any given point (the actual point of impact).\nImpact dispersion around the bumper case\nBend Protection:\nAs many of us know, the iPhone 6 Plus has proven bendable through normal usage. (# bendgate). The Rhino Shield Crash Guard offers protection against bending for your iPhone. When properly installed (and the install isn\u2019t rocket science), the Crash Guard bumper can protect your device against more than 225 pounds (or close to 100Kg) of pressure.\nYou will see in our video a demonstration of an iPhone protected with our bumper that is run over by a car, which survives the impact without any damage.\nThe bumper is also screen protector-friendly. While it will be compatible with most screen protectors on the market, the overall impact protection you see demonstrated in our videos will only be achieved with the use of our Rhino Shield impact resistant screen protector.\n<Due to the curved edges of the iPhone 6, the fitting of your Rhino Shield screen protector is manufactured to cover the flat, forward facing portion of the screen, but it will not wrap around the curved edge. The shield is manufactured to cover the entire display area of the device. Our bumper is designed to cover the curved edge and leave no area of the screen exposed.>\nThe bumper style case reflects simplicity while offering a possibility for personalization. We hope to offer many fashion colors.\nDifferent colour, same protection\n RHINO SHIELD Crash Guard are currently available for the iPhone 5/5S/5C  the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.\nColour options of the RHINO SHIELD Crash Guard\nSpecial Thanks to Patrick Calderon for working really hard with us and has been a great help with PR exposure and crowdfunding expertise!

We designed this game to take seconds to learn and minutes to play, but offer a vast ocean of depth to explore.\nThe game is about destroying your enemy's three crystals before they take out yours. You play your cards onto the board in real time, so every second is packed with tactical decisiveness. Fight over territory, out-flank your foe, and prepare your ultimate attack. As the game progresses, the pace will pick up and more powerful characters hit the board faster. Will your forces be ready for the onslaught?\nMany Spirit Siege characters have special abilities which you can leverage for gaining the upper hand in a match.

We\u2019re building a system that involves the community. The Living Game will find balance by adjusting the cost of overplayed and underplayed cards slowly over time.

One comes for Honor.\nWill you summon the strongest army? - Will you be the first to take the capitol? - Will your magic outwit your opponents? - Will you be the last King standing?\nKing Down is an epic strategy game for 2-4 players, where each player allies themselves with one King, hand picks their army and goes into battle by competing to take down the other Kings and cross the board to victory.\nDescribed as \u2018the prequel to Chess\u2019, King Down incorporates age-old, intricate and fascinating mechanics from \u2018the Game of Kings\u2019 but breaks all the rules by reimagining the classic pieces, introducing brand new characters, and including new spell cards, strategies, tactics and win conditions. King Down is a brand new game that will stand the test of time and last the ages.\n\n\"King Down is really its own game with new objectives and a very different feel. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that it looks spectacular.

The game is already pretty tight, quick, and highly entertaining. It\u2019s both immediately familiar, yet fresh and new feeling at the same time.\" Purple Pawn\n\"Saar Shai's creativity and love of creating games that are both visually stunning and mentally stimulating is evident from the very start.

Saar devised a unique, new mechanic known as \u2018double-edged cards\u2019 and designed a tactical card game around it. \u2018The Agents\u2019 was the unexpected success story of the Kickstarter gaming world in 2013, and with an awesome, supportive community spurring him on, Saar is thrilled to now be able to introduce himself as a \u2018game designer\u2019 when he meets new people at dinner parties.\nDream Catcher was founded by Rafi Ben Aharon and Nadav Shlomo Giladi.
