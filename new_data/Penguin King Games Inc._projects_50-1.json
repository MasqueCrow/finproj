Discover an incredible world, fight against different enemies and create your own adventure, making your own experience. Help the moonwalkers to bring the magic to their universe again.\nPlanned for endings of 2021.\n The Moonwalkers promised to be the keepers and the protectors of the magic. All the portals that bring you to new places have been closed and forgotten into the realm of the moonwalkers; your mission is to visit them, bring your magic to every world and resurrect their essence to keep them alive.\n Kandra, the main character, will be the chosen one to make this happen. Her feathers bring magic and with them you can make the world alive once again, fight against all kinds of dangers and collect all old artifacts to make all this possible.\n Several years ago, the moonwalkers disappeared, taking magic with them. Darkness took place and brought corruption, and then, all portals suddenly closed. But now, your mission is to travel around every universe and bring purity to all this worlds.\n\n\nKandra is the main character, the chosen one. She is a moonwalker, a race of spiritual creatures which are the protectors of the magic.\nBeing really young, she starts this adventure with us, to complete her training and get the knowledge to control the magic power of her feathers.\nAs a moonwalker, she gets her feathers from her spiritual form, always available when she is prepared to attack or wants to fly around this amazing universe.\nSoley is an ancient Moonwalker, older than Kandra. He will be our mentor and will help us discover all dangers and history surrounding us, to have a complete knowledge about what happened while the moonwalkers were away.\nWhile we explore, we will find different characters that will need our help. We will face enemies to protect them or to get items they are in need of, to restore the balance once again on \"Mystic's lake\" lands.\n\nWithout magic, all kinds of dangers appeared, causing troubles and bringing corruption. Our mission is to defeat them and keep our people safe.\nThe prisms are the most valuable object in this universe. With them, you will be able to unlock new paths for your adventure. Find them in every world and collect them!\nThe moonwalker\u2019s feathers have been stolen, all of them are unique and we are in need to find them to recover the magic in our world!\nThose feathers appear from the moonwalker's magic shape. All of them are very important for the moonwalkers. This feathers bring the magic alive and will erase the corruption and darkness created by our enemies.\n\nThose are the gates to brand new areas, find them and expand your horizons in that incredible universe!\nKandra's universe is full of landscapes, sunsets and secret places awaiting for you to step in for the first time in centuries. The moonwalker's lands are alive, with their stories, their people and an ancient knowledge ready to be shared with you if you are ready for it!\n\nEvery corner hides a challenge, every step leads you to a maze, every wonder suits you with a question without an answer, and you must find all the clues to solve it, which are hidden deep within yourself. All worlds have their own puzzles, that will give you the feathers you need to collect.\nFace your enemies with your powers and clean the corruption that has been established.\nAll music in \"Kandra: The Moonwalker\" has been made by ourselves. Each piece is a reflection of Kandra\u00b4s world. We try hard that their melodies were not mere accompanists, but a complement to the story we tell, printing feeling and enriching the player's experience, because Kandra is not just a game, it prettends to settle as a memory of those that you can't stop to remember. Here you have an example, enjoy!\n * All rewards with an asterisk include rewards above, except the reseller's pack.\nAll included in designer's pack will be modified if necessary to be adjusted to the game.\n\nThe current plan is to release Kandra: The Moonwalker for Steam on Windows and Mac platforms first. Searching to expand for consoles.\n            We are planning to launch \"Kandra: The Moonwalker\" in English and Spanish.\n            With time, we are planning to expand this to more languages in the future.\nBased in Spain, our team consist in 15 passionate talents. This include both permanent crew members and collaborators.

The correct phrasing to say the game is included in these tiers is \"as well as the previous rewards\" or \"on top of the previous rewards\". And this phrasing would also mean that the 75 euro also includes the OST. The last thing about the pledges is that you've limited the amount of backers who can get 1 copy of the game.

You wake up on the beach of a foreign island, unable to recall anything. Alone and equipped with only basic farming tools provided by the town residents, you aim to recover your memories. Complete quests and explore Omoide Island as you unfold your story.\nGifted a small and empty plot of land by the mayor, transform and manage the terrain as it blossoms into your own unique farm. From growing crops, planting trees and flowers, and raising your own animals, you are free to choose the life you want.\nBe careful where you plant your crops as certain plants only grow during a particular season!\nCooking\nAs your farm grows, you are sure to harvest plenty of fruits and vegetables. Instead of selling your produce in full, why not save some of those fresh ingredients for yourself? There are many recipes that can be discovered on the island.\nTip: Be sure to restore your stamina by preparing food to take with you for long and busy days!\nMining\nStaying cooped up inside all day can be quite boring, why not go on an adventure to liven your day? Head down to the mines to release some pent up energy and explore a network of secret caves. You may stumble upon precious gems and mine ores which you can utilize to upgrade and improve your tools. If you dare to visit deeper into the mines, you may discover rare resources. What treasures will you bring home?\nFishing\nSome days are meant for hard work while others call for a bit of leisure. What better way to relax than to take your beloved pet out for a fishing trip? Omoide Island has a variety of water sources that yield different fish, so feel free to explore and catch them all! Not only can you enjoy the day fishing, but you can also bring home a freshly-caught dinner. Don\u2019t forget to continuously upgrade your fishing rod to tackle bigger and rarer fish.\nRelationships\nYou don\u2019t have to be isolated on your farm, feel free to speak with and befriend the townsfolk. You may have items to trade with those in town, or perhaps you just wish to visit. Every island resident has a unique personality and carefully tailored backstory - it\u2019s up to you to learn all about them!\nImprove your relationships by completing side quests for your neighbors - you may even fetch a better buying and selling price from them or unlock special rewards. Friendship may even turn into romance when you least expect it.\nQuests\nThe residents of Omoide Island will need help on occasion. If someone is in need, you can view their request on the bulletin board in town or you may receive a letter directly. Don\u2019t worry if you are busy with another task as side quests and missions are optional.\nCurrently, there are two types of quests available: the main quest linked directly to your character\u2019s storyline and optional side quests. The former will lead your character to uncover their forgotten memories and answer the question of what happened before arriving on the island?\nThe latter quests will allow you to improve your relationships and unlock unique items that cannot otherwise be crafted. \nPets\nWhat is life without a furry companion at your side? Pets are, and will always be, your most loyal companions. Explore Omoide Island together, give them endless pets, and play until the sun sets. Your pet, aside from keeping you company, can also assist with farming duties. When exploring more dangerous areas of the island, it may be best to leave your companion at home for their safety. \nPets Currently Available:\nAnimals\nIn addition to planting and managing your crops, you can also raise farm animals. Care for your adorable neighbors with feeding, grooming, cleaning, and - of course - plenty of petting! Your animals love to be showered with affection and, in return, will yield a variety of important resources such as milk, eggs, wool, and feathers.\nIf you have animals of different genders in the same barn or coop, they may even make a family of their own.\nCharacter Customization\nIf you ever feel the need to upgrade your look, spice things up by altering your wardrobe or hair. While your character\u2019s gender is chosen early on in the game, you have the full ability to customize your character by switching hairstyles, eye and skin color, and clothing. Looking for a new outfit? Different clothing can be found all around Omoide Island!\nHome and Base Customization\nOne of the most important places is your home. Your home is where you relax and unwind after a long day\u2019s work. Upgrade your space to have everything from a larger interior to new and decorative furniture. Take it a step further and customize your farm by having full control over barn placement, coops, fences, and more!\nWeather\nOmoide Island will experience four different seasons with each having their own festivals.\nSpring - brings cherry blossoms to the island\nSummer - has plenty of sunshine\nAutumn - leaves change color and fall to the earth\nWinter - soft snow and slick ice\nMain Areas\nYour Farm - this is where you start a new life and, while it may begin with an empty plot of land and a basic home, make it yours!\nOmoide Town - the island\u2019s residents live here. This is where you will handle business transactions.\nThe Forest - has beautiful scenery, including a waterfall. You can complete a variety of activities in this location such as chopping wood, fishing, and foraging for herbs and flowers.\nThe Mountains - uncover cave entrances in this area where you can mine for ores and gems.\nThe Beach - what island is complete without a stunning beach?

We want to be able to grow our team and also convert our part-time team members to full-time. Kickstarter will also bring awareness to the game and help us build a community filled with farm-sim lovers who are passionate in helping with the development process. We would love to add more features and customization options to the game. However, we don't have the resources to pursue these projects, despite having a plethora of ideas. We believe Kickstarter will help us achieve a portion of our dreams: by building a farm-sim that everyone will enjoy playing.\nBased in Singapore, our team is made up of nine individuals that are passionate in game development.  Some of us are developing A New Leaf: Memories part-time and we hope to convert everyone to full-time with the help of this Kickstarter.\nThis Kickstarter page is powered by Crytivo - a California-based Indie Game Publisher running successful Kickstarters since 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile our team has been working hard these past fourteen months and have many contingency plans in place, unexpected problems can still happen.

An individual named Haevermaet Anthony did not provide any services or assistance to the campaign and any such representations by such an individual are false.\n\n Press Kit |  Discord |  Reddit | \nClick to read the summary of the campaign in Spanish and Catalan or scroll down to read it in English\n Elementallis is a 2D top-down adventure mimicking the style and feel of classic 2D Zelda games. Explore a vast world and conquer the dungeons to restore all the Elements and use them to solve puzzles, defeat your foes and progress on your adventure. \nAs a descendant of elementallists, you took part on the disruption of the Elements and now you'll need to travel the world and restore them with the aid of your newly met Elemental. Explore the lands of Elregir, help its inhabitants, face enemies and strong bosses and solve puzzles in your quest to restore the Elements and bring back the world to its former balance.\n Features\nProve your worth in the 8 dungeons, full of puzzles, secrets, enemies and bosses.\n Use the Elements to fight, solve puzzles and uncover previously inaccessible areas in a metroidvania-esque style.\nDiscover the 8 different biomes and help its inhabitants.\nFight in real-time combat and defeat your foes using the Elements wisely to exploit their weaknesses.\nExperience a story about growth and overcoming guilt. \n Elementallis is coming to Steam (Windows), Nintendo Switch, PS4/5, Xbox and itch.io in June 2022.\nPLAY\n\nFootage of Elementallis running on the Nintendo Switch\nLanguages\nElementallis will be available in English, Spanish and Catalan. More languages will be considered later in development.\nThe Elements are the focal point in Elementallis. Each one of them is crafted to serve you in combat, puzzle-solving and exploration. \n\n Fire - Allows you to cast a fireball that ignites flammable environmental objects such as vegetation and torches. Also sets enemies on fire!\nMake your way by burning obstacles and set your enemies on fire! Be careful though, you are also flammable!\nFire can allow you to see in dark places\n Nature - Grow vines that help you climb and access new undiscovered areas or grow plants that drain your enemies' life.\nSome paths are inaccessible until you use the proper Element to overcome them\n Wind - Dash with the wind to move faster, avoid pits and dodge your enemies' attacks.\nUsing the Wind dash, you'll avoid falling into pits\n Earth - Create an area of effect that destroys rocks, opens sealed paths and damages and repels your enemies when you are surrounded.\nEarth makes a small earthquake\n Water - Introduce yourself in a floating bubble that will help you traverse through rivers and lakes. The bubble will protect yourself from enemy attacks until it bursts. You can also extinguish fire with the bubble!\nWater protects you from enemy attacks and slows them down\n Ice - Freeze heavy objects with Ice so they can slide and be moved. Also applies to enemies!\nWhen frozen, enemies can be pushed without you taking damage\n Lightning - Electrocute your enemies and paralyze them with a lightning bolt!\nZap!\n Combine Elements for more powerful effects!\nWater + Lightning / Ice + Earth\nYour Elemental changes depending on the Element you have equipped\n Elementallis will feel very familiar to Zelda-like fans. The main pillars of Elementallis' gameplay are:\n\n Combat: Real-time combat using a weapon, shield and the Elements at your disposal. You'll need to dodge your foes' attacks and strike them taking into account their weaknesses.\nUse every tool in your arsenal to defeat your enemies\n Exploration: The land of Elregir is formed by 8 different biomes (forest, swamp, mountains, volcanoes...) and is full of secrets to discover, treasures, caves, people to meet and challenges to overcome.\n Puzzle-solving: You'll find most of the puzzles in each region's dungeon. You will need to use the right abilities and think laterally to solve them. Solving them will reward you with important items or allow you to progress.\nThe lands of Elregir are formed by 8 different biomes and each one of them is sustained by one of the Elements.\nYou will explore a vast and diverse world where you'll discover towns, caves, secret locations and dungeons.\nEach region has its own dungeon. Complete its challenges to restore the dungeon's Element. When an Element is restored, your Elemental will absorb some of its power and it will grant you the ability to use said Element.\nYou have obtained the Fire Element!\nIn Elementallis, you'll face a very diverse cast of enemies in each of the regions you explore. Some of these enemies will be based around an Element, so they might be weak or strong against some of the Elements you use.\n\nAn example cast of enemies\nYou'll also face some stronger enemies, mini bosses and bosses that will test your combat abilities.\nUse Fire to damage that Candle monster!\nThis Golem is guarding something important...\nFor us, Elementallis is a love letter to the games we used to play when we were kids. But when you remember something, you usually idealize it. With Elementallis we'd like to honor our memories and try to enhance the visuals and music that we remember. That's why we want to go beyond pixel art and chiptune music in order to create something unique.\n\nGraphics\nTaking inspiration from Gameboy and SNES games for the pixel art, we are mixing it with modern effects such as lightning, post-processing, particles and shaders to achieve a unique aesthetic that feels both modern and nostalgic.\nDemonstration of all the effects that are used to achieve our art style\n\nMusic\nWe are approaching music in the same way, using orchestral music but evoking the nostalgia of the old platforms by adding 8 bit sounds.\nClick here to play the demo!\nWe've made some exciting rewards to show our appreciation for our backers! \nWould you like to know more about the Designer! tiers?

Keep in mind that we are showing prototypes and they can be subject to small changes.\n\nCollector's Edition \nEverything is included in the Golden Case\nPlushie\nHand-made plushies made by Boira Plushies with high quality materials and details.\nYou can choose which Elemental do you like as a plushie!\n\n Switch Physical Edition\nSwitch Regular Physical Edition with case, game cartridge and manual (cover design might be subject to change)\n Acrylic Pins of the Elementals\nAcrylic Pins of the Elemental in its different forms\n Acrylic Standee\nAcrylic Standee recreating the protagonist obtaining the Fire Element\nSet of Postcards\nSet of 3 Postcards\nArtbook (also available as digital)\nArtbook (Digital and Physical)\nDouble-sided Poster\nDouble-sided poster\nSoundtrack CD (also available in digital)\nSoundtrack (Digital and Physical)\n When you select your reward, you can also add the following items as add-ons.\nHello everyone! I'm Iv\u00e1n Ruiz Lozano, the designer and programmer of Elementallis.\nMy love for video games began at a very early age and I have very fond memories playing with my friends and family, specially on Gameboy. I've always been interested in computers and coding, and after some years working at an IT company, I decided that I wanted to focus on something more creative and started learning game development. \nAfter saving some money and when I felt comfortable with Unity and game design, I decided to quit my job to build Elementallis, my passion project, intending to deliver the same experience I had playing as a child.\nI'm working alongside Lu\u00e2n and Ra\u00fal, the best partners I could have asked for :)\n\nLu\u00e2n Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u1ecdng - Pixel Artist\nHi everyone! My name is Lu\u00e2n, I have been working with Pixel Art since 2017 and have worked on multiple game projects around the world.  I love working with cute things, cool things and both together are even better!\nMy inspiration to become a pixel artist is the Metal Slug series - the monument to the pixel art game! \n\nRa\u00fal Sangonzalo Terrado - Composer\nHi there! I'm Ra\u00fal, a music composer and guitarist, but also a developer. After many years of studying blues and progressive rock, I got fascinated by the way some music game composers combined them with orchestral and electronic sounds, especially in the realm of the 90s JRPGs, such as Nobuo Uematsu and Yoshinori Mitsuda. I evoke the nostalgia of these old platforms by adding 8 bit sounds to my music.\n\nWe've also worked with incredible talented folks such as Marcel Mosqi (cover art), Nicole Marie T (first songs and main theme for our previous trailer) and S\u00e1ndalo Espino (logo). \nThe project started with my own savings and this allowed me to work full time on the game and hire the necessary work that I couldn't do myself. Now we have the main mechanics of the game and the art and music for some early areas of the game.\nWith this Kickstarter campaign you will help us continue making progress on the game. You will help us achieve our dream: releasing our very own game. We'd like to contribute to the medium with our own entry.\nGame development is our passion and we are enjoying the experience very much, with your help, we can continue doing so and if we can continue working on the game full time, we will be able to release the game sooner.\n\nBudget breakdown\nYour contributions will ensure that I can work full time on the game and pay for the works of our team. The rest will go towards your rewards, shipping, Kickstarter cuts and taxes.\nYou can follow development progress on our social media, pick your preferred platform for updates and behind-the-scenes content!\nWishlist Elementallis on Steam!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have made a planning and roadmap taking into account bug testing and unforeseen events. You will always be updated of the state of the project with the monthly updates.\n\nMost of the groundwork for the game is already done: main mechanics, some abilities, art direction and style, music direction and main story. What's left is to add all the abilities, build more areas of the world and populate them, adding enemies, secrets and characters.\n\nTo ensure that the game is as polished and bug free as possible, we will be testing it thoroughly locally and in beta tests (we hope you can help us with it!).\n\nYour feedback is very valuable to us, with your help we can create something great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Stay updated!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udd14 Exclusive backer updates and videos\n\ud83d\udcac Exclusive Discord role and channel", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["35 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Customize your reward!", "descp": "Customize your own reward and add every physical or digital items you want!

Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.\nEncounter creatures both wonderous and horrifying (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nThe default tone for Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with starships cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost.\nVisit Remote Settlements on perilous worlds (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nIt's a dangerous life for anyone living in the Forge, and doubly so for the Ironsworn\u2014those adventurers bound to sworn quests.\nSwear iron vows and see them fulfilled or forsaken (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nInspiration comes from the the quest-driven adventures of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and outer-rim locations of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated suspense and industrial grittiness of Alien, the desperation and retro-tech of the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the mysticism of Dune, and the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse. It's all blended together into a heady stew of perilous sci-fi adventure, and topped with a dollop of Guardians of the Galaxy gonzo.\nMost aspects of the setting can be adjusted to your preferences. The campaign launch exercises offer inspiring prompts and guidance to immerse you in a galaxy of your own creation. \nThe Art\nStarforged is packed with amazing illustrations by lead artist Joshua Meehan. Josh composites photos, textures, 3d objects, and hand-painted elements to create a vibrant, cinematic rendering of the people, places, and perils of the Forge.\nSet off on perilous expeditions (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nJosh uses the Starforged oracle tables and generators to help build the unique subjects and aspects of each illustration. The art is directly inspired by the game!\nDevelopment process for an Ironsworn: Starforged illustration - from initial concept to finished piece (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nExplore mysterious precursor sites (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nIt's a perilous galaxy, so consider bringing an ally (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nFace deadly foes in high-action battles (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nThe System\nStarforged is true to Ironsworn's roots, tuned to fit the spaceborne setting, while incorporating experience and feedback from years of development and play. \nIf you're new to Ironsworn, here's a summary of how it works.\nThree Ways to Play\nLike it's predecessor,  Ironsworn: Starforged offers three ways to play.\n Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.\n Co-Op You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.\n Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous galaxy. Good luck!\nYour Character\nThe Starforged playscape, with print-and-play asset cards and character sheet.\nYour character in Starforged is composed of stats and trackers. These elements help you determine the outcome when you perform risky actions.\nAs you complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, you gain experience. You spend this experience to add assets\u2014vehicles, modules, paths, companions, and deeds\u2014which deepen your abilities and options.\nCharacter creation is fast and flexible, with a guided exercise to help define your background, resources, expertise, and goals.\nMoves\nMoves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in Starforged. \nFor solo and co-op play,  moves help resolve your actions and trigger new opportunities and complications. For guided play, moves take an active role in the conversation between the guide and the other players.\nSample move from Starforged.\nIronsworn: Starforged moves are inspired by the innovative, fiction-first mechanics of the Apocalypse World system created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.\nMomentum\nThe momentum meter is one of your character's most important mechanical attributes.\nMomentum is a special mechanic which is core to playing Starforged.  You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. You lose momentum when you suffer a cost which causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.\nYou can use momentum to gain a decisive result \u2014 or avoid dire failure \u2014 on a critical move.\nAction Roll\nWhen you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, roll three dice at once:  An action die (D6) and two challenge dice (D10). Add your relevant stat and any bonuses to your action die. This is your action score.  Then, compare your action score to each of the challenge dice and check for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. The move will tell you how to interpret the result.\nThere are three possible outcomes for the action roll:\n Strong Hit: Your action score beats (is greater than) both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.\n Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.\n Miss: Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions\nThe Oracles\nStarforged Oracles are random prompts and generators which help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide creative backup for the guide in guided play. They are an inspiration engine--ready to introduce amazing locations, surprising revelations, and dire challenges to your Starforged campaign.\nMockup of oracle tables within the Starforged rulebook.\nIf you loved the oracles in Ironsworn, you'll find much more to love here. It's an entire galaxy of possibilities! Plus, these tables are largely system agnostic and can be paired with other sci-fi systems. \nStarforged oracles are included in the Preview Edition, which is an immediate reward for backing this campaign.\nShipping Info\nThe pledge levels do not include shipping. After the Kickstarter concludes, you will pay shipping for any physical rewards through the pledge manager. \nHere is a list of shipping estimates by region. \nContiguous USA: $11-$16\nEU/UK: $20-$25\nNorway/Switzerland: $33-$41\nCanada: $20-$25\nAustralia: $21-$25\nNew Zealand: $21-$34\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: $12-$17\nRest of Asia: $24-$36\nAll Other Countries: $57-$120\nWe are customs-friendly in the UK/EU and many other regions!

If VAT fees apply in your region, you will be charged those fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. However, we want to alleviate these charges as much as we can,  so we will cover 50% of your VAT fees!\nLegacy Add-Ons\nIn collaboration with DriveThruRG, we are offering Ironsworn books and cards as add-on rewards during this campaign. These materials are not completely compatible with Starforged, but include mechanics, tips, and guidelines which might help enrich your Starforged campaigns. Plus, they allow you to experience vow-driven quests in the perilous fantasy setting of the Ironlands. These are the existing editions of these books and cards, and are not new versions or reprints.\nThe bad news: Shipping on these legacy items is managed separately through DriveThruRPG, and shipping cannot be combined with physical Starforged rewards. \nThe good news: You'll receive your reward codes after this Kickstarter campaign ends. You can order your legacy books and cards at that time, rather than waiting for release of Starforged. \nAs a thank you for supporting Starforged, printed legacy add-ons are discounted from current prices by about 15-20%. You can select these add-ons when choosing your backer level. If you add a legacy item to your pledge, you'll receive a code to purchase that item from DriveThruRPG for the cost of production and shipping.   Check this page at DriveThruRPG for current estimated shipping costs.\n Ironsworn Print Edition - Set off on perilous quests with this 270-page core rulebook. Winner of a Gold ENNIE award! \n Ironsworn Asset Deck (Printed Deck) - Upgrade your Ironsworn playscape with a deck of printed asset cards.  \n Ironsworn: Delve - With a vast array of new options and tools, Ironsworn: Delve is the perfect companion for your Ironsworn campaign.

Playtesting has been underway for several months. Much of the art for the book has already been completed. \n\nAbsolute Tabletop has developed dozens of RPG products, and managed four successful Kickstarter projects. They have experience with fulfillment and logistics, and will help ensure a smooth delivery for our valued backers.\n\nBecause this project involves a larger team than previous Ironsworn products, we may encounter delays due to a specific individual's availability. We will put measures in place to ensure that no one (including Shawn) is an indispensable resource that would cause a failure to deliver. We will keep the backers informed about what is happening with the project, and will provide regular preview releases of the book as it is developed. \n\nWe may also encounter delays due to unexpected issues with production and shipping. Working with our fulfillment partners, we will make our best effort to identify and resolve any issues before they impact the backers. \n\nShawn has always believed in open and transparent communication with Ironsworn fans, and this project will be no exception.

Their origins long ago lost to time, the valuable and seemingly-magical relics within are an even greater threat to all involved.\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Exploration, cheese, frogs\nDislikes: Being lectured \nGood-natured and energetic, Mirai tries to see the best in everyone. She arrived in New Riverstone a year ago with no memory of her past life. \nAfter finding the Flowstone in an ancient ruin, she can manifest Flow into physical matter, allowing her to build and modify existing structures, so long as she has enough resources. \nAs her story unfolds, she will learn that even with her newfound power, not everything broken in life can be easily put back together.\n\u201cNew Riverstone is our home. With everyone\u2019s help, I\u2019ll build a village we\u2019ll all be proud of!\u201d\nBlood Type: B\nLikes: Cinnamon rolls, Captain Crimm\nDislikes: Bullies\nA young pirate. While hot-headed and stubborn, she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about. \nTreated as disposable deadweight by some of her crew mates, Vivian has been bullied into activities that their captain would not approve of. \nThrough meeting Mirai, Vivian finds the courage to stand up for herself, even if she must stand alone.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be part of a crew that tries to justify robbing from innocent people. I'm better than this. We're better than this.\u201d\nBlood Type: A\nLikes: Word puzzles, being included\nDislikes: Show-offs, muscleheads\nThe military outcast. Marcus has a low-ranked position in the Republic of Byzankar's naval fleet. \nSoft-spoken and reserved, he thinks first before taking action. He joined the military not out of love for country, but for his fascination with Relics, ancient technology excavated from ruins around the world. \nDistrusted by most of New Riverstone, Vivian of all people will reach out to him and help him realize that some risks are worth taking.\n\u201cThese villagers did nothing wrong. There\u2019s no reason to take things this far.\u201d\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Poetry; hot tea\nDislikes: Anyone threatening his crew\nThe infamous pirate king. As the Scarlet Tusk captain, Borras Crimm is the most wanted man in the world. \nStrong-willed and decisive, he takes any and all measures necessary to secure his crew of people displaced by conflicts around the world. After a Byzankar ambush, his ship finds its way to Ocean's End. \nNormally not one to attack innocents despite his reputation, his desperation to save his starving crew sends him on a collision course with Mirai and New Riverstone.\n\u201cA captain\u2019s first duty is to their crew. Always.\u201d\nBlood Type: AB\nLikes: Training, collecting swords\nDislikes: Beggars, laziness\nThe rising star of the Byzankar fleet. Driven, calculating, and with a strong sense of justice, Cerule quickly reached the rank of Commander at a young age. \nLittle is known about her, besides a reputation as a fierce naval combatant. When she finally corners the elusive Borras Crimm at his most vulnerable, a deeply-sown seed of vengeance begins to bloom, threatening to consume her.\n\u201cI won\u2019t permit anyone to leave this island until I have Borras Crimm locked away in chains.\u201d\nThe town of New Riverstone\nLocated on the largest island of Ocean's End, this young town is comprised of war refugees, explorers, and those curious enough to live on the edge of civilization. Mirai has made her home here for the past year as she tries to recover her memories.\n\nThe Islands of Ocean's End\nWith sandy beaches, wooded foothills, rocky mountains, and extensive caves, Ocean's End is an explorer's paradise. \nMirai's curiosity leads through every nook and cranny of the islands as she gathers materials, evades pursuers, and looks for a way to save New Riverstone.\n\nA long-forgotten civilization\nScattered around the world are mysterious ruins of impossibly advanced technology. \nSome people revere the ruins, some plunder their secrets for their own purposes, but no one knows who the \"Panganeans\" were, or why the facilities were created. After Mirai finds the flowstone, it sets events in motion that reveals how closely she is tied to the ruins, and leaves her with a difficult choice...\n\nThe Harbinger\nThe flagship of the Mighty Byzankar Navy,  this naval destroyer is the pinnacle of Panganean-derived tech and shipbuilding prowess.  On board is a mysterious passenger, guarded by the legendary Commander Cerule, the youngest to ever earn the title. Under her guidance, the Harbinger has cornered the pirate ship \"The Scarlet Tusk\" and is prepared to use it's incredible power to end the pirate king once and for all. \nFlowstone Saga has real-time combat where your party faces off against up to 3 monsters at once. While monsters and your allies take turns attacking and using special abilities, the main character - Mirai - controls the flow of battle on the puzzle board.\nBy clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. \nSome monsters may use charge attacks which can be interrupted with your attacks. This makes it important to weigh the state of your puzzle board with the battle scenario. Is it worth it to clear some lines to defend against a special attack, or would it be better to continue to build up blocks for an even stronger counter?\nWe want Flowstone Saga to be enjoyable by everyone, not just puzzle experts. So, in addition to game difficulty options, we've created a feature called \"Hold Mode\", which is selectable before starting a new game, and anytime in-game.  \n\nIn \"Hold Mode\", battles are no longer real-time. You still move pieces around, and have access to all the same powers, but there is no 'gravity' pulling pieces down,  and enemies will not move or act in real-time. \n\nYou have total freedom to plan your next move carefully. Then, once you lock a piece in (and only then), the enemy turn gauges will increase slightly.  \n\nEventually, enemies will act, but it will be on your terms, based on the number of moves you've made - and not the passage of real time.  This way, you still have the strategy elements of where to put pieces (and make combos, use powers, clear enemy blocks, etc) and deal with enemies, but with absolutely no time pressure at all!\n\nYou can try \"Hold Mode\" for yourself in the public builds available above, or watch a quick demo in the video below!\nPLAY\n\nThere will be over 100 different foes to defeat over the course of the journey, from the adorable Beewis, to fearsome Thunder Komodos and beyond!\nJust some of the many foes you will face in your adventure\nIn addition to regular attacks, most monsters have attacks that will interact with your puzzle board. Some will drop blocks that will slowly damage Mirai until they are cleared, while others will replace her current piece with something trickier to manage. \n\nThere are dozens of different monster attacks, and each will require it's own strategy to overcome.\n\nMirai can use her powers to create or repair structures. To do this, you must fill in the overall shape of flow energy with set pieces. \nMirai creates a ladder to escape danger\nCreate objects to move to a new area, or collect an out-of-reach treasure.\nForce open locked doors, or hack computer terminals.\nRepair broken walls or barriers to defend against invaders.\nAlso scattered throughout the islands are optional ruins that Mirai can repair for bonus rewards. Maybe something special will happen if all of them are repaired...\nThough these puzzles start out easy, some are quite tricky... and equally satisfying to solve! \n\nChoose from several dozen pieces to find your perfect combination\nUnlike other falling block games, you can choose what pieces are in your \"bag\" using the power of the Flowstone. You must have 8 different pieces, which have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nSmall pieces offer flexibility and options - they fit in almost any gap!\nLarge pieces grant speed to fill the board quickly, allowing for frequent power attacks\nAlmost every piece available has link crystals that multiply damage when combined carefully. Some difficult pieces are extra powerful, so if you can use them effectively, you will reap the rewards.\nCreating a balanced loadout to suit your individual style will be the key to victory in battle!\n\n Equipment found or purchased can be enhanced with the \"Dreamcaster\", an ancient relic that allows entry into the item itself, known as an \"Item Dream\".  \nEach Item Dream is a mini-roguelike, with a small but challenging randomly-generated dungeon. The rules are simple: Defeat the boss to remove impurities, and the item grows stronger. Fail and be forcefully ejected back into the real world.\nSome gear that may appear weak initially have great power hidden within, and will require full purification to show their true form. \n\nMirai starts out with only \"Flow\" blocks, which deal physical damage.\nThroughout the game, she will harness other elements to open up new strategies.\n Fire blocks deal damage-over-time, and are a better use of small line clears\n Ice blocks freeze an enemies and prevent them from acting\n Lightning blocks have damage that scale even higher with bigger clears, and hit all enemies at once\n\nAlso, various barriers exist in the world that call for certain elements...\nNew Riverstone is always growing, and with Mirai's new powers, creating new structures is a snap...or is it?\nVillagers will have a request, and let you know what materials they need for the building to be built.\nMonsters throughout the island have stolen key items in building certain structures. Mirai will need to find the monsters and reclaim the goods!\nOnce everything has been collected, the structure can be built.\nEnjoy deliciously prepared food from Nando, once the campfire has been completed.\nBuilding some structures will provide new services or buffs to Mirai and her party on their adventure.\nSome buildings can be further upgraded to provide stronger bonuses and perks.\n\nTo help get the raw materials she will need to build the town, Mirai can team up with the happy-go-lucky but absentminded Miner, Hagan.\nThis game mode is a race against the clock, as Hagan will throw various materials onto the puzzle field. Any material block Mirai clears, she collects! \nWhen the time is up, Hagan is too sleepy to continue, and it's time to return back to town. Maybe if you can pass him a few coins, he'll extend the timer a bit longer.\nThere are many different areas to mine, each with it's own collection of resources.\nOccasionally, Hagan will find an old treasure chest filled with gold. Clearing this scores Mirai a quick payday!\n\nWhen Mirai builds the garden, it's magic somehow attracts the attention of some nearby Spirit Frogs; friendly ghosts of a legendary troupe of adventuring amphibians. \nBrave adventurer~! I lend you my power!\nFeeding them some delicious food from the garden causes them to bond with Mirai, giving her the ability to select a patron frog, who will instill in her it's Job Class abilities from it's former life.\nThe Flow-infused soil grows fresh crops remarkably fast!\nFreely swap Frog Spirits in the status screen to be able to use their abilities, based on classic Tangledeep job classes such as Brigand, Edge Thane, Paladin, and more!\nGiving Eric seeds and soil found while adventuring, or from collecting with Hagan will grow more food in the garden.\nFeed the Sprit Frogs the collected food to level them up and learn more powerful skills and perks!\nAs you level up the spirit frogs, the job buffs they provide get stronger!\n\nLater in the game, you can test your skills against mighty opponents. Start as an unranked fighter, and smash your way to the top, to claim the GrandMaster title!\nMirai and her friends will start in the Bronze league and fight their way up!\nThere are 4 fights per tier, with a final encounter to test your mettle. Win to be promoted to the next division!  \nThere will be familiar foes in the arena, but some challengers are found nowhere else. The most difficult opponents in the game await you in here.\n\nAs New Riverstone grows, Mirai helps construct a beautiful outdoor bistro! Once this is built, she can have lunch chats with the villagers to learn more about their backstories and personalities. \n\nYou can have a friend come along and endow the party with a unique buff\nFrom Hagan's ability to find extra items after battles, to Alasdair's defensive bonus, each buff is useful!\nAs you level up your friendship with each friend, buffs grow in strength, and can  further enhance your favorite strategy.\nThough many ruins are buried beneath the surface, one stands alone as the most mysterious and labyrinthine. Tangledeep is a dungeon of constantly shifting caverns and underground jungles, with fragments of civilizations nestled within. It has proven impossible to map, as its layout is constantly in flux. \n\nWhat lies at the bottom? It's up to you to find out.\n\nLike Item Dreams, Tangledeep is a roguelike mode, with randomly-generated dungeon floors. While Item dreams are smaller, with only a few floors, Tangledeep is much more extensive, and is considered endgame or post-game content\nMirai starts on the first floor with basic shapes and no gear. Defeat increasingly-difficult enemies as you explore, obtaining new pieces, equipment, perks, and more.\nEarn special items that can be brought to the main adventure, as well as special currency to buy cosmetic items and town upgrades.\n\nFlowstone Saga's soundtrack has the soul of a classic JRPG soundtrack of the 16 and 32bit eras, with the memorable melodies that classic games are known for, brought to life with modern production and performances that the consoles of yesterday could never do. \n\nThe music of a great RPG always lives on in our minds long after the credits have rolled, so we're working hard to ensure the Flowstone Saga soundtrack is perfect.\n\nFrom day 1, we've shared progress, ideas, and plans publicly and transparently, and we plan on maintaining that relationship with the community throughout development. \nWe have a dedicated channel on Discord: #Flowstone_saga.\n\nTalk to other players, give feedback, report bugs, or share memes... come on in! \n\nWe're there daily and are happy to talk shop, take suggestions, and give updates on what we're working on. Talk to us and other players about your experiences with the game! Share strategies, tricks, or awesome combos you've pulled off.\n\nIn 2017, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for our first title, Tangledeep, with a similar purpose: raising money to further polish art and music. We think this same approach makes sense for Flowstone Saga. While we have invested our own time and money heavily into the game, there is always more we can do to improve the game's presentation, for example:\nMore character portraits with additional moods or expressions\nProfessional mixing and mastering of the soundtrack\nAdditional live musicians to make some tracks sound even better\nA greater variety of particle FX and animations \nMore sound effects to accompany the wide range of abilities and events\nAdditional flavor text and character conversations\n... and much more!\n\nWe do not need money to finish the core game. We're doing that no matter what! We're fortunate to be in the position where income from our previous game and income from other projects is enough for us to fund the core development of Flowstone Saga.\n\nThat means no risk that we'll accidentally burn through our Kickstarter funding and be unable to finish. Instead, this funding will all go to making the game tangibly, materially better-looking and sounding. What's not to love about that?\nWe've come a long way, but we have a ways to go! Here is a look at the current state of the game. Some of these bars fill up faster than others, but we are committed to transparency in what we are working on, and keeping the community updated on progress.\nBesides a Kickstarter-exclusive wallpaper, digital copies of the game, soundtrack, and artbook, we've got lots of tempting custom rewards! \n\nGrand Champion Explorer\nGive us a name, and we put it in the game. It could be you, your pet, or your D&D character. Names could be used in special items, locations, NPCs, dungeons, monsters, etc. \nPuzzle Crafter\nPut on your puzzlin' cap! Work with us to turn your puzzle ideas into reality. Show off your cleverness by making an object outline, or make players curse your name by making something brutally difficult. The choice is yours!\n\nArena Master\n\nThe Arena is an endgame gauntlet filled with the baddest bosses around, and you can add your creation to the list of fearsome fighters. It could be a crazy creature, your pet, sky's the limit!\nWork with us to design stats, special attacks, and battle strategy!\n\nHero of Legend \nEach job class in the game will have an ultimate armor that will be obtained after a quest chain. Name and give a backstory of the former owner of one of these elite sets of gear!\nWeapon Master\nThe most powerful weapons are guarded jealously by equally powerful monsters. Work with our artists and designers to create a relic weapon that is one of the most powerful in the game\nWork with us to create a suitably-powerful guardian that must be battled to earn this weapon.\nGeomancer Explorer\nTurn your MSpaint sketch into a beautiful vista!\nWork with us to create your own special place, named after you. Using a sketch and/or description provided, we will build the area, fill it with monsters and treasures, plus a unique landmark that will only appear in your area.\n\nOC-do-not-steal Explorer\nThere are all kinds of beings in our world; bring your very own to life with this reward!\nWork with us to get  your character design in the game with custom sprites, portraits, and a short backstory for the players to learn about as a side quest.\nYour character will be able to join Mirai's party as a friend, giving them a unique buff.\n\nThe adorable plush Goldfrogs\nSmall and soft, these cute croakers are handmade by DragonAvenger Crafts and designed by Flea Circus Designs. They measure 3\" tall, 3.5\" wide, are made of soft minky fabric and feature shiny golden coin embroidery.\nOn May 16th, we reached 100% funding with 3+ weeks left to go! Here are our stretch goals to help keep the hype going and add more cool stuff to the game.\n\n$25,000: Sprig Salon - ACHIEVED!\nMirai's pet fox will be more stylish than ever! Unlock accessories, animations, and palette swaps to customize this cute fella, who is always be visible by your side. And yes, you'll be able to pet him, too.\n\n$30,000: 2nd Player Assist - ACHIEVED!\nA buddy on your couch can help out on the battlefield by providing helpful bonuses, and thwacking enemies! By connecting a second controller, your friend will get their own Mana gauge to use powers and give you an extra edge in difficult battles. \n\n$35,000: Town Planner\nTransform New Riverstone into the town you want it to be! Find or purchase decor items to spruce up and enhance the town, from natural objects like bushes, trees, and flower patches, to statues, fountains, birdhouses, and more. Place each item virtually anywhere in town with free positioning!\n\n$40,000: Battle Jukebox + 6 New Themes\nHot-blooded music for fighting! We'll add six brand-new battle themes to the game, plus a \"Battle Jukebox\" that will play random themes with every encounter.\nThese new tracks will be composed by lead designer & composer Andrew \"OA\" Luers, lead programmer and Tangledeep composer Andrew \"zircon\" Aversa, renowned electronic & soundtrack artist Jimmy \"Big Giant Circles\" Hinson, and epic orchestral composer & OST mixer Nabeel Ansari.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping a game often involves unexpected bugs and issues which can throw a wrench into even the best plans and schedules. This is especially true when porting to Nintendo Switch, which involves approvals and testing that we have limited control over.\n\nWe have made what we think are reasonable delivery estimations for v1.0 of the game, based on our experience successfully shipping \"Tangledeep\" on PC in 2018 and on Switch in 2019. We also plan on launching in Early Access before the v1.0 release in order to further polish the game based on player feedback.\n\nWe have put over two years into Flowstone Saga already, along with a significant amount of our own money. There is very little we can imagine that would prevent us from finishing and releasing the game, especially given our track record with Tangledeep.\n\nThat said, if any issues arise that might delay the game beyond our planned date, we will communicate this well in advance to backers. The most likely issues would relate to Nintendo Switch approvals, or waiting on third-parties such as localization teams.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Katie's Tip Jar", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Flowstone Saga!

Thanks for getting us funded!\nThe most exciting and colorful hand-drawn adventure to ever meet your eyes! Think of it as a combination of the Kirby series colorful charm and variety, mixed with Castlevania game play (both Classic and IGA styles), and with an aesthetic like a Paper Mario title.\n-What is Vivid Spirit?-\nVivid Spirit is an action adventure platformer where you use colors to dictate how you fight. You can jump and stomp on Colored Blocks or enemies to change colors. Then summon forth an arsenal of weapons or powers based on your hue. Use these abilities to solve puzzles or get the upper hand on enemies in combat!\nYou'll play as Vivid, a young girl who makes due despite her unfortunate loss of color. She leads an interesting life in her home land of Paper Craft, whether it's fighting off terrifying, amphibious wizards... or walking her dog, Spirit! Her canine companion isn't shy like she is, and in fact, can be quite mischievous.\nWe take inspiration from 2D platformers of the 90's, but with a modern feel. There is a wide variety in stages as well as open world areas that you can explore to your hearts content! We are hoping to make the game accessible to all sorts of people, like those with color blindness by using shapes to represent colors.\nDid we mention this game was drawn? By hand? ON PAPER?\nOver 3000+ images drawn, with more to go!\n-The Stories-\nThat's right! Vivid Spirit is more than one single adventure! There are over FIVE different adventures awaiting you in the land of Paper Craft, and they all have something different for you to experience! One story you may play as Vivid, but in another, you'll play as Spirit the Dog! And you'll even be able to use both in certain areas!\nWe can't tell you everything, but you'll start off with only two stories you can play through. As you progress, the rest will be unlocked. The first two stories are dedicated solely to Vivid and the other to Spirit.\nIn Vivid's story, she'll have to go on the chase to rescue Spirit \u2013 dog napped by the bully, Slam Jim! You'll go through a linear set of stages all in an effort to defeat the giant punching bag. And in Spirit's, a terrible wind has blown away all of her favorite toys across the land! You'll then have to search through different levels at your leisure to recover them \u2013 some being a bit tougher to find than others!\nThis and many more grander adventures await you, should you be up for the challenge! And perhaps discover the mysteries surrounding Vivid's lack of color and the sudden appearance of the Colored Blocks.\nNot everything in Paper Craft is as colorful as it may appear...\n-The Characters-\nMeet the star of the show, Vivid!\nVivid is an... odd girl to say the least. Although she's happier now, that wasn't always the case. Ever since she could remember, she lacked color. The exception being her blush. This abnormality affects her speech, practically making her mute most of the time. And although she is small, she's actually 17. Whatever ails her has physically malnourished her. Her father is trying to help.. but she rarely sees him these days.\nThen one day, when she missed the bus to school, she tried walking and ended up falling into a river. It was then she met Spirit who saved her life by using a special power. The dog taught her how to manipulate color and create objects like swords! But more importantly, she actually had a friend. And through what she had learned, they would go off on new adventures and make more friends. All despite her disabilities.\nSpirit the Dog!\nSpirit is a mysterious dog, seeming to come out of nowhere at the right moment to rescue Vivid. Perhaps that's why she was named Spirit; cause she was watching out for Vivid. And ever since then, she still does. Though that's not to say Spirit doesn't get herself into trouble, which she often does.\nHer excitement is easy to see in the wag of her tail and in the speed of her run. Unlike Vivid's Color Magic, which summons forth weapons and tools, Spirit uses the elements of nature to help out. From fire, lightning, and even wind, she can manipulate nature to get around. Super useful when playing fetch!\nSlam Jim the Bully!\nOne of the first major foes you'll face, he dog naps Spirit for no good reason! Perhaps it's due to the fact he's not very bright and only knows how to fight. What a jerk! But perhaps all he needs is a friend...\nIt's the Hoppin\u2019 Mad Warlock, the Toadster!\nThis amphibian is easily angered by the exploits of Vivid and Spirit. He owns an entire fortress for various magic research, including the study of the recently appearing Colored Blocks. Regardless, that doesn't stop him from trapping Vivid and Spirit inside his castle, hoping it would teach them a lesson for intruding on his property when they tried to trick-or-treat at his door.\n\u2026.Needless to say it would turn out to be the biggest mistake he ever made.\n-The Game Play-\nVivid is a game that has been in development for a few years now and we've been tweaking the engine little by little, seeing what works and what doesn't. Our hopes is to make one of the best platforming experiences you'll ever encounter and will love to come back to time and time again.\nAs the name suggests, the game is primarily centered around color. Being a certain color gives you advantages and disadvantages to just about any situation. Your attacks, platforming, defense, powers, and puzzles. All of them are affected by your current color; Red, Yellow, or Blue.\nThe Colored Blocks you see lying around can give you color by landing on them with a move called Downward Spiral. Just hold down while in the air and STOMP! Blocks that are transparent can be walked through if your color doesn't match, which means you'll need to switch colors to take advantage of blocks being physical or transparent.\nThen there's S.C.A.B (Same Color Attack Bonus). When you fight enemies, if your attacks share a common color with the foe, you'll do DOUBLE damage! So a Red attack will do double damage to a Red enemy. And Blue and Yellow attacks will do double damage to a GREEN enemy, since Blue and Yellow mix to make Green. But just remember that SCAB also applies to yourself as well. Enemies that hit you with similar colors will do double damage to YOU! So there's a bit of a risk involved; do double damage and risk losing more health? Or halve the damage you take while doing less to enemies?\nIn addition, enemies attacked with similar colors yield Color Energy. You can find these scattered all over levels. Collecting them will fill the Energy Meter, which can be used to activate your Power Pins! You can equip Pins to one of your Color Slots and use them so long as you have energy to do it. There are a variety of Pins you can unlock, ranging from healing, making you faster, or even wiping out the entire screen! Just remember to choose which ones you want when entering a stage. Careful planning leads to success!\nIt's also important to consider the properties of the weapons Vivid uses. Red, Yellow, and Blue Weapons all have abilities to them that are best fit for certain situations. Red ones are typically short ranged but have great control, making them good for movement. Yellow attacks are horizontal projectiles that are good for taking out opponents from afar, though limited vertically. And Blue Weapons are vertical, allowing you to take out pesky enemies you can't reach too well.\nSpirit also has differences, though she is built with speed and platforming in mind more than combat. Her abilities involve getting over hazards quickly or reaching areas you couldn't normally get to easily.\nAnd if that were not enough, your color can also influence many objects you interact with! From wind to jumping up waterfalls, there are many small details like this that you may find while playing. Understanding that your color can influence what you interact with can lead you to many secrets!\nSpeaking of secrets, the reason you'll want to go after them is because of treasure and money! By getting some coin, you can purchase new items at the Shop. These can be new weapons, Power Pins, extensions to life, and so on. There are 18 Weapons total in the game!\nAs for the levels themselves they are formatted differently in each story. Some levels are mostly linear, requiring that you complete it before going to the next stage. But in some stories there are no levels but rather open world areas that you can explore freely. There you'll find Save Stations to save progress and switch out weapons and the like. Beyond that, each story has other differences you'll need to keep in mind to give you an edge while playing. Like whether or not you're using Vivid, Spirit, or both. Some stories you can swap between the two freely, while others you cannot due to plot reasons.\nThese are just some of the things that'll be in the final product. There will be a variety of collectibles, Extra Challenges, Achievements, and unique Bosses to face in the game. We hope to make this one of the best experiences a game can give you... which is to be fun!\n\n-Questions-\nWho is LucasMaxBros?\nThat's me! I also go by Luke or Lucas. Been making games as a hobby for about 10 years now and hoping to finally make a complete product everyone can play. I've been working on Vivid Spirit since late 2014! It's changed over the years but I'm quite dedicated to making it as great as it can be. Other than that, I just like creating stuff; drawing, writing, and of course, coding.\nOn the music side of things, we have two composers: \nForte (Twitter / Bandcamp)\nScooblee (Twitter / Soundcloud / YouTube)\nWhat is the money being used for?\nThe game has been worked on for quite a while, there isn't much left to do. But one big thing missing is the OST! I need to hire composers to make the game sound magical. In addition, I've been having tech issues and had to already use a lot of money to build a new PC. I'll need more hardware to ensure things are stored safely, and to get the game on other platforms.\nIf we go beyond the $6000 goal, I can also hire more artists to do additional work, which can make the game arrive faster and give me more time to program additional features... like a Co-op Mode!\nHow can we trust this game will be delivered?\nI've put quite a few years into this project and have managed to already make some progress into the Beta, so the game is already in a settled place. It's just a matter of taking it all the way. With funding, that can speed things up.\n\nRelease Date?\nOn the backer rewards, you'll note it says May 2022. There currently is no planned release date, but we believe we'll have it ready first quarter 2022. There's always the possibility of setbacks. However, funding can ensure replacements for hardware in case of failure, which actually happened earlier this year! Thankfully nothing was lost. And now that Vivid Spirit is so far along, with over 90% of animations made, it should be reasonable to make the game within a year.\nPlatforms?\nAs it currently stands this game will only be released for Windows PC. That doesn't mean there won't ever be other ports, and we hope to do so! It's just a matter of money and getting the hardware to do it. We will update our page if any ports become a possibility. So make sure to back the game and spread awareness if you want Vivid on other platforms!\n\nLocalization?\nVivid is a game that mainly tells its story through visuals and game play. That being said, there will be dialogue and character bios and stage lore you can learn about. You do not need this to enjoy the game, but we will try our best to get other languages should we have the money necessary.\nCan you pet the dog?\nYes!\nCan you pet the human?\n YES!\n\n-Backer Rewards Explained-\nNote that all the rewards are color coordinated!\nWHITE: We appreciate any form of support!\nRED: When the game is about to be released, we will email all those with a digital poster at full resolution AND a second new wallpaper to celebrate the release of the game! This new poster will include some enemies and bosses that'll appear in the game. So if you don't want to be spoiled, we'll make sure to hide it safely when it's sent!\nThis tier, along with the ones above, will all give you a chance to enter your name or a legal and appropriate pseudonym when the credits pop up at the end! We will contact everyone who's involved if they wish to do this or not have their name in it at all. And all the names will be color coordinated to the color of the tier they backed!\nORANGE: A Digital copy of Vivid for Windows PC! A key will be sent to you upon release. Should other versions of the game be possible before release, we will notify you and ask which version you'd like.\nNOTE: You can offer $26 for an Xbox, Nintendo Switch, or PlayStation digital copy by default once those versions are available. This way we can manage between PC and Console versions easily when we send the codes to backers.\nWhat if I want multiple copies of Vivid Spirit?\nCheck the FAQ!\nYELLOW: Access to the Full Soundtrack to Vivid upon release!\nGREEN: A Digital Artbook and Gallery from the development of Vivid Spirit. It'll contain concept art, various beta designs, and official HQ art of characters! There will be notes and comments explaining how things were made and more!\nAQUA: Beta Access! We will every couple of months send out special copies of Vivid Spirit with some early versions of levels and items for you to try out. This gives you a chance to help us out by testing Vivid Spirit before it ever releases. You may even get to fight special bosses before anyone else sees them! And since you'll be helping test the game, if you happen to use Discord (here's our server: https://discord.gg/GzND9sV  ) you'll get a special role that'll grant you access to special channels. They are used for discussing beta levels and for giving feedback.\nBLUE: Face or Object to represent you in the background of a level! We will contact you after the campaign is over, and you can give us either a picture of your face or an image of an object, such as a basketball, a lemon, or a skull... or you with a basketball, lemon, and skull... etc! So long as it's appropriate and legally possible to show, we'll use it. Then we'll draw it in the style of Vivid and place it some where in the game! Where it'll be is up to you to find out, so keep your eyes open! These background objects you send may even hide a small item inside!\nINDIGO: Design a Cosmetic Weapon! There are 18 weapons in the game, and while playing, you'll get an item that can alter the looks of weapons. Why? Because it's fun! This won't change how the weapons work, but they can lead to cool or funny looking scenarios.\nYou'll get to choose one weapon and either make a design for it or let us draw something based on your description. As long as it's appropriate and legal, we'll do it. That, and it has to work with how the weapon functions. So if it were the Crimson Blade...  it can't be an absurdly long sword! And it have to be primarily red, since that is a red weapon.\nAnd each weapon has FOUR forms since weapons can power up. This means we'll allow up to four designs for that weapon! One for each charge level. Or you can just design for one charge level. It'll be discussed after the Kickstarter has finished.\nPURPLE: Design an Enemy! Specifically, a simple enemy. We won't be making anything that does 10 different moves and has extreme AI planning. But we'll certainly design an enemy of your description and balance it accordingly. We'll discuss it in a meeting on Discord and even draw concept art until we get a desirable design working and implemented! This will happen after the Kickstarter has finished.\nRAINBOW: Design an Optional Boss fight! We already have all the Bosses for Vivid planned out, but we do have room for a few extras. The boss will have little to no story relevance but we'll allow you to custom make a whole fight! The only deal is that it can't be overly flashy, as you'll only have one health bar to work with. We will allow up to two phases for the fight! We'll discuss it on Discord when the time comes to implement your boss into the game, how it'll look, and so forth. We'll discuss this after the Kickstarter is finished. But bare in mind it might be a while before we're ready to start working on such!\nAlso keep in mind we're limiting this tier to 4 entries, cause this game has quite a few bosses in it already. There's only enough room for a few more!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame Development is always a source of unknowns, especially when it comes to polish and technology malfunctioning. We are using most of our free time to make this experience come true, but even so, that alone isn't enough to complete this project. The game will have to go under thousands of tests before we think it's even close to ready. And that sort of polish takes time.\nWith a hardware failure that happened earlier this year, we're being extra cautious with how much time things could take. Especially because progress on Vivid Spirit froze for over two months. But rest assured that won't happen again with the right funding. Beyond completing the OST, our hope is that the money from this project speeds up the final steps of this games completion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe game can be made to play on a variety of platforms.\nReusability and recyclability\nMy game is digital, and so are the rewards.\nSustainable materials\nNone, because it's digital.

Subscribe to our newsletter!\nWant to Wishlist the game on Steam? Do that here!\nYou can also Follow us on Twitter or join our Discord.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\nWhisker Squadron is our fresh take on forward scrolling aerial combat, featuring feline heroes, dynamic missions, and procedurally generated bosses and worlds!\nComing to PC and consoles in 2022\n Wishlist on Steam | Website | Twitter | Facebook | \n\nHey everyone! \nWe are Flippfly, the team behind 2013's Race The Sun. We are so excited to let you know about our new project, Whisker Squadron!\nClick banner to wishlist Whisker Squadron right now!\nWhisker Squadron is the culmination of a creative spark that was lit over 20 years ago, and that has burned in us through our careers, and strengthened by modern indie games. When we created Race The Sun in 2013, we took aesthetic cues from classic low-poly games like Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, and created something with a uniquely minimalist feeling that was loved by our fans. Ever since that project shipped, we\u2019ve talked about creating a follow up that was more combat-focused, and that pushed the procedurally-generated elements even further.\n\nWhisker Squadron is that game.\n\nChoose your pilot and fight your way through procedurally-generated worlds and epic, procedurally-generated boss fights. You've got one life, and your tactical upgrade choices will be crucial to your success in this aerial roguelike.\n\nEngage in epic aerial combat with your feline pilot of choice\nTake on a series of epic, procedurally-generated boss fights\nFight your way through dynamic worlds in a mission that's unique every time you play it\nAnd there's more:\nProcedurally generated, rogue-like mission structure that's unique every time you play\nIncredibly dynamic procedurally-generated bosses that make for intense climax to every act\nChoose your pilots from a cast of 3 feline heroes\nDaily challenges and leaderboards\nDon't just take our word for it! Here is what the games press is saying about Whisker Squadron:\n\u201cSome of the bosses look downright inspired\u201d - PC Gamer \n\u201cIf this is where the game is starting in the public eye, I can\u2019t wait to see where it ends up.\u201d - Polygon \n\u201cIt's early days yet, but yeah, I'd play this\u201d - Rock Paper Shotgun \n\u201cWhile on the surface Whisker Squadron looks like Starfox with cats, the addition of Race the Sun\u2019s elements make it a very different game.\u201d - Hardcore Gamer \n\u201cThe foundation of a tried and true rail shooter mixed with procedurally-generated level design, roguelike gameplay, and striking art design is a solid one for Flippfly.\u201d - Shacknews \nWhisker Squadron is a corridor shooter with procedurally generated worlds, some light roguelike elements, and a cast of cats! Pilot your ship, avoiding obstacles and blasting the autonomous bots built by the sinister PAW Technologies corporation in an effort to save the galaxy from out of control algorithms bent on planetary destruction.\n\nThe game follows an action rogue-like formula: You get a single life to play through a 3-act campaign through several worlds and random space encounters, each with their own looks and threats. Challenge yourself to acquire higher rankings by avoiding damage, blasting all the bots, and keeping your multiplier high to earn the most rewards for beating each world.\nChallenge isn't everything, so we also offer a set of customizable gameplay settings instead of traditional difficulty settings. Start with more shields on your ship? Encounter less enemies? Get health pickups at the end of each world? Go for it!\nAnd if you want a nightmare, the settings will be there for you masochist-cats as well...mewhahaha\nDynamic mission map\n\nPlay as multiple characters, each with their own unique special weapon. Along the way you'll encounter shops and events to acquire a choice of new weapons and items to powerup as you make your way across the galaxy to stop the bots. Each play-through is unique, with each world being procedurally generated from a set of 'pattern' chunks, and a map that presents different connections and choices.\nAnd it's not just the worlds which are generated: each act culminates with an epic battle against a large enemy bot, and the bots are always looking for improvements so you'll have to keep on your toes each play-through because this bot is procedurally generated for a unique battle each time!\nJin is our character artist, and has drawn our wonderful cast of cats. Here's a few of them:\nSean is leading the way on the visual development for the game, using the custom world editor that we\u2019ve built for this game. We\u2019re evolving the minimalist style we developed with Race The Sun, and adding layers of visual flair on top. What you see on this Kickstarter page is a work-in-progress. We\u2019re improving the visuals more every week, and we\u2019re confident that the final look will blow you away.\nWe\u2019re also super excited to be working with Chel Wong on the game\u2019s original soundtrack. Chel has an amazing range of styles and really nailed the feeling that we\u2019re going for with this game. You can hear her work in the trailer above!\n\nHere\u2019s what Chel has to say about working on the Soundtrack:\n\u201cFor the soundtrack I have so many ideas I'm excited to work on! I plan on taking some influence from predecessors in the genre but also going to be putting my own spin on things. And as is my specialty, I can't wait to see what kind of adaptive layers I can put into this soundtrack to react to gameplay!\n\nSOUNDTRACK PREVIEW\nhere's a little preview of what Chel's cooking up for the soundtrack. This is the track for Lunar Canyon, along with the \"boss variant\" that will play at the end level boss fight.\n(Note: this is a work-in progress, Chel is still in the process of adding some sweet guitars!)\nHere are a few of the more unique Kickstarter-exclusive rewards we're offering!\n\nPUT YOURSELF IN THE GAME ($200 and above)\nYou'll send us a photo of yourself, your pet or anything that's age-appropriate, and we'll add it to an object in a special \"Easter egg\" level that players can access in the game itself!\nPut yourself in the secret level, rough concept\nADD YOUR FURRY FRIEND ($500 and above) \nYou'll send us a picture of your pet, or some artwork of your personal animal persona, and we'll add it to the game as a secret playable character, unlocked with a unique cheat code.\nYour furry friend in the game, rough concept\nCUSTOM SHOUT OUT $1000 and above)\nWe'll send you a survey and code up a special conversation with the characters in the game, who will give you a shout-out by name, activated by a special personal cheat code. We'll work with you to make it special!\nCustom shout-out, rough concept\nAaron San Filippo is a co-founder of Flippfly and the company\u2019s lead programmer. He\u2019s overseeing production and code, building new tools to support the design of the game, and coordinating the team. He also built the prototype for the game and helps out with design.\n\nSean Campbell is the designer and creative director. Sean helped Flippfly build Race The Sun\u2019s portal worlds, and has returned as the world creator and Whisker Squadron\u2019s creative director. He\u2019s also leading the efforts on the game\u2019s 3D art. \nAaron, Sean, Chel, Jin, Chris, and Zaire\n\nChel Wong is a seasoned composer with multiple game soundtracks to her name. Chel works in a variety of styles with an incredible range, and she\u2019s creating an awesome original soundtrack for Whisker Squadron.\n\nChris Atkins joined Flippfly recently as a programmer, and is helping flesh out Whisker Squadron\u2019s gameplay.\n\nJin Li is a concept artist and animator from Sydney, Australia. She created and drew all of the characters for Whisker Squadron and contributed concept design.\n\nZaire Lanier is a writer and narrative designer from the Midwestern US. She's creating a comic called The Bone Herder, and will be helping create the WS universe, characters, and in-game dialog.\nJune 2021: beta-level backers and above get early access to the beta on PC\nDecember 2021: game is content-complete and enters final phase of testing\nMay 2022: The game launches and all backers get a PC copy\nJuly 2022: All physical and digital rewards are delivered.\nMost of the funding for Whisker Squadron comes directly from Flippfly. We have been working on this game for about a year, and we are in a fortunate situation where Race The Sun and our other games are providing a steady income stream that\u2019s allowed us to work on the game. However, this Kickstarter will be essential for getting us over the finish line, and if we reach our stretch goals, will allow us to create an even better game, and guarantee an on-time delivery.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested a lot of Flippfly funds in Whisker Squadron already, supporting a small core team to build about 1/3rd of the game so far. We are on Kickstarter to raise funds to help finish the game and expand our team. This money will help us create an original soundtrack, add additional features, and finish the game sooner.\nYour support means the world to us! Our fans have always been central to Flippfly\u2019s success, and you are quite literally making this project possible. Thanks for coming along for the ride and being a part of our dream project!\n\n* Platforms:\nAt this time, we are planning for Steam, Epic Games Store on PC. We're also looking into PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch We will finalize these plans in the coming months and keep you updated!

We've already started experimenting with a few of these; and they're turning out VERY good; we featured a lil bit of Empty Diary's acoustic mix way back in our 2020 trailer, and already have some stuff on the way for Mirror and Forever Now. You can expect way more of it in the final game with this goal met.\nFOR $300,000 (THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS), WE'RE ADDING ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. \nWhile we want to just go, hey, mic drop, no explanation needed, here is some explanation: \nyou will be able to queue in online lobbies and try and get a better score than your friend or enemy, at the same time as them\nyou can use custom beatmap tracks, provided that you and your friend or enemy also has said beatmap tracks\nall of the community features will be linked into it\nit might be post-launch, but it will be added\nNETCODE IS HARD. We already said that. But if we hit this goal, we can absolutely promise this much. We want to do more, but without a lot more funding and a lot of beta-testing, I am legally unable to tell you any other multiplayer features the game may or may not have. Also hey, let's say it again:\nnetcode is hard\nAnyway, what's up? Feeling okay?\nYOU, THE PERSON READING THIS: Hold on wait HOW DID YOU GET FUNDED IN A DAY?\nD-CELL GAMES, EXCEPT PERSONIFIED AS A SINGLE ENTITY: We have no idea! People like this thing! Go figure.\nYOU:  I'm figuring! Also, what's with...the format? \n D: It's just a conceit. I'm meant to represent us, the people who made this dang thing. You represent, well, you, but you're not you, because you're not actually having these thoughts. I mean, it'd be cool if you did. Did you? That would freak me out a bit, if that was me. ANYWAY HERE'S THE GAME:\nunbeatable is a videogame\nY: This tells me nothing. \nD: It tells you tons of things! Look, right there. It says \"unbeatable is a video game\" in casual lowercase. You can see it right there! Levels! Story! Other!\nY: Why\u2019d you make it look like a Dreamcast game? \nD: I already regret doing the interview gimmick. You know what, forget it. Let's start from the top! Again!\nY: Wait, hold on, what are-\nIt's a narratively-hyperfocused dense exploration game where two-button rhythm combat powers more or less everything.\nEXPLORE AND HELP PEOPLE(?)\nOne half is this: you explore the game world, meeting terrible people and building a setlist for your upcoming concerts. Helping strangers, practicing with bandmates, sleeping in all day - it's your funeral, you'll only have so many days before each big event!\n\"street-style taiko\" is what someone has called this, and we're stealing it\nThe other half is this: arcade-flawless rhythm gameplay powered by an entirely original soundtrack. It's simple but frenetic - sure, there's only two buttons, but there's a lot of visual variety to the setpiece-styled battles. Want to groove exclusively to the rhythm gameplay? We'll have an ARCADE MODE available for you to play from the start!\nThe setup: In the world of UNBEATABLE, music has been outlawed For Reasons You'll Find Out.\nThe twist: A small girl has decided to bring it back. \nThe punchline: Beat (that's you, you are her) finds herself tangled up in her plans...and in the crosshairs of both the police and a mysterious new enemy...\nBut enough talk. Want to give the game a shot? We're releasing UNBEATABLE [white label], our episodic side-story demo, on Steam now! SIDE A Track 1, which lets you play 12 songs and learn more about the vibrant world of UNBEATABLE!\nBeat used to try to sing. Now she *sings*. Hopefully she'll be able to figure all of this out before things get worse.\nQuaver's the young, smart, and the tenacious backbone of the band. Even at her lowest moments, you can't tell her to just give up. You couldn't pick a better guitarist for this band!\nThere's more to Treble than his lazy, sleepy attitude - as the keyboardist of the band, Treble's always reliable, even when he would rather be taking a nap.\nIn contrast to her twin brother, Clef is LOUD. Like, loud.\nUNBEATABLE aims to look like a long lost bootleg 90s VHS recording of the newest anime on the block.\nOur touchpoints for this project are numerous, probably way too many to count!  - but also admittedly reductive of what we're setting out to do. We want UNBEATABLE to stand as its own look in terms of art direction and give it a melancholic flair. We're doing more than just taking the classic anime look as our own!\nMusic is an important part of the game, although we're sure that's pretty obvious. You can listen to a preview of the game's soundtrack above. The music is written to accompany important narrative beats and motifs of the game's story, and there's also going to a bevy of B-SIDES (by RJ Lake) and story-exclusive tracks present in the final release.\nI mean, or you could just...listen to it\nPLAY\n\nSo you might be thinking, \"oh god, I have to play a rhythm game? hard pass. i'd rather read the Iliad.\"  And we get it.  The Iliad rules.  But look: if you just wanted to play the game's story mode and vibe to the beat without being frustrated by the beat (or would like to/need to tweak settings to make the game more comfortable to play...or even just wanted to see if a difficulty is right for you?) We'll be implementing several accessibility options for the game, one of which will be the game's \"Assist Mode\".\nThe demo includes one feature from this mode called \"AUTOPLAY\", where Beat will automatically attack even if you provide mis-inputs (although if you do make a timed hit, it will take your accuracy into account). Let us know what you think on the feature, but do note that we will be looking into implementing (across the whole game):\nModifiers that disable health and adjust regen.\nOptions for color-blind users\nVarious options to configure dialogue visibility\nFull controller / keyboard custom bindings\nScreen-Shake Toggle (will be added eventually in [white label]\nIn addition, we currently have the following available in the [white label] demo:\nToggles for both the VHS Filter and Post-Processing\nController Presets\nConfigurable Scrolling Speed for incoming enemy attacks\nConfigurable Game Offset (with an in-game wizard!)\nAdjustable Game Speed ( 0.5x / 2x)\nNo-Fail Mode\nSo, I'm interested...but...who are you?\nI'm glad you asked! Say hi to us:\n\nUNBEATABLE IS A VIDEO GAME WHICH IS BEING... \nANDREW TSAI (@PixelHavokk) loves anime, and will be tried in court over it. He came up with the initial concept for UNBEATABLE fairly soon after making a game where you have to type to stay alive, and then told Jeff about it, and then they told other people, and hey, now you know. He does the art direction, most of the animation, works on some of the code, has a \"story by\" credit, and handles combat design and polish. Lots of hats! More hats than a person usually has space for on their head. He's the reason most of the characters have music names. \nRJ LAKE (@spellbang) has been sort of accidentally-ing his way through the games industry for almost a decade now, bouncing between asset creation, design, biz dev, and Other. Used to work on Homestuck* (listen to volume ten!) and does stuff with Strange Scaffold (dog airport!). Does Not Code, And Is Sorry. He's handling music direction, additional music, narrative design, dialogue, some setpiece design, all the storyboarding Andrew doesn't do, and is in charge of most of the marketing (the trailer was his fault). He's to blame for all the jokes. \n\nTJ Maddux (@respinmusic)is D-CELL's resident composer and musician. His musical journey started by playing drums for rock bands that regularly pushed sound pressure levels far past safe listening limits, but he eventually waned on the aggressive use of volume in order to  study the sorcery that is jazz composition. He's responsible for the live recording that drives UNBEATABLE.\nJack of all cables, mastering of songs; Vasily Nikolaev (@VastonikMusic) makes it his goal to immerse yourself in worlds that sound real, but feel stylish. Music composer and SFX artist, he handles mixing of all the songs in the game and is responsible for most of the synth work and wilder production tricks you'll hear, as well as a huge chunk of the sound design.\nTogether, TJ and Vas work as peak divide and provide the vast majority of the soundtrack for UNBEATABLE.\nMireille Arseneault (@ProgramGamer) is known for being the TIGsource forums admin and is the main programmer on UNBEATABLE. Mireille's role on UNBEATABLE is to implement the game's various systems. These allow the rest of the team to create dialogue, quests, and beatmaps!  They live in Canada, where bagged milk is.\nJeffrey Chiao (@comet_melting) is UNBEATABLE\u2019s producer and beatmap designer and helps out RJ with biz dev stuff! They keep the team in check (by dousing the fiery equivalent of game production havoc) and build  the amazing beatmaps that accompany Peak Divide\u2019s soundtrack. Outside of UNBEATABLE, they also work on several other games as the director of  SKY HOUR WORKS.\nRachel Lake (@rachelklake) is an illustrator and UNBEATABLE's lead vocalist (and the voice actor for Beat). She helps out with PR, community management, and additional art, and supports the team by derailing meetings with Minecraft memes.\nIN ADDITION, we've got:\nMoxie Riles (they/them) helping out D-CELL GAMES with UNBEATABLE as a cleanup artist (and cheerleader).\nand Yumna Taqiyyah (@Taqibunn) is helping out with additional animation! You can see her work on the band up there!\nWe began development of UNBEATABLE in early 2018, going through a long pre-production phase lasting up until mid-2020; we took a long time locking down core gameplay and the game's final narrative. Since then, we've been working part-time on the full production of the game. It's come a long way since people have first gotten to play the game at MAGFest 2019!\nRight now, we're developing the game's vertical slice (which covers the game's second chapter) - and with that almost completed (it's...close), we're looking to head straight to work on developing the rest of the story mode. We expect this is going to be at the minimum a two year effort, based on how long things have taken so far.\nworse than text\nIT'S TIME FOR PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF:\nWe are now switching over to Jeff! That's me. Lemme take you a quick rundown of the financials of this KS and the project. The charts really explain themselves, but let's break it down to everyone's favorite - the pie charts.\nPIE CHART #1 - Our Kickstarter Breakdownnnnnnnnnnn\nAs for what our development breakdown looks like, here you go!\nPIE CHARTS 2 - What all of our development costs are going into!\nUp to this point, we've been running entirely with little to no funds making the game - so having a jumpstart of any kind would help guarantee the game the resources it needs to become a reality! It's no secret that the project will need a lot more than this - funding UNBEATABLE's base goal will help us develop the game's vertical slice and be able to pursue more funding, but the actual development costs for the final project are on estimate to be roughly ten-times our budget floor (games are expensive, guys).\nWithout funding, we still anticipate continue production on the game, but we won't be able to meet our 2023 release window. That's...just how...these things...go\n\n*please don't hold that against us\n\nWanna upgrade the demo(s) with new content? Help us out with some exciting achievement goals!\n\nEvery Kickstarter apparently needs to say \u201cevery Kickstarter needs this\u201d when they add a thing that every Kickstarter has, and since every Kickstarter does this, we\u2019re doing this, and we\u2019re telling you about it. WE GOT ACHIEVEMENT GOALS! Help us build our community (please make us look cool) and we'll upgrade our demo(s) with new songs and surprises! \n\nYou'll get 1 point for each tier passed, and 10 points will unlock a brand new B-SIDE that will come to ARCADE MIX and [white label] - the mysterious FOREVER WHEN!\nMore goals will be added throughout the Kickstarter campaign - letting you unlock even more special rewards!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've already elaborated in \"PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF\" that the Kickstarter's base goal will not be enough to bring the game's production to completion by end of 2023. If the Kickstarter is funded, we intend on delivering this game no matter what - but the final amount we get will really play a part in how long we can keep going before its ready to search for partners to help bring the game to completion.\n\nRegarding PHYSICAL MERCH: We have experience producing everything but artbooks, so for the most part, we are confident in delivering and shipping physical goods across the world. We will update on production deliveries, delays, and more throughout the campaign.

Thank you to all those who have pledged at any level, or who have helped spread the word. :)\nStretch Goal status:\n\u2713 12,000: Boss Rush, Challenge Game Mode. [Funded!]\n\u2713 14,000: Seven Sisters, Survival Arena Game Mode. [Funded!]\n\u2713 16,000: Multiple music tracks for each world. [Funded!]\n\u2713 18,000: Sidereal Mode - A \"Newgame +\" Campaign. [Funded!]\n\u2713 20,000: Post-Kickstarter physical item add-ons [Funded!] \n(See the \"Stretch\" section below for more details.) \nThank you all so much. (\u25e0,\u25e0)\n\nVenture into the haunted wilds with Gable, a little owl, as she sets out to rekindle the dormant relics of a land long abandoned to ruin.\nPuzzle, fight, and fly your way through the long lost gauntlets, and spectral denizens of the fearful Deep Wilds.\nFlying is a core feature of traversing the environment in Down Ward. The unique flight system allows unlimited airtime, but requires forward momentum and skillful maneuvering to maintain lift.\nYou can play Down Ward in early access.\n\nPlay on Steam\nPlay on Game Jolt\n\nThis early access version of Down Ward is already playable, and has quite a bit of content. It's a small stand-alone freeware game by itself, rather than a demo, and I will keep this free version available as a free game even after the Kickstarter.\nWith your help, I aim to expand this game into a proper full-length title.  \nLike the physics of real flight, as long as Gable is moving forward, she can gain lift.\nShe can stay in the air as long as she has the room to maneuver around obstacles and maintain forward airspeed. Becoming a proficient flyer is important. Especially when hostile haunts begin showing up!   \nDown Ward is a simple but challenging platformer, where flight is critical to navigating the environment, and airspeed is critical to flight. Specters of the Deep Wilds abound, and obstacles, both puzzly and precisiony await!\nGameplay\nSeek out luminous feathers, collect them, and commit them to the Ward Tower. Along the way, you'll encounter a variety of hazards and haunts.\nGable is not entirely defenseless against the ghostly sentinels of the ruins. Armed with a starlight blade, she can spear nearby haunts, or knock them away.\n\nThe blade can interact with more than the animate dead. The black heart stones and their grooved control mechanisms present another use for the glowing blade. Though the more complex black heart puzzles may require some owly consideration to surmount...\nCombat\nThere are no hit points for you or enemies, so every hit matters.\nMy philosophy for designing the combat elements of Down Ward is that a successful combat action should change what you need to do next, rather than only changing how many times you need to do the same thing to deplete a health pool.\nEven enemies defeated in a single attack can change your options after you land a hit. For instance, you can use the bodies of defeated skelly owls as temporary platforms.\nFacing a mix of enemies with different behavior and defeat criteria, when each action will change the state of things, requires more thinking on the fly. So to Speak. :)\nI want the combat to work more like a kinetic puzzle than a war of hit point attrition.\nAs a result, the ability to weave a blade through larger and more complex hosts of foes will come from your growing skill, rather than a weapon that does more damage.\nColors\nDown Ward's retro hand-held inspired graphics use a 4 color palette.\nThere are well over 100 color palettes to choose from:\nSome mimic the venerable monochrome LCD, from an age before time was time. You can play in the original 160 x 144 Game Boy resolution if you so choose. (Scaled up to fit your monitor of course.)\nThere are even a few palettes for the little known avian holidays of Talontines Day...\n (Wherein your friends very patiently endure your inability to sit still. It's tradition.)\n\n...and of course Owlloween! \n(Pictured below, Owlloween colorized)\n(Note: Birdie Pumpkins do appear in game for the month of October, up to Halloween!)\n\nDisplay support\nDown Ward automatically resizes itself to fit whatever display shape it finds itself in. It should always use all the display area it's given to work with.\nIt will also make sure that it always scales up the game visuals by an integer amount, to keep all the pixel art perfectly sharp.\nSo, 16:9, 16:10, 3:4, Widescreen, even vertical aspect monitors will work.\nSpeedruns, Challenge runs, & Metrics\n\"Hourglass\" is a set of unlockable game modes built around time attack and variants of time attack unique to Down Ward. In the \"Airborne\" game mode, for instance, your timer only runs when you're touching the ground, so limiting time on the ground is how you improve your time-score.\nAlso included are various metrics available in the Stats menu that can be used for devising alternate Speedrun, & Challenge Run goals. These include keeping count of a variety of in-game actions, as well as time spent in levels, best run times, and time in the air or on the ground, among others. Additionally your distance traveled, flown, walked, and others are recorded and can be viewed in Feet, Meters, Miles, or Kilometers.\n\u25c6 12,000: Boss Rush, Challenge Game Mode. \nAn unlockable Boss Rush challenge mode. Fight all the bosses in game in staggered waves, flanked by the various haunts of the deep wilds, and environmental hazards therein!\nFail, and Gable may be required to have a picnic with the boss that defeated her. Such is the fearful custom of the old ways.\n\u25c6 14,000: 7 Sisters, Survival Arena Game Mode. \nAn unlockable challenge. Fight all of the 7 Sisters simultaneously in a large survival level. Don't want to spoil too much, but expect to be at a picnic for 8.\nTesting and feedback will be final arbiter, but to give a bit of a design sketch, my inclination is to structure this challenge as follows:\nUpon entering the arena, you'll face one of the seven, chosen randomly, along with a host of hostile haunts. As the stage progresses, likely by completing side objectives, each successive sister will be summoned into the arena. The sequence of sisters will be shuffled like a deck of cards, making each playthrough different. When all the sisters are summoned, if you survive that long, they become vulnerable and the real fight begins!\n\u25c6 16,000: Multiple music tracks for each world. \nMultiple music tracks for each world, instead of just one major theme per world.\nAnyone donating at a level that receives the Soundtrack reward, will also get all of the additional tracks added by this goal.\n\u25c6 18,000: Sidereal Mode - A \"Newgame +\" Campaign \nA second much harder variant of the main campaign of the game, unlockable by beating the game once.\nOne of the most surprising things to me about working on this game was how much your skill in flying can grow. By the time you complete your first playthrough of the game, you'll be able to fly and fight in ways you'd have thought impossible when you first started your journey.\nRevisit the campaign, but with more hazards, more adversaries, and in more complex and treacherous combinations. This new game mode will stress your improved skills, and test what you've learned in the fire, as you delve into the far more hostile wilds.\n\n\u25c6 20,000: Post-Kickstarter physical item Add-ons\nI've been considering for a while now the possibility of adding a 5th stretch goal. A lot of people have asked about either, physical rewards of some kind, or equivalent post-Kickstarter physical items, to be available after the campaign ends. I think it's a little close to the end to add in physical rewards directly to the Kickstarter, as I worry some people will likely only check back after the campaign ends, and I don't want them to feel left out. \nAt this goal, I will work out how to set up physical Down Ward add-ons that would be available after the Kickstarter, and that way everyone could join in if they wanted. This would likely be shaped in part by backer suggestions and interest. I've had people ask about shirts, posters, ceramic pins, and plenty more. I could make a list of the things that have been suggested to see what people think about the possible options.\nWho is working on this project?\nI'm Fisholith, a solo indie developer. :)\nI program the game & rigorous owl logic\npixel the art\npaint the other art\nanimate the characters\ncompose the music\ndesign the sound\ndevise the mechanics\nconstruct the levels\nwrite the writables\nbusiness the businessy stuff.\nThough being a solo dev does not mean being a creative island, and without the feedback, critique, suggestions, and help offered by many of the wonderful players of Down Ward, it would not have reached the point it has.\nWhat is the funding for?\nIf the Kickstarter succeeds, I'm going to be working as a solo developer, doing all of the things mentioned above, for a little under a year, for the main game, and more than a year when factoring in some of the rewards that require the game to be completed. This funding offsets some of the cost of committing to that. In addition to this funding, I'll be contributing a fair amount myself from personal savings. \nContact\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me via any of the following:\n Down Ward contact page (likely the fastest) \nKickstarter's direct message system.\nTwitter @Fisholith\nfi@fisholith.com\nOr even on Game Jolt: Fisholith on Game Jolt \nRewards overview\n\"GG\" is an abbreviation of Grey Garden.\n** The rewards with a double star (**), have a later delivery date than the normal rewards. Check out the \"** Double Star rewards\" section at the end for more info.\nDown Ward game\nA download of the full game upon release!\nI made the below image for fun, I don't have a secret cartridge stockpile.\nbut I can dream... :)\nSoundtrack & Wallpapers\nA download of the entire soundtrack (DRM free), and desktop wallpapers.\nSome little Examples in different styles:\nNote that the Stretch Goal \"Multiple music tracks for each world\" would add several new songs to the soundtrack, and if that Stretch Goal is unlocked you will also get the new additional tracks.\nLikewise any of the higher backer tiers that result in the creation of additional tracks would also add the extra tracks to this reward for everyone. :)\nIf you're curious, this link (Fisholith Soundcloud) will take you to a few of the songs I composed for my prior little freeware game-jam projects. Down Ward is included as it started out as a little game jam project itself. :)\n\nDesign & Artbook PDF\nConcept art, design work, artifacts, locations, and fragments of lore from the world of Down Ward.\nBeta Access\nAccess to the commercial beta, which will be available before the game's final release. You'll be able to play the game as it grows. Your feedback and critique will help me shape and polish Down Ward. I'll also mark your Grey Garden credit to indicate that you participated in the beta. (Note that this commercial beta is different than the currently available freeware beta for the little freeware edition of the game, just in case you were wondering.)\nGrey Garden Credits - Some notes\nWhat is the \"Grey Garden\"? - The Grey Garden is a special in-game location any player will be able to visit in a lucid dream. Credits will be stored in heart stones, or creature statues, and when struck, the name they contain will be shown in a burst of light, then fade away slowly.\nNote: This is an example. The actual Grey Garden environment will be much larger. Also, don't worry, your statue won't be missing it's head. The one on the left is just in considerable disrepair. ;)\nGrey Garden - Shared Name Stone\nYour name, along with up to 4 others, will be stored in a shared heart stone in the Grey Garden. Striking the stone will show your name among those of your fellow stone-mates in a burst of light! You can be credited however you like, within reason. :)\nGrey Garden - Personal Name Stone\nYou'll get your own personal heart stone in the Grey Garden. Striking the stone will show your name above it in a burst of light.\nGrey Garden - Creature Statue\nA credit statue 2 times gable's height.\nYou'll get your own personal creature statue in the Grey Garden. There will be at least 10 different creature statues to choose from, each with at least two variations. They will be various owls, birds, snakes, and fish. Striking the stone statue will show your name above it in a burst of light.\nGrey Garden - Chromatic Creature Statue\nA chromatic credit statue 2 times gable's height.\nAn extension of the \"Creature Statue\" reward. When a chromatic creature statue is struck, In addition to showing your name in a burst of light, it will also transform the game's color palette to a color set of your design, choosing, or vague suggestion. :)\nWhen you leave the Grey Garden, the colors will go with you. For each chromatic creature color palette, there will be an achievement, for completing the game with that color palette.\nThis means you can get an achievement named after you. But more importantly, it means you can make a completionist play the game with four slightly different shades of black, only to (barely) see the name of their tormentor once more in the form of an achievement. (Seriously though, probably don't do 4 shades of black.)\nGrey Garden - Large Unique Statue\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 4 times gable's height. (or that length)\nYou'll get your own personal unique chromatic creature statue in the Grey Garden. Choose a creature from the list below and, describe a pose, submit a reference photo, or even go the concerningly creative route, do the pose yourself and submit a photo. Bonus points for making wings or antlers out of stuff you can find around your house. :)\nAny kind of:\nOwl\nBird\nDeer, (including the Frost-Tails of Down Ward.)\nSnake\nReptile\nFish\n(e.g. A falcon, python, or hog-nose-snake, are all valid options.)\nGrey Garden - Giant Unique Statue\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 8 times gable's height. (or that length)\nPoses can be suggested or submitted as described in the \"Large Unique Statue\" reward above.\nAny kind of:\nOwl\nBird\nDeer, (including the Frost-Tails of Down Ward.)\nSnake\nReptile\nFish\nGrey Garden - Outlier Giant Unique Statue\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 8 times gable's height, with alternative creatures.\nLike the \"Giant Unique Statue\" reward above, but with a much extended list of animals to choose from. See the \"Large Unique Statue\" reward for info on submitting pose ideas.\nNote: These are creatures I don't currently have a developed style for in Down Ward, so it might take a bit longer to figure out how I want them to look, to fit in with everything else.\nAny kind of:\nWolf or Fox\nCougar, Leopard, or Cheetah\nRabbit\nMouse or Rat\nRaccoon\nFerret or Weasel\nDolphin or Shark\nOctopus or Squid\nInsect or Arachnid\nCrustacean\nBat or other living flying animal\nArchaeopteryx, or other winged animal that is extinct or prehistoric.\nGrey Garden - Giant Statue (Natural/Outlier)\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 8 times gable's height, with any listed creature type.\nYou can pick the reward from either \"Custom Giant Statue\" or \"Outlier Custom Giant Statue\" above. This lets you pick from either list, giving you the entire range of natural and outlier animals as options for your giant statue.\nCo-compose a Character painting **\nI'll create a digital painting of a Down Ward character or pair of characters for you.\nPick one or two characters from Down Ward, and a simple scene or action.\nI'll create a painting based on the elements you picked, which I'll send you upon completion. Eventually, after I've completed all the other painting rewards, I'll add them all to a second wallpapers set for the wallpapers reward, so everyone getting the wallpapers including you, can enjoy all the new additions. The painting will include your \"requested by\" credit alongside mine on the final image. :)\nYou don't have to decide right away. As the project progresses, and I'm able to share a bit more of the lore and character details, you'll have more to draw from, when choosing the picture elements.\nWhat are some examples of one or two characters, and a simple-ish background? A portrait of Gable, tucked under Soliel's wing and peeping out, set against a foggy backdrop would work. Or Wisteria coiled up in snakey loops, resting on a heart block, against an out-of-focus green forest backdrop.\nExample of a painting that would work:\n\nCo-compose a Desktop painting **\nI'll create a digital painting of something Down Ward related for you.\nPick one to five characters from Down Ward, a setting or location from the game lore, and a simple scene or action.\nI'll create a painting based on the elements you picked, which I'll send you upon completion. Eventually, after I've completed all the other painting rewards, I'll add them all to a second wallpapers set for the wallpapers reward, so everyone including you, can enjoy all the new additions. The painting will include your \"requested by\" credit along side mine on the final image. :)\nYou don't have to decide right away. As the project progresses, and I'm able to share a bit more of the lore and character details, you'll have more to draw from, when choosing the picture elements.\nWhat are some examples of one to four characters, and a location setting? Gable, Wrenwen, and Ceruleine using Amaranth as a perch, resting in her antlers, in the arched entrance of Castle Gail Hallow. Or Wisteria looped around Kerna, wading into the shallows of the Palace in Reads. \nExample of a painting that would work:\n\n\nCo-design a Challenge level **\nI'll work with you to co-design a unique challenge level. The layout, enemy and hazard composition, emphasis on platforming/combat/exploration/puzzles, architecture and theme, are among the many elements to play with in the design of a level. Co-design a custom color palette for the level, which will also get added to the master palette list. You and other players will be able to warp into your level through your statue in Grey Garden.\nCo-design a 3-level set Challenge + Custom Music **\nMaximum owly peril awaits!\nI'll work with you to co-design a 3 stage sequence of Challenge levels. The layout, enemy and hazard composition, emphasis on platforming/combat/exploration/puzzles, architecture and theme, are among the many elements to play with in the design of a level. And in a level series, there's also the escalation of difficulty to consider. Co-design custom color palettes for each level, which will also get added to the master palette list. You and other players will be able to warp into your level set through your statue in Grey Garden.\nIn addition to the level design, I'll also create a custom music track for the level set, which you can help tailor the mood and tone of. This song will also be added to the Soundtrack reward for everyone. :)\n** Double Star rewards\nThe ETA for all normal (non-double star **) reward items is Dec 2021.\nOnly the reward items with a double star ** on the end will use a later date. This will likely be May 2022, but please check the tier in the rewards side-bar for the official extended date. This is because the double star ** rewards are likely to rely on content that will be more fleshed out by the time the game is nearing completion.\nIt also helps prevent the more involved custom reward work from colliding with the core project work.\nIf you've backed at a level that includes one of these rewards, I'll contact you before the end of Dec 2021 at the latest, but feel free to send me a message whenever you like, to ask questions or if you already have an idea of what you might want, and I'll keep it in mind for later. :)\nYou made it to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf successful, this will be my first Kickstarted project, I'm a solo dev, and it's game development.

No matter how long they have been there, everyone will help you to find you way out.\nt. \nWe sometimes explain our game concept by saying it is a mix of fluid platformer Dead Cells and the 2D dungeon crawler Wizard of Legend. This last one was inspirating for its gameplay but also for its fantastic and aerial mood, in particular its original soundtrack composed by Dale North.\nWe are absolutely thrilled he accepted the collaboration as his work perfectly reflects our vision of the game\u2014filled with magic and gusto!\nIn a game like Astral Ascent, sound design is not just a way to make the universe sounds good\u2026 it will flesh out actions, spells, and bosses! We think our project requires an organic and juicy sound design that Romain Rope perfectly understood as you can \u201csee\u201d above.\nAttacks feel impactful and spells sound powerful but the sound design also really adds another dimension to our gorgeous 2D world.\n\nWe want our backers to pay the right price for their shipping costs so we are partnering with Backerkit in order to charge shipping closer to the delivery. This way, with the use of the pledge manager and the add-ons system, backers will pay the lowest shipping costs by grouping their items together and have the shipping fee calculated on the exact weight. Below you can find our current estimates, based on our discussions with our partners:\n Celestial Seeker (Physical edition + Zodiac cards + Genga print) \nEU:14\u20ac | US:10\u20ac | other: 16\u20ac (Add-ons shipping costs not included) \n\n Zodiac Tier (Physical edition + Zodiac cards + Genga print + 4 enamel pin's + Kickstarter Exclusive Ayla figure) \nEU:22\u20ac | US:18\u20ac | other: 24\u20ac (Add-ons shipping costs not included) \nFigure in production by Graphigaut\nAs an indie team trying to self-publish, we are facing major challenges. We know Kickstarter is a direct answer to most of them.\n1 - Get funded! This may be obvious but our main goal is getting enough funds to keep working on this dream project. Obviously, we do not entirely rely on the Kickstarter success as we reinvested all the money we earned from Dark Devotion and secured partnerships that financially helped us. As such, any additional money we make will directly be invested to improve the game's quality.\n2 - Get noticed by the media! Without a publisher behind us, we need to get the media\u2019s attention to be noticed. A successful Kickstarter campaign is a strong message sent to everyone and with your help, we have a better chance of being seen and heard!\n3 -  Get feedbacks! Our goal is to make a tremendously fun game. To do so, we believe we need feedback from players as soon and as much as possible. Demo and early access will be key elements to make the best possible game. We want to iterate in a direction that will satisfy our fan base.\nWe are univocally committed to making Astral Ascent the best possible game we can! For that, we need your support. Help us spread the word and make our first self-published game a true success story!\nWe are highly committed to release Astral Ascent on both PC (also available on Mac & Linux) and console. But as a young indie game studio self-publishing their game, we do not have experience on porting games. So we have made a partnership with MP2 Games: an expert company dedicated to porting games made on our engine (Construct 3).\nMP2 Games successfully ported amazing games such as:  \n Baba is you (Hempuli)\n Iconoclasts (Konjak & Bifrost Entertainment)\nand more recently Cyber Shadow (MekaSkull & Yacht Club Games)\nThis high quality partner will allow us to support all relevant platforms for Astral Ascent\nWe have already overcome the main challenges of the development : localization system, controls remapping, level generation, etc. Yes, it sounds weird, but trust us, these are terribly hard to do! We are now fully working on improving and expanding the game content which makes us relatively safe regarding schedule as we are experienced on these topics. \nSince we are building a rogue-lite game, we think Early Access is our best option to collect players feedback while improving the game. This way we are sure to release a finished product that will satisfy everyone\u2019s expectations.Thus, we cannot know for sure the exact time we will remain in Early Access in order to polish everything. Our estimated current schedule is :\n2022-Q1 - Early Access Release (Steam)\n2023 - Final PC & Console Release\nWhile in Early Access we will make frequent updates of content and also major updates such as releasing new bosses, new worlds to explore, and more!\n\nWe have translated Dark Devotion to a large panel of languages so as many players as possible could enjoy the stories & lore of the game. We made a lot of effort to have rich & fantastic background texts, we want the largest audience to fully appreciate them but localization costs money for such a limited ressources team as ours so we had to make choices that we wish to expend if the campaign is successful. \nCurrently targeted languages\nFrench | English | German | Russian | Brazilian Portuguese | Simplified Chinese | Traditional Chinese Japanese | Korean\nHibernian Workshop is an independent game studio based in France. What makes us special is that our studio has been founded by self-taught game developers and artists and it's your support from our previous successful  Kickstarter campaign that allowed us to create the studio and become professional. \nThanks to the success of Dark Devotion, we had the opportunity to add great talents to our small independent team. We all work remotely from our homes allowing more freedom to everyone. We are doing our best to work without crunch with an humble and positive mindset.\n\n Louis Denizet - Creative Director & Programmer - @DenizetLouis \n Alexandre Magnat - Lead Artist & Pixel Artist -  @Skreed3 \n Renan \"Relixes\" Rodrigues - Gameplay Programmer - @Relixes \n Ga\u00ebl Giudicelli - Concept & Pixel Artist - @444Pixels \n Romain Rope - Sound Designer - @RomainRope \n Anthony Jauneaud - Narrative Designer - @iamleyeti \n Dale North - Music Composer - @DaleNorth \n R\u00e9gion Nouvelle Aquitaine - Financial Support - @NvelleAquitaine \n Maple Whispering - Publisher for Asia - @MapleWhispering \n Limited Run Games - Physical editions - @LimitedRunGames \n MP2 Games - Console Port - @matpow2 \n Tokkun Studio - Animation Studio - @TOKKUNSTUDIO \n ICO Partners - Marketing Agency - @icopartners \n Dan \u2018Mikal\u2019 Shimizu - Effects Consultant - @kindeyegames \n Boell Oyino - Illustrator - @BoellOyino \n Lyne \"Boo\" Hehlen - Cinematic Storyboarder - @ly__Boo \n From The Void - Localization & Proofreading agency - @FromTVoid \n Graphigaut - Figure sculptor -  @Graphigaut \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAstral Ascent is a complex game, it will require a lot of artistic work as well as a lot of systems to create the perfect replayability alchemy we are looking for.\nWe even added local co-op! \n\nEvery Kickstarter campaign comes with a portion of risks but we hope we proved our dedication to put all our heart in our creations despite challenges we could face with the success of our previous game.\n\nWe are not just starting the game, we hired greatly talented people to work with and we took months to set the direction and already made every main systems that we felt were scary to make.\n\nIt is a clear vision that we share and move forward together, we are really close to be able to publish the game by ourselves, without a publisher, we only need your help to make it real!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Astral Supporter", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcdd Get project updates\nHelp us to self-publish and reach the stars!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["23 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Astral Aspirant", "descp": "Get access to the game as soon as possible with Early Access (Steam) + get the final game at a lower price than its release price.\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbe Digital copy + Early Access to the game (Steam)\n\u2b50\ufe0f Your name in the credits (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83c\udf31 Exclusive Discord Role (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83d\udcf1 Exclusive HD Wallpaper (computer & phone)\n\ud83d\udcdd Get project updates\nHelp us to self-publish and reach the stars!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["1,015 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac22 or more", "title": "Astral Aspirant (Consoles)", "descp": "Get access to the game on console on day launch at a lower price than its release price.\n\u231b - Select the console platform you prefer in a later survey.\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbe A digital copy for console\n\u2b50\ufe0f Your name in the credits (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83c\udf31 Exclusive Discord Role (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83d\udcf1 Exclusive HD Wallpaper (computer & phone)\n\ud83d\udcdd Get project updates\nHelp us to self-publish and reach the stars!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2023"}], "stat": ["356 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "Astral Seeker", "descp": "Why choose?

It is heavily inspired by classics such as Zelda and Terranigma, combined with rogue-lite elements. Holomento will release on PC, with console ports being potential Stretch Goals, should the funding goal be reached.\n Explore a hand-crafted open world featuring procedurally generated dungeons!\n Fight your way through Eventide Hollow - again and again!\n Rebuild the Hollow and release it from its ruinous curse!\nEventide Hollow was a lovely kingdom where its people lived in peace. It was once a vast land with free roaming folks and expanding villages, but now it is filled with darkness, strange creatures, and guarded townsfolk. It seems peace doesn't last forever.\nA horrible curse was laid upon the land and Eventide Hollow fell into despair. The source of the curse was also its only protection from it... the Holomento.\nThe Holomento traps the souls of all who possess it, the mysterious book affixes itself to those who seek passage through the Hollow. If the Traveler dies, their soul is also added to the Holomento before it returns to its resting place awaiting the next traveler.\nOnce acquired, the book is tied to the soul of the traveler holding it. The Holomento cannot leave the Eventide Hollow and therefore any Traveler who possesses it cannot leave the land.\nHolomento enables you to write your own story as generations of Travelers pass through a land desperate for help. Open shortcuts, reveal secrets, locate ancient relics, and build improvements to enhance the Hollow for future travels...\n...or just invest into the Hollow's Stonk Market (yes, it's real) to enrich yourself - we won't judge!\nHere's a quick overview of a handful of regions you're going to see during your travels!\nDue to the curse, travelling through Eventide Hollow is quite dangerous, with many enemies that you will have to deal with. Thankfully, Travelers are well versed in handling all kinds of weaponry, from swords and bows to handguns and... grenade launchers?\nDiscover a variety of traditional and nontraditional weapons. Upgrade your stats by collecting hundreds of different items, including special weapons, and utilizing item skills to bring destruction to the dark creatures of the Hollow!\nChoose from a variety of starting classes! Each class begins with a unique set of items and changes how you will fight your way through the Hollow drastically!\nDue to the curse, most towns in Eventide Hollow were destroyed. Now only ruins and corruption indicate what once was a beautiful kingdom. Those that remain are hidden in plain sight. Hope is the only thing left for the surviving inhabitants - but even that is vanishing. \nDuring your journeys, you will have the opportunity to restore the Hollow to its former glory! Upgrading shops and homes, rebuilding towns, and improving the Hollow will help you on your future journeys!\nAll towns are upgradeable via their shops and storefronts. Each town has a number of common amenities that are uniquely essential to it. Upgraded towns will reward you with many benefits and also allow you access to the local Stonk Market! It allows you to invest in local businesses and grow your influence and wealth throughout the Hollow.\nHolomento is currently in a playable Alpha state. While you are able to complete runs at this point, several aspects of gameplay like dungeons, proper town rebuilding and many of the planned items have not been implemented yet. Development progress has been steady and will continue to be thanks to our amazing community of Alpha testers. They have kindly given us plenty of valuable feedback during the ongoing alpha phase!\nYou can also find the full road map right >HERE<!\nThe funding crowdsourced through Kickstarter will allow us to make Holomento something truly special.\n\nThe game so far has been entirely self-funded and has finally arrived at a state where we will need the help of outside contributors and freelancers to give the project the polish it needs! \nFunds will be going towards supporting the game's composer, sound designer, artists and some new artists we will hire for 3D modelling and animation primarily. Some of the funds will be held for software licenses and assets we will need during further development of the game.\n\nIf you want to listen to a few samples of our amazing soundtrack by Adeel Jafree make sure to give the Holomento OST Playlist a listen!

Pick between four difficulty modes or use the accessible Assist Mode! \nYou can try the demo for free on Itch.io or Gamejolt.\nThe game currently runs only on Windows.\nAdditionally, when backing the Game Tester tier, you will be granted full access to the alpha version of the game. This includes all the currently built areas, relics, bosses and content.\nYou'll gain access to the early access version as soon as the Kickstarter ends and will have permanent access throughout the games development with new content updates dropping around every month or two.\nThroughout developing this game I have come to appreciate testers and feedback a lot. I am very much looking forward towards building this game with the people who want to see this game grow into the best it can be!\nThis map is less than 50% of the World!\nThe Demo contains the first area in the game, which has 2 Bosses and a couple of upgrades. It's a small slice of the early part of the game and does not have many upgrades but it lets you try how the game plays.\nThe early access version right now contains 6 explorable areas, some more finished than others. There are 13 fully functional bosses, 13 spells, 59 relics and around 15 abilities. Not all spells and relics can be found in the world right now but they are all fully implemented and can be used (through cheats). The alpha version contains possibly 10+ hours of content and the full game will contain much more and generally be much more polished, hoping to make a 50+ hour game.\nYou will be able to collect a lot of Upgrades!\nCombat is simplistic but precise, our protagonist Greencap uses a sword as his main weapon. Throughout the game you will learn different type of slashes and attacks, your arsenal will grow and the playstyle will change. \nGreencap also has a parry which can negate incoming damage, not only that but you can trigger the successful parry into a dodge-roll for additional protection and mobility! This combined with the dashes and other special moves you have gives Greencap some great mobility!\nSatisfying!\nMy design philosophy behind the combat is to make it as fair as possible, where enemies have distinctive behaviours that are easy to learn and memorize. You will be acquiring new abilities and spells through bosses. \nIt's the same philosophy there where I want boss attacks to be telegraphed clearly and patterns easy to memorize.\nI try to avoid randomness as much as possible and I think bosses are an area where testers will help tremendously with making them feel fun and fair. I am also not afraid of remaking stuff entirely in case a boss turns out not the be fun!\nUse spells in creative ways! You will never get the most out of a spell by just casting it, in Lone Fungus the spells are really an extension of your sword. The spells react to how you swing at them with your sword, each spell reacts differently and this gives combat and platforming some depth because most spells have several uses not just in combat but also in platforming.\nEach spell-type represents a culture of mushrooms that used to live in the kingdom, which powers you will acquire. You will gain one new spell per area and your mushroom cap changes based on which spell you have equipped.\nSome spells are mainly useful in combat while others are also used in traversing the world and unlocking new areas, where striking them with your sword in the right way might bounce you in a direction. Or their effects might be used in puzzles for opening up new areas.\nGet creative with spells!\nLone Fungus is very much a platforming focused Metroidvania, probably more than most other ones.\nIn the beginning my main inspiration for this game was Hollow Knight, but I wanted to expand the sword pogo-mechanic and generally feature more platforming based gameplay. Several people did call my game Hollow Knight + Celeste, at the time I hadn't played Celeste yet, but I got it a short while after and ended up loving it!\nThe hardest platforming sections will be optional and no lore hidden behind a path full of pain!\nI embraced the similarities and got further inspired by that game. I do believe my game brings some new mechanics though, one of these are the mushmovers. These are magical objects placed all over the world which are used for traversal and platforming. They come in various varieties and give the platforming a blend of striking with your sword at the right time and controlling your momentum!\nThe protagonist Greencap has many movement based abilities other than spells too, he can dash forward and up and also has a spinning jump. He can also bounce off surfaces with his sword and accelerate at very high speeds if you combine it with your dash! \nGreencap also has a crouching super-jump and a meteor-strike. All this combined with the mushmovers and spells does make the movement tech in this game quite deep and adds something interesting for people who enjoy complex mechanics. For people who enjoy a more casual or exploration/story based experience, do not worry! There is an assist mode and more on it below.\nHow about you speedrun the game like this?\n I made a video showing off some of the potential speed-runner tech the game has to offer!\nSome people have shown great interest in the game but get concerned about the tough and skill-based platforming aspect of the game and for me it's not just important to make the game feel really responsive and fair, but also accessible! Even though the game is very focused on platforming and designed to be challenging there are options to play the game how you want through an assist-mode! You can pick between minor and major options which make the game easier in different ways. Other than an assist mode the game also features four different difficulty modes which will additionally increase replay value.\nLone Fungus is set in a world built by ancient mushrooms, where you play as the only mushroom left. The setting is very much based on your loneliness in the world and the search for what happened to the Mushrooms who built this world, and what your role is. \nThe storytelling will be told through the environment and through the few entities you can talk to, which are interact-able sculptures that tell you about the past and the present. These are remnants infused with magic that gives them the ability to speak and remember events. They are not merely lore-tablets, instead they react to your progress in the game with their own unique personality based on what kind of mushroom culture who has built them. When you find new abilities and revisit them they will tell you new stories. They also may offer hints on not just story elements but also on secrets and perhaps what you should be doing to progress.\nAs a musician i will be doing the music for the game myself!\nI may not be the best composer that produces the greatest quality tracks but I do feel like i know how i want my game to sound! I also do want to put my own vibe into the soundtrack as this project is very personal to me. I'm aiming for the game to have a SNES era feel to the music while also being modern and punchy, each area will have it's own track where the setting is reflected in the music!\nCheck some of the tunes out below!\n\nColor Caverns \nAcid Dungeon\n Astral Realm\nBlue Palace\nUntil now creating this game has only been a hobby, a hobby which has brought me a great sense of purpose and I truly enjoy working on this project. My dream is to work full-time as a game developer, run my own company and do more games like this in the future. By funding this Kickstarter you are funding me as an individual and my passion for video games and world-crafting.\nWho am i?\nYou can call me Basti and I really love games, music and art. I used to do games as a kid when I was 12-15 but in my adult life spent more time with music and art.\nIn December 2019 I started playing around with game development again just for fun and as I was doing a platformer I almost got struck by a sort of an epiphany. \nI've often wanted to do a full game but I thought it felt too hard or that it was not possible, but now I feel I can really do this. I decided I really wanted to make a Metroidvania game in the style of Hollow Knight but with more platforming and some unique mechanics and I have not stopped since then. I believe I've made great progress and I feel like I know what I want to do with my life now.\nI am a person who has a need to express myself creatively or else I feel like I'm dying inside. Game development gives me so many ways to express myself through art, music or gameplay and I feel like anything is possible. \nI've been told by the Swedish Tax agency that I can expect about 30-50% of the Kickstarter income to go to taxes, this is after Kickstarters cut (around 45% of funding goal max i hope). Even with this in mind the Kickstarter funding will sustain my living costs for a year. Me and my girlfriend recently also moved to a cheaper apartment to reduce our living costs to make this possible. Doing this Kickstarter will fund development time for atleast a year, allowing me to focus on the development of Lone Fungus.\nThere are two exclusive backer skins you can get through the Kickstarter. These are skins you can wear throughout the game and since Greencap can change his cap based on his spells there will also be an option to overwrite the spell-caps with the equipped skin. The plan is to have more unlockable skins in the full game by beating the game in certain ways or finding secrets. The skins will be something you will be able to pick in the main menu of the game and chose and switch when ever you want to as long as you have them unlocked.\n(These skins are subject to change & improvement based on backer feedback)\nAll the Designer rewards will have to be designed with me, it's a process that'll we'll have to go through together. I'll do everything to put your ideas into the game but not everything you suggest might fit. The crazier idea you have the more chance it'll be put in as an end-game secret but I'll truly try to put in whatever you might suggest to the best of my ability. Just keep in mind there might be limitations to what I can put in and that perhaps compromises might have to be made. It's great if you have multiple ideas!\nGet immortalized in the 'Hall of Immortals' as an ancient mushroom statue portraying you as a hero, villain or just a character from the past. Get to decide what the inscription on the statue will say and put your message in the game!\nThe 'Hall of Immortals' will be a secret room in the game.\nDesign your own skin and get to play with it in the game! You will also be able to decide how players will acquire the skin in the game! (you will get the skin unlocked if you want to)\nRelics are equippable upgrades which might do anything from change how a current ability behaves, to give you a totally new one! (Like Charms in Hollow Knight) Decide everything from how it will look to what it will do!\nDecide how an enemy will look and what kind of behaviour it will have! The world of Lone Fungus consists of many strange creatures and monsters, it's not set in a realistic world but a magical one! So this can be any type of fantasy creature you can think of!\nDesign your own Talking Sculpture, this will be an interactable character in the game. You will get to decide it's personality and what kind of things it will tell the player, and also what its appearance will be!\nDesign a full boss battle! This can consist of several stages or behaviours! Decide on how it will look and what type of attacks and weaknesses the boss will have. You will even be able to decide what kind of obstacles there will be in the Room where you fight the boss!\nThis can be any crazy idea you have, well almost. If you are a creative person with many ideas then this tier is for you! You will be able to design whatever you'd like for the game as long as it's doable. It can be anything from a totally new ability to a platforming mechanic and it'll be a design process we will go through together to add something really cool to the game which i have not thought of myself!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks in the development time of the game. I am confident I will finish the game because around 50% is already finished and if this was a shorter Metroidvania it could very well be finished already. In a worst case scenario where I don't manage to get everything done until the deadline, the game might get delayed or parts could get released as free DLC. I'd like to do free DLC either way probably, but I have plans on what I want to be included in the base game when it releases.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nIt's a digital product.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 179 or more", "title": "Play the Full game!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbd Digital Copy of the Full Game (Steam)\n\ud83d\udd14Exclusive backer updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["326 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 290 or more", "title": "Music Lover!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbd Digital Copy of the Full Game (Steam)\n\ud83d\udd14Exclusive backer updates\n\ud83e\ude95Digital Copy of the Original Soundtrack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 315 or more", "title": "Super Backer!

Maybe it wasn\u2019t always, but it is now. And the world out there is darkening, like the sky before a late-summer storm.\nThese are good people, here in Stonetop. Your kith and your kin.\nIf you don\u2019t step up to protect them, who will?\nStonetop is a \u201chearth fantasy\u201d tabletop RPG set in an Iron Age that never was. The players portray the heroes of an isolated village near the edge of the known world. Their adventures focus on dealing with threats to the village and seizing opportunities. These aren\u2019t rootless mercenaries seeking fortune and glory; they\u2019re exceptional people, taking risks on behalf of their friends, family, and neighbors.\nLike most tabletop RPGs, Stonetop plays out as a conversation between the game master (GM) and the players, with dice being rolled at key moments to determine which direction the story goes. The game can be played in short runs of 2-4 sessions (each about 3-4 hours long), but is best experienced over a dozen or more sessions.\nStonetop is \u201cPowered by the Apocalypse,\u201d using a system and framework similar to games like Apocalypse World, Monster of the Week, or Masks: a New Generation. It started as a setting guide for Dungeon World, but over 5 years of development and playtesting, it\u2019s become a standalone game. Knowledge of Dungeon World may ease your entry into the game, but it's not a prerequisite for play.\nPrintable play aids include all of Stonetop's core \"moves\"\u2014the rules that drive the game.\nFeatures of the system include:\n A rich and well-realized world of gritty Iron Age fantasy adventure, providing enough detail to ground play immediately while leaving plenty of room for the players and GM to make the setting their own.\n 9 distinct types of player-character (see below), each with their own reasons to look out for their community and seek adventure beyond its walls.\n Rules for governing and improving the village itself across the seasons and over the course of years.\n Rules for overland travel that capture the excitement of setting out into the unknown and the relief of returning home after a long time away.\n Hand-drawn maps depicting the village of Stonetop itself, its immediate surroundings, and the extent of the known world.\n An extensive setting almanac covering important regions, points of interest, neighboring settlements, creatures of the wild, and eerie remnants of past civilizations.\n A collection of unique magic items, each with special rules for unlocking its mysteries, powers, and dangers.\n Guidelines and advice for the GM, including step-by-step processes for collaborative customization of the village, adventure creation, and shaping a developing campaign.\n\u201cI had a chance to play this with a small group, including one person who usually didn't enjoy RPGs. We only played one session, and he still talks to me about how special it was to him. I would play it again in a heartbeat.\u201d \u2014William H., Vox Arcana Podcast\nClick through for full-size page spread\nA close-knit community burns bright at the edge of the known world, surrounded by mystery and danger. Rainwater collects in the Cistern; iron is shaped at the forge; magic is rare and fearsome; the will of the gods is discerned from the shapes of the clouds. Only the bravest venture far from the Ringwall, but upon these few the future of the village depends. \nEnough setting detail is provided to start everyone on the same page, but as the players create and introduce their heroes, they begin to shape the world to their personal and collective interests. The game text establishes a foundation upon which each group builds their own unique version of Stonetop.\nAlthough extensive guides to the village, its environs, creatures, and other elements are included, this material is designed less as a \u201csetting bible\u201d and more as a toolkit full of prompts and resources for the players and GM to exploit.\nClick through for full-size page spread\n\"I love the setting, from the ancient ruins and wild places haunted by fae, spirits, and much stranger things (hypnotic baboon-headed snakes!) to the magic that demands sacrifice and promises terrible consequences. Every setting detail is richly evocative and meant to be played, not just read, with countless hooks, prompts, blanks, and questions that have spurred my creativity and my players\u2019 enthusiastic collaboration.\" \u2014Matt Wetherbee, playtester\nAt the start of a new game, each player creates one hero to play. There are nine different archetypes, each with a unique set of possible backgrounds, abilities, and connections to the village, all defined by the player during the first game session: \nEach playbook is designed to hold \"inserts\" for tracking things like inventory, the Marshal's crew, or the Ranger's animal companion:\nClick through for a PDF of the Seeker's playbook.\nInterior of the Seeker's playbook with inventory insert\n\u201cI love it. The character creation is evocative and really feels like play... It creates not only your character\u2019s backstory and relationship to other player characters, but also to Stonetop and the NPCs in Stonetop. When you are done with session zero, not only are you psyched to play your character and interact with the other player characters, but you are attached to the village.\u201d \u2014Christo Meid, playtester\nThe village of Stonetop has its own character sheet, or \u201cplaybook,\u201d with stats, traits, and improvements to be unlocked in play. This playbook drives much of the game. For example, the village\u2019s \"Fortunes\" directly affect what new threats or opportunities each new season brings, and the players must manage the community\u2019s \"Surplus\" to avoid disaster when winter comes. As a game of Stonetop progresses, the village playbook changes in response to the victories and failures of the player-characters. And as the village changes, so do the threats and opportunities that heroes face.\nClick through for a PDF of the steading playbook.\n\"I didn't know how much I needed a game that let me play out Our Town or Main Street or Gilmore Girls in a fantasy setting until I played Stonetop and realized it might be the only game I needed. Stonetop not only helps players create amazing adventures. It also creates a persistent, believable place. Players will come to care about that place and the people who live there deeply.\" \u2014Emily VanDerWerff, Vox\nThe game includes dozens of magic items and locations (\"arcana\") that the heroes can acquire and learn to use. Each has special rules for unlocking its mysteries, tapping its powers, and\u2014for the most powerful items\u2014the consequences of doing so.\nThese arcana are designed to be printed as two-sided cards, to be given to players as handouts.\nClick through for PDF examples of major and minor arcana (spoiler alert!)\n\"Stonetop's unique take on magic items\u2014requiring effort to understand and activate and each coming with their own set of costs and consequences\u2014is fresh, rewarding, and surprisingly intuitive. Each Major and Minor Arcana has a character of its own that drives its story forward, each one naturally forming a story hook that is as unique as the character who wields it.\" \u2014Chris Thompson, playtester\nThe goal of this campaign is to fund the printing of two high-quality hardback books:\n Book I: Stonetop contains the core rules and extensive guidance for the GM. ~400 pages.\n Book II: The Wider World and Other Wonders is a setting almanac that details the regions, sites, monsters, and arcana (magic items) unique to Stonetop. ~250 pages.\nThese books will be 5.5\"x8.5\" (\"digest\" size), hardback, printed offset, and jam-packed with beautiful pen-and-ink illustrations by artist Lucie Arnoux.\nHere's an early mock-up of the books to convey their intended size:\nMock-up for scale (cover designs not final)\nAnd here's a mock-up with a more stone-like feel, showing the stretch-goal slipcase that will be included with every set of books:\nClick through for a higher resolution image.\nAll backers will receive PDFs of both books and additional play aids. The PDFs will be thoroughly bookmarked and hyperlinked to maximize ease of use.\n\"What can I say about Stonetop that hasn\u2019t been said already? I could wax lyrical at length about the wild grandeur of the setting, the clarity of the GMing techniques, the evocative poetry of the playbooks, how well the moves bind the game around the village and its material human concerns, the balance it finds between unique worldbuilding and blank spaces crying out to be made your own.\n\"Instead I\u2019ll just say this: for four years now, this has been the game I come back to time and time again, always bringing new friends with me. I\u2019m playing in a campaign now and still I know that in months to come I\u2019ll hear the call again, pull on my GMing boots, and go wandering once more up to that little village at the top of the world.\" \u2014Luke Jordan, game designer, Games from the Wildwood\nAnyone who backs at the Print + Digital level has the option to select additional rewards, in the form of art prints and/or a custom character illustration by Stonetop's artist, Lucie Arnoux.

Each project has been slightly more ambitious than the last, which has allowed me to gradually improve my knowledge base and set reasonable goals.\n\nContent and art is 75% complete for Stonetop, so the main challenge I see is making sure that the printing and fulfillment of the two books goes smoothly. There may be delays, for instance, if I ask for extensive corrections after seeing the printer's proofs, or if other aspects of production don't meet my expectations. For previous projects I have shipped all rewards myself, so going with third-party fulfillment is also an unknown.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Stonetop - Digital Edition", "descp": "Both books (600+ pages total) and all play aids in PDF form.

London\u2019s deeper secrets will only emerge over multiple playthroughs!\nThe gameplay of Mask of the Rose extends beyond dialogue. You'll open new locations on the map, gather outfits and disguises, work odd jobs and collect resources. Together, this will determine what you can attempt in social situations \u2013 and how much you can get away with!\nMask of the Rose will be coming to console platforms as well as PC, Mac and Linux. We\u2019re offering Steam or GOG keys as backer rewards. Mask of the Rose will also be available on Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X/S. \nMask of the Rose is set in Fallen London: a darkly hilarious gothic underworld where death is a temporary inconvenience, the rats talk, and Hell is only a train journey away. \nWe\u2019ve been exploring the Fallen London universe over eleven years and five different games (including Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies). If you\u2019re a newcomer, Mask of the Rose is the perfect jumping-on point. If you\u2019re already a fan, it offers new discoveries and a chance to explore more personal stories, including encounters with favourite characters.\nMask of the Rose begins in 1862, just months after London was stolen by bats and relocated to the Neath: a vast cavern far below the earth. Down here, the sun doesn't shine, and Parliament has sunk into the Thames. Queen Victoria never emerges from her palace. Cats spy on their owners and whisper their secrets abroad. And it's rapidly becoming clear that London isn't going to be returning to the Surface any time soon\u2026\n\nWhen you create your character in Mask of the Rose, you\u2019ll choose what your life was like before you were caught in London\u2019s fall. Were your family landed gentry? Or did they own a tailor\u2019s shop, or work on the docks? Your choice will determine how you dress, what you know, and where you fit in.\nWhatever your origins, the Fall cut you off from your family and resources. Now, you are beginning a new job for none other than Mr Pages, one of London\u2019s mysterious new Masters...\n\nThe old laws are suddenly in disarray, and London's citizens must make new lives for themselves.\nFor your fellow lodger Griz, the Fall is a liberation \u2013 the chance to be taken seriously in a position that would have been denied her when she was 'Miss Griselda'.\nFor your other housemate Archie, the change is terrifying. What is a medical student supposed to believe in when even the laws of death no longer apply?\nAnd when Archie is arrested for murder (even though the victim has since returned to life, and is feeling much better now thanks) you may begin to moonlight in detective work. Can you crack the mystery of London's first homicide since the Fall?\nLondon is rather the worse for wear after being dragged below ground. Not everything survived, nothing is the same, and no one can quite explain what has happened.\nIn Mask of the Rose you'll be able to visit a number of different locations in the city, including:\n\nBefore London fell, Horatia\u2019s was your temporary home. Now it\u2019s the only place in the city that feels familiar \u2013 until, that is, one of your own is arrested, and Horatia starts taking in new lodgers \u2013 not all of them human.\n\nAfter surviving the Fall relatively intact, Tentergrounds has become a home to many. Among them is David \u2013 Fallen London\u2019s first murder victim \u2013 as he tries to understand his own death and return.\n\nCrucial secrets are hidden in your own fragmented memories of London's Fall. But are you brave enough to relive them?\n\nA new literary salon is gathering all the brightest stars in London. The host has amber eyes, a scalding handshake, and a previous address in Hell itself, but he\u2019s an excellent listener.\n\nOnce a 40-gun frigate, the HMS Ungulate has been converted into a temporary prison. Unless you can prove his innocence, Archie may be spending a very long time there.\nMask of the Rose is a story about love, in many forms. The choice is yours: will you be a brilliant matchmaker, connecting friends and rivals while remaining unattached yourself? Or are you looking for lasting love? Or shorter assignations? Or perhaps you're open to whatever comes your way?\nEvery major storyline will be accessible regardless of whether your approach is romantic or platonic \u2013 even if the final endings may vary.\nHere are a few of the characters you'll meet:\n\nRachel was halfway through her latest novel when normal, workaday London ceased to exist \u2013 and her literary inspiration along with it. But meeting Milton has rekindled her passion for writing. He might be her suitor; he might be her Muse; he might be an actual devil, if you believe in that kind of thing. Her brother David hates him, but Rachel isn\u2019t about to let that stand in her way.\n\nHarjit hasn't lived in London long. But when catastrophe struck, he knew someone would need to organise volunteers, dig out basements, and round up the lost. Besides, he had a missing person of his own to find. For lack of other options, he stepped into a constable's uniform \u2013 and into a job that grows daily more unpredictable.\nNow he\u2019s had to arrest Archie for murder. The evidence says Archie did it. Harjit\u2019s intuition points the other way \u2013 but lately, trusting his intuition has led only to heartbreak.\n\nFor a decade, Horatia has taken in lodgers and turned them into family. But since the Fall, supplies are scarce, and her boarders can't afford their rent. So when a man made entirely of clay knocks at the door, offering to pay handsomely for lodgings, she can hardly refuse.\n\nMr Pages runs the Ministry of Accounting and Recounting, which has embarked on the titanic endeavour of conducting Fallen London\u2019s first census! A lover of the written word, Pages has never struck such a rich vein as London.\nIt does have a lot of questions for you, however. How do people declare their affectioniments, in this fair city? How lasting are their attachments? Might a Londoner take an interest in a very tall, broad-shouldered, cloaked personage that leans towards the chiropterous, hypothetistically speaking?\nExpress Yourself through Fashion. In Mask of the Rose you are what you wear. Manage an expanding wardrobe that offers a host of options. Sometimes the right disguise or outfit will get you into a social occasion. Other times, the effect will be more subtle: giving you the confidence to take a reckless action, or provoking the reaction you need from another character.\nExplore widely. Experience the city through three seasons \u2013 the season of confessions, the season of Yule, and the season of the Feast of the Rose. Each day you\u2019ll read the news, learn of any recent events and opportunities, and then turn to the map to choose your next action. Will you find Rachel and interrogate her about the night of the murder? Comfort Archie in prison? Work at one of several jobs to earn money, or use your resources to unlock a new part of the city?\nCollect the stories of Londoners \u2013 and especially their affairs of the heart. You begin as a census-taker with a notebook full of questions. The more you learn, the more it fills up \u2013 and unlocks new lines of inquiry. For some reason, Mr Pages is especially keen for its census-takers to document the \u201cassignations and besotments\u201d of London\u2019s citizens. Why is it that London\u2019s new Masters are so preoccupied with stories of romance\u2026?\nOur digital rewards range from corvid companions to choosing a Fallen London character to feature in Mask of the Rose!  We are delighted to be partnering with Gametee to create and deliver our physical rewards for Mask of the Rose. \nGametee create items that enhance gaming culture - the finest quality, the most environmentally and socially conscious, and above all, the most beautiful. We have a lot in common with Gametee as independent British businesses, and we admire not just their design aesthetic, but their whole approach - from their remuneration of artists to their environmental policies. When looking for a partner, we were especially impressed with the quality of their products and the creativity of their designs.\n\nMilton\u2019s Parlour, the best (and most unholy) literary salon in London. Sweet honey, heady rose, and the traces of ivy. \nMr Pages' Den, where scandalous documents urgently await censorship. Parchment, cypress shelving, and just a hint of ink.\nA twin pack of gloriously fragranced gaming candles themed to Mask of the Rose. Hand-poured, vegan (100% natural soy wax) and handmade in England. They burn for up to 20 hours and come in keepsake tins.\nCrafted using the finest archival quality cardstock, each magnificent city map measures 42cm X 59cm (16.5 X 23.4in) and will help make better sense of life in the Neath. This map captures London as it was at the time of the Fall. Includes a hand-numbered certificate of authenticity commemorating your special investment in the campaign.\nFor illustration only, map image may differ.\nThere are many ways to support this campaign. Our community has been essential to making the world of Fallen London what it is today. Get involved however you can!\nUPDATE: We've achieved ALL 20 social goals and ALL of the social rewards!\nYou've simply bowled us over your romantic poetry, personal ads, Victorian origami, Feast of the Rose celebrations, costumed cats and creatively captured Masters!\nCheck out our Twitter and #MaskoftheRose to see everything shared and submitted so far. Our wonderful Principal QA Specialist continues to collect and showcase your chiropterous felines on this delightful Twitter thread. Pop into our Discord if you haven\u2019t already to chat about the campaign and all things Mask of the Rose.\nYou've only gone and unlocked every single social reward! Good work everyone!\n\nAchieving five goals unlocked an access code that will give your character in our Fallen London browser game a special Poetic Gift \u2014 just click the link to apply it to your account!\nSeven goals unlocked a second Fallen London access code, this time for a mysterious Ministerial Gift. You may want to do so before Monday 22nd February as this gift has a special use during the Feast of the Rose, which you can discover by speaking with Lilac. But don\u2019t worry too much if you miss it \u2013 the option will be available again next year.\n10 Goals unlocked 10% off at Gametee for a limited time and the release of a free selection of Mask of the Rose and Fallen London-universe themed printables. The discount code has now expired but you can still enjoy the printer-friendly downloadables on Gametee\u2019s website! The items can also be accessed via Dropbox if you prefer not to create a Gametee account.\n15 goals unlocked a chance to interview one of the characters from Mask of the Rose! We ran a poll and Milton, he of the amber eyes and scalding handshake, won!\nThank you for the many (184!) questions you submitted for Milton. They have all been received, compiled and submitted for consideration. He answered Mr Pages' approved selection in this update.\n19 goals unlocked a future encounter in Fallen London with Horatia. Your landlady in Mask of the Rose has a heart of gold and a soft spot for the Neath\u2019s more unusual inhabitants \u2013 but how is she doing decades later, in the Fallen London browser game? We will make her current residence open to visitors, creating an opportunity to meet her! This will happen sometime after the campaign, but ahead of the release of Mask of the Rose. In the meantime, Horatia has something for you \u2013 may it keep you company until you meet in Fallen London.\nAll five stretch goals have been unlocked!\nMask of the Rose comes with three initial options to define your protagonist\u2019s background, allowing you to have grown up as a dockside urchin, as a worker in your family\u2019s tailor shop, or among the stifling  pomp and luxury of the aristocracy. Your choice will grant advantages with particular factions in the story, and equip you with some unique clothing options.\nThis is a fourth origin to select when creating your character: the Housebreaker\u2019s Heir, who has a pickpocket\u2019s deftness, several criminal acquaintances, and a fraught relationship to anyone wearing a badge. Each origin grants advantages with certain factions and some unique clothing items!\n Early in Mask of the Rose, your landlady Horatia takes in new lodgers \u2013 some human, some decidedly not. We\u2019ll add one of these lodgers as a new character to Mask of the Rose: a Clay Man, fresh from the living city of Polythreme.\nHe\u2019ll be one of the game\u2019s secondary characters \u2013 not as elaborately woven into the central narrative as the main cast, but an interactive character with his own story to explore. What emotions stir beneath his stony exterior? You\u2019ll be able to get to know him better, and perhaps even learn the secret that brought him to Horatia\u2019s door... \nA fifth potential origin for your protagonist: the Undertaker\u2019s Child! Thanks to your family business, you are acquainted with numberless vicars, solicitors, grave-diggers and hearse-makers. You also know perfectly well how Death is supposed to behave \u2013 even if Fallen London persistently defies your expectations.\nThe deviless Virginia will make an appearance in Mask of the Rose. In the years to come, she will go on to be many things in Fallen London \u2013 including its Lord Mayor \u2013 but she was around long before the city arrived in the Neath. Her story will give us an opportunity to show what she was up to in a newly-arrived, vulnerable London\u2026 \n A sixth protagonist origin will be added to the game: the Scholar of the Occult! The scholar is a historian of esoteric practices ranging from witchcraft to alchemy, and this background gives you an in with academics and the more disreputable sort of artist, and a gift for noticing disturbing things out of the corner of your eye\u2026\nWARNING: while the Neath could broadly be described as very occult indeed, its particular brand of the strange has little to do with alchemy, witchcraft, angelology, or other surface occultisms. A Scholar of the Occult is as likely to be bewildered by London\u2019s new home as anyone else, but perhaps they will be a little more accepting of the eerie and the uncanny.\nOur answer to this might be a little unusual. We're doing okay right now, and can fully fund development of Mask of the Rose (though any pledges we receive will reduce the risk and put us in a better position for the future).\nInstead, we're doing this to find out whether this is a game you want us to make.  We're excited about Mask of the Rose; we hope you are, too. The funding goal is not how much it will cost to make; it's the amount that would convince us Mask of the Rose will appeal to a large enough audience, so that we can safely commit to making it.\nWe won't be making Mask of the Rose available in Early Access, so we're also hoping to learn how you feel about different parts of the game, to help guide development. If you have thoughts to share on any part of the game, please let us know in the comments!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMask of the Rose is in some ways more complex than many visual novels. But it will be smaller and more focused than most of our past games, which can be enormous and \u2013 we confess \u2013 somewhat baroque.\n\nWe're familiar with the technologies we're using to make it, and have already built a vertical slice \u2013 a short, fully playable section of the game. We\u2019ve also had a fair amount of experience fulfilling Kickstarters: we\u2019ve run three successful ones, and delivered on all of them.\n\nFor these reasons, we're confident in our ability to complete Mask of the Rose. We think the biggest risk is instead that it might take longer than estimated. In particular, we have a tendency to delay our games if part of the design isn't working out as well as we'd hoped \u2013 it's more important to us to make good games than to release them quickly. Also, it's very important to us that our team doesn't have to crunch. That means that if some things take longer than we expect, we might have to push back the release (although we\u2019ve included contingency in the schedule to cover a certain amount of this).\n\nIf everything goes to schedule, we expect to be ready to release Mask of the Rose towards the end of 2021, but to account for these risks, the date we\u2019re committing to is June 2022.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nThe scented candles are made with soy wax, a more sustainable alternative to paraffin.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe majority of our rewards are delivered digitally.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "The Citizen", "descp": "Welcome to the Neath!

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art.

Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

Together with your fellow players and GM, you create the city of Nagara and its unique locations using a tarot deck. Each session your characters inch ever closer to a Doom they\u2019re working tirelessly to prevent, but must inevitably face as the chronicle ends.\nThe game has the dark horror feeling of a dungeon crawl, while focusing on mechanics that drive in-game drama and push personal stories. You\u2019ll get embroiled in the various wars raging between guilds in the city and try to secure a bit of personal peace, before all your efforts crumble around you. You\u2019ll strive to survive in a city that is literally trying to eat you, and siphon off its power to keep the ones you love safe.\nCity of Flesh takes inspiration from grimdark fantasy combining it with a feminine aesthetic to create an immersive gore-splattered roleplay experience where you delve into the dreams of a sleeping colossus and tear through fleshy reality to make your own fate.\nWhat You\u2019ll Get\n\nCity of Flesh is an A5 sized, 50+ page, soft cover zine. We've paid attention to paper quality and the zine will have a glorious hand-feel. PDFs will be distributed through DriveThruRPG and physical zines will be sent through the Dutch national mail service. \nShipping is free, we've calculated the costs into our funding goal.\nWithin the zine is:\nA complete grimdark femmecore setting for you and your friends to build upon\nA full set of unique tarot-based mechanics to run your game\nA guide on how to interpret the cards for your game\nAn immersive safety mechanic to keep the game safe and fun for everyone at the table\nIf you'd like additional physical copies of the game add \u20ac15 to your pledge for each additional copy. We'll send PDF codes along with the additional copies ordered.\nTake a look at the stretch goals we unlocked!\n2,500: UNLOCKED - Monster generator \n3,500: UNLOCKED - Encounter generator\n5,000: UNLOCKED - All Stretch Goals printed and added to physical pledges\n 6,500: UNLOCKED - Proofing\n  Welcome to Nagara\nNagara, the City of Flesh, dominates the Plains of Bone. The world is young, the Age of Titans draws to a close, but the city is ancient. Built in the womb of the slain Colossus, Nagara is both rich and powerful\u2014and already past its prime. A Doom approaches Nagara, as the world rebirths itself into a new, more rational form in which there\u2019s place for neither Titans, nor cities built atop their rotting remains. To facilitate this transition, the city\u2019s dreams birthed the Midwives\u2014people imbued with some of the city\u2019s primordial energy who must guide it to whatever comes next.\nThe Colossus is dead by any measure of human life, and yet she isn\u2019t\u2014 she still undulates with primordial creation, heaving and oozing to form a protective shell around Nagara. The magic of the Sovereigns keeps her dormant, as does the life-leeching magic of lesser citizens and their efforts to keep flesh at bay with fire and blade. Entire city blocks still live under overhangs of flesh as a result of the Years of Suffering, with some citizens carving houses into the red tissue.\nThe need to drive back the Colossus\u2019 flesh becomes more dire as Nagara expands. Sovereign Nemaida offers rewards to explorers who venture in the necrotic parts of the city to slay monsters and burn away the flesh. The Midwives often find themselves called to the danger the endeavor promises, for there is plenty that can go wrong.\nHow It's Played\nNagara is dying and will be reborn. At the start of the game you map the city by performing a three-card reading for each location in the city. You\u2019ll map seven locations and then place a single card on the Blooded Sanctum, the Doom\u2014the end of your story. Each location represents one session (roughly four hours) of your game, therefore you\u2019ll play seven sessions before the eighth final session where you encounter the city\u2019s Doom.\nAt the start of every session players pick a location focus\u2014this is the location the game session is crafted around. The GM crafts the plot of the session based around the conflict and threat of the location.\nDuring the game players perform more readings, drawing a tarot card from the deck, to modify the scenes based on how characters act. Readings help facilitate the drama in your character\u2019s life. Depending on how your Reading turns out, you and/or the GM ascribe meaning to the card drawn.\nExample of Play\nThe Midwives are caught in a waking nightmare of terror and blood where an unhinged Relic stalks and murders people in their sleep. Steffie\u2019s character Torga realizes maybe the Relic can be reasoned with, she asks the Relic if they can help it in some way. Liz, the GM, asks Steffie to make a Pacify reading, because Torga is trying to connect with the Relic.\nSteffie draws the Five of Swords. \nThe Relic explains that it's enraged, not because it can\u2019t fulfill its destiny, but more because it loved Hydrassa deeply and hates seeing her body so defiled.  Torga reveals she knows the sting of unrequited love too and swears to help. Seeing another being who knows its pain, the Relic asks Torga to take action by returning Hydrassa\u2019s body to her burial tomb. \nNice to meet you!\nSteffie de Vaan is a Dutch author and developer of role playing games and short stories.

While is easy to read for people with no sight problems, we realize some of the black pages with thinner white text, or heavily illustrated pages, may cause issues for others.

With Aveliana I want to bring novelty to indie games with fun and original gameplay! Aveliana is an infiltration-action-adventure game!\nJUMP INTO THE ADVENTURE AND PLAY THE DEMO ON Gamejolt!. \nAveliana is a 2.5D game with unique gameplay: based on the detection pattern of enemies, you find your own route through the world. All the enemies can be avoided in the idea of a commandos-like. The gameplay is ultra-dynamic because it is focused on a single character, Aveliana. \n(This trailer was selected as \"best indie game trailer\" by Best Indie Games!)  \nIf you feel one path is too complicated or you want to explore a new route, it is always possible to find a secret path, in which the game smoothly transition from 2.5D to a 2D platformer. And if you are tremendous, you can choose to stand and fight your enemies!\nThe gameplay is constantly renewed in Aveliana thanks to the many enemies that I have crafted for you. Each of them has a different detection and attack pattern. Tall enemies, like robots, can not be directly targeted because they are too tall. However, Aveliana has other tricks in her bag. All along with the game, you will also unlock new abilities to build your character. \n Don't you love hiding in high-grass?\nPLAY\n\nAveliana is also a game with beautiful environments that you will want to explore to discover all the secrets of the game (and you can contribute to it in some rewards!). Each level has a different environment and atmosphere. Sometimes, after an action-packed sequence, you will have the joy to admire the landscape before continuing the adventure! After a long journey in an environment entirely hand-drawn, you will face fierce and unique bosses!\n2.5D / isometric view environments:\n2D environments:\n Note: you don't like too difficult games and you just want to know Aveliana's story and discover the levels? No worries, there will be a \"story mode\" for you! \nThe game will be initially released on Steam and will support Windows, Linux and Mac. Later it could be ported to consoles.\nElevator pitch\nAveliana is an action-infiltration-adventure game recognizable by its art design as well as for its fun and unique gameplay!\nEmbrace Aveliana\u2019s quest to bring back someone she has lost! The game takes place alternatively in an isometric or a 2D point of view and is fast-paced. Guide her through arduous paths watched by monsters, follow the trace of a mysterious fox, and find the powerful artifacts she is looking for at the core of wonderful temples. Will you stealth your way to victory? Seek a forgotten path on the edge of a cliff? Or stand and fight against your enemies? The choice is yours!\n PRESS KIT\nWhat are my inspirations?\nJust before starting the game development, I was playing a series of games that probably initiated the thought process in my mind. I played Zelda Breath of the wild, Celeste, Cuphead, Disco Elysium, and finally Children of Morta. I am also inspired by other games such as Gris, Commandos, Rayman origins, and of course Zelda Ocarina of time! Other arts also inspire me, such as painting or music, but also poetry, and anime (in particular Miyasaki's work that I find unique and so poetic!).\nWhat makes Aveliana unique?\nThe gameplay, the story, and the art style!\n2.5D to 2D smooth transition! You can find hidden 2D passages but if you fall, you may fall onto enemies:\nPLAY\n\nUnique and diverse stealth gameplay\nPrecise and fast gameplay for experts (speedrunners!), and adjustable for occasional gamers\nA recognizable artistic design\nHand-drawn environments with a lot of variety\nA meaningful story with a lot of story twists\nChoose your set of skills for the adventure\nIn Aveliana, at the start of each level, you can reassign your abilities and adapt the set of skills to the upcoming level and to your playstyle. For instance, here the first ability I have chosen (which is the one by default in the demo) is the Dash ability because I like to move quickly, but I could have chosen the Hard skin instead to take less damages. For each slot, you will have to choose between two options! \nFoes in Aveliana \nAll enemies in Aveliana have their own detection and attack pattern! The game already has three \"common\" enemies that detect you with a cone (like the yellow guys in the little video below)! Each of them will be of a different type (melee, zone, ranged)!\nHere you can see the new ranged enemy I have just implemented (quite challenging to fight for me):\nPLAY\n\n It also already has 7 unique and more challenging enemies, like the ones below, that will force you to modify your approach and think about your movements! Look at the rewards because you could participate in the development of more enemies like this!\n (this one below you can only see when you are on specific spots where you can activate your medallion)\n(that one makes a circle around you and you have to stay in it!)\nPLAY\n\nAnd finally, we have already three unique bosses in the game! One more is programmed!\nAll this variety in terms of detection and attack patterns is excellent for renewing the gaming experience all along with the game! The enemies can combine in fun and original ways to surprise you at all moments!\nWhat about the story?\nWhile looking for three artifacts, Aveliana will wander a poetic yet dangerous world and discover about her and her environment! As an indie game developer and following my personal thoughts about our world, I wish to use the videogame as a medium to share and carry meaningful messages. As a scientist, what passionate me the most is how a bunch of atoms can come to live, think, eat, love, etc. Aveliana is a strong and reckless bunch of pixels; she is guided by a fox and she starts to understand who she is thanks to him! The whole artistic design, being minimalistic and poetic, has been thought for you to enter into Aveliana\u2019s story and to live a great experience!\n[Work in progress] In-game, if you want to get more details about the story, you can use your medallion and scan around to find hidden little NPCs that will give you the precious information:\nPLAY\n\n Who is Thefrenchdev? \nI'm Romain, a French man from La Rochelle (France). I'm 32 and I have started this project at the end of February 2020 and I literally fell in love with game development. Since then, I have been working on Aveliana every day during my free time (from 6 pm to midnight). It has become my passion and the development has gone so well that I have quickly been able to share playable demos with people. This has motivated me, even more, to continue working on it and make it as fun, interesting, and enjoyable as possible.\n I jumped into game development suddenly but I have a background in programming since I am a theoretical physicist and I have painted and drawn all my life. This has helped me a lot during the whole journey since I haven't had to remove any good idea for the game because of technical limitations.\nI am doing this project solo but I receive a lot of support and help from my wife, Fanny. We did a lot of brainstorming for the story and we often discuss artistic and gameplay ideas!\nThey loved the game! \nThe Escapist has selected the game for The Escapist Game Showcase!\n Gamejolt has selected Aveliana to be featured as an Indie Gem! \"YOU are an indie gem! Really excited to follow along on your progress!\" \nThe game was selected in a video by Best Indie Games!\nAll these awesome guys including IndieGameiacs!\n Why I am doing this Kickstarter? \nBy backing the project, you can really make it outstanding and support a solo indie dev who put all his heart into it! If the game release is successful, maybe I can make my dream come true and become a game developer! \nFirst, for the game development, I want to invest in a new computer because the one I am currently using has neither a great GPU nor CPU. This would help me to be more efficient in game making and game testing (which is an important upcoming phase). For now, it suffers a bit when I need to test the game having other software opened (Unity3D, Photoshop, etc.)!\nOne big reason to kickstart this project is that I would like to raise funds to attend game events and promote the game. I think many beautiful indie games have been forgotten because no one knew they ever existed. Going to such an event costs about 1-2 K$ for the registration fee, the transportation (when we are able to travel again), and a hotel room.\nThen I would like to be able to afford to pay the people who are gratefully contributing to the game. I am specifically thinking about game music. I think the music is so great that the composer deserves more than what she is asking for.\nI bought a few days ago instruments and tools to make and register music (a workstation, a MIDI controller, a sound card, a DAW software, and an amp)! But who will make this music and why? Well, my wife plays the piano very well and I play guitar so we want to make additional music for the game that will be played procedurally. This means, the current music will be used as intro/outro tracks and for special events in the game and the new music will vary depending on what you do! For instance, if you encounter a lot of enemies, the rhythm and instruments in the track will change. I hope this will create a unique atmosphere and I think I have not seen this kind of thing in a game! I am really excited about it and I will use part of the Kickstarter funds for the things I have bought.\n I really want to make a Switch version for the game, and reaching the main goal and then the stretch goal for it would convince me totally to do it! Plus, I have been accepted (in just 3 days!) as a Switch developer (this means they really loved my project)! I will surely dedicate some funds to the port to this console.\nThe Kickstarter goal of 12K will greatly help me with this project! It will also unlock the Kraken (a unique mini-boss that I will design, draw, and implement in the game!).\nThe two stretch goals are important bonuses! The first one is a totally new world and environment for the game that I will draw, design, and implement! This is a mock-up of an environment that I want to create: \nPLAY\n\n The second stretch goal will unlock the voice-over for the English version! I would love so much to have voices for the game story. \nA new and unique reward!\nI have added a new reward called \"The music lover\" which is unique and is a big support for me! \nFor the game, I want to continue working with Ally, who is making awesome tracks, and I want, with my wife, to create new music that will be used during the levels and will be generated procedurally. This means the music will change accordingly to what is happening with smooth transitions. For this, I borrowed some money to pay for a midi keyboard, a sound card and to pay for the 16-tracks version of Bitwig (it is a DAW, a software to create music). All the funds from this reward will be used used to reimburse the instruments and to pay for the upgraded version of Bitwig (I have found some really awesome sounds that can only be used in the \"studio edition\" and tested (but can't be saved) in the \"demo version\"). This is why this reward is unique and matters so much for me: it will contribute to an extremely important piece of the game! If you love music and game music this one is for you! You will have access to all the soundtracks that we will make thanks to your contribution and we can discuss about game music during a discussion.\n(you can make your design)\nBONUS: The music lover is the only one who will be able to add a bonus to his pledge to order a unique Vinyl of Aveliana's soundtracks! The design isn't definitive and because it will be edited only once, you'll be able to choose your image of the game for the cover and the sticker.\nPhysical rewards! (organic/environment-friendly materials)\nI have prepared rewards with a lot of attention and I hope you will love them!\nFirst of all, all ranks have access to a digital version of the game when it will be released!  \n A reward for everyone: If we reach the first Kickstarter goal, I will implement the Kraken into the game! Alongside much other stuff for which you can contribute!\nDiscover the rewards!\nThe design of the tote bag and Aveliana's portrait illustration has been done in collaboration with LesPetitsMo who is an awesome french artist I've discovered during the game development! \nThe other designs are the artworks I have done for the game. The scene with Aveliana and the fox is my absolute favorite, I have spent 10 hours on it! I also love the T-shirt design with Aveliana surrounded by many little details that correspond to the lore of the game (e.g. the fox, the medaillon). If you choose a reward with an illustration please contact me in order to tell me which one you prefer! (non-definitive designs)\nT-shirt (choose your design)\n\nTote bag (design LesPetitsMo)\nPrints (size approx. 21x31 cm)\nContribute to the game creation! \nI have prepared contributive rewards so you can participate in the game making!\nWrite a piece of text that will be added (on my approval) in the game! \nIt can be a side-story, a joke, a quote, a poem, anything you'd like! People will be able to read it in the game and you will be credited in the game! Characters in the game will talk about your legend, or have a laugh when reading your funny joke. I think this is really a unique way of adding your name to the game!\nDesign a new mini-boss or enemy for the game!\nWe will discuss and collaborate to make a new and awesome new monster for the game. Your contribution can be either sketch, drawings, animations, or just ideas of an awesome monster that would make the quest of Aveliana even more arduous!\n\nWhy doing eco-friendly rewards and at what cost? \nI have decided to make the rewards as respectful as possible of the environment because this is something that matters to me! I also wanted to have good fabric for the T-shirt, tote bag, and high-quality paper and printing for the illustrations. For this, I have decided not to increase the reward prices thus it will slightly reduce the margin I will get from physical rewards. For you, it's all beneficial and I hope you will appreciate it!\n Share the news and join us on social media! \nSince I have started the project, about 7 months ago, I have grown a community of more than 8K followers on Instagram, Twitter, and Discord. This has been an exceptional journey with a lot of awesome feedback. I would love it if you'd like to participate in it, follow me, discuss with me, and make the game even greater than it is right now! And you can find news about the game, about the Kickstarter, about Steam release, etc.\nFor the launch of the Kickstarter, I am going to start a fanart challenge! There is nothing to earn and it is all for fun (to thank all the artists that are following me)! The last events I organized received the participation of over a hundred people (#thefrenchdevDTIYS on Instagram)!  Check for more info on my social media!\nRemember you can wishlist the game on Steam!\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! MERCI!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks when doing such a big project alone. However, I have managed to progress a lot already on the game development and there are already many milestones that have been reached (getting a Steam page, making a demo, etc.).\n\nAt which stage am I in the project and what is the plan?\nEven if this is my first game development project, I think I know from the start where I am going and what is the scope of the game. This has helped me to always be on time with my schedule, and even be in advance on many aspects (for instance the IA of the game is already done, the game mechanics and the physics is coded, I have already about 18 levels that are completed and ready for polishing, etc.).\nI have started the game development on the 23rd of February and after about 1 month, I have started to send versions to people on my social media so they could try it and give me feedback. I got a lot of positive feedback and bugs to solve. After 2 months of game development, I have proposed a \"pre-alpha mockup\" on Gamejolt, which has been played more than 250 times! I received a ton of really good feedback and this demo was stable. Then I focused on doing a real demo for the game, the one you can find now on Gamejolt. This version is a glimpse at what will be the game in terms of story, art design, gameplay...\n\nNow for the next 6 months, I want to focus on drawing all the levels of the game (about 25 for about 6-7 hours of estimated gameplay). On the fly, I will of course add new enemies, implement the story, and add features (such as unlocking new abilities for Aveliana). After this, I will enter the final phase of the game development and during the last 6 months, I will focus on polishing everything. Playtest the game a lot and finish the drawings, animations, cutscenes...\n\nI think I can say now that the game will be finished because the project is sufficiently advanced and I see where I am going with it. All the stages have been completed ahead of time until now. \nThe current version of the game is playable and stable, it is just too short and it doesn't carry yet the story I want to tell!

With no memory of this place, you will explore and rediscover the serene and peaceful existence you once had here. Welcome to Everafter Falls.\nWhile you were gone, some things have gone a little astray. Find out why you are needed and what lies in store. Players can complete the game at their own pace and will have an option to continue playing indefinitely even after finishing the core story.\n\nA Pet that will always be by your side...\nYour pet comes with 2 basic abilities - Dig and Water. This design decision reduces the amount of tools cluttering up your inventory and makes possible some other interesting mechanics.\nYour pet can be taught new abilities. Is your inventory full while traversing the dungeons but you don't want to travel back to town? Send your pet to town to sell off its inventory while you continue exploring.\n\nNeed to get out of a tight situation or just reduce travelling time? Yes, Pet teleportation is a thing on Everafter Falls. \nPet Teleportation is a learnable skill\nGrow a huge range of fruits and vegetables\nEverafter Falls host a large variety of crops and plants, with some strange and unique species not found on Earth. Discovering and acquiring some of these may not be easy, but will be a rewarding experience. Below is a preview of what you will find in the game, with plans for more to come. \nHarvestable fruit and vegetables\nAll crops have a good number of visually distinct growth stages so that you know where they are in their growth cycle.\nA preview of crop growth stages\nTrees fruit at different rates and have a different maximum fruit capacity depending on variety. Waiting until they bear the maximum amount of fruit will yield more fruit over time, compared to harvesting as soon as the first fruits emerge. Discover what other methods can be used to increase fruit yields even further!\nMushrooms can be found in the wild or grown with the right equipment\nCraft various drones to help you with farm work, fishing, and general support. Each drone can be enhanced with up to 3 Drone Parts, giving them extra functionality. Support Drones are unique in that they can be equipped and will follow you around.\nA Water Drone automatically waters your crops\nChoose drone parts to modify drones to suit your needs\nA support drone can be equipped to provide extra inventory slots and additional firepower for the Dungeons.\nSomething I have not spent much time on yet are the farm animals. I plan to have around 5-8 different species that can be bred and will produce valuable goods. Some species may not be familiar to ones on Earth.\n\nOne species that has already been decided on is the the Alpaca. I could not resist working on this first. You'll be able to harvest super soft wool from them.\nFarm Alpacas for their soft, soft wool\nA behind-the-scenes look at animating these little fellas.\nWhat are Pixies?\nPixies are tiny little helpers that can be caught. They can then be placed on various things for different effects. You can sustainably harvest stone from rocks and wood from trees without destroying them using Blue Pixies. Green Pixies will help increase the growth rates of any plant or speed up processing times for the machines you craft! Discover what rare Red Pixies can do - if you ever catch one.\nPixies can harvest resources like wood and stone without destroying the tree or rock\n\nHow to catch Pixies\nPixies can be caught by placing edible offerings inside Pixie Shrines. Check back the following day to see if you find a pixie inside it. The quality of the offering and location of the pixie shrine will determine the chances of attracting a Pixie and also type pixie caught. Shrines can be crafted, however, the town center has a Golden Shrine that, once restored, can be used to attract rarer Pixies.\nDiscover what else pixies can do when you discover them\nRestore structures around town and put them to good use\nDiscover Cards along the way and eat them to gain their powers.\nCharacter progression is handled by earning cards either by completing quests or through special events. More often than not, you will be presented with 3 to choose from so you can decide what direction you want to take that best suits your playstyle. Will you choose cards that help you maximize profits from your farm, or strengthen your skills in combat so you can dive deeper into the dungeons?\nCard choices direct character progression\nAfter choosing a card, you'll need to eat it. How else are you going to gain it's powers?\nTastes like cardboard\nExplore the peaceful town and meet its inhabitants. Attend festivals, celebrate special events, find hidden areas and help restore things back to their former glory.\nOne of many areas in town to explore\nPenguin Post\nAll mail in Everafter Falls is delivered through Penguin Post. Pip and Pepper are the penguins that run this service and use carrier Pigeons to do the delivery. Every now and again, you may find a pigeon who has forgotten how to fly. Bring it to the post office where Pip and Pepper (the penguins who run the joint) will give it a job delivering mail.\nMail being delivered by pigeons who have forgotten how to fly\nGradually Changing Seasons\nFor a more immersive experience, trees change at different rates when the season changes. This small touch not only increase diversity in the environment, but provides a visual cue for when a season is ending and a new one starting.\nTrees will change at different rates to indicate the coming of a new season\nPersonalize your experience and create the character you want to play with many options to choose from.\nCharacter Creation\nMake your home yours\nThere are many types of decorations to find and collect to make your home unique. Below are some examples from each category.\nCustomize your home with a huge variety of items\nFine tuned decorations, place anything for display on shelves and tables.\nNot only can you decorate your house with various furniture including floor furniture, rugs and wall items (clocks, windows), you can also choose what to display on all shelves and tables. In addition to this, most furniture can have its color changed using a potion dye crafted from some unique fruit species.\nFishing and The Town Aquarium\nEverafter Falls is a host to many kinds of fish, some you will be unfamiliar with. The Town Aquarium has recently undergone repairs and needs your help to repopulate it. Receive special rewards for collecting as many types as you can.\nFishing is a lucrative business here in Everafter Falls\nThe town aquarium can showcase every type of fish you've caught\nA large number of marine species to discover for those who love to collect!\nCombat in this genre has been the area most lacking and I hope to change that trend. Everafter Falls features a dungeon with many levels and lots of enemies to encounter.\nThe game will have a moderate level of progressing difficulty and will be somewhat challenging if players want to focus solely on traversing the dungeons. For those who prefer a more casual approach, if enough time is spent doing other activities and progressing in other areas of the game, players will acquire items and abilities that can make fighting enemies a breeze.\nTaking down enemies is a breeze with help from your Pet and a Support Drone.\nPreview of some monsters you'll encounter in the dungeons\nItem Drops with random stat generation\nDiscover unique and powerful items that can help you on your adventure. Items can boost combat stats, or increase farm productivity. They can provide bonuses to your card levels, drones, and pet skills. Enjoy the thrill of finding ultra rare and unique items.\nEquipable Items with random stat generation\nOn this adventure, you'll meet a lot of fun and strange characters along the way. Complete fun and wacky quests to uncover their stories and earn items that will help you on your journey. \nMany characters are waiting to share their stories with you.\nEverafter Falls will not have a bachelor/bachelorette system (you are the only human here). Such a system would be difficult to reason for as the intricate relationships between the characters and player is tightly bound to the story. Have fun learning about the characters and their lives and perhaps they may share intimate moments with you if you've earned enough of their trust.\nComplete important quests for great rewards.\nYou\u2019ll be able to make some neat stuff that will help you make other neat stuff! There will be a huge number of items to discover, craft, produce, and refine. Below is a small preview of crafting and equipment processing.\nCraft and create machines to help you process items into other valuable and useful goods.\nA relaxing, fun, and memorable soundtrack\nEverafter Falls will have an Original Soundtrack composed by Tim Carlos. He has already produced some outstanding tracks for the game, please have a listen below. All pledges above the \"Post Pigeon\" tier will receive the Original Soundtrack digitally.\n If you enjoy what you hear, you can find more about Tim through his website  TimCarlos.com or follow him on Twitter  @tflatminor \n\n **Please note that I have mistakenly put \"Digital Copy of the Game\" and then \"Digital Copy of the game at a discounted price\" under Pledge Rewards for the \"Kickstarter Pricing\" tier. Please note only 1 copy of the game is given at this price. \nReference chart for pledge tiers and rewards\nBelow is a preview of the exclusive in-game posters, these can only be redeemed by backers with a provided code and cannot be obtained otherwise. Please visit Penguin Post in-game and submit your code. The item will be sent to you via a delivery pigeon!\nPreview of Excusive in-game Poster Rewards\nThe game will be released for PC/Mac/Linux first via Steam in March 2022, with the Nintendo Switch version following several months later. I would love to release on all platforms/consoles, however, as a solo developer, I need to ensure I don't spread myself too thinly to keep the project manageable. The possibility of Playstation and Xbox releases will likely be considered after the game has been released on the Nintendo Switch.\nBackers can choose to receive their digital copy of the game on for any available platform but please be aware of the different planned release dates. These are fairly conservative dates but are still estimates and may change.\nAlpha testing is planned to start mid 2021, and the Beta testing towards the end of 2021.\nThe Digital Art Book will include exclusive WIP images, character designs and some fantastic artwork commissioned by various artists.\nCommissioned artwork by Daniel Bogni\nCommissioned artwork by Jamsino\nI was raised in Australia, but was born in Cambodia. My family and I were lucky enough to have immigrated to Australia during the Khmer Rouge era. I am very fortunate to have had the education I had in Australia, without it, I wouldn't be in the position I am now.\nI moved back to Cambodia at the age of 32 hoping for a new direction in life. Thanks to the lower cost of living, moving back here has afforded me the opportunity to work almost full time on this game for nearly 3 years now.\nThese last 3 years have been spent juggling game development, freelance design work, and being a father to my now 2 year old son.\nI chose to do this Kickstarter so I can focus on doing what I love, which is working on this game. Additionally, It would help me with funding for the Original  Soundtrack. I am also hoping to create a community of fans that can provide feedback and help shape the game into the best it can be.\nAll the core systems have been completed and are in a playable state, with a decent amount of content complete. Much more content is planned, and a lot more time needs to be spent on the combat/dungeons. \nI set out from the very start to create a game I would enjoy, in a genre that has rekindled my love for gaming. I have poured a lot of love and energy into making it what it is today. A successful campaign will take a load off my shoulders and provide enough funding to last the rest of development.\nI am extremely grateful for anyone backing this project, with your support, I hope to develop a game that will provide you many hours of wholesome fun. Thank you so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving poured everything in into this project for nearly 3 years now, I am fully aware of the difficulties and challenges faced with developing and shipping a game alone.\n\nAfter going public with the game a couple of months ago, I've been overwhelmed with the positive response and show of support. I aim to do my best to release a game that will not disappoint.\n\nI originally aimed for a release date at the end of 2021, however, have since pushed it back to mid 2022 to be a little more conservative with timing and to better meet expectations for the launch date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 24 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Pricing", "descp": "- Get the game on release date at a discounted rate here on Kickstarter (Full price US$19.99 / AU$29)\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Copy of the game at a Discount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["764 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 35 or more", "title": "Small Sprout", "descp": "Show extra support for the project by getting the game bundled with the Digital Art Book and an exclusive in-game poster, and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Thank You\" in Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["368 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 65 or more", "title": "Post Penguin", "descp": "Get the game on release, bundled with the digital soundtrack, digital art book, and an exclusive in-game poster and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Big Thank You\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["97 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 105 or more", "title": "Beta Bee", "descp": "Get Beta Access to the game, along with the game on release date, digital soundtrack, digital artbook, exclusive in game poster and your name in the credits as a Beta Tester.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nBeta Access\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Beta Bee\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nName in Credits as \"Beta Tester\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 210 or more", "title": "Alpha Alpaca", "descp": "Be one of the first to play the game by becoming an Alpha Tester.

What do you do?\n\u25b6 FIGHT\n\u25b6 ITEM\n\u25b6 RUN\nThe Game\nFight Item Run cover - design is subject to change.\nFight Item Run is a Powered by the Apocalypse game that smashes action-packed combat and magic together with dynamic character and relationship exploration. The dungeon is the structure and sole setting, though \"dungeon\" can be interpreted as anything from cave systems to cloud cities. The party begins in a chamber and there are monsters; once they\u2019ve defeated the monsters, they proceed to the next chamber where there are more monsters. Chambers also have items, treasures, puzzles, and mysteries. When the party has collected the adequate gear to advance to the next level of the dungeon, they come to the chamber with the passage down (or up for a tower or with a portal to some nonlinear other realm) to advance further. The goals for Fight Item Run are the following:\n\u25b6 Fight monsters, collect items, survive the dungeon.\n\u25b6 Tell a collaborative story of mystery and adventure.\n\u25b6 Plant and build upon evocative details at every chance.\n\u25b6 Explore the lives and relationships of characters traveling together.\nCombat & Recovery\nFight Item Run is played in two phases: Combat and Recovery. Combat is forward motion and Recovery is retreating. When there are monsters and danger, the characters are in Combat. If all characters run from Combat, then they are in Recovery until they advance forward again. Each phase has a set of basic moves available to all players, as well as opportunities for players to use moves unique to their character's Class and School of Magic.\nCombat features tactics built around creative interpretations of flavor text\u2014if you think the fire sword you picked up from the last red demon you beat would be good against a tree monster, it is. Combat is also the launching point fo narrative cutscenes and relationship building.\nRecovery is packed with valuable downtime activities, including for the players. In and out of character recaps and safety tools are built in to the entire system and take center stage during Recovery.\nCutscenes\nSeamlessly switch into a cinematic storytelling mode with Cutscenes when certain milestones are met during Combat or Recovery, such as beating a Boss or the party all being knocked down to zero HP. The intro Cutscene is a tutorial to get players having fun with what they want their characters to be able to do, picking the consequences themselves. Explore character backstories and relationships at various checkpoints and give each other credit for a game well played during the final credits Cutscene. Wield minor Cutscenes, in addition to the big ones, as tools to pause, fast forward, skip, or rewind the narrative.\nAffinity\nAction-packed monster battles, bizarre and powerful feats of magic, and delving deep into the secrets of the dungeon are the framework for beautiful relationships to blossom. Unlock little moments throughout play to confide in and learn about these other adventurers you're traveling with. Your fellow party members will grow alongside you as you notice each other in those pivotal situations of danger, daring, and intimacy. There are perks to affinities as well: give minor bonuses to your allies as you bond with them and, when they bond gets stronger, crystallize it into new gear.\nitems & abilities\nFight Item Run blends \"soft\" and \"hard\" mechanics, bringing in special abilities and gear with flavor text that has actual impact during play. Defeat a spiky monster and draw from it a spiked hook sword, which is particularly effective at catching the antlers of the next monster and bringing it down. Defeat a slime monster and draw from it a gooey suit that allows you to slip through cracks. Use your slime suit to slip inside the giant haunted armor and use your hook sword to tear it apart from within. Adapt, grow, collect, and advance. \nEven the most well-equipped adventurers rely on good ol' fashioned consumables: gather single use items, like MegaPotions, Restores, Special Brews, Beast Stones, and ParalyzePlus, to increase your odds, barter with merchants, and mix into alchemical experiments.\nThe Book\nFight Item Run is being offered in three formats: illustrated PDF, accessible plain text, and hardcover. The accessible plain text is designed to be easily readable, with screen readers in mind. All versions have the same content and the PDF and the ePub are included in all tiers starting at the digital-only level. Fight Item Run is 60+ full color pages at 5.5\" x 8.5\".\nThe three illustrated versions are framed by pixel art from different iconic terrain. Below are two digital mockups (not final text or layout!) of example interior pages.\nDigital mockup: not final art or design. The grassland terrain is nice, quaint place to begin an adventure or a reprieve after surfacing from a dungeon.\nWhile these pages don't have final text or layouts, the design intention is present: information is clearly highlighted. Key terms pop out of paragraphs, headings are clear and descriptive, and lists are organized and spaced for quick scanning.\n\nDigital mockup: not final art or design. The desert terrain is hot, dry, and unforgiving, battering adventures just as roughly as the hearty monsters that stalk the sands.\nThe Team\nThe game is written by me, Tay Curreysmith (he/him). I wrote Fight Item Run as a nostalgic love letter to the feeling I had as a little brother watching my older siblings play classic jrpg and metroidvania type games. My oldest brother named Red XIII after me in one of his many playthroughs of Final Fantasy 7 to tease me\u2014haha, he named the dog after me\u2014but I just thought it was so cool to be a part of that world. I was terrible at MegaMan, but I got to be Zero when my brother and I played pretend. These games, at least my idea of them as an observer, would go on to inspire my earliest game designs and motivate me to always continue creating.\nMy editors are Summer (she/her), who consulted on mechanics, and Lauren Bryant-Monk (she/her), who provided safety editing. I'm very thankful to both of them for elevating Fight Item Run beyond my abilities.\nBrittany \"Bri\" Williams (she/her, they/them) is on board as a writer and story lead for the playable campaign/setting modules included in Fight Item Run.\nMia \"Hye\" Mardikian (she/her, they/them) brings Fight Item Run to life with stunning graphic design. Intuitive typography highlights and organizes the text, which is all overlaid unique pixel art backgrounds. Background art is designed by Hye using tilesets by Diego del Solar (he/him) aka Shackhal. Cover pixel art is by Brian Wolf (they/them), who will also provide interior illustrations unlocked by stretch goals, with graphic design by Hye.\nThe Rewards\nIf you're not the type to get a game on launch day, then back at the Supporter level to get your name in the credits and notifications on all the updates. Every contribution is deeply appreciated!\nBack at the Virtual Emulator level to grab the two digital versions and save on shipping. Your name will be added to the credits under your pledge level, including at all the higher pledge levels too.\nThe Cartridge level includes the beautiful digest-sized hardcover copy. At 5.5\" by 8.5\", this full color book is ready to go\u2014you don't even need to blow into it first.\nThe premium tiers start with Build Your Own Mods where you get to hop on an hour call with me to talk hacking, homebrewing, and how you can make your Fight Item Run experience totally unique.\nHave a hand in the game itself with the Choose Your Fighter! pledge. I'll work with you to design a playable Class to be included in the final game. Bring to life your favorite homage!\nAdd-Ons\nThis campaign is part of Kickstater's beta testing of add-ons, which can be added on to any pledge level. These include extra downloads and copies of books, as well a few very special options.\nStarting with Shackhal's tileset, I designed Pixel Art Six-Sided Dice (which is what Fight Item Run uses) that can be added to any pledge, including the digital-only level. These dice hold their details well at 25mm (jumbo size!) and are printed, not just stickers.\nKeep the rules at your fingertips with the Quick Reference Deck add-on: a deck of cards featuring all the moves, as well as other key rule highlights. Each card also includes the page number the move or rule originally appears on for easy reference to the original context.\n25mm pixel art dice sample; design is not final.\n\nStretch Goals\nStretch Goals through $4,000 have been unlocked! Check back soon for more.\n\nWe're knocking out these stretch goals! You've already unlocked 9 additional interior illustrations by Brian Wolf and an additional campaign setting by Bri Williams! Keep checking back for more stretch goals to be announced.We're knocking out these stretch goals! You've already unlocked 9 additional interior illustrations by Brian Wolf and an additional campaign setting by Bri Williams! Additionally, a sticker sheet using art by Brian Wolf will be added to all physical tiers.\nSocial Stretch Goal: Click through to the tweet. 100 retweets unlocks an audiobook version of Fight Item Run available for free to all backers at the Virtual Emulator tier and up.\nThe Process\nWriting is complete and editing is already done and paid for. Design is already underway. The main steps left to complete, that we'll need funding for, includes the extra art and the printing and shipping of the books.\nCost Breakdown: 47.8% for production, 8.8% for fees, 9.0% buffer, 16.9% for design, and 17.5% for shipping.\nDue to the small quantities we're printing at, cost per unit decreases pretty quickly as total units go up. The savings go towards funding interior spot art illustrations by cover artist Brian Wolf (in their illustrative style, not pixel art), which are unlocked at each stretch goal. Everything else scales proportionally: as we get more backers, the higher production costs, shipping, and fees get. These are the only planned stretch goals, but ask me again if this project turns into a giant runaway success.\nA note on shipping: Shipping is really expensive and costs are constantly on the rise. If the cost of shipping is prohibitive for you, especially international backers, please message me directly. I might be able to reduce the cost for you or arrange a bulk shipment to be sent to a local game store. In fact, if you have a local game store, please let them know about this campaign and we might be able to save everyone some money if order direct as a retailer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done a few Kickstarters now, big and small. The last one failed, but I'd like to chalk that up at least in part to it happening during the early phases of a global pandemic\u2014my priorities shifted. I'm keeping this campaign relatively simple, only promising products that are made or are readily manufacturable. I am not offering, nor will I, products that require me to write more. I'm way too slow at it. I'm also not promising commissions, which were difficult to coordinate in the Spell: The RPG campaign. Kickstarter did approve this project for add-ons, which I'm very excited about! I've used add-ons previously with third party providers, so I expect everything to be smoother running through Kickstarter.\n\nI'm being realistic about shipping dates and costs, which is difficult to plan around, but also acknowledges the dire state of the USPS, as well as countless interrupted supply chains.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady? Let\u2019s Go!\nClick for a PDF of this graph!\nWondering what\u2019s involved in all those delicious bullet-points on that reward tier you\u2019ve been flirting with? Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Just a Taste", "descp": "All backers at $10 and up get immediate access to the fully playable prototype PDF.

Discover different weapons, items, and abilities that will help you progress and discover new areas.\nDesigned and developed by one guy hoping to recreate that special feeling of being dropped into new unexplored territory and setting off on a new adventure.\nComing to Windows, Mac, and Nintendo Switch in October 2021.\n\nFeatures\nClassic side-scrolling action in a modernized retro pixel art style.\nSharp and precise character movement and attack abilities.\nHand-drawn pixel art brought to life with frame-by-frame animation.\n Metroidvania at heart heavily focused on exploring and being rewarded for it.\nA vast interconnected world with secrets, enemies, and quirky little robots.\nSatisfying combat. Slash your way through enemies.\nAbilities\nAll of Haiku's abilities allow for multiple uses, whether it being in combat, quick traversal around the map, or for finding hidden passageways.\nCollect different power-ups and explore new areas.\nSword: Your main weapon to eradicate machines carrying the evil virus.\nDash: Dart skillfully away from attacks and zip past hazards.\nDouble jump: Fly high over enemies and reach new heights as you explore.\nRoll: Speed through corridors and get through tight gaps.\nBomb: Use brute force to get past certain objects and to damage enemies.\nGrapple: Swing between platforms and use the momentum to reach difficult areas.\nCombine abilities to reach extra difficult areas.\n\nUpgrades\nCollect spare parts from enemies and use them in the store to buy upgrades for your abilities. Beware, you won't be able to buy every upgrade from the store, some are scattered across the map so you'll have to go out and find them.\nBuy upgrades from the vending machine character.\nThe world of Haiku is inspired by retro-monochromatic pixel art with a modern twist so you will see only a few colors onscreen at a time. The entire palette is made up of only 16 colors. Each one has been specially picked to offer a surprisingly large range of color combinations.\nEverything is drawn by hand and animated frame-by-frame to achieve that retro look.\nIf you like the look of this tool, then check out Aseprite - it's perfect for pixel art and animation.\n\nInspired by movies like The Matrix and games like The Legend of Zelda: BoTW.\nHaiku wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world where humans no longer exist. After the extinction of the human race, machines were the only intelligent beings left to inhabit the planet. \nFour artificial intelligent beings soon evolved and developed a world of order and stability. Programs and machines lived in peace for many years, until the virus spread.\nIt corrupted the programs first, then after, the machines. The machines could not function without the correct programs and so the world began to break down.\nIt's up to Haiku to restore order!\nThe entire world consists of approximately 8 areas. Here are a few that you'll encounter along your journey to save the world from the evil virus:\nCity: On lockdown to prevent the computer virus from spreading.\nOne of the city entrances can be found at the city's foundations.\n\nGarbage: Waste produced from the city above falls into this area. Due to the poor conditions, the virus spread quickly down here.\nThe conveyor belts that move the garbage stopped working a long time ago.\n\nSewers: What game would be complete without a water level?\nIf there's water that means there could be life, right?\n\nPower source: The heart of Haiku's world, where all power is produced and distributed to different areas. There is a dark history of how this power was first produced.\nSome of the electric pods are broken, and spilling a strange yellow liquid.\n\nForgotten ruins: A safe haven, (almost) untouched by the virus.\nInteract with unique characters as you travel through the lands.\n\nSurface: Expect to find bones, skeletons, and the remains of the human race scattered across the surface of the planet. Access to the special backer area, the Catacombs, can be found around here.\nNever-ending black rain from the radiation.\n\nThe Catacombs (special backer area!): A sanctuary and memorial for the forgotten human race. Get your name and message added to the game as one of the last human survivors before their extinction (see rewards for more info).\nAvailable for Beta tester, Super fan, Collector and Builder backer tiers!\nThe entire world and its enemies are based on one simple theme: machines. Therefore I use everyday objects as inspiration for coming up with enemy concepts. Here are just a few:\nGarbage area: Washing machine, Nokia, trash bin, nut, and bolt.\nPowerhouse area: Electro-magnet, battery, surveillance camera, and light bulbs.\nWhile I don't want to reveal any main storyline bosses, there are plenty of mini-bosses or optional bosses that you will encounter along the way. Each boss has its own back story and is designed around the theme of its area. Here is one sneak-peek:\nGarbage magnet: Residing in the Garbage area, tormented by his own past and by what the virus has brought upon his family.\n<phase one initiated>\n<\u20b1\u2c67\u20b3\u20b4\u0246 \u20ae\u20a9\u00d8 \u0142\u20a6\u0142\u20ae\u0142\u20b3\u20ae\u0246\u0110>\nHi there! I'm Jordan, I love playing games and now I love making them. Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing games with an open-world, where you wanna check out where that path leads to? And the game just lets you! I love that feeling of exploring a world on your own terms and creating your own proper adventure.\nFor the last year, I've spent every day learning about pixel art, animation, and game development to work on my dream project 'Haiku, the Robot'. All while working a full-time job. With this project, I hope to recreate that feeling of being dropped into new unexplored territory and setting off on a new adventure.\nJoin me for behind-the-scenes news on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or Discord!\nFor the longest time, I have always dreamed of making my very own video game and to be honest, I still can't believe that I'm doing it. From the very first time I jumped into Unity's game engine, I fell in love with game development, and I can truly say that it has changed my life.\nWith this Kickstarter campaign, you can help change my life for good and make this dream a reality. Just like most of you, I currently work a 9-5 job, which doesn\u2019t leave me with as much time as I\u2019d like to create Haiku and his wonderful world. With the funds, I will be able to quit my job and dedicate 100% of my time to the project. For the next year, I want to pour all my passion into building a truly amazing world full of secrets for you guys to explore and uncover.\nBudget breakdown\nYour contributions will ensure that I can devote 100% of my work-week to completing the project. The rest will go towards your rewards and shipping, paying the tax man and giving Kickstarter a little cut! \n'Haiku, the Robot' is planned to release in October 2021 on Steam, and later on Nintendo Switch, if we hit the stretch goal. (Check the Stretch goals section!)\nChoose between a copy on Steam or Nintendo Switch if we meet stretch goals!\nYou can already wishlist the game on Steam!\n\nWhy is Nintendo Switch a stretch goal? As I am self-publishing the game, I plan to release it on Steam first and make sure that everything works correctly on PC & Mac before moving onto the Nintendo Switch launch. This way I can dedicate the necessary time to making sure that players have the best experience across all platforms.\nNintendo has already approved my official Nintendo Switch Developer license!\nPrices in \u20ac and $ are an approximation as exchange rates can vary.\nFree shipping included! All physical rewards will be sent out as soon as possible.\nThis is the same t-shirt that I have on in the video :D\nChoose between a black or white T-shirt. Available sizes: S - 3XL\nOne mug size: 11oz\nAvailable sock sizes: M - XL\n\nWhat is a Haiku poem and how can I write one? More details can be found here: https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/style-and-usage/rules-for-writing-haiku.html\nImportant: the Haiku poem does NOT have to be related to the game!\nSuper important: make sure to use the hashtag #HaikuKickstarter so I can find your poems later! I will announce the winners at the end of the campaign, good luck!\nI am very active on social media, so make sure to drop a follow on your preferred platform for behind-the-scenes and frequent updates!\nYou can already wishlist the game on Steam!\nLastly, I wanted to give out a special thanks to everyone who helped with the Kickstarter page, from people reviewing and giving suggestions, all the way to making translations for the trailer so a wider audience can learn about my story.\nA special thanks to everyone who has followed my progress over the last year, everyone who leaves me nice comments and continuously motivates me to continue moving forward. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for all of you, so thank you! <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is my first commercial game and I am not an experienced game developer, I do have first-hand experience in project planning and project execution from working in an IT software company for 4 years.\n\nMost of the groundwork for the game is done, this includes core mechanics, abilities (except for that darn grapple hook), art direction, art style, the main storyline, and more. What's left is building more of the amazing world, enemies, and background story.\n\nWith that said, I have made good estimates for the project with plenty of wiggle room for bug testing and other things but there is always a strong possibility of running into some unknowns along the way. Not to worry though, I will always keep you in the loop with monthly updates and videos so there will be 100% transparency between the project and you (the backers making this dream a reality)!\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll be testing the game extensively throughout its entire development. Both locally and in beta tests, which I hope some of you will help me out with! Ultimately, this game is for all of YOU, so it's super important for me to get feedback and create something great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Get the game!", "descp": "ABOUT \u20ac14 / $15 - Get a digital copy of 'Haiku, the Robot' for Steam!

It really does worry too much...what's the worst that could happen with Beatrice by your side? Even a flock of Depraven wouldn't mess with a freshly bloomed Lullabile.\"\n\n .....WHAT IS \"MORTASHEEN???\" \n\nOpticaper, Lagomust and Zeze, monsters that pre-date my shift to digital color\n\nI'm Jonathan Wojcik, creator of multiple online comics, short stories and other media you can enjoy on my website, bogleech.com, one of the most ambitious of which is the world of Mortasheen. Inspired as far back as the early 2000's by the then-recent success of series like Pokemon, Digimon and even Neopets, Mortasheen is my own original monster-training universe with emphasis on crawling parasites, oozing fungi, chattering ghouls and bizarre, uncanny biotechnology.\n\nEledirge, Amoebeyes and Hissbegotten\n\nIn the nearly 20 years (!!!) since I came up with the setting, I've personally created over 700 monsters - and counting! - that you can browse HERE, though a great deal of them warrant updated illustrations and updated descriptions.  Every single monster mashes up a little of everything I love most in the world; the \"bug eyed monsters\" of 50's B-movies, the surreal grisliness of horror manga, monstrous Tokusatsu villains, artists like Beksinski or Giger or Sydney Sime and especially the real, actual biology thriving all around us in the form of incredible insects, worms, slime molds and parasites.\n\n\nToxicoil\n\nTo quote how someone else once put it, the simplest watered-down explanation of Mortasheen would be \"Cronenberg Pokemon,\" except that, despite its motifs of toxic waste and body horror, the world of Mortasheen leans more toward's the Pokemon world's cheerful attitude and cutesy humor, marrying morbidity and optimism in a similar manner to the good old Addams Family.  Mortasheen is not and should never be a bleak, grimdark post-apocalypse.\n\n\"SO WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A ROLEPLAYING GAME?\"\n\nJunjo, Apteros and Scuttlegeist\nSo, it was way, way back in 2009 that I was approached with the idea to develop Mortasheen into an independent tabletop roleplaying game, especially as there had yet to be a successful example of a pen and paper \"mons\" game - still rare to this day! The project wasn't meant to take more than an entire decade, but as entirely the \"art side\" of the project, all gameplay development had to be left up to a tiny circle of people who had to continue ironing out and playtesting their original, trademark battle system in their very, very limited personal time.\nIt's an entirely unpaid development process now lengthy enough that I have been asked about it by cognizant, literate internet users who describe themselves as \"growing up\" with Mortasheen (!!!) and, in some cases, were not actually born yet when I first promised to release something \"soon.\"\n\nEyedra\n\nI myself was in my teens when I drew what would become Mortasheen's first official monsters, I was in my 20's when we started on an RPG concept, and now, I am entering the final years of my 30's. I am not going to let myself wake up at 40 one day with nothing to show for what's basically my life's work, so it's now or never to finally release the game, and I want to be able to make it far, far more worth that wait than it was ever initially going to be, which is where kickstarter comes in.\n\n\"WHAT WILL THE CORE RULEBOOK INCLUDE?\"\n\n\nMortasheen's core rulebook is, like all good rulebooks, much more than play mechanics. For officially the first time, it will flesh out the setting's more unique characters, cultures and environments beyond what you can glean from the existing monster profiles, and will hopefully be an entertaining read even for those who don't actually play tabletop games. It's a world guide and an art book, and we want to release it both digitally and physically with the most polished art and writing we can manage. Contents will include:\n\nPLAYER \"RACES:\"  What peculiar humanoids live in the Mortasheen world, creating all these freaky fiends to battle one another? You either already knew or correctly guessed the answers include things like \"bug people\" and \"gross cyborgs.\"\nCHARACTER CLASSES & SUBCLASSES: everybody's pretty much a \"mad scientist\" in this setting...but what kind? A bonkers botanist? A crackpot chemist? An irrational engineer? The schools of \"science\" in Mortasheen can allow you to customize and boost your monsters in their own strange ways.\nNPC CHARACTERS: famous figures around Mortasheen city, each as peculiar as the monsters they hire to help run their various equally peculiar business endeavors.\nLOCALES: the undulating, undead Corpse Sea. The organic subterranean labyrinth of Axabod. The surreal, twisted forest of the Devil Birds. Sectors of the city and beyond are laid out in detail!\nVILLAINS: what even constitutes an ultimate threat in this setting!? Mortasheen is practically made out of threats! But if it's threats all the way down, there still has to be one at the top.\nTABLES AND LISTS OF ASSORTED WEIRDNESS: what physics-bending nonsense comes of a wormhole experiment? What are the deadliest fungi in the sewers? What can you order at the kind of fast food window that might possibly attempt to eat you first? These and other questions will be answered!\nMORE STUFF: we still haven't covered everything the book will contain!\n\nAt minimum, the final book will be 100-150 pages, full color, probably 8.5x11 inches and available in both soft and hard covers. I intend to try and get the book finished and available for purchase within one year from this campaign's end, coinciding with 2021's Halloween season, but if we finish it sooner, we'll see about releasing it sooner as well!\n\nSanguinettle\n\nWith this campaign's funding and that single extra year of time, I intend to backpay those who have already volunteered hard work on the game and commission a number of additional artists to not only add a more varied, striking range of illustrations but help to improve my own artwork for the book, most of which I completed more than eight years ago and no longer find all that satisfactory. \n\n SOME CONTRIBUTING ARTISTS. AND SAMPLES OF THEIR PREVIOUS WORK:\nBiomechanicalmush!\nArtblog - twitter\n  Laurence Iguanamouth\nArtblog \nFrancine B./Witnesstheabsurd\nArtstation - Twitter - Email\n\n........And hopefully more!\n\n\n\nABOUT THE MORTASHEEN WORLD:\n\nThe titular \"Mortasheen\" itself is the name of an ancient, biomechanical city so improbably vast that light never reaches what used to be \"street level,\" an entire small town could fit on a single factory rooftop and the tallest structures are perpetually snow-capped.\n\nIronically, the sheer scale of this metropolis makes it as lawless and wild as an untamed jungle. It has never been mapped, it seemingly expands by a will of its own, and those powerful enough to seize any kind of leadership role are still lucky to have more than one skyscraper under their jurisdiction. About the only thing remotely centralizing a city \"culture\" is the universal dependency upon bio-engineered monsters for everyday tasks, and the subsequent importance of arcane science as a fundamental life skill. Educational and research institutions reign supreme, with the most prestigious regularly hosting public battle tournaments and handing out all manner of exciting quests as they train students into the next generation of bioengineers.\n\n\nAn entire adventure series could practically be contained in a single \"city block\" of Mortasheen, but its continent-spanning tangle of architecture and machinery has also long transformed the world beyond its borders. There are meat-eating forests, living flesh caverns, a \"sea\" of solid garbage, another \"sea\" of squirming reanimated corpses, a desert of bone-controlling fungus and more. Most wildlife left on the surface has re-evolved from the rats, crows, cockroaches and other urban critters that endured the global contamination of the city's waste processes, and those few normal, natural humans inhabiting the outside world have had to adapt many extreme methods of survival, from living entirely inside of roving war machines to hiding out in orbit.\n...No, honest, it STILL doesn't have an edgy grimdark tone. I promise.\n\n ABOUT THE MONSTERS! \nMortasheen does not have \"elemental types,\" but its monsters are divided into thirteen classes, which are as follows:\nBIOCONSTRUCTS are engineered both for combat and, in many cases, practical everyday uses. This Slurpentine for instance functions as pest control, using its sweet, flypaper-like body to collect and consume the many tiny, swarming things that can not only pose a major nuisance in Mortasheen, but are often weaponized by other monsters. The majority of Mortasheen's monsters are Bioconstructs, in turn divided into Genetizoa (fully organic) and Abiozoa (partially inorganic) creatures, ranging from ancient and terrifying weapons of destruction to dangerously powerful organic washing machines.\nZOMBIE SPAWN are literally born from the bodies of regular zombies, which are more of a \"background presence\" in this setting than a central part of its horror slant. Zombie Spawn typically develop from an egg-like teratoma any zombie may develop with significant age, and despite their pitiful appearances, they are much more dangerous than their shambling \"parents,\" with extreme regenerative powers that can withstand almost anything. This Beeblezug can spew symbiotic maggotoids that could easily reduce someone to gleaming bone in only minutes...though that's just the kind of threat the above  Slurpentine specializes in dealing with.\nWORMBRAINS like this Nemateuthis are monsters under the control of parasites...which are under the control of even smaller parasites. The collective intelligence of their microscopic \"brain flukes\" are essentially their true minds, and the multiple layers of host-organisms are sort of like meaty giant mecha to the tiny worms, which gradually perfected these larger bodies over millenia of evolutionary manipulation. Wormbrains can spread their parasites to temporarily enslave their prey even in the midst of battle, and their flawlessly organized hive minds are very, very difficult to faze.\nECTOSAURS like Eviscergeist are slimy, luminescent monsters that can shift between a solid and semicorporeal state. Like tardigrades, rotifers, ectoprocts and other tiny lifeforms, Ectosaurs can desiccate themselves into seemingly \"immortal\" forms that can be reawakened even centuries later. Often mistaken for fossils, their origins are not entirely understood.\nJOKERS like the legendary and terrifying Harlequeen are stretchy, rubbery monsters filled with psychotropic gases that, somehow, also seem to constitute their brains. Totally alien, unstable and chaotic, they are almost impossible to fully control, and it goes without saying that a whiff of their internal gas will drive almost any creature equally haywire.\n\nARTHROPOIDS like the spider-based Vertigo are complete fusions of human and arthropod into brand new species, and rival bioconstructs in their sheer individual numbers. Highly intelligent, they tend to have a number strange abilities at least loosely derived from their insect, arachnid, crustacean or even lobopod halves. Interestingly enough, insect Arthropoids cannot go through metamorphosis, but a larval insect will produce a completely different Arthropoid species than its adult form.\nFECTOIDS are intelligent viruses infecting specialized bacteria infecting mutated protozoa that can, in turn, fuse together and build larger macroscopic bodies. This Scrabies is seen in its macro phase, but once it grows too large to sustain itself, its body will break back down into a microbial disease, endlessly cycling between the two states. This one is also another monster in symbiosis with swarming pests; unlike other Fectoids, the Scrabies uses mosquitoes, fleas and ticks to further spread its infectious stage.\nBOTANICALS like Lascivenus aren't simply \"plant creatures;\" each is a hybrid of plant, animal and fungus, though one of the three is often subtle enough that some Botanicals can be much more plant-like, more animal-like, or pretty much mushroom people. One thing they are not, however, is photosynthetic; you can't really get healthy sunlight through Mortasheen's smog, so the plant cells of Botanical monsters are universally non-chlorophyllic, and these monsters rely entirely on flesh and blood sustenance. \n(She just wants a hug, though, she already ate)\nVAMPIRES like Vamprey are another, very different product of an intelligent virus, rivaling the one responsible for \"zombies.\" This virus isn't even contagious or dangerous to its hosts, but passed down genetically as it breeds normal organisms into hyper-evolved, staggeringly intelligent super-hosts that never age, require only blood to refuel, defy gravity and read minds.\nAs the virus seemingly originated from the vents of the deep ocean, virtually all vampires are derived from fish, cephalopods or other aquatic organisms. Though we don't yet have fishing mechanics planned, that's something I always wanted to implement as a major means of obtaining the Vampire class.\nWe've even got a vampire clam...and it is indeed called Clampire.\nUNKNOWN such as Vault are a diverse array of entities drawn in from outer dimensional realities. Though most of them originate from many different universes and have no natural relationship to one another, they can be considered a single, cohesive monster class because they all share a form of corruption resulting from interdimensional migration itself; even YOU could become an Unknown-class monster if you slipped into their world! These beings are only *mostly* tangible, they don't interact quite right with the known laws of physics and they're prone to \"glitching\" at any moment.\n\nBIOMECHA like Lazaroid have few extant species, as they are widely considered antiquated and even somewhat \"creepy\" compared to more fully organic monsters. They are, however, still organic enough (despite appearances) that they can self-replicate, sometimes becoming serious pests of themselves as they form what are essentially colonies of \"feral\" cyborgs. As for totally inorganic, fully electronic robots...the very notion of such a thing is downright repulsive to the typical Mortasheen denizen.\nDEVIL BIRDS like Astarath are by far the rarest, possibly oldest, most mysterious and most feared of all monster types. Though no \"magic\" or \"spirits\" exist in this setting, these warped and twisted avians have a mystical, demonic aesthetic and wield strange, terrifying telepathic powers that manipulate the emotional weaknesses and prey upon the vices of their adversaries. \nFinally, we have the GARBAGE class, the most famous of which is the self-devouring Grobbidile. Garbage monsters are entirely accidental by-products of Mortasheen's biochemical waste, and are generally considered almost entirely harmless and useless...though rare individuals can exhibit surprising, deadly powers, and unlike most monsters, some Garbage creatures CAN \"evolve\" into larger, tougher forms.\n...Including Grobbidile!\n\n STRETCH GOALS:\nFULFILLED! We can now pay for even more art and artists! If you're a long-time fan and concerned about the art direction straying too far from Mortasheen's existing style, don't sweat; I'll still be doing character and creature designs, but every artist I bring on board will be able to illustrate something I NEVER could have finished on my own, either because I didn't have the time or there are things I just can't draw! Like machinery and architecture! Every artist will, however, get to design at least something entirely of their own, and the more I can pay them, the more content you'll get of both mine and theirs! More of everything!\n\nFULFILLED!!! Check out Mortasheen Weekly real quick. This artist has made positively FANTASTIC 3-d models of Mortasheen monsters for years now, for relatively little pay, and it's time to put a STOP to that ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!!! By which I mean they should be doing it for a LOT of pay!\nI mean, hokey smokes, look at this Amoebeyes! Now I can start paying this very artist to make monster models compatible with 3-d-print-on-demand services, opening up an official Mortasheen Miniatures Shop! All 3-d models will also be made available to download or purchase for those who already own their own 3-d printer!\nFULFILLED!!! \n\"Wait a minute\" you say...\"why does a tabletop RPG need a sprite project???\"\nMaking an official pixel sprite of EVERY Mortasheen monster has long been on my to-do list, and it's something I'm fully capable of doing myself....or would be, if I didn't have this many monsters to catch up on, many of them already overdue for a design tweak anyway. With enough money to hire STILL MORE indie artists, I can try to get the entire monster archive sprited up in no time, and then we can use those sprites for any number of digital projects, merchandise, and PRINTABLE TOKENS for players to represent any conceivable monster team!\n\nI am adamant, however, that Mortasheen's sprites must bear some resemblance to the visual aesthetic of a certain 1990's gameboy game. In fact, I think this Mumblegog I sprited up myself as an example looks a little too on-model. If you're as charmed as I am by the lopsided Bulbamanders and Squirtasaurs of yesteryear, I hope you'll enjoy what the sprite project will do to these poor fools!\n\nPLUSH DESIGN CHOSEN! For an extra $4,000 we can produce a run of plushes with the help of an excellent manufacturer already lined up! The quote has been based on a medium sized 8-inch plush, the final cost of which should be around $30, plus a little extra shipping.

At the time, the goal is to finish the game and make it available for Steam and Nintendo Switch. However, the possibility of porting Lonesome Village into more consoles has always been our objective.\n You can wishlist Lonesome Village now on Steam:\nWishlist Lonesome Village on Steam now\nLanguages \nThe mechanics of Lonesome Village will be reminiscent of classic RPGs, but our approach to the day-to-day interactions with different villagers and scenarios as well as life sim elements will make the game feel like a brand-new experience altogether.\nAscend the tower and solve your way to the top!\nFind yourself in dungeons that call to mind the atmosphere and quality of the 2D Zelda games.\nSolve tricky dungeon puzzles and save villagers in the tower to advance to the next chamber.  \nYou will find unique puzzles to solve for each animal friend you have to save.   \nHELP THE VILLAGE GROW - Unlock new areas and help Lonesome Village thrive through:\nExploring\nThe Village and its surroundings make up a great area to discover and explore:\nHome Customization\nWes is getting used to his new life in Lonesome, so he needs to make himself comfortable in his new house!

The more happy or comfortable they're about you, they'll give a better price for sale and will pay you more for your items.\nInteracting with the villagers will make your relationship with them even better, which will also make your life in Lonesome easier as they will be nicer with you.\n\nWes is a curious coyote that has always felt a pull towards strange and mysterious things.\nOur little adventurer friend does not live in Lonesome, but he has become involved in the recent odd circumstances surrounding Lonesome and decides to make it his quest to rescue all the villagers that are trapped inside the Tower and save the village from catastrophe.\nThese are normal people (well, not quite like us, but you know) who want to help the village grow again.\nResponsible for Ubhora's disappearance. Will they try to awaken evil again?\nWe have been working really hard to create a unique aesthetic style. We want to show that every single detail of the game represents our commitment to creating a charming adventure like no other.\nThe soundtrack of the game will be created by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix. She is a composer and sound designer that has participated in videogame projects like \"Greak: Memories of Azur\".\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\n*Following assets are representations of what the assets will be like, the final result may vary\n\nVIP Rewards\n*Pay the shipping later!

Our goal is to create fantasy stories in the form of indie video games.\nOur previous game 'Jumper Jon' became the 1st game entirely developed in Mexico for Apple Arcade\u2019s first 100 games release.\nThe experience we have gained from developing all these years has encouraged us to produce a unique experience for PC and Consoles.\nThe development of Lonesome Village has been quite slow, up until this point. Since the beginning of the production process, the game has been developed by a small fraction of the Ogre team. These points combined with a lack of funding has made finishing Lonesome Village quite challenging without support. \nThe current development advance of Lonesome Village is 1/3 of the total development plan.\nHowever, Lonesome Village has seen a lot of positive reactions from the press and on social media, which have praised the art style and the concept of the game, which motivates us to continue developing this project.\nWith your support, we can invest more time and resources into finishing the development of our game. We\u2019re committed to bringing the world of Lonesome Village to life, but we can\u2019t do it without you!\nStay updated with our development! We\u2019ll continue to share important updates on our social media channels:\n  E-mail: ogrepixel@gmail.com\nOur goal is to create a unique experience for those who love to challenge their minds and are always looking for something new to enjoy, that\u2019s why this game needs all of the team\u2019s attention.\nThe development process is complicated, especially for all the features we want to include in the game, which is why the required budget has increased to a point where we need the help of people who want to be part of such a special experience that we know our game can be.\nFortunately, the studio was able to keep operating in spite of the ongoing challenges which came with COVID-19. This allowed us to continue our commitment to finish the development of this charming game.\nThanks for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter campaign. Even if you decide not to back us, sharing our campaign with your family, friends and social media would be a great help to us :D", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges derived from the development of video games are many.

Take control of Rose, a mysterious amnesic, and explore a world that has fallen into darkness\u2014where only a few precious flickers of light remain. From peaceful grasslands to a long-forgotten mine, Rose will navigate this interconnected 2D world as she gains new abilities and faces off against monstrous creatures, as well as other adventurers with their own hidden plans for the light they all covet.\nPlanning for a launch in the second half of 2022, Chiaroscuro will release on PC and Mac via Steam.\nA riveting and interactive story line.\nAn art style that explores the practice of Chiaroscuro.\nOver a dozen environments to traverse through non-linear exploration.\n Challenging combat and platforming.\n Tight and satisfying gameplay.\nOver two dozen engaging boss battles.\nA plethora of unique characters. \nAdjustable gameplay mechanics through the use of elemental casting.\n Uncover the mysterious history of Chiaroscuro through optional side-quests.\nLooking to get your hands on the game for an early preview?  Here's a short demo of the game to try if you're interested. (Windows and Mac!)\nInterested in following the game's development?  I post frequent updates featuring behind the scenes content on the game's community discord!\nThe region of Chiaroscuro was once overseen by the gods of balance, Yin and Yang, who's coexistence maintained peace throughout the island. However, the world was forever changed when Yang vanished, taking the Lights with him and leaving the land in darkness.  Over time the locals adapted to this new normal, difficult as it was, but when rumors spread of flickering lights in the region\u2014a determined few set off to restore balance to the world.\nThe amnesiac protagonist of Chiaroscuro, Rose. When she first awakens in the Mines little is known about her\u2014but as Rose\u2019s abilities grow and the light scattered throughout the world becomes accessible to her, that forgotten history will begin to resurface.\nEventually, Rose stumbles upon a character known as the Doctor. He introduces himself as a lone agent attempting to cure the world of its imbalance by collecting all of the Lights. Lights are an incredibly powerful element that have been rumored to restore memories, something that is incredibly valuable to Rose.\nAs the name suggests, Bandit is introduced as an outlaw who has been attempting to steal the Lights for self-benefit. However, it turns out he may have entirely different intentions...\nThe region of Chiaroscuro has a plethora of unique environments across its land, the following areas are just a taste of the locations you'll discover in-game.\n The Courtyard may appear to be a peaceful and welcoming grassland, but don't let that lull you into a false sense of security. There are more than a few creatures hiding in the undergrowth just waiting for you to drop your guard.\nThe town of Duskhaven is one of the most notable areas in Chiaroscuro.  Duskhaven was once a bustling mining town\u2014but the miners vanished without a trace the same time the Lights did. This tragic coincidence forced the town to close off the Mines and lean on their ports as their only means of survival.\nThe Ominous Grove is a woodland area filled with an ethereal aura.  Many spirits have made this their home, as the grove was once protected by the Pumpkin King. Unfortunately, the King passed away after the lights faded and this long-standing power vacuum has now attracted the attention of the King's would be heir...\nThe Mines became inaccessible after the disappearance of the town's miners; Duskhaven could not afford anyone else to go missing.  Strangely, one of these mines ran out of ore shortly before the incident, causing some to theorize that the miners did not simply lose their way out due to the lights disappearing.  The Mines are also home to a monstrous beast, which is rumored to eat those who draw too close.\nThe Arctic Cliffs are considered the highest point of elevation in Chiaroscuro. Despite the mountain's visibly icy peaks, the region is actually located on a dormant volcano.  This combination of ice and steam has resulted in the collapse of the mountain's pass, which makes ascending its cliffs much more dangerous.\nThis underground world was once home to an ancient civilization that believed in total isolation from outside influences.  However, over time this cave system, and its inhabitants, became exposed to a dangerous radiation that could not be traced. The impact of which wildly altered the environment and ultimately made the Irradiated Caverns nearly uninhabitable for an age.\nA concept of Rose plasma casting, woah!\nThroughout the game, Rose will come across different elemental fragments. When equipped, these fragments give Rose the ability to manipulate whichever element she is wielding. There are ten elements in the game, each offering the player its own special elemental move and abilities. Additionally, each element offers its own unique playstyle, whether you are one that prioritizes power over caution, speed over health, or vice versa.\nThis is the Spirit Blast, the elemental spell for the Spirit element.\nThere are also many different types of elemental creatures, which will interact with you differently depending on which element you have equipped.\nIn addition to element-specific abilities, Rose has (and will gain) a series of skills that will make up her base skillset regardless of the element being used.\nHop up walls using the jump button!  The longer you hold down the button on a jump, the higher you go.  If you let go early, it stops you mid-fall.\nSlash away at enemies with your blade in order to obtain Lumen.\nSlashing downwards on enemies mid-air causes you to pogo off of them while keeping momentum!  Funny enough, the Chiaroscuro community actually coined this term!\nGet propelled forward in whichever direction you are facing by using the Lumen Dash!  As the name suggests, this costs a small amount of Lumen to use.\nIf your Lumen bar is full you will regenerate health automatically!\nMake use of the Bow, which does not cost Lumen to use and serves as a handy ranged-weapon.\nUse your Lumen to cast a powerful elemental spell that varies in range and power.\nA physical attack that costs Lumen to use, with a utility that varies drastically depending on the element equipped.  For example, the Ruby Strike. A multi-directional dash that enables Rose to charge through, and deal damage to, anything that gets in her path.  This move can also be used for extra mobility when combined with the Lumen Dash as shown in the clip above.\nHey! My name is Joey, also known as BlackberryKin.  I am 20 year old college student studying digital media.  In the future, I aspire to become a full-time indie developer with my own studio working on projects I love.  Chiaroscuro has been the center focus of my life for the past nine months and I hope this passion project continues to point me in the right direction!\n\nI should also mention, while this game development journey started off completely solo, as the game grew more talented individuals began to take notice of its existence.  Since then, I have received tremendous help from the following individuals...\n\"Hey all, I'm Weezlack. I've been writing and recording music for years but recently have been involved in writing music for a few video game projects. I try to focus mainly in synth, ambient and modern cinematic sounds. Chiaroscuro in particular has been a fantastic blend of my love for video games and writing music.\"\n\"Hey, Louvee here, I'm a concept artist that started a year ago to learn and make art. I'm not very experienced but I have a lot of drive and passion to become one of the best and an old master one day. I got interested in Chiaroscuro a couple of months before I contacted Joey to see if I could be a part of it. To be honest I thought I wasn't gonna get in but, surprise surprise I'm here. I'm ready to do my best and deliver a quality and fun game. I'm very excited to bring this project to life and make it into something very special.\"\n\"Hey guys, I'm Alex, 27 years old! I'm a music producer and sound designer. I'm also a session musician!  I'm very excited to be working on some sound design for this project!\"\nThe game's main promotional art is done by Jaya Ply.  He is a fantastic artist and I highly recommend checking out his Twitter page!\nMost of the levels, characters, enemies, and boss concepts originally started on paper.\nHere's an early concept art of Bandit!\nHowever, since the launch of the game's demo I have brought Louvee along to assist with the concept art for the game.\nSome illustrations of Chiaroscuro's main characters by Louvee.\nIf you are interested in checking out some of the game's soundtrack by Weezlack, here are a few 30-second clips for you all!\n Additionally, I am getting the help of Alex Kirrage to design the game's sound effects!  Here is a short demo showcasing an example of some of the updated sound effects for the game.\nPLAY\n\nOkay, it's time to go over the goodies!  If you guys liked the look of the game and think it has potential, why not give it a back?  Here is a list of some exciting backer goodies!\nIf you pledge $15 or more you will receive a digital copy of the game on Steam for Windows or Mac!\nThis will be a digital download sent out a month or two before the release of the game, and will likely have 20 to 30 of our favorite tracks in the game.  This is available for any backer who pledges $30+.\nThe game's beta will be available for anyone who backs $40 or more, which is a sneak peak at part of the real game!  Don't worry, nothing to spoiler-y.  This version will come out a few months before the launch of the game and will have brand new features not showcased in the demo!  Additionally, you will obtain the Beta Tester role on the game's community discord, plus an in-game code for Rose's Flower Girl Skin.\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that I accidentally added the PDF Lore and Concept Art Book to the Beta Tester Early Bird Tier.  That being said, if you are one of the lucky 150 beta tester early birds then you will also get a PDF Lore and Concept Art Book along with it.\nWho doesn't like lore?  If you back $60 or more you will be sent a digital copy of the game's lore book!  This will showcase a visual representation of the game's extensive plot, intriguing characters, interconnected environments, most (if not all) of the game's official concept art, and lastly, old concepts that were scrapped along the way!\n\nI should note that while the previous rewards are stacked depending on how much you pledge, the following are exclusive rewards, which means purchasing the $1,000 tier does not mean you get the $250 or $100 tiers.  That being said, however, the following tiers will include all of the rewards above.\nSince community is important to the game's growth, I want you guys to be a part of the game!  Get your name and a message (keep it appropriate!) in the game by having it engraved in one of the obelisks scattered across the Dreamyard!  This is only available for backers who pledge this specific tier ($100).  You will also receive an extra copy of the game!\nIf you pledge the $150 tier, you will get to design a character!  I will personally help you design said character to represent you in the game.  Have the character say something to the player! You will also receive an extra copy of the game!\nFor those that pledge the $250 tier, you will get to design a character and build that character its own room!  The room's style will vary depending on the location of your character, which I will discuss with you when the time comes.  You will also receive two extra copies of the game!\nFor those that pledge the $500 tier, you will get to design a character and build that character its own room and quest!  The quest can be whatever you wish as long as I give the idea the okay!  You will also obtain the Light role on the game's community discord, along with two extra copies of the game!\nFor those that pledge the $1,000 tier, you will get to design a boss fight for the game!  I will discuss the details regarding designing the boss fight, such as where it will take place, the bosses attack patterns, and the theme of the fight.  The boss should also stick to the scope of the project and should be an appropriate difficulty for whichever point in the game we decide to place it!  You will also obtain the Light role on the game's community discord, along with three extra copies of the game!\nThe game, obviously! I recognize that my ambitions for Chiaroscuro are bigger than just a solo hobby project; I want to dedicate the time that vision demands and hire others to help make it a reality. This Kickstarter campaign will provide the funds to make both of those possible. If the campaign is successful I will be investing the majority of funds into the art, sound design, and animation of Chiaroscuro. The remaining resources will enable me to support myself while I hunker down and focus on developing the game.\nAs a first time developer I want to keep the scope of this project manageable, so that means this Kickstarter campaign is solely focused on the PC/Mac release of Chiaroscuro. Consoles are something I am very interested in bringing Chiaroscuro to in the future though, either following the PC release or through a potential partner. For the moment however, working through the additional requirements (both technical and logistical) that come with releasing on console is something I cannot currently commit to.\nI spent about a week learning the ropes of Game Maker Studio 2 before diving head first into my game development journey.  Chiaroscuro was initially supposed to be a practice project to hone my programming skills.  However, over time I became more invested in the game's development until eventually I decided I wanted to polish it and showcase it on Kickstarter.\nAs of October 23, 2020 I am nine months into the game's development, and I am very satisfied with the progress I have made.   With over 2,000 hours already invested into this project, I am highly confident in my ability to finish it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile Chiaroscuro is my first commercial release, its development is driven by my motivation to grow as a game developer and something I care deeply about. But, as a novice in this space, I fully understand there will be bumps along this road. I know though\u2014that just like the challenges of being a solo developer while creating a demo, building a community, and running a Kickstarter\u2014that I have the drive and passion to overcome those hurdles and see this project to its conclusion.\n\nAlso, as I am a college student there will be times when I need to focus on my studies. I hope that the demo included in this campaign, created over the past 8 months, shows you how I can effectively leverage my time management skills to balance Chiaroscuro's development with my own education.\n\nRegardless if you have the means to support this campaign or not, I want to say thank you for reading this page and for everyone's support throughout these early months of development. You all have been such a supportive group of individuals, and with that support I will continue to tackle this game development journey head on!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Stay in the Loop!", "descp": "Get access to backer-exclusive updates about the game!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Get the Game!", "descp": "Digital download of the game.

We now know it as the ground zero of the parseling phenomenon, the very soil fertile with meaning and words. In the germination stage of the infection, the stench of paranoia and hushed whispers filled the air. I suppose it was only fitting that in such a place every thought and the stray word became enriched with such intensity of significance. Perhaps the most distinctive thing about Nominal City is that large areas of the city were torn from their roots and rose into the air where they have been ever since. The catastrophe of this created many victims and refugees still clustered within the city, to which the rest reacted poorly to. The memory of this event remains a stain in the collective psyche of the people.\n The old city encircled by a new wall, sits quarantined on a peninsula away from the rest of the mainland. Underneath in the craters and shadows, it smells like a dense forest of tall gray buildings with faded and peeling pastel paints. Posters are layered over each other like rings of wood in a tree. Replace the forest animals with people rugged up in their thick coats and scarves becoming anonymous figures. There\u2019s a feeling of oppression in the concrete, the enclosing wall bordering the entirety of Nominal City and the nearby mountain range, the fall of the government, and the rise of large private corporations to take over public interests. It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a new movement, spoken of only in quiet corners. Something that might be a threat. \nParselings, have you heard of them?\nParselings is supported by two distinct systems that have been entwined together to make a complete game. The Choice system covers the rules that represent the thoughts and actions of the characters. While the Parse System dictates how your powers work and how to shape the world. By mastering both parts of this game, your journey will be shaped by your creativity.  However before all of that, in order to enjoy the game of Parselings, you will need to gather a couple of things.\nA Deck of Cards For Each Player\nIn the Choice System, each player controls a single character and a deck constructed out of a set of regular playing cards. The cards you choose will represent your character\u2019s health and mentality. The larger the deck, the more options, and health they have, while in comparison with fewer cards, the more limited their actions are.\nYou will need to make some hard decisions when constructing your deck because of one simple reason: Parselings are not gods, nor are they omnipotent. They will need others to help do what they themselves cannot. As the game progresses your deck can change and twist as your character progresses through different scenarios.\nA Set of Dice For Your Game Master\nThough predominantly a deck-building game, you will still need a set of dice to be shared by your group. When sitting down to play the game, only the GM will actually need these dice. While many NPC actions could be replicated with cards, it is faster for the GM to use dice on lesser challenges.\nA small pool of d6s (six-sided dice) to represent the small enemies and obstacles in the campaign.\nA single d10 (ten-sided dice), d12 (twelve-sided dice), and d20 (twenty-sided dice) to help decide the words a Parseling can use.\nYour Imagination\nAs a roleplaying game, stories are at the heart of these systems and the rules offer a systematic way of translating actions into a format that everyone else agrees upon. We are utilizing our imagination to fuel the game, putting our time and our effort to create our own fun and a story we would want to listen to. For players, this means you\u2019ll need to be able to describe your character and what they want to do. For the GM, you\u2019ll need to create an adventure with your players in a way that everyone enjoys.\nParselings is a game where you get to tell any story that you can imagine.   \nWhether you are undertaking a devious deal or enacting a daring distraction, the circumstances are never the same for any two people. Governing the mechanical side of the game, the Choice System is built to embody the individuality of your own character, to represent how you want to play. By choosing your cards it\u2019s more than just a gamble, your choices are will change fate. \nEach card in your deck tells a story about your character. You\u2019ll know what it feels like to step into their shoes, watching the odds change with every card you spend and every move you make. Whatever happens in your story, the choice is yours.\nPLAY\n\nBy uniting we stand, by dividing you will fall.\nIf the Choice System is the gears directing the fate of your characters, Parses are the heart and soul of the game. The Parse System is where your imagination and will to co-operate with others truly matters. Parsing is the supernatural phenomena or magic that is carried out by two or more Parselings with a simple touch and uttering a small string of words. Through using this power to redefine the world, you\u2019ll be able to achieve amazing feats that would be otherwise impossible.\nA Parseling\u2019s words are determined by their perceived role in the world. These come from anywhere \u2013 from strangers, friends, and even from the Parseling themselves. All players are involved in the process of determining the potential words each character may possess. Dice are used to mix things up and represent the haphazard nature of the Parsecyte they've bonded.\nDo what you will with your gifts, but ask yourselves, how will your words define you?\nAs it stands, the Core Rulebook is already completed, boasting around 220 pages and 100 or so art pieces (some of which you may have already seen). It will be available as both a PDF and a Hard copy. However, you'll also have the chance to pick up a story module and various sets of playing cards themed around the Parselings game. Choose your reward level and back this game to get in on the action!\n\nInfer Memorial station is the perfect introductory module to introduce a table to Parselings, as well as making a tentative foray into a city that is on the cusp of a great change.  Its suitable for up to 6 players, and has a run time of about 1 to 2 hours.  As a bonus, we will be bundling the PDF with some pre-made character sheets so you can jump right in.\nPlaying Cards are also available. Our range of beautiful decks (click here for a better look) which are color coded to make your experience with the game a little easier.\nThe NPC Blank decks are designed for GMs to jot down Quick NPCs on the fly. These usually represent people or creatures that populate the world as the nameless thousands.  Depending on how far we go, we may even include a few examples...\n\nFill up our ink vials by backing Parselings and helping us make the game even better! \nParselings was developed primarily in Australia over 2019-2020 and published by Smunchy Games. \nYou can get in touch with us by joining the Parselings Discord Server, Twitter, and Facebook, or Smunchy Games Discord Server, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always, there are risks with shipping and production timelines.

Here's what some of the players have been saying about Nocturne: Prelude.\n\"It has an amazing art style and Undertale-like story.\" - SkyKevin \n\"So far I've fell in love with this game. I hope to see it become one of the best rpg games of the year.\" - Billmastoras \n\"The graphics, the combat system, the hidden items, the music, it's all amazing.\" - KawaiiCthulhu \n\"Characters are vivid and I have already found myself smiling and falling in love with them.\" - RazrPredator \n\"I was so engrossed with the music, and the gameplay is really unique! The story had me captivated! Never have I played such a good game in a very long time!\" - Jazmaen \nPlay Nocturne: Prelude right now. The first chapter of Nocturne, available for free on Steam.\n\nNocturne is a story-driven RPG set within a digital afterlife. As you explore a vast and beautiful pixel art world, you'll meet a cast of unique characters who'll challenge what it means to be alive. \nIt features a genre-defying, skill based Rhythm combat system that is suitable for beginners and veterans of the rhythm genre.\n\n\nThe digital afterlife survived humanity's extinction.\nMillennia have passed since humanity's extinction; but somehow you've only just arrived in a digital afterlife. Your conscience was uploaded to a world where a sentient AI has taken control, twisted creatures roam the land, and a vast corruption spreads.\nAs you search for your lost brother, you become entangled in a power struggle between the admins. Doubt is spread about your sudden arrival in this world and the very nature of your existence is questioned.\nNocturne is a story of human identity. What does it mean to be alive in a digital world, where minds are just code running on a machine? Does the life of an individual still have meaning? Should it be protected at all costs? These are the challenges you'll face as a once beautiful world falls apart around you, a world where computational power has become a scarce resource. \nNocturne is inspired by decades of traditional RPGs. \nYou'll find equipment that unlocks powerful combat buffs or special abilities, preparing you for the heart-pumping musical combat that makes Nocturne so unique.\nNocturne's combat is inspired by traditional DDR-style four column rhythm games. It was important that the combat remain fairly true to its roots, while taking advantage of the RPG genre mix where appropriate. You won't need to micro-manage cooldowns & mana in Nocturne, but you'll benefit from various buffs & abilities you acquire through equipment. During the actual battle, you'll focus on hitting notes and being immersed in the music.\n\nNever played a Rhythm game before? No worries, Nocturne has 5 difficulty settings and additional customization that ensures a comfortable experience for everyone. You can even change the difficulty at any save point, so you can always switch things around to keep on track. If you'd like to enjoy the story without any concerns for rhythm, you can always enable Story Mode, which gives you the exact same experience without any fear of failure.\n\"You wish to preserve life, but you fail to understand it. Life is an array of memories, a log of past events. You define yourselves by these memories, but they are nothing more than redundant data.\" - Nocturne\n Unlock Goals\nTrihex will be featured as an NPC in the game if we reach the goal of 200 Retweets for this tweet during the Kickstarter campaign.\nA mystery character will be revealed if we reach 100 Retweets on the announcement Tweet during the Kickstarter campaign.\nAnother mystery character will be revealed if Nocturne: Prelude reaches 500 Reviews on Steam on during the Kickstarter campaign.\nCombat\nYou can equip items which provide combat abilities based on your performance. For example, an item with the Barrier ability will activate after reaching a high enough combo, creating a protective shield that reduces incoming damage. An item with the Restore ability will heal you, but only if you land enough perfect notes. If you're struggling with a fight, then changing your equipment can give you the edge you'll need to overcome a specific encounter.\nYou'll also have to be aware of different note types. Mines will temporarily disable an entire column if you accidentally hit them. Critical notes will cause twice as much damage.\nSilence\nNocturne's puzzles are also rhythmic! Throughout the world you encounter corrupted objects that must be restored through a mechanic called Silence. You'll have to play a sequence of notes while dealing with unusual mechanics, such as the columns moving around, or even going invisible.\nCustomization\nTraditional rhythm games have always provided lots of customization. Every player has preferences, so it's important that Nocturne provides plenty of options. Here's a summary of the customization already available in Nocturne: Prelude.\nSpeed Modifiers (X-Mod/C-Mod)\nNote Speed\nJudgement Text Mode\nJudgement Text Layout\nNote Miss Sounds\nMirror Charts\nNote Colors\nColumn Direction\nLatency Calibration\nKeybindings\nArcade\nThe Arcade is a gamemode that allows you to play any previously beaten enemy or boss.

I'll talk about the many challenges along the way, while providing insight into my working process, my philosophies of design, and the core of what Nocturne is all about. You'll get an in-depth perspective into how Nocturne was made.\nGame Script: The entire script. That's right, the whole thing. Read every single line of dialogue from every cutscene, so you can be sure you've not missed anything.\nDesign Document: Before creating Nocturne: Prelude I wrote a 57 page design document. I'll be expanding this document significantly for the full release. You'll get to read the entire thing. This is the master document that covers everything from the gameplay mechanics, item and ability design, story, characters, combat, music, etc. It's all here.\nCut Content: An important part of design is knowing when to let things go. Sometimes ideas are tested, but never make to release because of technical issues, design conflicts, or perhaps they're just not fun. Learn about some of the content that never made it to release.\nConcept Art: Before any final art assets are made for Nocturne, they'll go through a concept stage where mockups and sketches are created. Often these designs are iterated on many times and can change drastically. You'll get to see early sketches of characters, enemies and locations with notes from myself and the artists about the designs.\n\ud83d\udcd5 Physical Production Book\nA printed & signed physical version of the Production Book.

You can listen to Nocturne: Prelude's soundtrack on YouTube.\nIt was important Nocturne's music was more than just a background track to the gameplay, so the soundtrack was composed to be deeply connected to the characters, creatures and world of Nocturne. You'll not just visually experience the triumphs and tragedies, you'll hear them too. The music provides an emotional core which drives both the story and gameplay.\nAll the combat music in Nocturne was composed with rhythm gameplay in mind. This allows us to create exciting and unexpected twists during boss battles that reflect the intensity of the moment in both the gameplay and music.\nI'm Benjamin Pracy, creator of Nocturne. I've been a professional writer & video editor for almost a decade. Nocturne is my passion project. I hope Prelude speaks for itself to the dedication I've poured into the game over the last few years. I've been blown away by the amazing response (97% positive!) Nocturne has received so far. I'll do my best to beat those high expectations for the full release. I've only just got warmed up.\nNocturne has been self funded for the last few years. I've worked with many talented freelancers, paying for their services out of pocket. Here's a breakdown of the current costs from creating Nocturne: Prelude.\nI've calculated a budget of 140,000 CAD (~$105,000 USD) to complete the rest of the game, with at least half of those funds coming from Kickstarter. Most of the core mechanics are done, so a large part of the work remaining involves producing additional content. That's why I'm expecting the final budget to weigh a little more towards Art & Music over Programming.\nAs the kickstarter budget only represents 50% of the funds needed to finish the game. The remaining $70,000 will be contributed from my own savings over the next few years. I continue to believe in this project enough to put forward my own money, so that together we can make Nocturne the best game it can be.\nWow, you made it all the way to the end.

You're putting up your own money toward the project and the most important concern will be if you'll receive the finished game. I've got two important points to address those concerns.\n\n1) The release of Nocturne: Prelude on Steam is proof of what I'm capable of creating and delivering. It was important to me that I released the first chapter so you have confidence in what you're purchasing and my abilities as a creator.\n\n2) A generous policy on refunds. I'm going above and beyond the typical expectations of a Kickstarter campaign by offering a full refund on any purchase tier, at any time prior to receiving the reward. No questions asked. I'll refund you in full.\n\nThe most likely challenge involved with creating Nocturne will be the timeline. I've given myself a generous time period for release, but like all creative projects, delays can be common. I've learned a lot about managing those timelines during the creation of Prelude, and will apply that knowledge moving forward. I will also keep the community updated about the progress of Nocturne at regular intervals.\n\nIf you ever have questions or concerns, my email is open: hello@pracystudios.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Pracy Studios\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nPracy Studios Ltd.

If you missed the Kickstarter don't worry, you can choose from these three tiers:\nSupport Camomille on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/XavierMoiny \nThe Kind Camomille is a wholesome adventure game about random acts of kindness and the joy of discovery. As Camomille the kind mouse, collect goodies by helping those in need and fill your gift basket for Grandma Rosie's 100th birthday. Relax into this beautiful open-world exploration.\nCurrently being developed for PC Windows and with your help The Kind Camomille can also be released on Nintendo Switch. Scope for the full game is roughly 5 hours of gameplay but I hope to expand this. Play the free Camomille's Playground demo on Steam and Itch.\nCamomille's Playground Demo\nPlay the free demo on Steam\nTwitter / Discord / Press Kit\nReady to take a stroll?\nThis is Camomille! She's a kind, gentle mouse (though a little on the quiet side). She's on her way from the city to The Island for her grandmother's 100th birthday, bringing along a gift basket full of goodies for the special day! \nHowever, misfortune struck! Shortly before arriving on the island, her basket overturned and everything washed out to sea. Now Camomille must do her best to fill it back up again with what goodies she can find.\nThe Island is a beautiful place, full of hidden vistas and little secrets for Camomille to discover.\nFrom the colors, to the design or even the music, everything is crafted with care to lift up the spirit and for you to have a pleasant time on The Island. Every resident on The Island looks out for each other and every creature lives in peace.\nThe Island is an inviting open world for you to discover at your own rhythm. Set forth to discover all the vistas, walk on the beach, run like the breeze through the fields, surprise animals down a path in a forest and search every nook and cranny The Island has to offer.\nHere are a few of areas you'll explore with Camomille:\nCamomille's not the only one on the Island! On her basket-filling quest, she'll encounter all sorts of wild animals, as well as the Island's residents. They could use a bit of help themselves. Here's a few that Camomille can meet...\nMr. Racoon loves painting landscapes, sadly he is all out of a very special type of red that comes from a rare flower.\nMr. Raccoon needs some help with his painting\nMiss. Beaver spends most of her days watching the whales by the cliffs, most of the time she's late for dinner.\nMiss. Beaver has gone exploring and is late for dinner\nMr. Badger enjoys his fly fishing more than anything, but lately the fishes won t bite...\nMr. Badger getting ready to fish\nThe Old Monk tends to his little garden like a mother tends to her kids, his bucket is lost and he is very worried.\nOld Rabbit Monk needs help watering his tomatoes\nThe little kitten just wants a friend...\nTiny fearless kitten will follow Camomille everywhere\nWatch for Camomille's Kickstarter Updates to meet more of the Residents!\nThe more you explore, the more residents you can find to help, and the more items you will discover to fill up the basket. Be rewarded for exploring every nook and cranny of The Island. Some light puzzle solving lies in the way between Camomille and filling her gift basket. Listen carefully to what residents need. \nMr. Pelican needs help getting his boat back\nI want the game to be enjoyable for everyone, including young people, so the puzzles will be more relaxing than challenging. You can finish the game with very little done, or everything done! Being kind is a choice and this wholesome exploration is an invitation to relax and enjoy random acts of kindness.\nCaptain Walrus is very grateful for Camomille's help\nIt all comes down to personal history, it took me years to accept how much I actually cared about people, then I started to witness random acts of kindness when they happened, a concept new to me at that time, believe it or not, and it touched me. Deep. \nThat\u2019s when it changed my life, kindness... and silence, because I finally understood that only silence gives you the opportunity to listen. If you listen, you open yourself to care even about strangers, from that place can be birthed a random act of kindness. \nOriginal concept art\nThat\u2019s why Camomille is quiet, I didn't do it on purpose at first, then it was clear as day. I guess we can say making The Kind Camomille might actually act as a personal therapy of sorts? That would be subconsciously of course!\nConsciously, what I hope for is for my little game to make some people\u2019s day better, and maybe pass along that idea I have about random acts of kindness.\nProduction timeline for The Kind Camomille\nI am mostly finished with the gameplay aspect of The Kind Camomille and it shouldn't change much, unless the demo proves otherwise. The dialogue system and the whole logic behind the residents Camomille meets is built and now needs to be expanded a bit more. \nScale of Islands\nThe wild animals programming is done, now I need to create all the model. The game now needs content: fill up the world, music and sounds, menus, texts and translations. Not to forget all the Steam achievements and lot of polish. \nCustomise your Reward Tier with these extra goodies! Simply add the extra amount onto your pledge and message me the Add-On items you want. \nIs there an Add-On you want but it isn't listed? Tell me in the comments!\nHello there! I'm Xavier, 35 years old game developer from Canada. My love for video games started early with the NES and never stopped since then. After studying in fine arts in Belgium i came to Canada, where i took a program in video games, that was in 2007.\nLife took a different turn and i worked in architectural visualisation, first as a 3D artist, then as an art director and a teacher, it was ok for some time... But that deep need to create something of my own, something to share with you and ultimately, if possible, make your day a bit better, that need never went away. So i decided to jump, and here we are. \nThe Kind Camomille will be my first ever released game, it's a project that will come out, and i will try to make this short game as good as possible. I just need some help to make it even better on release day. \n My big goal is to release The Kind Camomille on Nintendo Switch and complete the loop that started with me discovering the NES 30 years ago! \nMatt is a composer, sound designer, and audio engineer based in sunny Tampa, Florida.  He is the founder of Royal Ruto Studios and creates music and noise for games, films, and podcasts.\n I have been developing Camomille solo, learning a lot through the process. When I found myself too stuck to progress I would reach out to my cousin, a games developer in a big company, for some guidance. I also spend a good amount of time looking through the generous work of many people on Github to help me get there faster. \nWhy I'm choosing Kickstarter:\n Community - The Kind Camomille is a wholesome game for everyone. I want to work closely with you to ensure The Kind Camomille is everything you hope it could be.\n Giving back - Kickstarter rewards means I can give the most back to you. I'm able to provide unique opportunities like having a picture of your pet in The Kind Camomille or a personalised wholesome message written by you, getting you in the game.\n Reputation - The Kickstarter community has helped so many wholesome games like Calico and Snacko. I truly believe Kickstarter will love Camomille.\nNintendo Switch - I will be able to purchase the developer kit needed for Nintendo Switch and can begin porting The Kind Camomille.\nLocalization - I will be able to translate The Kind Camomille into German, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.\nMusic and sound effects - The Kind Camomille's official composer is Matthew Vaughn from Royal Ruto Studios, and it would benefit greatly from more music and many sound effects.\nSpecialists - As a solo developer it's important to understand the scope of my skills and time available. Hiring other people to help out when needed most will evolve The Kind Camomille into the best version of itself.\nThank you for reading about The Kind Camomille!

If the voice line is realistic it needs to fit the text perfectly, any changes in the text requires a re-recording of the voice acting.\n  2. You would need one voice line per language.\n  3. Recording quality needs to be the same across the audio files.\n\n  As you might know some of the backers have access to recording some audio for a character, how do you go about that when probably most people don\u2019t have the proper recording equipment (or know how) to do it? How do you maintain quality and how do you manage translations? It wouldn\u2019t be fun for my backers and it would be quite the hurdle to make happen.\n\n  The solution? Well, Nintendo!\n  After searching for a while i discovered that Animal Crossing is using a very smart and efficient system to manage custom text to be actually read. The system is simple enough for me to replicate something that works like it.\n\n  While i am not super glad that the sound will end up really close to what they did in Animal Crossing, as i d prefer having something more unique to the game, i have to admit that it\u2019s the ultimate solution for our game, context and budget.\n\n  Here\u2019s how it works :\n\n  You record every phonetic sound of the alphabet, letter by letter and you make a system that can read it (which is surprisingly easy), with some slight randomness to the space between them.\n  Here's a voice reading from A to T in phonetics.\n "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Update #8 - Achievements, Optimizations, Fonts and other things.", "update_content": "Hello everyone! \nI can't believe it's already been over 6 months since TKC has been funded thanks to you all, time goes by so, so, fast. \nAnd as time fly by we are getting closer to release, which is sweet, and stressful at the same time.

We were left with only our sun, our small cluster of planets, and a new, twisted moon. Something, birthed from the sky-eater, fell to our planet and began to twist and warp it.\nIt was the end of our world before anyone living now can remember.\nMany generations later, the remnants of our people wander the twisted land and fight the bioluminescent night-crawling creatures as they search the ruins of our castles and cities for ancient magic and technology to help us survive. The brave and hopeful of us work to keep our pocket-sized towns together and alive.\nNow, so many years after our stars were devoured, you head into the world with a gun at your side.\nI hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.\nWith your friend, a gun, at your side...\nGUN&SLINGER is an RPG about a weapon and a wanderer. A Maestro and two players (Gun and Slinger) set out into a dead planet mutated by a god's forgotten child and hunt strange bounties, investigate the world, and unlock hidden powers. During play, they seek to learn the nature of what\u2019s hunting the Slinger, figure out why the Gun is sentient, and discover how the world died.\nKey Features:\nTell the story of a post-magic world and the people working together to survive.\nExplore the nature of a twisted reality and a force that hunts the players.\nUse Two different playstyles for the Gun and the Slinger with unique capabilities and mechanics.\nAnswer Questions & Prompts at the table to establish a bespoke setting to adventure in.\nYou can be a magical, sentient gun.\n Rewards: \n $12 gets you the final full-color PDF.\n $20 gets you the completed full-color paperback & a digital copy of the PDF.\n $100 gets you all of the above AND an exciting, secret note in your book.\n All backers get their names put in a Special Thanks section in the book.\n All physical tiers get a sticker included in their order!\nbook mockup, final cover may vary. cover art by Sadia Bies\n GUN&SLINGER in podcasts! \nI\u2019ve had the absolute pleasure of guesting on a few awesome podcasts to talk about and play GUN&SLINGER! If you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a fix of G&S, or some extra info on the design, then check these out!\n Party of One with Jeff Stormer\n Game Closet with Taylor LaBresh\n Rollin\u2019 Bones with Ryan Howard\nGive \u2018em a listen and share with your friends!\nIn GUN&SLINGER, the player-characters are bound together by fate, promises, and magic. One of them fills the role of the Slinger, the other embodies the Gun.\nA Slinger that\u2019s hunted by evil\nThe Slinger is a wanderer, looking for something in this twisted world. They\u2019ve been touched by the Twist and can pull on it for power. They must be careful, though- if they pull on the Twist too much, they\u2019ll lose themselves in it.\nBeing marked, they are hunted by something- a strange, horrifying creature of the Twist\u2019s design. During setup and through play, you decide as a table what this creature is and bring it into scenes using the Maestro\u2019s moves.\nA Gun that\u2019s more than a Gun\nThe Gun may live in a shell of cold steel, but they were not always this way. During setup and through play, you learn about the Gun\u2019s past and how they became trapped in this new body of violence.\nThe Gun may not have arms or legs, but that doesn\u2019t make them unable to affect the world around them. The Gun can use their connection with the remaining elements of Magic in the world to, well, do magic! The runes engraved on their body shape the form of their connection and, in turn, their spells. They can also reach into an ethereal plane of magic that resides alongside the physical realm to move and manipulate things.\nA sample of the Gun\u2019s character sheet\nEach player in GUN&SLINGER interacts with the mechanics differently, all the way down to their stats. Take a look at the section of the Gun\u2019s sheet above. The three starting stats are intentionally a little bit vague for a couple of reasons.\n G&S encourages players to be flexible with stat definitions. The way you approach a situation should dictate what stat it uses, and vise-versa. The Gun could attempt to intimidate people with any of these stats, it\u2019s just up to you to decide how that looks!\n G&S also allows players to, as they progress, create their own stats. In one playtest, a player gave their Slinger the Stat \u201cThe Bigger I Am\u201d and used it as an opposite to \u201cLight On My Toes\u201d. Any time they did something bull-headed or with a physical presence, they\u2019d use this new Stat and force their way through.\nThe way the stats are named in G&S gives you quite a bit of insight into the character they portray all while setting a tone and giving flexibility. You\u2019ve got a 2 in \u201cI've Been Around\u201d. What\u2019s that mean to you? Do you know about the local flora? Can you navigate easily to places you've never been to? That\u2019s up to you, Slinger.\nIn GUN&SLINGER, all conflict is resolved using a deck of playing cards. When a player wants to do something under pressure or with an uncertain outcome, The Maestro presents them with how difficult it'll be to do, and the players need to figure out how best to overcome the challenge.\nIn order to solve the problems they face on their quest to help fix their broken world, they\u2019ll need to tap into the cards they have (through imaginative game-mechanical twists on Go Fish and Blackjack), their stats, and any other tools they happen to have at their disposal.\nAs you venture through the world, tackle problems, and fight monsters, you\u2019ll get to change your stats and rework the game into something that\u2019s truly your own. \nGUN&SLINGER comes with a unique post-post apocalypse setting replete with room to be shaped into something special as your group plays through it. Elements are defined to a certain extent, then ways for you to create specifics or changes are outlined and some examples are given.\nIt\u2019s a world of hope and struggle, mutated by the forgotten child of an unknowable god that ate the stars, leaving behind only your sun, some neighboring planets, and a new moon of strange energy that never leaves the sky. There are aesthetic elements and keystones provided in the book, and some facts about the nature of things like The Twist and Magic are established, then everyone playing is given some prompts and free reign over making this setting something all their own.\nOne playtest took place in a desert land with demons, industry, and gold being key aesthetics. Another was in rolling planes with a never-ending storm, strange new flora, and magic soaking into the planet through the rain.\nA sample of these setting elements: The Twist is a force that mutates the planet for unknown reasons.\nThe Maestro controls the world and works with the players to bring it life. They create challenges, intrigue, and consequences for the players based on their actions. They have the use of a very unique and powerful threat in the form of two Joker cards that can bring an intense sense of pressure and immediacy to any situation. Finally, they also interact with the Go Fish and Pairs mechanics differently and have a unique list of Moves they can make whenever they\u2019re able to afford the cost.\nThere are systems currently in the works to allow GUN&SLINGER to be played without a Maestro.\nCalling The Thing That Hunts using Joker cards\nThe Maestro\u2019s Face Moves\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI want GUN&SLINGER to be the best thing it can be. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on the game, and I want to turn it into a physical thing with a level of quality and production that I feel it deserves. I\u2019m here on Kickstarter with this project to raise the money to pay a fantastic team the money they deserve so we can make something kick-ass.\nOur goals & challenges\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise $4,350 to give the product a final physical form, complete with graphic design and art. The final product will be a 40+-page full-color paperback, with professionally-done layout and visceral artwork.\nHere is our estimated budget for creating GUN&SLINGER.\n $1,450 for writing, game design, sensitivity consulting, and editing.\n $1,800 for layout and art (lots of art!)\n $300 for printing from Mixam Press.\n $350 as a just-in-case cash reserve.\n $450 for Kickstarter\u2019s fees and credit card processing.\nThis brings us to $4,350 needed to make this book a reality.\nThe Team\nNevyn Holmes is a game designer based out of central Texas.

[Instagram]\nStretch Goals\nAt $6,350, Viditya Voleti will be writing a new playset, SWORD&BEARER, that will include a new setting, setup section, two new characters, and art by Nadhir Nor!\nHere's the pitch:\nSWORD&BEARER is set within a massive city that shares aesthetics with idealistic European and South-Asian architecture. In this world, magic is relatively commonplace and used in daily life. There\u2019s been an industrial revolution, and many things are powered by a mix of coal and magical energy harnessed from the world. Patrols and the army make use of firearms, and artful melee weapons have become a thing of decoration.\nThe Twist in this setting has taken its place among the ruling classes of the city, driving them to control and capitalize on its people by making them just comfortable enough to be complacent. It is a caste-based capitalistic society where the upper echelons have been infiltrated and manipulated by Magic\u2019s hungry and self-driven sibling, the Twist.\nViditya Voleti (Twitter, Itch). Viditya is a QPoC game designer and writer who loves exploring the medium in several avenues! A true goblin of the community, he wears different hats from making games, consulting, Twitter worldbuilding, streaming live design nights, reading and reviewing games, and really anything he decides will be fun! All of this gets collected on his Patreon.\nNadhir Nor is an illustrator from Malaysia. From folkloric visuals for musicians to cheesy queer romance tucked between his art books, he's very interested in seeing how the modern society can navigate between what's mundane and magical.\nAt $7,250, Adira Slattery will be writing an alternate character for the GUN, the DEMON, to be included in the final book, with fresh art by Josef Rahaman and a sigil by Ezra Rose!\nHere's the pitch:\nTHE DEMON is an optional playbook replacing either the GUN or the SWORD as a companion. Instead of existing as an object, the Demon lives within the arm of the SLINGER or the BEARER. It only remembers how to cause pain, and it doesn't want to let go. \nAdira Slattery is a trans Jewish game designer, poet, and podcast human. Her work spans comedy, horror, and intimacy. Adira has designed a number of amazing projects, and her work in very thoughtful spaces of game design will be sure to make THE DEMON a powerhouse of a character option.\nJosef Rahaman is a concept artist from Arizona with a major passion for games & the creativity that births them. Throughout attaining a degree in Digital Culture, he jumped at every opportunity to expand his expertise knowledge of creative processes.  He aims to imbue that spirit of ingenuity into everything he does with the hope that it will inspire joy and creativity in others. His work and flexibility of styles is a perfect fit to bring THE DEMON to life!\nEzra Rose is an illustrator, zinester & multi-disciplinary creator living on a small farm in Western Massachusetts with queer chosen family.

Play as a MECH excavated from the remnants of a strange past civilization, who reached for the PILOT in its desperation and now finds itself uncovering its memories through experiencing the world with the Pilot. \nExplore a fantasy-like world with fragments of highly advanced magitech societies born from space ships scattering its surface. Some large factions powered by these fragments exist and struggle to keep the rest of the world ignorant of the legacies they are meant to inherit. Mobile Aberrant Geoanimus, corrupted mecha obsessed with non-corrupted mecha and their pilots, wander the lands, corrupting everything they touch.\nPam Punzalan is a queer woman from the Philippines. Her works explore queerness, emotion, memories, violence, reclamation, rebellion, and identity. She's published her own work (Sundo, Asian Acceptance, a lot of micro RPGs), collaborated with others (Maharlika, several Zinequest 2020 entries) and is on a number of major projects (Sina Una, Ancestry & Culture, Five Torches Deep, Spire, Rookwood).\nMisael \"Gio\" Manning is a Filipino Canadian concept artist and illustrator.

Explore the jungles of Amazonia as Marisa, alongside her capybara companion!\nThe Arkanya Team is working alongside Top Hat Studios to bring The Girl from Arkanya to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One, as well as Steam and Itch.io. Backers will receive the game on the platform of their choosing, though beta access will be through Steam and Itch only.\nFollow us on Twitter and join our Discord for news and updates! \nClick to go to our Twitter page.\nClick to access our discord server.\nLet's go, Kapi!!!!\nThe Girl from Arkanya is the tale of Marisa, an aspiring young adventurer with her sights set on becoming the world\u2019s greatest treasure hunter! She is accompanied by her capybara companion, and you will need to use both characters together in creative ways to solve puzzles and challenges. But treasure hunting can be a risky business! As Marisa ventures further in to untamed wilds and dark dungeons, you must constantly weigh risk versus reward as one wrong step could mean losing everything.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to popular demand, we now have capybara petting!\n\n\nThe Girl from Arkanya takes a proven formula and expands upon it. The beginning of the game will feel very familiar to fans of the top-down action RPG genre, but the game quickly changes as the player is tasked with controlling not one, but two characters!\nOnce Marisa meets Kapi, he will follow behind Marisa for the rest of her journey, and the player may take control of him at any time! Marisa can also push, pull, carry, and throw her rodent companion, which will help her solve challenges she will face along the way.\nWorking together with your giant rodent is essential to your success!\n\nThe wilds of Amazonia can be cruel and unforgiving, and treasure hunting is a game of risk vs. reward! The player will collect valuable gems and artifacts from the jungle, which can be traded to Renzo de Rocco, Arkanya\u2019s esteemed collector of exotic goods. He will pay you handsomely if you can make it back to the city with treasure in hand, but be warned: If Marisa is defeated, she will drop all of her treasure!\nDon't worry, Kapi will always be there to save you!\nWe designed Arkanya around the idea that the player sets their own difficulty through the choices they make. Going forward, we will continue to find new ways to allow players to avoid risky situations, while also creating even greater rewards for those who run head-first into danger and succeed! Thriving in Amazonia is a matter of preparation, and continuously asking yourself one question: Do I play it safe and turn back, or press forward and risk it all for a chance at even greater fortune?\nKAPI WE GOTTA GO!\n\nThe year is 1167 A.D., and the port city of Arkanya is fast becoming the jewel of the Holy Roman Empire. Seated at the edge of the known world on the most fertile soil ever seen, Arkanya grew into a bustling city within a mere forty years, built by the hands of explorers, farmers, and merchants.\nYet uncertainty haunts the future of Arkanya. The Marajoaran tribe, which once peacefully lived alongside the people of Arkanya, has vanished into the wilds without a word. To the North, the forces of Aztlan wage a desperate war against the conquistadors of Castille, a conflict which has now spilled into Amazonia. And to further complicate matters, the weather has become chaotic and violent, disrupting life within Arkanya\u2019s walls.\nHigh Priest Xolotl, Hero of Aztlan, Scourge of Marajoara, and the world's greatest necromancer.\nThere is little room for debate - The Bierhaus is the cultural center of Arkanya.\n Perhaps the most important tool in Marisa's kit is her Shaman Dances. They allow her to alter the world around her in various ways, such as altering the weather, commanding nature, or unlocking the secrets of Marajoara. \n\nDancing is tied to it's own keybind, meaning the player never has to swap items to activate a dance effect. This was important because of the frequency with which players will have to activate various dances. \nDue to the limit of two equipped items, we didn't want players to feel like they always had to have Marisa's sword equipped. With this in mind, we have designed almost all items to have an offensive use, as well as their utility function. While the sword will always be the best item for raw damage, the player will be able to effectively fight with a variety of tools. \nDon't forget to stock up on cold beverages when going exploring!\n\nMarisa and Ari, Old (left) versus new (right)\nART\nWe went into the project with very little art experience, which meant that early builds were done primarily with modified versions of assets we'd bought. Because we didn't want to be limited to using only art we could find/afford, the game's lead programmer devoted a great deal of time to practicing pixel art. \nArkanya has undergone three identifiable generations of art now, though the transition between each one was gradual. \nEarly builds of Arkanya ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio.\nArt improvement is still an ongoing process, as newer art starts to really outshine older art and makes it look out of place. We predict that there will be at least one more distinct generation, though much of the current art will probably stay as it is. \nImprovements made to not only the sprite itself, but to the fluidity of the animations\nMUSIC\nWe originally planned to have a 16-bit soundtrack using SNES-style sound fonts, but soon abandoned that concept when it became clear that the game was not going to follow SNES limitations. \nWe feel that memorable music is an important part of any game. Robby's sound design philosophy has maintained a short, simple, but memorable style that many would associate with that era of gaming, but using more modern production methods. \n\nThe Girl from Arkanya is expected to sell for 20 USD at the time of launch, so please take advantage of the discounted price during the campaign!\n\n\n\n\nPoster Art of The Girl from Arkanya (Design may be subject to change)\nMockup of the acrylic standees (Design may be subject to change)\nMockup of the Arkanya Art Book (Design may be subject to change)\nMockup of the Kapi body pillow\n\n So far, Arkanya has been funded out of our own pockets. This hasn't always been easy, as the team experienced some unexpected expenses not related to Arkanya, and like many others, we were financially impacted by COVID-19. However, we have found ways to stretch our dollars and get the most possible bang for our buck, and we will continue to do so after this campaign. \n So where is this $10,000 going? Here's our budget estimate based on the information we could find. \nPayment Processing and Kickstarter fees: 10% ($1000)\nTaxes: 10% ($1000)\nSoftware Licensing: 12% ($1200)\nCreation of Physical Rewards: 12% ($1200) \nCommissioned Art: 8% ($800)\nBusiness/Legal fees: 2% ($200)\nDevelopment: 46% ($4600)\nThe nice thing about these numbers is that most of the percentages stay the same or even go down if we exceed our funding goal. So the more money we raise, the greater percentage that goes into the development budget. \nMore funding means faster and better development! There are, of course, diminishing returns on this. We could get ten million dollars and Arkanya still would not come out tomorrow. However, each dollar we raise means less time worrying about keeping the lights on, and more time focused on making The Girl from Arkanya the best game it can be. \nClick to go to our Itch.io page!\nA note about the Chapter 1 prototype: Leading up to our Kickstarter launch, we made the decision to work overtime and get many big visual updates ready in time for the trailer. However, we were unable to update Chapter 1 with these visuals. The build you will play is outdated by four months, but we hope you will enjoy it all the same. A newer version will be available for download in the near future!\n Harrison Withrow: Lead Developer and Artist\n  Robby Siva: Sound Designer/Composer, Assistant Developer\nPublishing, marketing assistance, and port development provided by Top Hat Studios, Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough we often receive help from our amazing friends and community, Arkanya is ultimately a two man team working part-time on the project. This brings with it several challenges. One such challenge was that preparing for the Kickstarter campaign brought actual development of the game to a grinding halt. \n\nOnce the campaign is over and this chapter behind us, our very first priority is to polish the Chapter 1 Beta into a full-fledged, stable demo. We give you our word that we will provide frequent updates on development via social media and Kickstarter, not just until the updated demo releases, but through the entirety of development.

It is a game filled with grassy fields, mossy shrines, herds of chubby bumblebees, opossums in sundresses, salamanders with suspenders, starry night skies, and the most beautiful sunsets you can imagine. You might be a tamarin who dances with small and forgotten gods, a leporine mail carrier who relies on moths to get packages where they belong, a little lizard with a big heart and a mysterious past, or a near-endless number of other thrilling possibilities. No matter what, we\u2019re always travelers\u2014animal-folk who go from village to village and get to see the length and breadth of all the world of H\u00e6th. The seasons will change as we play, and we will change with them. But I can\u2019t tell you all that will happen on our journey together, along the winding dirt road and amid the grassy fields. We\u2019re just going to have to find that out together.\nWill you join me?\nThe Journey Ahead\nWanderhome makes use of a unique game system inspired by the No Dice, No Masters engine, developed by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum for Dream Askew and Dream Apart. Each player will make a character with the help of one of fifteen possible playbooks, making choices about their personality, animal-form, look, and passions. Each of these playbooks give you a radically different approach both to navigating the setting and growing over time. From the carefree Ragamuffin to the introverted Poet, from the Guardian and their young ward to the lonely Exile, from the cheerful Dancer to the moody Veteran, there is plenty of space in Wanderhome to imagine every possible world that lives in your heart.\nOnce you\u2019ve created your character, you and your fellow travelers guide them through the dreamlike pastoral world of H\u00e6th. There are no dice in Wanderhome. Instead, you can inconvenience yourself or step outside your comfort zone in order to get tokens, and then turn around and spend those tokens to tackle larger problems and help make the world a better, kinder space.\nQuote from Vincent and Elliot Baker of Lumpley Games\nQuote from Samuel Mui Shen Ern, Babblegumsam\n\nAs you arrive at each new place, you\u2019ll build it together using a combination of thirty-six distinct natures, including farms, fields, lakes, ports, glens, and towers, among many, many more. Each nature gives you the tools you need to imagine and articulate both the literal and metaphorical aspects of the place you find yourself in. These places have kith, ordinary people living ordinary lives, navigating a world that is both peaceful and difficult in its own ways. Each kith is made out of traits that range from crafty and adventurous to many-faced and oracular. These traits give kith things they can do to define their personality, articulate the problems in their life, and push the journey forward (for good or for ill.) Sometimes you\u2019ll be able to help the kith with their problems, but more often than not you\u2019ll just spend time with them and learn more about the world.\nSketches by Kimberli Johnson, Nadhir Nor, and Letty Wilson\nWanderhome is structured with an emphasis on safety and care, built on my own work designing safety mechanics and constructing alternate safety approaches beyond the industry standards. It features a bespoke set of safety mechanics built around empowering players to guide the story however they want, which are used consistently throughout the game. It is also designed to collaboratively set the tone and articulate a version of H\u00e6th that's perfect for your group. \nWanderhome is a GM-agnostic game\u2013while you can play with a Guide facilitating the world, you can also approach it without anyone in charge, where everyone takes equal part in the collaborative conversation. And while you can play Wanderhome in as little as 3-4 hours, the longer you stay with Wanderhome the more the world will grow with you. The months will pass over time and as each season concludes you\u2019ll get to make new choices about your character, advancing them in new directions and helping them grow in ways you didn\u2019t think was possible. If you play long enough, eventually your characters will retire or grow apart, and the journey will continue with brand-new travelers and a vast world ahead of you.\nThe free playkit is available on Itch now! (Art by Letty Wilson)\nThe World of Haeth\nWanderhome is set in the wholly-original fantasy world of H\u00e6th, inspired by the works of Brian Jacques, Tove Jansson, and Hayao Miyazaki. The game hints at and builds a mythological language around forces like the bitter King of the Floating Mountain, the Lily Rebellion, the Slobbering God and the blade that killed her, and the fall of the great dragons of old, but refuses to elaborate or define them\u2014leaving that exercise to the players through the journey itself. Instead, Wanderhome is focused on the lives of ordinary people, and the world that exists for farmers, merchants, and crafts-folk.\nWanderhome is a world filled with animal-folk and their buggy livestock. Unlike many worlds with animal-folk, there is no morality or judgement ascribed to the various animals of H\u00e6th\u2014a snake is just as capable of being a kindly farmer as a rabbit, and you can\u2019t assume much about someone based on what animal they are. You might find a fluffy shepherd with a herd of bumblebees, a shrewish merchant riding a stag beetle the size of a house, a lonely fox riding a grasshopper from place to place, or a praying mantis that hangs out in a gecko\u2019s pocket.\nQuote from Avery Alder, Buried Without Ceremony (Art by Jennie Lindberg)\nWanderhome also features an original calendar of new months and seasons, with its own cycle of holidays and traditions. From flowery Bloommeadow to brisk Firetop to snug and quiet Snowblanket, each month is both rooted in potentially familiar natural cycles but with a unique twist. Each place you travel to has a different expression of the seasons in it - no matter how many times you travel through the year, it will always feel different. If you play Wanderhome long enough, you might even encounter unique phenomena that create a new twist on the calendar. \nThe H\u00e6th is a world full of queer love, hope, happiness, and community. It is a land that was once ravaged by violence, but is putting itself back together again. Wanderhome dares to imagine a better world, one where money and power are distant stories from a bygone age, and we can learn to begin the process of healing.\nThumbnails by Danny Kyobe and Jo Thierolf\nKickstarter\nWanderhome, like all projects, is a dream that can only be created with your help. In an industry dominated by exploitative hiring practices and low wages, I believe it\u2019s possible to release a large-scale high-quality game where everyone is paid what they\u2019re worth. While the funding goal is higher than most Kickstarters, I refuse to get away with underpaying or undervaluing the incredible artists, writers, designers, and creators who are willing to pour their heart and soul into this game. Wanderhome is ambitious, but the hope is to make something unlike anything else in the role-playing game space.\nThe final copy of Wanderhome will exist in two forms\u2014a complete digital PDF copy of the game, and an approximately 150 page 8.5\u201d square softcover in full color, printed by Mixam Press and published by Possum Creek Games. Wanderhome will feature a cover by Sylvia Bi, illustrations by Letty Wilson, and full-page pieces by more than a dozen different artists, each with a unique style and perspective on Wanderhome. These talents are being directed (and the book is being designed) by the one-of-a-kind Ruby Lavin, with editing by Kazumi Chin and Luke Jordan.\nHere is how the budget is being distributed:\n $5,000 for game design and editing.\n $7,000 for layout and all the incredible art.\n $4,000 for printing and production.\n $800 for Backerkit, who will be handling shipping after the Kickstarter.\n $1,800 for Kickstarter and credit card fees\nMockups of the Book (design not final)\nHardcover Now Available!\nPDF Tiers\nSoftcover Tiers\nHardcover Tiers\nMerchant Tiers\nPilgrim Tier\nThe Team\nJay Dragon\nJay is a queer lyrical game designer who lives in the Hudson Valley.

These will probably be available on Backerkit instead of through tiers, but we'll keep you posted!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWanderhome is completely finished, and no additional content needs to be created. However, I can imagine hiccups in production, manufacturing, and distribution. While this is Possum Creek Games' fourth project with Kickstarter, it is on a scale we haven't previously worked with, and there might be issues ensuring a speedy timeline with the many artists. While we've spent the past several months preparing for the larger scale of Wanderhome, we still admit there might be logistical complexities.\n\nAdditionally, we live on a precipice right now. The world is in the midst of a series of enormous crises, and the United States that Wanderhome will be distributed in might be very different than the United States of the summer. Our timeline has already been prepared with the acknowledgement that COVID, the rise of the far right, fallout from the American 2020 election, or goodness knows what else might meaningfully and dangerously impact the project.

I am Stranga, the creator of the games: Just Ignore Them, My Big Sister and Red Bow. I also co-created Mini Thief along with Tommah. \nWelcome to the Kickstarter for my latest game Ashina: The Red Witch. A top-down horror-themed story adventure game.\n\nThe story is about Ash. An ordinary girl who takes a journey through a mysterious spirit world filled with strange creatures. Ash must find her way back home...before something else finds her. This game is a canon prequel to one of my previous games 'My Big Sister' which will tell the story of the events that led to the red witch. \nI also have plans to include some alternate endings to the game as wells as a few secret ones. \n\n\nAll of my games (except Mini Thief) are made in Adventure Game Studio. AGS gives me the flexibility to create something more unique and adventurous than RPG Maker. Most of the engine's functions and systems are already pre-built into the engine, which gives me more time to create my own unique systems and features.  I have more designing freedom with less programming to create it  and I love to design!   \nThe game will feature:\nA unique and thrilling story!\nNew and exciting characters! As well as some returning characters from my previous games.\nAdventure like puzzles throughout the game to help keep your mind at its wits.\nExtra character dialogue options to delve into some of the lore surrounding the game's universe.\nMini-Games!\nAn Original Soundtrack + Remixed Soundtrack.\nAchievements + Trophies! As well as an in-game trophy system.  \n\n\nThe reason I started this kick starter is to help financially support me and my family whilst I develop the project. I'm a full-time game developer and I do absolutely everything myself, from programming and artwork to story and music. I occasionally receive help when it comes to testing or grammar checking (As I tend to miss quite a few things while I program). \nBut my stories are made for the fans and players. I love to share them with everyone! \nWith the extra funding, I will be able to make a longer game with much more content than my previous titles. I also hope to add a few new mechanics as well as some  extensive puzzles \n\nThe game will initially release on PC through Steam and itch.io as early access when available. Once the PC full release has been established, the game will be ported to consoles such as:\nPS4\nXboxOne\nNintendo Switch\n\n\nThe stretch goals will be used to extend the game and add more nifty features.\n + $5,000 - An extra chapter will be added to the game!\n + $10,000 - An extra chapter + Bonus alternate ending!\n +$20,000 - Digital art book!\n  +$50,000 - In game character lore book or collectors cards + Character face portraits to dialog! \n +$100,000 - A defibrillator to revive me  after I pass out seeing so much support!(Just kidding!). Animated intro + a few animated cutscenes throughout the game + Possible IOS and Android ports of the game + I'll think of some more things, don't worry!\nWith your funding, I estimate a full release around early to mid-2021 or even late 2020 (It all depends on the stretch goals). I want to try and make this game as enjoyable as I can with as much content that I can pack into the game add as much content as I can to the game, hence why the stretch goals are important.

There is a full story with lovely sprite and anime-style art, along with a fantastic soundtrack! \nWith multiple difficulty settings, you can choose a more relaxed, story-driven experience OR push your puzzle and tactical skills to the limits.     \nLike what you see? Play the game yourself! We've been releasing public builds for several months now and lots of people are already playing and enjoying the game, even in its pre-alpha state. If you like what you see, remember that we have over 12 months of additional development left, with plenty more story, gameplay, and art to come.\nNote: These are PRE-ALPHA builds and may have bugs, placeholder content, and gameplay balance issues. They're still fun, though!\nPuzzle Explorers (b43) for Windows\nPuzzle Explorers (b43) for Mac OSX\nPuzzle Explorers (b43) for Linux\nJoin the Discord Community!\nWe've got a Tangledeep server with a dedicated #puzzle-explorers channel, so if you want to talk to other players, give feedback, report bugs, or share memes, come on in!\nWant to play more throughout development?\nBackers at the $15 tier and above will have access to beta builds, followed by Early Access, and finally the complete game via Steam!  \nPuzzle Explorers has real-time combat where you (and eventually, your party!) face off against up to 3 monsters at once. While monsters and your allies take turns attacking and using special abilities, the main character - Mirai - controls the flow of battle on the puzzle board.\n\n       By clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. Some monsters may use charge attacks which can be interrupted with your attacks. This makes it important to weigh the state of your puzzle board with the battle scenario. Exciting!   \nThere are plenty of other battle features that become unlocked as you progress in the game. For example, monster attacks often mess with your puzzle board by removing blocks, swapping your tiles, speeding up the game, and more! But you can also strike back harder by connecting link crystals in blocks, which can be cleared for combo multipliers.  \nIn contrast with the high-energy battles, you'll also come across ruins which can be rebuilt for rewards. To do this, you must drop the right blocks in the right locations. Though these puzzles start out easy, they can be quite tricky... and equally satisfying to solve!   \nYour home base in Puzzle Explorers is the town of New Riverstone. Here is where you'll meet a host of charming characters, buy items, and go on quests. A big part of the game is building and upgrading the town, which involves both fighting battles and seeking resources.\n\n       To gather resources, you'll talk to Hagan the Miner and play in Mining Mode. This is an arcade-style, time-attack puzzle where you have 2 minutes to get all the resources you can.  \nTo earn these resources, you must clear lines with those resources. Clearing lines also increases the Resource (blue) gauge. When it fills up, Hagan will throw more resource blocks on to the map. The faster (and more) you clear, the faster you'll find more resources. You might even find some special treasure chests!  \nYou can move freely through town like a 2D side-scroller, talking to townspeople and learning their backstories, as well as helping the town develop.  \nYou'll help the townspeople by completing Town Upgrades. As you gather resources and defeat bosses, you'll collect dozens of resource types and key items which can be used to purchase items or equipment, as well as build up the town and progress the story.\n\n       Several NPCs have their own roles, and by giving them the resources they need, they'll be able to thrive. It's not all about combat!  \nUnlike other falling block-style games, you have the ability to choose what pieces are in your \"bag\" using the power of the Flowstone. You must have 8 different pieces, all of which have their advantages and disadvantages.  \nFor example, small 3-piece blocks may be convenient, but they are slower than larger 5 and 6-piece blocks which may work against you in Battles. Also, some blocks contain link crystals which help you deal huge damage in battle when combined carefully.  \nYou start out by only dropping \"Flow\" blocks, which deal physical damage. You will later find: Fire blocks that deal damage-over-time, and are a better use of small line clears; Ice blocks that freeze an enemy and prevent them from acting; and Lightning blocks that scale even higher with bigger clears, and hit all enemies at once.\n\n       Monsters can also have elemental strengths and weaknesses, so using the right element at the right time is really important. Furthermore, certain elements work best with certain sized pieces. Be sure to experiment to see what works best for you! \nFlow, Fire, Ice, and Lightning are some of the elemental choices you can make\nThe story is a character-driven, three-part epic. Whether it's our hero, NPCs, party members, or antagonists, we want each one to be memorable, expressive, and interesting.\n\n       Picture a lush & verdant world that was lost to time for many millenia and only recently rediscovered by denizens far beneath the surface. New frontiers are being explored every day, but much is still unknown. Without great empires and civilizations, towns, clans, and kinships form in unexpected ways.\n\n       Although some have banded together to live in harmony - like the town of New Riverstone - others prefer to take the fruits of labor by force. Tales of roving pirates and mighty fleets abound. But nothing is as simple as it seems!  \nMirai will meet a ton of interesting and unique characters on her journey\nWe've come up with a grand variety of tempting rewards for backers at all levels! Besides obtaining the game and soundtrack, you'll be able to get your name in the Special Thanks, get a cool digital artbook, or even collaborate with us to create new puzzles, monsters, and characters.\nWhat we're not doing is any kind of physical rewards (except for the highest tiers, and even then, it's a small item.) Our previous experiences with Kickstarter, though all successful, have shown us that manufacturing physical goods adds a lot of time, hassle, and expense to a project. We think you'll agree these resources are much better spent on making the game better.  \nGoldfrogs love cheese almost as much as Mirai! These cute croakers are designed by Flea Circus Designs\nIn 2017, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for our first title, Tangledeep, with a similar purpose: raising money to further polish art and music. We think this same approach makes sense for Puzzle Explorers. While we have invested our own time and money heavily into the game, there is always more we can do to improve the game's presentation, for example:\nMore character portraits with additional moods or expressions\nProfessional mixing and mastering of the soundtrack\nAdditional live musicians to make some tracks sound even better\nA greater variety of particle FX and animations \nMore sound effects to accompany the wide range of abilities and events \nAdditional flavor text and character conversations\n... and much more!\nWe do not need money to finish the core game. We're doing that no matter what! We're fortunate to be in the position where income from our previous game and income from other projects is enough for us to fund the core development of Puzzle Explorers. \nThat means no risk that we'll accidentally burn through our Kickstarter funding and be unable to finish. Instead, this funding will all go to making the game tangibly, materially better-looking and sounding. And what's not to love about that?  \nFor several months now, Puzzle Explorers has been in 'public development', and we intend on keeping it that way! This means you can always:\nChat on Discord - Talk to us and other players about your experiences with the game! Share strategies, tricks, or awesome combos you've pulled off.\nRead the Dev Log - See what goes into the game every build, and contribute your own suggestions or feedback!\nWatch Development Live - We're shooting to stream development a couple times a week, always announced on Twitter (@TangledeepGame)first!\n\n       As mentioned above, public builds will continue to be available through the end of September, 2020. After this, builds will only be available to $15+ backers.  \nWith much of the core gameplay complete, our biggest task is building out the story of the game. While the story outline is complete, the written dialogue has to be input in game-readable dialogue, along with all accompanying cutscenes, animations, and music. These in turn require ongoing art assets for new allies, enemies, and environments.\nOn the programming side, we've established the core gameplay loop already - combat,  unique ruins puzzles, town upgrades, mining - so future tasks are closely tied to story progression as opposed to core engine and mechanics.\nWith that in mind, our broad goals are as follows.\nEnd of Summer 2020: Complete all game UIs (e.g. menus, dialogues, and other user interfaces.) Act 1 story finished and implemented in some form. Bistro conversation system implemented (converse with more NPCs!)\nEnd of Fall 2020: Game launched in Early Access. Act 1 story fully polished. Basic Steam achievements. Nintendo Switch port started. Most Job Spirits implemented.\nEnd of 2020: Full story complete. All jobs implemented.\nQ1 2021: Story fully polished. Nintendo Switch port ready for testing.\nQ2 2021: Ship the final game!\nOngoing: Fixing bugs, adjusting game balance, and making quality-of-life changes to enhance the overall experience. Writing & mixing music, creating SFX, and visual effects also happens parallel to all other development.  \n Andrew Aversa - Lead Programmer & Studio Founder\nComing from a background in music composition and production, game development was a big career change for Aversa in 2016, when he founded Impact Gameworks and began work on Tangledeep. It was also the fulfillment of a lifelong dream of creating video games, taking inspiration from the beloved golden age of RPGs (SNES & PlayStation).\nFor Puzzle Explorers, Aversa is bringing the many lessons learned from his first project to make this game's development easier, faster, and more fun, while also contributing to some of the game's battle and puzzle design.\nAlso, he promises UIManagerScript.cs won't be 20,000 lines this time.\nAndrew Luers - Lead Artist, Lead Designer, Composer\nAs the person responsible for the gorgeous environmental art of Tangledeep, Luers was more than ready to flex his artistic muscles and creativity in a new title. As a long-time puzzle game and JRPG lover, his concept for Puzzle Explorers wasn't totally unexpected: combining two of his passions into a dream project. \nSince he began designing the game in 2018, Luers has been tirelessly leading the project from puzzle design to story outlines and monster encounters. Simultaneously, he's taken his pixel art to a whole new level with stunningly large landscapes and beautifully-animated characters. He only wishes he could escape Bronze in League of Legends.\nFun fact: Luers competed in the finals of the 1990 Nintendo World Championships and was one of just 90 competitors to receive the (now coveted) holy-grail of retro game collecting: the NWC grey cart for NES. \nMolly Heady-Carroll - Animation\nMolly was a Creature Designer and Pixel Artist for Tangledeep\u2019s DLC Legend of Shara and Dawn of Dragons. She makes a return for Puzzle Explorers as an Animator: bringing performances to the characters.  \nMolly graduated from the University of Arts Utrecht, The Netherlands, with a Masters Degree in Game Art in 2014. Since then she has created art for games such as Stranger Things 3: The Game, The Mummy: Dark Universe Stories, Crap! I\u2019m Broke: Out of Pocket and, of course, the Tangledeep series. Molly currently lives in the Netherlands with her husband and two leopard geckos.\nScott Hagelgans - Lead Writer\nA fan of gaming throughout his entire life, Scott (aka 'FenixDown') developed a special affinity for RPGs and other story-centric genres over the years. He acted as a secondary scenario writer for Tangledeep and contributed extensively to its DLC expansions, Legend of Shara and Dawn of Dragons. Also, as a huge fan of video game music, he served as a script writer for the official OverClocked ReMix podcast for over a year.\nScott is currently the reigning champion of the biannual, post-MAGfest Bennett Foddy's Get On Top tournament.\nJames Mello - Sound Designer\nJames has contributed sound design, audio implementation, and music on a variety of projects for VR, mobile games, and any game jam he can find. He has also toured the far corners of the United States as a musician, running two vans into the ground playing shows with artists like Mike Watt, the Lemonheads, and Joe Lally (Fugazi). He also somehow ended up playing a rehearsal show with Jimmy Fallon for the Tonight Show.\nJames can often be spotted in the wild roaming the streets of Seattle with his trusty Zoom H5 recorder, along with his trusty sidekick Bev the dog.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping a game often involves unexpected bugs and issues which can throw a wrench into even the best plans and schedules. This is especially true when porting to Nintendo Switch, which involves approvals and testing that we have limited control over. \n\nWe have made what we think are reasonable delivery estimations for v1.0 of the game, based on our experience successfully shipping \"Tangledeep\" on PC in 2018 and on Switch in 2019. We also plan on launching in Early Access before the v1.0 release in order to further polish the game based on player feedback.\n\nWe have put over a year of development into Puzzle Explorers already, along with a significant amount of our own money. There is very little we can imagine that would prevent us from finishing and releasing the game, especially given our track record with Tangledeep.\n\nThat said, if any issues arise that might delay the game beyond our planned date, we will communicate this well in advance to backers. The most likely issues would relate to Nintendo Switch approvals, or waiting on third-parties such as localization teams.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "zirconmusic\n4 created \u00b7 11 backed\nAndrew 'zircon' Aversa is a game developer, composer, and sound designer based in Fulton, MD.

Don't let your guard down and use everything you have learned to overcome these skilled fighters! \nFive Gods of Kung Fu will be released on Steam for PC, Mac and Linux.\nI'll be honest, this is my first game and as much as i would love to see it on Xbox, PS4 and Switch, it will require a lot of time and money. I wouldn't be comfortable right now to estimate that, so I am not gonna put it up as a stretch goal. But you have my word, if this kickstarter is successful I will do my absolute best to bring it to consoles in the future. The more money i can raise right now, the more likely console ports will become. \nYou play as Li, who works at his grandfather's small restaurant mainly as a dishwasher. The recent growth of gangs all over the country is making life harder for everyone and when a local gang stirs up trouble in your grandfather's restaurant you seek help from a nearby Kung Fu school.\nAfter learning the basics of self defense, you try to protect the family business the next time the gang arrives, but can do so only with the help of an old man who saw his meal interrupted and helped defend the restaurant.\nThis old man is a true master of Kung Fu and will start your journey to become a legendary Fighter. Someone who might fulfill the prophecy of defeating the mysterious Five Gods of Kung Fu, learn their secrets and unify the land.\nThe game will feature an original soundtrack written by me. I've been playing the piano basically all my life and the guitar half my life. Making music is a big part of me and everything you have heard in the trailer, the demo or what you'll find below is written by me. Have a listen!\nSmash the initial funding goal to reveal stretch goals!\nMany of the features and systems are already developed. The main work left will be content. I plan to work closely with the community to make every part of the game the best it can be. \nThe demo is about 20 minutes of playable content and contains only a small taste of what I want the final game to be. I published it early to gather feedback and I definitely want to continue in that kind of development with lots of community involvement.\nYou can expect a game length of 6-9 hours of story and additional end game features.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo game development is always a little risky.

A capital in full decadence, where its glorious past has vanished through the passage of time and it has been painted into forgotten tomes of libraries set on fire. The civil war has come to an end and a fatal disease haunts the city, corrupted to the bone.\nWithin this world, left to its fate lives Eric, a man who remembers nothing and stands in the middle of a conspiracy bigger than himself.\nHidden secrets and tales will bring back an ancestral past created by wars between the messiah and the false prophets. Gods and false gods, spells and alchemies, ancient orders that arise and an evolving race made by unknown creatures called \"the Cold Ones\" lost through legends and songs, which only a few brave souls are not afraid to sing.\nEric will have to subvert the words of the hidden prophecy, the one that haunts him in his nightmares. It\u2019s a continuous obsession, which will force him to venture through dark palaces and mysterious castles populated by nobles corrupted by power, scientists blinded by knowledge, and bloodthirsty mutants.\nIt will be an ongoing challenge against creepy and strange creatures, abominations feeding on blood and human memories, where no one or nothing can be trusted: only rely on one's own strength. \nThe Last Faith is a Metroidvania that promotes a deep exploration style gameplay with non-linear levels. While you travel around the giant map, you have control over the way you want to be next. Every single spot counts, as you can discover new items, new secret areas, particular puzzles to solve and unique enemies.  \nYou have the choice to wield your favourite weapon as the game provides a large number of them, you will be able to power them up with special buffs and mostly you will cast magic spells against your enemies. All of this is wrapped up in a stunning and highly detailed pixel art style. \nWith the stunning visual effects, different combos, special attacks and three types of dodges, The Last Faith provides deep and satisfying reactive action combat. You will be able to switch between a variety numbers of weapons where each of them has different stats and special movesets. Here are some of the melee weapons we implemented on the game. We are constantly thinking and designing new ideas:  \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nAlso you will be able to choose between different distance weapons such as guns and rifles. They possess a unique passive ability, you can get a bonus chance of breaking the defence and stun the enemy. An example can be seen in this demonstration: \nfire guns concept arts\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThe dodges are divided in 3 types: back dodge, tactical dodge and evasive dodge:\n Back dodge: simply escapes attacks by sliding back. Can perform special attack right after using the dodge.\n Tactical dodge: It allows you to dodge attacks while sliding behind the enemy for then facing its back. This will open a chance for you to quickly deal a good amount of damage. (Good during duel combats)\n Evasive dodge: Dive roll to avoid specific types of enemies. (Good to avoid large number of enemies at the same time)\nHere is a demonstration of all the three types of dodge: \nWeapons can be buffed by using elemental powders. Those are special items you can collect while playing the game. You will either find them by killing enemies or buying them. Buffing weapon will add an extra bonus damage and some passive ability.  \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Fire Buff Gameplay - Add fire to the main weapon, and add an extra bonus damage. It is very effective against beasts and Cold ones.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Electric Buff Gameplay - By adding electricity to your weapon, you will get an advantage against humanoids and armored enemies. This also increases the chance of stunning them. \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Ice Buff Gameplay - Add Ice effects to the main weapon. This will slow down the enemies plus it will give an extra chance to freeze and execute them by disintegrating them into a thousand pieces.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Dark Buff Gameplay - Add dark bonuses to the main weapon. The bonus ignores the enemies defence and armour stats plus you absorb mana from them\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nCursed blood Gameplay - This is a special buff. You can acquire the cursed blood automatically, right after executing a specific type of enemy. This will make your weapons turn with blood and adds bonus damage. Very Effective Vs humanoid.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThe last faith also provides some supportive magic spells to deal extra damage to enemies and bosses. Like the buffs, the game provides 4 types of magic spells: fire, ice, dark, and electric. We are constantly creating new effects and magic spells. Here are few of the magic spell we implemented on the gameplay:\n\nThe Last Faith core is a Gothic-style based around the 19th century, mixed with dark, creepy, and horror feelings. We built a world around those themes; in fact, you will play through giant cathedrals, astonishing palaces, and majestic castles with highly detailed sculptures and decorations.\nThe game is a Metroidvania at the core, which means levels are designed to be non-linear. You are free to explore even the most hidden secret part of the world, you will travel through a giant world connected by different levels and huge environments, it presents a variety of puzzles to unlock different areas and secret areas of the game. You will acquire a large number of abilities, not only to help your combat situations, but mostly needed to progress on new parts of the game. Here are a few examples of what to expect and and we are also excited to work on even more abilities:\n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nAs a player you will be able to interact with several environment items, such as boxes, chairs and more. We are constantly iterating on new ideas. Here is an example of picking up and throwing away a chair:\ninteract with chair\ninteract with corpse\n\n\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nOur plan is to release The Last Faith to as many platforms as possible. The main goal will be Steam (PC/Mac/Linux), Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, and Xbox One. \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nThe Last Faith is populated by a variety of creepy creatures. We designed a large number of types at this stage and we are still constantly creating new ideas. Here is an overview of what you will encounter through the gameplay:\nThe Widow\nThe Hollow Hunter\nCathedral Guardian\nVultures of the North\nThe Blood Seeker\nBlind Sinner\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n We also designed stunning giant bosses, as we want to give an extra level of creepiness to the game. There will be more to come!\nLaddak the Cold One\nRuthless Beast\nHorror of the Crypt\nHydra - The Child of the Abyss\n\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nWe would love to introduce some of our concept art made during the early stage of our game design process. We took a large amount of time creating the main character and some of the selected environments. There will be a big collection of art and concept art printed in our upcoming artbook and it will include more deep stories and facts about our universe. \n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\n\n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\n\nWe have been working non-stop on The Last Faith for about two years now and after spending a large amount of time exploring the core themes, concepts, visuals, and combat mechanics, we are finally ready to move at full-speed to the production stage.\nWe are a small team formed by two brothers Duilio and Riccardo Guglielmino. Our goal is to create memorable experiences through building video games. We are very committed to this as we are spending every single seconds of our life in building projects. We have years of experience in both developing and designing video games, mobile games and also web apps.\nThe Last Faith project was born from our passion of gothic architecture and arts. We want to create an experience where people have to feel what means living in an epoch full of mysteries and terrifying environments. For example, living in a gothic city or walking through an ancient street where strange creatures or bad inhuman experiments ambush you.\nWe have been supported by amazing people, and we would love to shout out them for their incredible talent and work!\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nWe built and delivered Ninja Knight in 2017, our first video game project, a beautiful handcrafted flat design challenging action game for Android. \nGet it on Google Play Store\nAs a small team, we have been working on The Last Faith for about two years now. We spent a lot of time in exploring concepts, themes and ideas around what we have today. We built several prototypes to find out what works best and what doesn't. We have also been funding the game ourselves and while working on our full time jobs, we\u2019ve been putting all of the possible remaining time we had from our lives into the project, including our sleepless nights. With the success of the Kickstarter campaign, you will give us and to The Last Faith an amazing chance to become real! \nThe journey is long, we\u2019ve been working on lots of aspects of the game, such as main feelings, themes and core ideas. We still need to work on some other parts of the game, level design, content, polish and more. We are planning to create lots more enemies, environments, abilities and spells and we want to invest into beautiful concepts in the areas of art and also music and sounds FX as we think they are a critical piece to the overall experience of The Last Faith. \nWith the funding efforts and your support, you will help us in shaping the project and speed up the production and put us in a full time development mode. We can\u2019t wait to share with you our vision!

You juggle enemies, explore mysterious islands on your airship, and fight ruthless bosses, all with a combat system inspired by deep technical actions games like Devil May Cry.\nCurrently, we are aiming to release on Steam and other digital PC platforms supporting Windows, Mac and Linux some time in late 2022 with PS4, XBOX ONE , and Nintendo Switch ports potentially coming in future. We are also open to releasing on the as of now upcoming PS5 and XBOX Series X, but we will adjust our plans with time.\nMade in Game Maker Studio 2.\n Presskit\n Twitter: @HyMyNameIsMatt\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/TgdZcyY \n\nWho is Hello Penguin Team?\nWe're a small group that have has been making games for the past 10 years.  Over time our short little hobby games have grown in scope and in scale leading us to Vernal Edge, our most ambitious project to date!  We've spent years working on mods, creating short games, and freelancing to create art and code for other games.  We're committed to doing things our own way and will make whatever weird creative decisions we want to create our perfect game.\nWe are Matthew Martinez (artist / co-programmer / co-designer)\nand Alex McCaskey (musician / sound / co-programmer / co-designer)\nWhy Kickstarter?\n  To us, Kickstarter is the most honest platform for funding games development.  We love our community and don't want to develop our games apart from them.  To that end Kickstarter is a perfect fit for us, allowing the community to tell us what they think of Vernal Edge for themselves, and receiving the funds we need to develop the game based on merit.\nCombat\nVernal Edge's Features a broad moveset, light resource management, and in depth juggling mechanics inspired by classic action titles like Devil May Cry. The game also features many customization options, giving you the freedom to tune your moves exactly to your playstyle.\nOf course there are still some challenges to overcome in a fight, no enemy worth their salt will let you combo them into oblivion without a fight.  Enemies have a defensive tool we call Poise to prevent you from destroying them completely until you've broken it all down.  You can use your Charged Attacks, Pulse Attacks, and Spells(which we'll get into later) to help you break down an enemy's defenses and perform some mad combos on them.\nPoise: To start, some enemies will have 1 or more blue orbs below their health bar, this being their Poise.  While they have Poise, you can not stun them or knock them around.  Certain abilities and attacks directly deal Poise Damage, offering you different options to deal Poise Damage you can even knock enemies into each other to destroy their Poise.  Once an enemy's Poise is broken, you can begin to combo them freely until they recover from the stun.  You can see this as a blue meter beneath their health bar, so there's no nasty surprises when an enemy recovers.  This back and forth relationship between you and your foes is what makes Vernal Edge tick.\nCharged Attacks: Plain and simple, and usually very good at breaking enemy Poise.  Hold down the attack button and release after the glow to perform a charged attack.  There are different attacks you can do depending on the direction you hold and even whether or not you're in the air!\nPulse Attacks: Since most of our inspirations for Vernal Edge's gameplay are 3d and use lock-on target systems, we wanted an option in combat that lets you perform attacks to specific targets.  Using Vernal's magic sword, you can throw out a Ghost Blade that marks an enemy, and lets you perform attack target to that enemy specifically!  Barrel into them, shred them with a thousand swords, or run up to them and deliver a multi-hit barrage!  You spend Pulse Points to perform these attacks, and the only way to gain them back is to hit more enemies.\nExploration and Platforming\nIn Vernal Edge, you explore the sky in your airship and land on islands in whatever order you want.  While on these islands you can use an array of swift and stylish tools like sliding and air steps.  Using these tools you can make movement or as technical or relaxing as you want, and we fully intend for some of you to sequence break.  Every island contains new environments to navigate, enemies to fight, treasures to uncover, and stories to unravel. In addition there exists a mysterious hidden world that links the islands together with even more secrets to discover.\nUpgrades and Customization\nWhile exploring, you'll find various equipable spells and abilities (called Memories), giving you new combat and platforming options and sometimes expanding the functionality of previously acquired abilities.   Some rare Memories will even give you access to important movement abilities that let you traverse new areas.\nSpells: Secondary and highly specialized abilities that can help you deal more damage under the right situation, or help you break down an enemy's defenses.  You only have 4 slots to equip spells at a time, so you'll have to decide which ones best suit you for any given fight.\nMinor Memories: Lost techniques from other fighters, you can directly assimilate their muscle memory and perform techniques that enhance your core abilities.  Do a rising punch out of your slide attack, catch your sword when it returns to you to perform a deadly spin attack, there are many options to let you build a playstyle you enjoy.  However, you can only equip so many memories at a time, but as you play the game and expand the capabilties of your mind you can equip more and become a lethal force.\nItems:  You'll find consumable items hidden in secret locations and to purchase from shops.  Using these you can restore your health and mana, or take more aggressive items if you're more confident in your abilities and want to use them as a part of your aggressive playstyle.\nOur hero, Vernal, has taken to the skies  of  Haricot, a kingdom that one day mysteriously broke off from the ground and rose into the sky,  to exact revenge on her long lost father. In her search she comes across Chervil, a strange cyborg with the mind of a brilliant scientist but no memory.  Both of them decide to team up and explore the sky in search of answers.  Along the way they clash with monster and the newly risen Church of Aloe, uncover hidden truths about the world, and run into a mysterious and powerful woman named Alstroemeria, who is also searching for Vernal's father.  All while Chervil attempts to keep Vernal out of trouble everywhere they go.\nWhile those two are off on their adventure, things shift and move on the islands.  Unexplained catastrophes have occurred on the islands, monsters are appearing and wreaking havoc, and some mysterious figures have appeared traveling throughout the kingdom.  The struggle for control seems to be fought from many sides, and there is much more going on than there would seem.\n\nVernal\nThe art of the sword is a difficult one to master, taking years of practice until you are truly a proficient killing machine.  Vernal does not actually know how to use a sword, she just hits people with it.\nAge 22, Vernal is on the hunt for her deadbeat father to deliver righteous punishment.  She's recently discovered that he is somewhere in the Kingdom of Haricot, and flung herself up there to find him.  She isn't exactly a bountiful harvest of wisdom or information, being unable to even read.  What she lacks in knowledge she more than makes up for in raw emotional energy.  She gives every attack her all, and won't tolerate anyone standing in her way.\nAlstroemeria\nIn the language of flowers, the Alstroemeria symbolizes devotion and friendship. Unfortunately, neither of these qualities accurately describes Alstroemeria herself.\nAge 19, Alstroemeria is a mysterious woman, appearing time and again seemingly on her own quest, and no vessel around that she would travel with.  Not to be messed with, she seems to have a strong proficiency in channeling magic without a ring-shaped catalyst to do so, and has the strength of 10 men.  She looks down upon the weak and feeble minded that she comes across and treats Vernal with especially nasty disdain.  She's cold, intelligent, and staying out of her way would be the smart thing to do.\nChervil\nMagical energy flows around and inside us constantly like a current.  It is theoretically possible to record one's inner current and make a template with which your very soul could be recreated, or at least that's Chervil's working theory.\nAge unknown, Chervil is a man in a machine, with no memory of who he originally was.  He is seemingly brilliant, quick to learn, and hungry for knowledge, but quite reserved.  He pairs up with Vernal, in the search for answers as to who he is and why the islands rose from the earth.  Being the only one who can pilot the ship (or read), he is a vital part of the duo.\nRings are the means with which we control the magic around us.  Magic flows all around us in a current, and the creation of specialized ring shaped catalysts allows us to shape that energy in a way that's useful to us.  Depending on the catalyst, you can achieve amazing results through your channeling: creating force, illuminating the dark, and even flight.  But using this technology on a sword?  That seems a bit...\nVernal Edge takes place in the Kingdom of Haricot, where the land mysteriously rose from the earth two deades ago ago. The culture and political structure of the lands that rose were completely upended, allowing a once minor religious organization to take power by feeding off of the people's fears. Somehow despite this crisis, the pace of research into Sorcery and \"Memory Storage\" has drastically accelerated, creating a massive technological boom on the islands, the likes of which has never been seen before.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVernal Edge hopes to combine open exploration, a compelling narrative, and stylish action combat. Games with similar combat systems are traditionally structured linearly and don't offer much choice, while it's already a known challenge to create compelling narratives in games that allow the player freedom to openly explore the world, so we will be on our own pioneering this combination of elements. While we've had experience creating small games with this world structure before, performing this task with a larger scale project will test the games content and systems to their limits.\n\nIt is also apparent that Vernal Edge will be a high scope project. with detailed environments and even more detailed character animations. We know that over the time of development life can always strike with setbacks and dilemmas, but we are experienced developers and confident we can manage any unexpected events and bring the game to you in a timely manner.\n\nWe believe Vernal Edge is special, and we will do whatever it takes to see it complete. Your encouragement and support have been extremely special to us, and we promise that the game only gets better from here.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental

Also, in the days following the murder of George Floyd, during the height of discussion on social media, attention was rightfully on larger issues than funding a game on kickstarter. Certainly, we\u2019re happy that people are paying attention to these issues and that they were using their money to donate to relevant charities, but it did put a halt to our funding for a few days; so we have a bit of catching up to do! If you can, please donate or share us around. It will help a ton during this final stretch!\n\nTo everyone who\u2019s backed us, we\u2019re extremely thankful.

They are made for out of the box play, and are perfect to pull out on any occasion.\nLittlebox games are easy to learn and quick to play. Each RPG is a heartfelt, collaborative experience, designed to deliver impactful play in just a few hours. There is no game master, and players tell the story together. It\u2019s different every time!\nEach game comes in a reinforced tarot sized tuckbox (7 x 12 cm), that you can easily throw in your bag and take anywhere. And with dry erasable markers, you can play again and again!\nThis Kickstarter features the first two games in the series:\nVillagesong, a game of leadership and change\nOur Mundane Supernatural Life, a cozy game of extraordinary daily living\nLead your village to strength or ruin, or help your werewolf flatmate face their first full moon, all in a single session. Create characters you care about, and then explore their stories of love, hope, and revenge in just a few hours.\nEmpty the box and find all the components you need to play. No preparation or printing needed, just open the rulebook and get started. Perfect for taking anywhere. Play your first game or teach a friend!\nPlayers work together to tell the story with the help of the cards. Close relationships form the heart of both games. Village bonds are forged and broken, an extraordinary day comes to an end \u2013 how have you changed?\nVillagesong is a fantastical RPG about communities, leadership, and change, inspired by tales from ancient Java. Your decisions will determine the future of your village and the island. What will you sacrifice, and what will you hold dear?\nAs we have reached our stretch goal, we'll expand Villagesong to include solo and two player rules, so you can enjoy the game with any number of players. We'll provide these rules as a PDF you can read on your phone, with no printing or prep required.\nYou play a village leader, responsible for the wellbeing and future of your home.\nAs the game progresses, you will make tough decisions that change your village, and the entire island. Choice by choice, you will shape the song of your village, sung for many years to come.\nDecide the future of your village\nThe tides of change wash over your island. During your turn, you will draw a change card, and reveal a new pressure facing your village.\nEager merchants look for a place to trade. The envoys of the great kingdom arrive in your village. The fanged demon queen offers an elixir of great power.\nDecide, do you accept their offer and take change into your own hands? Or do you resist their influence and send them onwards to another village?\nOnce you\u2019ve made your choice, explore the impact of the change on the villages.\nBonds are forged and broken\nYour village cannot stand alone. It is connected to those that surround it \u2013 by the flowing river or the mountain pass, but also by the bonds of blood or friendship that tie the leaders together.\nBut what is best for your village may not be best for those around you. If the trust between leaders is broken, the bond between your villages breaks too, leaving you to perilously make amends, or face the future alone.\nHow will you be remembered?\nAs you make decisions during the game, change cards are tucked beneath your village, leaving a chronicle of your time as leader. Your villagesong, a melody of life, handed onward for generations to come.\nMuch of Villagesong is inspired by tales from ancient Java. With your help, we will be able to dive further into history and myth, and bring these stories to life in the best way possible. The materials pictured above are not final \u2013 we\u2019re continuing to improve the game as we learn more about ancient Java and how to represent it.\nOur Mundane Supernatural Life is a cozy two player RPG that explores the everyday life of a supernatural person and their loved one. It\u2019s a game about the difficulties of going grocery shopping when you\u2019re partly ethereal, or the importance of finding good child care every full moon.\nSpend an extraordinary day unlike any other.\nYou and your friend play a supernatural person and their loved one. In this game, you will play through a single day of your life together. But life always comes with its problems. Face supernatural and mundane troubles as your day unfolds. \nPlan your day\nPlan your day by writing your daily activities on the cards, and then placing these in chronological order. What's happening today?\nPlay your day \nPlay through a scene for each activity in your day:\nSet the timer: Each scene takes a randomised length, to highlight glimpses of the mundane and the supernatural as your day plays through.\nCheck for a symbol: Turn over the card and check for a symbol to see if the activity goes smoothly, brings you closer, or creates trouble in your day.\nPlay the scene: Play through the scene until the timer runs out! Jump in to play secondary characters as needed. \nWe released a free version of Our Mundane Supernatural Life in 2018. When we heard how much people enjoyed the game, we decided to make a revised and expanded edition. \nGive the game a try! Get the original 2018 version free below:\nThe Littlebox Edition features:\nMulti-day play mode: Play out your mundane supernatural life over three days, instead of one. Roll 1d4 for that element of your day you just can\u2019t control \u2013 the weather!\nTwo new scene symbols: Hearts (\u2661) are scenes of connection between yourself and your loved one, while stars (\u2606) are moments of realisation or awareness about your own life. These new symbols are designed to be used with the multi-day play mode, but can also be used with the standard game.\nTime tokens: Two tokens that allow you to take control of the length of a scene \u2013 but only if you blurt something out!\nWe are not using a pledge manager for this campaign.

Check out our Steam page and add us to your wishlist to get notified upon release! \nWeaving Tides is a charming singleplayer adventure set in a world of magic and textile. Ride on the backs of carpet dragons and explore a stunning textile landscape, as you soar above and dive below the weave.\nCall your Weaver and set out on a journey to explore ancient dungeons, solve puzzles, challenge quirky creatures and unravel the great mysteries of a long forgotten past!\nDive into an enchanting, woven world and reveal secret pathways.\n Stitch and cut your way through the textile landscape and wrap up your foes using your Weaver's unique stitching abilities.\nSolve tricky textile puzzles which are scattered across the world.\nConquer Zelda-like dungeons but beware of their fearsome guardians!\nBefriend three different Weavers, choose the one that fits your playstyle.\nOutfit your Weavers with mystic embroideries to enhance their abilities.\nUncover hidden mysteries packed in a charming story.\nPrologue Download\nWeaving Tides will be available in seven languages: English, German, Russian, French, Spanish, Japanese and Simplified Chinese.  \nWe will also keep our ears open to your requests. If there is enough  interest we will do our best to translate Weaving Tides to even more  languages.\nSome of our biggest influences: The Legend of Zelda Series, Bastion & Tearaway\nWeaving Tides is influenced by a cluster of our combined interests and the things we love, but among our greatest inspirations are the Legend of Zelda series, Bastion and Tearaway. Our takeaways from these games are:\nAn epic adventure filled with challenges like in the Legend of Zelda  \nA beautifully crafted story and lush, vivid environments like in Bastion \nCreative Puzzles and witty interactions with your surroundings like in Tearaway \nAll of the mechanics in Weaving Tides are inspired by textile crafting techniques. The Weaver dragon you ride has a \u201cribbon tail\u201d that flows behind it as you fly. It serves a variety of purposes and is the key to completing the challenges of the woven world.\nUsing the Weaver's ribbon allows you to complete magical stitching patterns, pull down hovering chests, drag heavy rugs, pull open curtains and more. \nSometimes the solution lies hidden somewhere close by, other times you will have to explore the mechanics of the puzzle further in order to solve it. Use your imagination and puzzle-solving skills to overcome these challenges and advance on your journey.\nThe world is filled with secrets and optional puzzles. Find them and your curiosity will be rewarded with new clues revealing the mysteries of the world or useful new items.\nWhile the primary focus of Weaving Tides lies in the narrative, as well as puzzles and exploration, it also offers laid-back, fun combat mechanics. \n Every enemy will require you to adopt a different strategy in order to defeat it.   \n While, for example, the Toothy Yappers have to be flipped onto their backs by resurfacing right beneath them or dashing through them\u2026 \n  ...the moles have to be pulled out of their dens before you can stitch or dash them.\nThe combat in Weaving Tides is challenging, but not overwhelming.  If it turns out to be too easy for you, you will be delighted by the various opt-in modifiers in forms of items which will toughen up your foes.  \nOnce you\u2019ve mastered these skills, explore dungeons to put them to the test! We have three dungeons waiting for you: a forgotten desert temple, a mind tangling forest maze and a dangerous lair which has yet to be unveiled!\nAnd of course at the end of each dungeon a boss is waiting for you! \nExperience a sprawling, strange new world full of adventure and secrets. In this world Tass seems to be the only one of his kind - a human. Accompanied by his foster dad Kilim he sets out to solve the mysteries of his past. But the world he calls home is changing in dark, unexpected ways, and a force that once lay dormant beneath the weave is awakening. \n Weaving Tides is a tale about finding a sense of belonging. The story is told in a light-hearted way sprinkled with charming characters and witty puns, but at its core it is a rich and emotional narrative about family, identity and the blurred lines of morality.\n Travel across the four unique layers of the woven world. Each layer has it\u2019s own culture, aesthetic, puzzles and dangers. This strange world is inhabited by intelligent beings called \"the Mothkin\", moth people with human-like features and a predominantly friendly nature. \nExplore the sun-drenched dunes of the Silken Desert, home to small nomadic villages such as your hometown, Veteri.\nLush, dense & dangerous, the Spun Forests are home to the tribal Mothkin who are strict believers of the great mother Dea.\nThe Mothkin empire is a stronghold of trade and culture. Blessed by a moderate climate the Mothkin of the empire express their love for their land by growing beautiful, well-trimmed gardens.\nSome speak of barren landscapes ravaged by relentless storms and hidden deep beneath the lustrous cities of the empire. Unknown things lurk down there; all we know for certain is they mean us no good.\nThe Weavers are the guardians of the woven world. Even though most Weavers are loners, three of them will join you in your quest and will invite you to ride on their backs. \nEach one of the Weavers behaves slightly different. While Twill has a higher movement speed, Luce can take more hits, for example - but their greatest difference lies in their special stitching abilities. It is up to you to use the Weaver best suited to your current situation, or you could just use whichever Weaver you like best!\nKilim's special move allows him to cover a wide area, perfect for patching up large rips and slowing down groups of enemies.\nTwill spits her ribbon in a straight line and can therefore precisely remove single threats without having to move into dangerous zones herself. \nWhen Luce\u2019s special move is unleashed he rushes forward, stitching and cutting everything in his path. Great for breaking through walls of enemies; not so great at avoiding painful obstacles. \nAlthough you will find some items by simply exploring the world and uncovering secret areas, some of the most sought after ones can only be bought from Salis the flying merchant.  \nYou gain Thread Essence by patching up tears in the world and by unsealing chests. Use the essence to buy magical embroidered patches which will greatly help you on your journey.\nA small selection of the magical emroideries you will find on your journey.\nSome of the items will be opt-in modifiers for folks that want an extra challenge: to give the enemies, say, more health in exchange for larger rewards. \n Sometimes a Mothkin will entrust you with a letter to a loved one, other times you might find a ripped scroll of parchment stuck between the branches of a terry-tree. Collect these writings if you wish to delve deeper into the lore and mysteries of the woven world.\nCapable explorers will find ways to reach even the most remote areas of the woven world. There you will find enchanted ribbons which can be used exclusively in Playground mode. Collect them all to create a stunning masterpiece of digital embroidery!\nWeaving Tides' Playgrounds mode invites you to create your own digital artwork. In this mode you can choose from a variety of ribbons, including those you unlocked in Adventure mode. There are also some helpful special features:\ndifferent camera positions allow perfect framing for your fancywork\nyou can toggle the cutting functionality of the dash ability on or off\nload in custom transparent background images to trace with your stitches\ntake a snapshot of your finished work by using the built-in camera\n The only limit is your imagination! Combine different ribbon styles to create mesmerizing patterns or pay tribute to your favorite game characters by reimagining them through weave. \nThese are just a few of the main characters and along your journey you will receive the help of a wide range of peculiar allies.\nWeaving Tides\u2019 evocative musical score, sound effects and overall audio will be handled by our talented composers Timo Jagersberger & Frank Schlick. Time and time again they have put us in awe with their rich and emotional music, but describing it with words won\u2019t do it justice so we will let these tracks speak for themselves: \nWhat is an Add-on?\nYou can customise your Reward Tier by choosing items to add and increasing your initial pledge by the necessary amount.\nHow do add-ons work?\nPress the \"Manage your pledge\" button on the very top of this page.\n  Shipping is already included in the add-on prices.

Prior to this project we made NIVA, a game where you play as a mighty forest god that can grow or wither plants. We also worked on a bunch of smaller projects, but Weaving Tides is our most ambitious project to date.\nThanks to the Kickstarter community creative, niche projects like this can exist. Weaving Tides began as a small idea about exploring a woven world but as development went forward the project grew and so did our passion for it. \nWe want to make Weaving Tides a game that you will love as much as we do and that is why we want to involve you in the process of bringing it to life! We\u2019re going to be especially interested in your ideas and feedback on:\nProgression & Balancing\nNew items\nPuzzle design\nWeaving Tides has been in development for almost two years now. We have come all this way thanks to our close circle of friends, the support we received from the Vienna Business Agency as well as our own funds and efforts, but for this final spurt we need your help. The funds from Kickstarter will enable us to pour even more polish and love into the game and make Weaving Tides what we know it can be.\n  This is how funds will roughly be split up:\nAfter Kickstarter fees, taxes and fulfilling the Kickstarter rewards all funds will go directly towards the development costs of Weaving Tides, localization as well as paying our composers to whip up even more amazing tracks. \nAbout 75% of the game is done. The core of the game is fully finished and all levels except the ending are fully playable. What remains is a lot of gameplay polish, more art assets, scriptwriting for minor characters and bug squashing. We are therefore confident that we will be able to deliver Weaving Tides in late autumn 2020.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been developing Weaving Tides for more than two years. Most of the difficult work is done and throughout our past five years of working together as a tight-knit team we have learned how to tackle even the most daunting tasks. We give our estimates a lot of thought and factor in technical hurdles as well as polishing, therefore we are confident with the timeline we have laid out. \nOf course no one can predict the future and there is always a chance of unexpected problems to occur which will potentionally delay the project. However even if such a case arises we will finish Weaving Tides without compromise. \nMaking Weaving Tides the best it can be is our main priority and we will always keep you in the loop about the current status of the project.

It's Free, featuring over 20 spells, and the entire Day 1 from the final game! Available for Windows and Mac. \nA young girl named Vasilisa, destined to become a witch, decides to throw her fate away and marry her beloved - but that dream is shattered when her betrothed dies under mysterious circumstances. \nAching for her lost love, Vasilisa seeks out Black Book - a demonic artifact, said to be powerful enough to grant any wish to the one who uncovers all 7 of its seals.\nStep into the shoes of a devil-fighting sorceress, and travel the province of Cherdyn to unseal the Black Book - and solve the plights of people in need.\nThe game takes place in a setting unlike any other - a 19th century countryside, where Slavic myth neighbors reality.\nFantastical creatures, elemental spirits and demons exist alongside ordinary folk. Some of them are evil, some are not. Yet, only a select few are able to perceive, let alone communicate with the otherworldly beings. \nVodyanoy - a male water spirit\nBlack Book features a wide variety of mythological creatures: from some that you may recognize, like Chorts and Drowners - to other, more obscure ones.\nWe took extra effort to achieve authenticity in our portrayal of these creatures - using old texts of classical myths, illustrations from folk tale books, and every other source we could find as reference. \nLeft: Vasilisa the Beautiful, 1899 by Ivan Bilibin\nBlack Book is a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the world of Northern Slavic mythology, shaped by its history and tradition. The game was developed by the people who grew up with these folk tales, and consulted with historians and anthropologists to make sure the game\u2019s narrative accurately represents the beliefs of their ancestors.\nEvery Chapter's main goal is for Vasilisa to unlock a Seal of the Black Book - and to do so, she will have to challenge the mysteries of the otherworld.\nBattle demons and other mythological beings, help ordinary townsfolk with their troubles, and solve the mystery of the all-powerful Black Book! \nBattle otherworldly forces using a unique card-based combat system. Each turn, Vasilisa has to compose a spell by putting together multiple cards - each with their own special effect. \nSome cards work better together - so be sure to create a perfect combo for maximum damage!\nThroughout the game, you'll always be adding new cards to your arsenal. There are multiple ways to obtain new cards - from buying them at the shop and getting them as rewards for quest completion, to getting them as drops from enemy encounters.\nCollect different cards and build decks that fit specific situations! \nOn her journey, Vasilisa will meet some people (and not just people), who wish to aid her in her cause - each with their unique backstory and ability, that will definitely be helpful in battle. \nTo grow stronger, Vasilisa sometimes relies on the aid of Demons, whom she sends out to do her bidding. Recruit demons, and pick out ones with the right abilities to get the job done properly.      \nIn Black Book, we do our best to emphasize the dark atmosphere of mythological stories with the help of music and sound effects. In the game we combine electronic music and folk musical instruments. We studied authentic recordings of folk songs - some tunes were recorded hundreds of years ago, and will now be reborn in our game.\nMikhail Shvachko is the composer of the game, breathing life into the world of Black Book with his music. Previously, he did the music for our previous game, The Mooseman - which can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/mikhail-shvachko/sets/themoosemanost\nIf you want to get a taste of what to expect when it comes to the unique sound of Black Book, you can find some of his latest work here: \nAside from Mikhail's work, in Black Book you'll hear live choral music, performed by the student choir of the Perm Regional College of Arts and Culture.\nIn Black Book, you'll unlock new songs as you explore additional locations and do side quests. You will be able to listen to them in a special section in the game menu.\nThanks to reaching the first stretch goal we\u2019ll be doing an english voice over for Black Book \u2014 this was made possible through the support of each backer! \nHere\u2019s the list of voice-over actors we confirmed: \n Sarah Anne Williams as Vasilisa (Jinx \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, Chihaya Mifune \u201cPersona 5\u201d)\n Kyle Hebert as Egor (Ryu \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d, Kamina \u201cGurren Lagann\u201d)\n Daman Mills as Nikolai (Frieza \u201cDragon Ball Super\u201d, Kai \u201cBeastars\u201d) \n Ben Diskin as Proshka (Mega Man \u201cMega Man 11\u201d, Aida \u201cBeastars\u201d)\nIf you feel like helping us grow the community around Black Book, we\u2019ll be happy to reveal some content as milestones are reached. Join us on Discord to enjoy content reveals!\nBlack Book supporters, who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers, will see themselves in the game - or help us design unique in-game content!\nThroughout the world of Black Book, multiple gravestones will be scattered. These are not your regular gravestones - these are a token of our eternal gratitude, in remembrance of those who pitched in to make our dream game a reality!\nEveryone's name from Adept pledge (or limited Backer Relief Plus) and forward will be immortalized in the game in those gravestones, so don't miss out on the exclusive chance to find yourself among the beautiful backdrops of Cherdyn!\nOne of the core features of the game that we're really proud of is the unique visual style of the Black Book. That includes every visual aspect: the locations, character and enemy models and animation, and last, but not least - the character portraits!\nIncluded in the Occultist pledge, you'll get the chance to see your own appearance, drawn in Black Book's artstyle, in the game itself! The development team will contact you and ask for a photo, which the artist will use to commission a portrait (which is also available on its own in the Herald pledge) - and then we'll pick out a place to include it in the world of the game!\nThe entire Black Book's combat system revolves around cards. Each card has a unique property - and if combined with others in the right way, can deal massive damage to the unholy creatures that roam the land. With the Hexer pledge, you'll get to design the look, name and in-game properties of a combat card that Vasilisa will use in her demonic encounters. Still, remember - setting and game balance restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over cards included in the final game. \nThroughout her journey, Vasilisa will find herself in many uncommon situations - from solving domestic disputes to confronting demonic creatures, who are known to terrorize human folk. Black Book will be filled with lots of unique in-game events - and with the Sorcerer pledge, we'll include your own scenario in the game as well!\nLater on in the development cycle we will contact you, and ask you to submit a short scenario - which we will then discuss and edit with you, and include it in the main game. But please keep in mind that setting restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over the events included in the game.\nWant to leave a bigger impact on the events transpiring in Black Book? Then the Warlock pledge is the way to go!\nA side-quest consists of several in-game events, usually ranging from two to three - and tell a bigger, more developed story. As with the previous reward, we'll contact you later on, and after edits and approval from the development team, we will include an entire side-quest of your making in the final product! Be warned, setting restrictions still apply, and the development team still has the final say over in-game content of this calibre.    \nAfter finishing our latest project, The Mooseman, we\u2019ve wanted to return to the idea of making a game based on Slavic mythos - but this time, something much bigger in scale.\nWe\u2019ve been working on Black Book for quite some time. During that time, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot - from refining the game\u2019s visual style and character design, to writing the story and developing the proper combat system.. The result of our work so far can be seen in the demo - but there\u2019s still a lot left to be done until the game is ready for release.\nWith the extra budget acquired from Kickstarter backers, we aim to add many new features to the game: some of them planned, but scrapped due to time and money constraints, and others completely new.\nAside from gathering the funding required for development, crowdfunding would allow us to directly engage with the gamers all across the world - and, with their help and feedback, make The Black Book the best game it could be.\nWe're aware that the current gaming landscape is about to undergo major changes. With that in mind, we want to make sure that Black Book will be available on PC, as well as current and future consoles - so that all of our audience gets to enjoy the game, no matter what their main gaming destination is.\nWe intend on supporting all current generation platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch. \nOne of Black Book's core features is its rich, text-based narrative - and we believe that we owe it to the players to make sure this narrative is to you in full. We are already working with a professional editor, making sure that the English version of the game meets the high standards that our audience has. And currently, we expect the game to be available in the following languages upon release:\nMorteshka - The Developer\nOur projects are mythology and ethnic-based with the narrative and worlds supported by historical facts and folklore. Our first project, The Mooseman, was released in 2017 on Steam, and in 2018 on AppStore, Google Play, and modern consoles.\nThe name of the studio comes from wordplay of \"Mort\", which is French for \"dead\" and Komi for \"a man\", and \"Matryoshka\", the famous Russian doll.\nHypeTrain Digital - The Publisher\nBlack Book is being published by HypeTrain Digital, an indie game publisher for PC and consoles. They provide initial funding for developing the game and porting it to consoles and helping us with the Kickstarter campaign.\nHypeTrain Digital work side by side with independent teams to successfully ship their masterpieces to a worldwide audience. Their titles include: The Wild Eight, Stoneshard, DESOLATE, Police Stories, 12 is Better Than 6.\n-\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Mooseman was our first project as a team - and during its development, we learned a lot about what it takes to make a game from start to finish. While we are confident in our ability to deliver the game on time, Black Book is a project of a bigger scale, compared to Mooseman - and so, there is a chance that the release date would be changed further down the line. \n\nHowever, as we've said before \u2014 making Black Book as great as it can be is our priority number one. Throughout development, we will keep you informed about all updates and issues. \n\nWe thank you for your faith and support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Follower", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["78 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Reader", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["2,173 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Wanderer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["574 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Loyalist", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["514 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["223 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Adept", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits -

It is the first time I am developing a game, so all of this is a very exciting process for me.\nThe release is planned for 2021 and I am developing the game with UNITY for PC/MAC at the moment, but I think it would be awesome to see Cleo on the Playstation, Xbox and Switch in the future.\nThe main focus of the game will be the story, which is split into 4 chapters:   \nEach chapter will take about 1-2 hours (main-quest) to finish.\n\"What is the most important part of a story?\"\nCleo is a 14-year-old cynical girl, living a repetitive life with her father in a bar. She knows everything about the epic adventures of pirate legend Captain Cabeca, but in her everyday life, she is just surrounded by boring fishermen and unsuccessful pirates, hanging around at the counter. \nBut when Cleo finds a strange pirate-logbook and sees a ghost, who gives her mysterious hints, her boring life is about to get turned upside down. She is thrown into a dangerous adventure and finds herself in a world of lies, deceive, greed and bad breath - the world of pirates - and most of them are after the same thing:\nTHE TREASURE OF ETERNAL MEMORY.\nMy name is Chris. I am a self-employed media designer from Germany. And since I was a kid, I loved movies and games that tell good stories. I especially loved weird adventure game stories, like Sam & Max, Day Of The Tentacle, Monkey Island 1 & 2 ( and I vividly remember getting and playing Monkey Island 3 on Christmas 1997 - when I was 9 years old). I think it's a great thing, that game development has become more and more affordable and accessible, because of free game engines and the possibility to self publish online. Today we have lots of great indie games and developers out there and I think that is awesome! I am really looking forward to the future of indie gaming.\nIt is so much fun working on this project and I just love seeing the world, that I imagined coming to life piece by piece. But of course, all of this is very time-consuming. This is why I decided to make this Kickstarter campaign. I want to see how much interest is out there for this game and it would be awesome to build a financial buffer to be able to work on this project full time for one year. \n After I paid off the golden jacuzzi for my west wing balcony, the money will be used for the following purposes:\nfinal design may slightly vary\nfinal design may slightly vary\nfinal design may slightly vary\nfinal design may slightly vary\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course any project carries some form of risk. The truth is: I am a self-taught game developer, \u201cCleo\u201d is my very first game and I am working on this project alone. There is always a chance of unexpected problems to occur, which will potentially delay the project.\n\nBut, since I am working on \u201cCleo\u201d alone, I am 100% behind this project and will do my very best to make sure, it will be a game I can be proud of, when it is finished.\n\nFor almost 10 years now, I am self-employed as a media designer, so I know how to work self organized. I will keep you in the loop about the developing process of the game in a monthly update. Those updates will be honest and realistic all the time, so you will always be informed about the current status of \u201cCleo\u201d.\n\nThank you very much for placing your trust in me.

We're overwhelmed by our backers' support and decided to sweeten the deal for some of our reward tiers by including some new stuff - no extra charge, completely free (including for everyone who has already bought these tiers)!\nALL TIERS FROM $150 AND ABOVE (STARTING FROM THE SENIOR DETECTIVE TIER) WILL NOW INCLUDE A NEW REWARD:\nThere was an urgency in his voice. He said he was fine, but his nervous tone gave me an inkling that he was in danger...\nAND BECAUSE OF POPULAR DEMAND, OUR SOLD-OUT TIER, TALKING SUPER SLEUTH, IS BACK IN THE FORM OF A NEW TIER: LOQUACIOUS SUPER SLEUTH! THIS TIER, ALONG WITH ALL HIGHER SUCCEEDING TIERS, WILL ALSO INCLUDE A NEW REWARD:\nDubai, Mexico City, Jakarta... the souvenir magnets on her refrigerator hinted at a life well travelled. I wonder where she disappeared to this time...\nWe can't update the descriptions of the old reward tiers, but rest assured it'll be part of the respective tiers. Please check out the FAQ for more info.\nJust some of the news and content outlets that have covered Chinatown Detective Agency.\nThe world is in flux, as the global economy nears the nadir of its decade-long collapse\nSingapore stands as a last refuge of order but even here the government struggles on the brink of chaos. Private detectives are now the first call for those citizens able to afford a semblance of justice.\nAmira Darma, the game's protagonist, is no thug. But she's no pushover either...\nThat\u2019s where you come in. You are Amira Darma, once a rising star at INTERPOL, now a freshly minted Private Investigator in the heart of Chinatown, and your first client is about to walk through your door...\nOld mentors make great first customers.\nFrom the studio behind indie game Terroir, Chinatown Detective Agency is a cybernoir point and click adventure blending stunning retro design with innovative mechanics. Manage your agency and use real world research to solve cases as you unravel a global conspiracy.\nInspired by the classic Carmen Sandiego games of the 80s and 90s, Chinatown Detective Agency is a mystery adventure game that will take you across Singapore and the world in hot pursuit of criminals, witnesses and clues. Solve puzzles and uncover leads using real research and investigation, and manage your time and money to solve cases from clients both well-intentioned and nefarious.\nAlong the way, untangle a web of conspiracies and plots that threaten to push the Lion City over the edge.\nUnravel a global conspiracy\nExplore a rich cybernoir future of mystery and intrigue in a world inspired by Blade Runner, The Da Vinci Code and Black Mirror. Travel the globe from your base in Singapore in search of leads, and talk with dozens of uniquely voiced characters each with their own mysterious agendas. \nSometimes, the clues hide in plain sight.\nNot every door is open to Amira. But that's nothing a little hacking can't solve.\nA story with multiple outcomes depending on which client you decide to help\nNothing\u2019s ever simple in Singapore. What starts as a routine recon job might be the spark that ignites this whole city. Your choices matter: do you side with the shadowy underworld informant, or root out corruption for a junior politician? In Chinatown Detective Agency, the cases you choose will tell a story all their own, for better...or for worse.\nAs a private detective, Amira will need to be ready for any situation - including potentially dangerous ones.\nReal-world research\nLeads and clues are the lifeblood of the detective. In Chinatown Detective Agency, each piece of evidence affects the outcome of your cases, and many puzzles require real investigation through internet research, code breaking and more.\nResearch. Decipher. Uncover truths. Rinse and repeat.\nAlthough most of the main quest can be finished entirely in-game, if you want to earn your stripes, you\u2019ll have to dig a little deeper. Solving side quests will require genuine investigation, from googling clues, checking an encyclopedia or scouring a map, meaning you\u2019re not just playing an investigator, you\u2019ll have to become one yourself. \n Work smart (and never skip a meal) \nFor a P.I., time is a precious resource. The daily grind of the working Joe is a one-way ticket to fatigue, and tasks have a funny way of taking longer as you tire. It's up to you to make good use of the time you have and to keep your agency, and yourself, alive.\nIf Amira forgets to take a break, her energy and focus is going to crash. Luckily, there\u2019s the Endurance meter to help you keep tabs. Go too long without food or rest and watch as everything grinds to a halt, quick as a case without leads.\nEndurance plays an important role in how well Amira can perform her duties.\nReplenish yourself by travelling to the city's best hawkers for a delicious local dish, but remember that nothing in this town is free - some items can turn a budding new detective into a down-on-their-luck bum in the space of a meal.\nRestoring Endurance with a hearty local dish is all part of the game.\nAssemble a team\nYou\u2019re new to the P.I. game, but over time you\u2019re bound to make contacts, build a network, maybe even hire some staff. Part of owning your very own private detective agency is having the right kind of support on deck, whether it's an admin assistant to help organise your bills for you and run the office while you're away, or an eager young researcher trying to make a name for themselves.\nYou never know who you'll meet in Chinatown Detective Agency, so keep an eye out for potentially useful characters.\nChasing down leads and gathering up evidence may pay the bills, but Amira\u2019s not just a detective: she\u2019s a businesswoman. You\u2019ll need to keep your staff happy, and the office running smoothly.\nLose yourself in the future\nNeon lamp-light reflected in pools of rainwater. Anti-government graffiti daubed across aging subways. The encroaching murk of riverside London. Explore 30 stunningly rendered tableaus from artist Ricardo Juchem and immerse yourself in the chaotic future of 2032.\nFollowing leads will take you deep into the underbelly of future Singapore.\nThe game will feature over 30 locations across Singapore and around the world. Travelling is a fundamental part of any detective\u2019s toolkit, so you'll be taking Amira to different cities and locations worldwide.\nIn Singapore itself, you'll travel to various places inspired by real world locations.\nSingapore's Chinatown\nThe historic Civic District of Singapore\nThe side streets of Geylang\nEach main location may have a number of sub-locations within, meaning more people and objects for Amira to investigate.\nThe locations in the game will come alive with NPCs, both human and factory-assembled.\nAmira\u2019s no slouch, but even Singapore can be a big place when you're traveling on foot. Getting around efficiently will mean taking the extensive MRT train system that crisscrosses the island.\nTravel across the island through the rapidly deteriorating but still-functioning MRT system of Singapore.\nMissions will also take you to different locales in every continent around the world. Luckily, the game's HORUS flight booking system is there to make grabbing that last minute red-eye as easy as falling out of bed.\nChinatown Detective Agency is a globe-trotting adventure - and you can't globe-trot without booking your flight tickets. Just keep in mind flights cost money, so make sure you double check your leads to avoid wasted flights.\nInspired by the classic Carmen Sandiego games, you'll be traveling the world as you pursue one lead after another.\nThe blinding lights of Dotonbori, Osaka\nDrones fly past Galata Tower in Istanbul at sundown\nThe Petronas Towers shine like a beacon above downtown Kuala Lumpur\nThe encroaching darkness is kept at bay by the faint light of makeshift bonfires in riverside London\nLike the locations in Singapore, these cities will have sub-locations that Amira can visit in pursuit of a breakthrough in her cases. The cities we'll be featuring in the game include: London, Osaka, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Toronto, Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro, Dubai, Mexico City, Ho Chi Minh City, Kigali, Athens, Hong Kong, Perth (Australia), Manila, Cairo, Seattle, Busan, Lima, Paris, New Delhi and Jakarta.\nChinatown Detective Agency is a narrative-driven game - and that narrative is anchored in a diverse cast of colourful characters. \nMany of the game's important characters are voiced acted, mostly by voice artists from Singapore in order to preserve the nuances of Singapore's own brand of colloquial English (Singlish) and local slang. But the main reason we opted to voice the dialogue is to convey the tension and drama of the story. Here's a sample of an exchange between protagonist, Amira, and one of her most important clients, Rupert Zhou:\nThe whine of a lonely synth. The pulse of an electronic bass line. Music plays a crucial role in establishing the atmosphere of Chinatown Detective Agency.\nWe looked to some of the greatest composers in film for inspiration, with a focus on those who have scored suspense, thriller, mystery and detective movies. Perhaps the most influential were Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, especially their work on The Social Network and Gone Girl. Other influences include the soundtrack of cult classic Twin Peaks, as well as those songs from the 80s that evoke (at least to Mark when he was writing the game's backstory) an image of Tokyo or Hong Kong caught in the lingering glow of neon lights - \"In The Air Tonight\" by Phil Collins, \"Live to Tell\" by Madonna, as well as basically anything by Foreigner.\nThe game's soundtrack is being composed and produced by two different musicians: Sean Kolton and Dmitrii Muchkin. Working independently, Sean creates the more contemplative and ambient tracks used during gameplay, while Dmitrii is working on the upbeat and dynamic tracks that you'll hear in the main menu and transition scenes.\nWe've a selection of varied and rewarding tiers for our backers.\nLet\u2019s be honest: we want to make sure a majority of our funding goes straight to the development of the game. To this end we\u2019ve limited our physical rewards to just a couple of items. But because we also want to give our Kickstarter backers the exclusive opportunity to have a hand in the development of the game, we've got something even better,  the ability to add a city of your choice in the game - or you could even be one of the three backers who'll help write a mission in the game!\nI got to the drop-off early. No sense waiting around.\nThere's...something familiar about this place...\nHey...what's that sound?\nI never was one for art, but I liked what I saw.\nTake this...I'll call you when it's safe.\nSingapore is a fine city. Specially for those who keep a mountain of overdue library books at home...\nThe card was blank...or so I thought.\nThe Triad wore black, you wore white.\nThese pages have a clue on them... someone wants to be found.\nJust try not to make a scene.\nCareful... these walls have ears.\nI was going nowhere fast, I needed a change of pace.\nAs soon as I saw it I knew: this case was the real deal.\nYou can help bring the game to life by buying one of our available tiers, each with different rewards. Some of them are limited in number, so if you like what you, go and grab it! \nGeneral Interactive Co. is an indie game dev collective consisting mainly of Creative Director, Mark Fillon and Lead Programmer, Jenny Hide.

Sean composes the more contemplative, analog, Twin Peaks-inspired tracks, while Dmitrii does the more electro-ambient stuff.\nDmitrii Muchkin, Composer\nMarvin Paule is a programmer that focuses on the game's U.I. mechanics, as well as the team's QA specialist (our official bug hunter, if you will).\nRaf Banzuela is General Interactive Co.'s branding and 2D asset artist.

Charlene, formerly of SEGA Europe, has been helping indie devs build their audience and image for over 5 years.\nHow are we using the funds?\nMost of the base game has already been created, and a majority of the funds will go towards producing and developing more content. By content, we mean things like new character locations and environments, new case missions, new characters, more animations, more voice acting -- basically things that make the game richer, more vibrant and have more play-time. Here is a basic breakdown of where the funds will go if we are successful:\nMore than half will be allocated to programming and art (which includes animation), as these are the essential to content creation, while the next largest share goes to music, audio and voice acting, to give the game a more immersive feel. The rest goes towards marketing the game and the fulfillment of backer rewards.\nThese allocations aren't set in stone - if there's one thing we learned from doing this before, it's that situations change as the development of the game progresses and new challenges are uncovered (including taking into consideration player and fan feedback - something we try our best to incorporate into our decision making). ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done our best to make sure our rewards can be created and fulfilled for our backers as easily as possible. We've limited our physical rewards, and instead, have offered rewards that allow backers to be part of the game and its development. We are committed to the quality of the game, and if successful, the campaign will give us runway for the remainder of the year - which should be enough time to complete the game.\n\nHaving said that, this doesn't account for unforeseeable events that can and will affect any project - changing team members, quality assurance and testing, issues arising from Unity and the other platforms we depend on and, most of all, the global uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. None of these challenges and risks are unique to us. We prepare for them by keeping the game's scope focused, and having a network of professionals and freelancers available to fill in gaps that my come up during development.\n\nAs a single player game with a semi-linear story, we're confident we can deliver on the game. However, should there be delays, this will affect our release date - and you will be informed beforehand.

Will you find all of them?\nThroughout the campaign we will update the demo with more content, stay tuned!\nIn addition, at your request again, we expanded the rewards tier with new options to actively participate in the development of 'Aeterna Noctis' hand in hand with our team ...\nARE YOU GOING TO MISS IT?!\nNeither too much nor too little. The sense of stretching goals.\nWe want to be transparent with you, because we choose a stretching goal philosophy. We dont want the game to be incomplete or have useless characteristics that would inflate the goals. We firmly believe that the goals that we will propose if we manage to reach the first are essential to make 'Aeterna Noctis' a complete game.\nSteady... ready...  We reveal to you one of the songs from the \"Piano Collections\" version of the OST!\nHere is exclusively the main theme of 'Aeterna Noctis' is its most special version ... Piano Collections.\n Help us achieve the goal and make this dream come true!\n\nThis project will not cease to amaze you, so we need your support. We reveal only a tiny detail of the many that we have in store for you... enjoy it!.\nFollowing the footsteps of the genre's great titles, 'Aeterna Noctis' aims to unite the best of each through a reinvented gameplay packed with original skills and mechanics. At the controls of the 'King of Darkness' you must regain your power exploring the vast lands of the dark and beautiful world of 'Aeterna' anchored between life and death. The intense action of fast and skillful combat together with truly challenging mechanics will join an exciting and deep story in this adventure made frame by frame using traditional 2D animation.\nComing to PC and consoles in late 2021\n'Aeterna Noctis' aims to merge the best combat mechanics with tight platform puzzles through extremely polished and designed gameplay capable of satisfying the most demanding player.\n Mechanics and challenging difficulty: The basis of our development has always revolved around this premise. 'Aeterna Noctis' is a game with an affordable but challenging difficulty from the first level, which increases progressively as the player gains experience in the controls and unlocks new skills, always keeping you alert but making you feel proud at each challenge completed .\n Clean and fluid gameplay: The gaming experience is another of our pillars. The gameplay has been designed and polished until achieving a system that responds to 100% of the actions regardless of the speed and conditions in which they are executed, avoiding the loss of actions involved and giving the player a feeling of satisfaction and total control.\n High Mobility: All our levels are designed to fully exploit the movement skills of our character, opening multiple ways to overcome each challenge and allowing the experienced player to improve their zone completion times.We are also Speedruns Fans!.\n Freedom of decision: Explore the mysterious lands of 'Aeterna' in a non-linear way. Although the main story of the game has a defined path, we want you to be the players who set your pace and ways to continue being able to travel this world of multiple different ways.\n Traditional 2D Art: Our art team has designed Frame by Frame through traditional illustration. Each and every one of the animations that you can enjoy in 'Aeterna Noctis', giving life to beautiful and fluid movements with absolute passion and dedication.\n A beautiful and deep story: it is not only about platforms and enemies! We have accompanied all this with an original, deep and emotional story with epic moments and unexpected twists that will captivate even the most experienced players.\nA PERFECT MIX BETWEEN PLATFORMS, ART AND GAMEPLAY\nYou, the 'King of Darkness', have just been defeated and rush into a relentless fall into the kingdom of 'Aeterna', it is not the first time that you visit it as you live trapped in an endless cycle of death and hatred. You must recover your old power, facing dungeons and enemies increasingly powerful and fearsome.\nFundamental pillar where 'Aeterna Noctis' rests, we have a gameplay system and levels designed and built to the millimeter. Tight jumps, traps with perfectly calculated timings, countdown events, almost impossible obstacles, smooth, clean and fluid controls ...\nEverything to offer you, the player, a complete gaming experience and control!\nThe difficulty level is above average in this genre, but it will always be accessible for players of all levels, managing to constantly maintain tension and pose a challenge even for the most experienced.\nThe response times are designed to react instantly adapting to each type of player, giving them a precise control of the character and offering the most skilled the possibility of moving through the areas in multiple ways searching of maximum speed.\nThe 'King of Darkness' has, among other original mechanics, a bow equipped with different types of arrows and other abilities that will be unlocked throughout the game, each of which has a different mechanic that multiplies and unlocks the possibilities to advance.\nFind your own style of play by advancing and modifying the experience panel to your liking and boosting your skills by equipping legendary items, being able always  to adapt your style to what the situation requires.\nDiscover the huge universe of 'Aeterna' made up of 16 well differentiated and connected areas, explore the secrets of this world in a non-linear way, always keeping control of where to go next.\nEach zone has exclusive graphic art, specific enemies, puzzles and mechanics adapted from its biome, spectacular events and cinematics, as well as hiding hundreds of secrets that are waiting to be found ...\nThrough the teleporter system you can move between the zones quickly, each one of them is full of secrets and ready to be revisited at any time with new challenges that are waiting for you.\nTo regain the power of the 'King of Darkness' it will be necessary for you to visit the 'Temple of the Kings', where there are ten dungeons that hold especially tough challenges, protecting inside the fragments of the soul of the 'Queen of Light '.\nTake her power away and make yours grow to unimaginable limits.\nHidden beneath the wasteland is the 'Pit of the Damned', an area with additional content separate from the game's main story and a place where only the most skilled and brave players dare to enter.\nIt contains the highest challenges of the game, contains mechanics of the highest difficulty and is guarded by the clan of the damned, the world's toughest bosses in 'Aeterna' that no one has yet been able to defeat.\nWill you be the chosen one?\nThe world of 'Aeterna' is populated by enemies, from the dumbest to the most bastards, all of them are equipped with different mechanics and characteristics that will make fighting intense and satisfying.\nHere you will see some examples of enemies that our art team has created for you, and soon they will come more and more impressive!\nNo 'Metroidvania' would be complete without epic boss battles, and of course 'Aeterna Noctis' is no exception. The Bosses will be divided into two groups, 'Mini-bosses' and 'Final bosses'. The former will be the keepers of events and secret zones and the latter will mark the area finals. Both will be accompanied by cinematics, from the beginning to the end, and they will have unique mechanics and high levels of difficulty.\nHere are some sketches and concept art that our team has prepared for you.\nThe NPCs could not be missing! Apart from guiding you through the story, some will offer you special missions that you must complete to get great rewards.\nHere we have 'The Chronicler', in charge of writing all the events of history in his gigantic books, through him we will access the mission that will allow us to obtain the secret stained glass window, great rewards and, for some of you, something very important ... 100% complete game.\nAnother great example is 'The Guardian' mysterious and sinister, oversees guarding the 'Temple of the Kings'. \nChaos, supreme god, creator of the universe and of all that it inhabits, decided at one point in his creation to make the world of 'Aeterna'. He populated it with different races and appointed wise rulers to show the path. Before long, these beings turned against their creator, grouping into two large groups and giving rise to war, death and hatred. This angered Chaos who, in his infinite immortality, took it as an insult to his magnificence and cast a terrible curse on the kings of both factions.\nHe named them 'King of Darkness' and 'Queen of Light' and condemned them to fight each other until the end of days. Cursed, even death could not free them from their destiny since, even if they defeated their opponent, Chaos granted them the gift of immortality and they were reborn again to regain their power and continue their eternal war.\nWe are really proud of our art team, not so much for their achievements in traditional frame-by-frame animation or for their spectacular designs, but for the passion they show day by day in their work and their great dedication that allows us to see little by little how the dream of 'Aeterna Noctis' comes true.\nYou may like our project more or less, but we know we have something in common, all of us love Video Games and Art.\nThat is why we choose different resources, great classic games, best anime in history, a more... to set our unique and defined style, with hints of homage those great works.\nFrom the very beginning we clearly knew what we wanted: Everything illustrated and animated in a traditional way, despite having the big drawback ... high costs, because each animation requires dozens of drawings and therefore hundreds of hours of work. Nevertheless, to make this feat a reality, we decided to ask you for help and support. That is why, showing you what we are capable of with our current resources, instead of designing a 'King of Darkness' out of our possibilities, we designed a sketch of his 'Soul Shell' and turned it into the main character within the DEMO.\nIt is in your hands we carry out this project and that \u201cSoul Shell\u201d become the Real King. Can we count on your help?\nWe are fortunate to have three great awarded musicians, who have built and will build the sound art of this project such as:\n'Juan Ignacio Teruel Torres' is a musician, composer and conductor orchestra. In his role as a composer, he has written songs for pop, rock, chamber and piano groups. He has participated in the composition of the music for the 'Vidas Cruzadas' project against bullying for the 'Educacuentos Foundation', winner of the Google.org Impact Challenge on Safety award in 2019.\n'Alfonso Delgado' is a professional classical pianist. He develops his concert activity in a wide variety of styles, from orchestral, chamber or soloist classical music, to modern groups such as rock or celtic-pop. He has composed and performed the music for the 'Vidas cruzadas' project for the 'Educacuentos Foundation' and arranged our Piano Collection Edition\n'Borja Murel' is a music composer, producer, multi-instrumentalist and sound engineer working in the world of film and music production. He has composed the soundtrack and made the sound of more than thirty cinematographic works. He has produced albums for renowned artists and composed the music for commercials.\nWe have been working on 'Aeterna Noctis' since July 2018, so we will soon complete two years of work dedicated to this great game.\nDuring this time, we have not stopped creating, dedicating ourselves, especially to defining the art, history and gameplay of this project, so that it never loses its essence. Thanks to having completed these milestones we are ready to start the production phase, and it is here and now when we need your support!\nWe firmly believe that your Feedback will be what makes this project really strong and that is why we offer our sponsors from 'Dark Lieutenant' reward tier the following benefits:\nExclusive access to the BETA version of the game\nAccess to our private development channels on Discord\nAccess to development surveys that will decide the course of the game\nWe want 'Aeterna Noctis' to be playable in the maximum amount of languages and with the highest quality. Above all, we want to ensure that all players enjoy history and events with the same level of quality.\nThat's why the key date has arrived, we hope to launch with full support the following language packs:\nWe have the means and sufficient experience to launch simultaneously on the following platforms:\nHow do add-ons work?\nPress the 'Manage your pledge button above. If you have not pledge yet, choose your base pledge first.\nIncrease your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.\nAfter the end of the Kickstarter Campaign you will recieve a survey that will ask you how would you like the add-on money assigned.\nIf we were to say that all hopes that this game will see the light depend on Kickstarter it would be suicide. Luckily, our company is supported by the financing of other national and international projects that allow us to dedicate resources to this initiative. The big question, does that economic effort make sense? Kickstarter has the answer. If you make this financing in a massive way, money will not be as important as knowing that it is something that people fall in love with. Does this project make you fall in love?\nOf course, Kickstarter is not only a barometer of the future success of this initiative, it is also a huge loudspeaker to listen to your opinions, with criticism being of the greatest interest. We do not seek praise (which also) as much as advice, changes, challenges or any vision that improves this project.\nWe hope from Kickstarter to give this project a boost in time and from you, to make it possible. Do you accept the challenge? We do.\nIt does not matter if it is the first time you know about us or you are one of our many followers, just getting to these lyrics deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nIt does not matter if you support the project or not, just taking a few minutes to read our proposal and see the work we have done with passion, emotion and with all our soul deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nIt does not matter if you are a collaborator who contributed $ 1 or the most ambitious of our packages because any contribution, however small, deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nIt does not matter how much you like or criticize this game or this initiative, because the most important thing is to exist and the fact of being in your head right now in any of its forms deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nBecause we know that you who read these lines are part of this dream. THANKS.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile the planet trembles with the Coronavirus, fear enters our houses and our minds, we can only draw strength and look to the future with courage. This game is a cry of hope, a cry to all people that despite any eventuality you want to end our way of life, we will be here to overcome them.\nWe trust you, we trust all of you who make it possible on Kickstarter for new projects to see the light. We, as a team, as people, as human beings will be in the trenches proposing a new challenge. We are not afraid that the world will change, because we know that together we will win this battle, we are only afraid to stay still while everything is transformed.\nWe want to take your support for this project as a promise to continue fighting, to continue living, and above all to continue shouting that NOTHING can stop us from being unique in the universe.\nOur team is made up of expert players, programmers with years of experience, artists who make dreams come true with their hands, and people who, although they apparently do not contribute anything, have the ability to make everything around them have magic.\nOur challenge is that a virus like COVID-19 will not stop the world, it will not stop us as a company with dreams to make our followers enjoy ... the question is, is it going to stop you?\nOur promise is that no matter what happens today and now ... this game will see the light of day because our illusion, our effort and our work is stronger than any stone (no matter how big) that gets in our way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Six Station Games\n2 created \u00b7 1 backed\nIndependent video game creation studio that

The aim is to create a fluid battle system, with head-to-head combat as its main focus while leaning on monster summons for special actions and attacks.\n Turn your foes into allies: use the Sword of the Necromancer to revive defeated monsters and make them fight alongside you.\n Gather weapons and relics: each weapon is different from the others thanks to the procedural  weapon generation system, which gives them various effects and  attributes.\n Fight with all your might: defeat your enemies using a variety of weapons and objects and dominating the fluid head-to-head battle system.\n Level up: enhance your character by fighting enemies and upgrade your stats. Improve your summoned monsters by fighting alongside them.\n Death is not the end: Each try gets you closer to the Necromancer. You will lose all your equipped weapons and monsters, but you will retain half the level you achieved in your run. Also, you can choose to exit the dungeon at some moments, losing all your level progress but maintaining all your  equipment.\n Learn the truth: Discover Tama and Koko's past as you advance through the dungeon.\n Local co-op play: Use the Flask of Homunculus to create a copy of the playable character and play with a friend in local co-op game.\n  You will be able to obtain items, weapons and monsters by entering codes in the Inventory screen. Use of these codes is limited to a few per day, so don't abuse them!\nYou can use the IR Codes as a help if you are stuck in the game or as a way to play with a certain starting set so you can challenge your friends.\nTo enter the codes you can use the IR Scanner feature for the Nintendo Switch. Using the IR camera available in the Nintendo Switch Right Joycon you can scan the codes easily, or...\nUse the Joycon camera to read codes. Sword of the Necromancer will be one of the few games on Nintendo Switch to make use of it!\n... you can enter them manually! For non-Switch platforms we are working on a companion app for Smartphone that will let you scan the code using your phone camera, but even if you don't want to use a Smartphone (or don't have one) or have a Nintendo Switch Lite, you will always be able to use the IR Codes regardless of where you play the game!\nCan't scan the code using a camera? Just enter it manually!\nYou can obtain IR Codes by purchasing the physical collectable IR Cards (see the Rewards section below) or by digital distribution via our Social Media Sites and Discord for some special events.\nThe digital distribution event codes will be absolutely free. Just download the code, print it or enter it manually and get your item!\nThanks to all the backers, Sword of the Necromancer will be a reality, but we can make the project even bigger!\nWe have reached all of our goals, thanks to all for your support!\n\"Legend says that, deep within these mountains, a heretic decided to violate the will of the gods in order to achieve eternal life.\nThe heretic succeeded in this aberrant attempt, and created a tool for forbidden rituals that could grant immortality\u2026 and even bring back the dead.\nOver the years and centuries many have tried to get that power for themselves, but all they found in the Necromancer\u2019s crypt was their demise.\nThey say that the tool the Necromancer created is also a weapon\u2026\nThe Sword of the Necromancer\u201d\nTama is a former rogue that is tasked to escort the priestess Koko in her pilgrimage around the continent. During their travel Koko dies, and Tama carries the corpse to the Necromancer's crypt, where legends say there dwells a power that may resurrect the dead.\nFilled with despair, Tama will enter the dungeon with the aim of obtaining the forbidden power of necromancy, ignoring the dangers that lurk in the shadows.\nFruit of the Necromancer's experiments with dark magic, the dungeon is filled with monsters of many types.\nEach monster has its own behaviour and perform different attacks. Some will charge at you on sight, others will keep their distance, some can come in aid of other monsters...\nMeet some of them\nChampimbomb expel stunning spores from time to time, which also produce a little mushroom-bomb that detonates if too close to them\nDollahans are invulnerable when they cover themselves with their giant shield. When they do so, they are also charging a devastating attack, so be careful!\nElusive and very rare to find, Restorebbit will run to its allies to cure them... even at the expense of its own health\nEvery monster that leaves a corpse behind when dead can be resurrected to be made to fight alongside Tama as a summon, but in addition to that, she can use a variety of weapons when fighting by herself.\nTama can also equip objects and relics that boost her stats and attributes. All of these items (monsters, weapons, relics and objects) will take one of the four slots available, each one assigned to a button.\nWith only the press of the assigned button (except for relics, that act passively) you will use the item, which allows for combos.\nYou can even use different weapons mid-combo to get the most of every tool\nIn addition to that, each of the close quarters weapons has a different charge attack: from powerful slashes to throwing your weapon!\nAside from the Sword of the Necromancer you have Gladius, Sabres and Claymores. Each one has a different reach and charged attack, but all swords can perform a 3-hit combo\nSpears are useful to keep the distance from your enemies. Halberds have the longest reach, Lances inflict a powerful stab and Pikes can be thrown (don't forget to pick them up!)\nAxes can deal a lot of damage, and the charged attacks from the Labrys and the Bardiche even have an area of effect, but they leave you open to enemy attacks!\nThese are your long range options. Magic comes in different forms depending on the type of magic tome you use, and casting it drains a little of your Soul meter. Bows don't use Soul but take a little longer to charge!\nBoth weapons and monsters can have elemental and status effects, and relics can grant resistances or weaknesses to them.\nAfter a certain point in the game, you will obtain an item called Flask of the Homunculus. By equipping it, Tama can create a copy of herself if there is a second controller available. This copy can be controlled by a second player, and is able to do all what Tama can except revive or summon monsters\nThe second player has its own 4 slots to equip weapons, items and relics (but not monsters!)\nPlayers can even trade items between them! Just approach the other player and open the trade menu.\nShare items so each player can make the most of their build!\nSword of the Necromancer will use traditional pixel art and frame by frame animation, which has been quite a challenge as we wanted to keep its 8-directional movement. \nThe game has 8-directional movement, and all animations have all 8 directions, which gives it a very good feeling when playing\nFor the flashback and \"cutscene\" segments we have opted for a more \"visual novel-esque\" approach, with hand-drawn CG illustrations (made by CasualMisfit) to better convey the emotions and expressions of the characters.\nFlashbacks will use illustrations like those of VNs\nThe game's music is being composed by In\u00e9s Mir\u00e1s, who has worked previously on several short films and documentaries, as well as in Youtube channels like UHC Espa\u00f1a. Also, she's part of the Galician band \"A Banda da Loba\", as the guitarist.\nShe is working on giving the soundtrack a mysterious and epic feeling, with roots on celtic music.\nSword of the Necromancer is being developed by Grimorio of Games, and produced and published by JanduSoft S.L, both based in Barcelona.\nFunded in 2012 and starting as a mobile game developer, now JanduSoft is focused on console development and has published and ported over 15 games for PC and consoles in the last 3 years. JanduSoft has experience with successful Kickstarter campaigns: Caveman Warriors, released in 2017 on all platforms, and Indiecalypse, to be released this very quarter.\nGrimorio of Games' previous game, Super Hyperactive Ninja, was also published by JanduSoft and sold over 15.000 copies, which supposed a massive hit for a (back then) two-people team.\nOfficial Artbook \nFull color artbook with the concepts and illustrations from our artists, pixel art sprites, developers comments and all the full game's script. Beware of spoilers!\n\nAltar of the Sword figurine\nHand-painted replica of the altar of the Sword of the Necromacer, as it appears in the game. Also doubles as a stand for the Nintendo Switch right Joycon to use it for the IR Camera Scanner feature and read IR Codes.\nThe altar figurine is being designed, modeled, printed and hand-painted by The3DHut.\nTama and Koko plushies\nHand-made plushes made by Boira Plushies with high quality materials and details. Check their Twitter to see examples of their work!\n\nOfficial Soundtrack \nSoundtrack of the game by In\u00e9s Mir\u00e1s in CD format.\n\nIR Cards\nCards to be used with the IR Code Scanner feature. You can get special items or monsters by scanning them to help you in your adventure. The IR Code Scanner feature uses the Nintendo Switch's right Joycon camera. For other platforms, we are working on a smartphone app.\nCheck the FAQs for more info about the IR Card packs\nAs we have reached several stretch goals, every backer with a physical reward will receive free IR Card packs. For the 30000\u20ac stretch goal we added a free IR Card pack with every shipping to choose, and for the 65000\u20ac one, we added a Kickstarter exclusive pack: \"Mixed Pack 2\".\nEvery backer with a physical reward will also receive this Kickstarter exclusive IR Card from the Sword of the Necromancer x 9 Years of Shadows collaboration!\nInstruction Manual\nLike in the old days, a full color instruction manual with explanations about the game, tips and strategies to help you progress through the dungeon. And with a \"Notes\" section at the end!\n\nPhysical Edition\nPhysical copy of the game for Nintendo Switch or PS4. Boxart is subject to change\n\nLost Diary\nBe a part of Sword of the Necromancer's lore! Write a journal entry and name one of the explorers, scavengers or looters that entered into the Necromancer's Crypt before Tama. Players will come across these journals during their gameplay.\n...\nDepending on your pledge tier, you will get different rewards:\nFor example, if you pledge for the Collector's Edition, you get all this plus digital goodies!\nYou can add an amount to your pledge to get more items in addition to the rewards of your tier. For example, you can add 13\u20ac to get an extra digital key or 10\u20ac to get the soundtrack separately so you can share or gift it to a friend.\n1. Select the \"Manage your Pledge\" option. If you have not made your pledge yet, first choose your base pledge.\n2. Increase your pledge amount by the total of add-ons you want to add.\n3. When the campaign ends, you will receive a survey asking for the items you want to assign to the money you added to your pledge.\nDigital Copy of Sword of the Necromancer - 13\u20ac (aprox 14 USD)\nPhysical Artbook - 10\u20ac (aprox 11 USD)\nPhysical Soundtrack CD - 10\u20ac (aprox 11 USD)\nPack of IR Cards - 5\u20ac (aprox 5.5 USD)\nPhysical Copy (for PS4 or Switch) - 35\u20ac (aprox 38 USD)\nFigurine - 50\u20ac (aprox 55 USD)\nTama plush - 60\u20ac (aprox 65 USD)\nKoko plush - 60\u20ac (aprox 65 USD)\n  We have been working on Sword of the Necromancer for a little more than year and a half, and while the main mechanics and features of the game are already implemented, we need a little help and feedback from the Kickstarter community. With your help, we can make Sword of the Necromancer the best it can be.\nWe will be extremely thankful for any help you can give us, even just sharing content about our game to your friends or your followers on social media can really make the difference.\nYou can also make a small donation to our project to help us even more and help us make our dream come true to finish and publish this game to as many platforms as possible so you can all enjoy it when it comes out.\nWe will launch Sword of the Necromancer in all current platforms digitally, but we also would like to have a physical release (for Switch and PS4), and our resources are limited.\nHere\u2018s how we intend to spend your donations:\nMost of the budget (69%) will be destined to fund several aspects of the game's development (mainly art and music) and produce the physical rewards.\nThe other 31% will be divided in paying taxes, Kickstarter and other fees.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis would be JanduSoft's fourth Kickstarter, and the previous ones have been successfully delivered. We have always fulfilled our commitments, so you can be 100% certain that we won\u2019t let you down.\n\nSword of the Necromancer's main features are implemented and the game is already perfectly playable in consoles. We need to add more content: monsters, bosses, extra modes, etc. and that is why we need your help.\n\nAs in every project, setbacks may occur, which would lead to delays. We will work hard to prevent that, and if the case there are delays, we will try to minimize them as much as possible.\n\nAnother point of possible delays would be the production of physical goods, like the physical versions, figurines or plushies, depending on the number of items to produce.\n\nThis is a game we are having a great time working on and the team is motivated, so you can count on our best efforts to deliver the best experience we can make.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac14 or more", "title": "Digital Game", "descp": "You get a digital copy of Sword of the Necromancer for your platform of choice (Steam/PS4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch)\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of Sword of the Necromancer\nYour name will appear in the credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["2,431 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac18 or more", "title": "Digital Game + Soundtrack", "descp": "In addition to the game, you will get a copy of the game's Digital Soundtrack, made by our composer Sinesita, and featuring all the songs from the game\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of Sword of the Necromancer\nDigital Soundtrack\nYour name will appear in the credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["334 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Digital Deluxe Edition", "descp": "You will receive a Digital Artbook and Instruction Manual in addition to the previous rewards.

After 9 years of living in the shadows, a brave warrior will rise: Europa. A battle hardened maiden who carries the fate of the world on her shoulders. \nEquipped with little else than her parent\u2019s mementos, her task is daunting - venture inside the missing orphan\u2019s memories to vanquish the curse that has been tormenting the people, and restore peace to the lands.\n\n\n\nA giant mechanical castle was left by an ancient king to protect the country's orphan youth. From time to time, its halls are known to move almost as if they have a life of their own. Now only a shadow of its former glory, the orphanage Talos lies corrupted with darkness..\n\nLose yourself in a dark 2D side-scrolling adventure with an emphasis on emotional storytelling, exploration and combat.\n  Slash your way through the immense mechanical Castle known as Talos and visit exotic places through the memories of its missing orphans.\n  Lift the laments that darken the map by defeating hidden bosses.\n   Transform into different elemental armors that will allow you to experience the game\u2019s design in surprising ways.\nGain power-ups to access varied locations and expand your combat skills to survive.\n  Find collectible secret treasures scattered throughout the castle.\n  Modify the difficulty curve by choosing what challenge you will tackle first.\n  Discover a wide array of references to classic games like Castlevania, Mega Man Zero, Super Metroid and Demon\u2019s Crests.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the soundtrack will feature the participation of legendary composers Michiru Yamane and Manami Matsumae, of Castlevania and Mega Man fame respectively.\nBut that\u2019s not all, by request of Ms.Yamane herself, healing music will play a very important role in our game.\nAs big fans of video game music, we have decided to implement a mechanic dedicated to showcasing the nurturing and soothing power of music in the game. By finding music notes scattered around the castle you will be able to visit the Degollado Theater and give those notes to two mystical composers that are said to wander there. In exchange you will get to see the characters perform exclusive melodies tuned to 432Hz designed to soothe your soul (and expand your health and magic meters).\nAnd as an update, we are also pleased to announce that Norihiko Hibino, Metal Gear Solid legend, is joining the A-list of composers in the soundtrack.\nHere are some words from Mr. Hibino himself:\n\"It's great that I can collaborate with  Yamane-san! We're good friends and I know she's quite into healing  music. I'm so glad to find out she can incorporate healing into games.

Prohibition, the Constitutional ban on the sale of alcohol in the United States, comes into effect.... And business couldn't be better at the Little Daisy Cafe.\nBut things aren't what they seem. Atlas May, proprietor, uses the charming little restaurant as a front for his real cash cow; the Lackadaisy speakeasy, where flashing the club symbol from a deck of cards grants everykitty in-the-know access to more moonshine than they could ever drink. Life is good... Until Atlas is murdered in cold blood.\nNow, it's 1927. Mitzi, Atlas' widow, struggles to keep Lackadaisy afloat, as the patrons drift away and a skeleton crew of staff sticks by her side. Scrappy young musician/rum-runner Rocky Rickaby, his wide-eyed but tightly-wound cousin Freckle McMurray, and the endlessly resourceful and sharp-tongued Ivy Pepper, heiress to the quickly-dwindling Lackadaisy fortune, are forced to make do in a world of increasingly unfriendly competition, intent on shooting, smuggling, and conspiring their way back to a successful bar, against all odds. \nLackadaisy Cats has been running online since 2006, immersing its readership in a world of sepia-toned crime, adventure, action, and comedy. And now, it's ready for its next big move... to a screen near you.\nWhy a cartoon? Why now?\nThere's never been more interest in adult animation, with shows like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and Primal capturing the attention and imaginations of millions of viewers. \nLackadaisy is an exceptional webcomic, but in her mind, Tracy has always pictured it as an animated film. It\u2019s a side effect, perhaps, of a childhood nourished on Looney Tunes, Disney, and Don Bluth features; a dream of sharing that living, breathing, musical version of Lackadaisy with its dedicated readership. But the when-and-how something like that could ever be achieved has always lacked an obvious ingress.\nAs the 20s dawn upon us again, with new animation tools and techniques available, with talented and excited artists on deck an raring to get to work, and with the internet eager for more independently-created media, the auspiciousness seems writ-large - splashed across an art deco picture palace marquee, if you will. \nNow\u2019s the time.\nThe Lackadaisy animated short proposes a 10-minute, fun-and-action-filled adventure, full of car chases, shootout, sass, and  un-requested violin solos. And with your help, we can make it happen!\nThe finished short will be available for everyone to watch!\nMeet the people in charge of (and contributing to) the project! \nA former game dev, illustrator and graphic designer, Tracy Butler began Lackadaisy after researching the history of her century-old Saint Louis home, and being inspired by her love of jazz music and 1920s aesthetics. Boasting over 1,600 backers on Patreon, Lackadaisy has been her full-time job for years, garnering a dedicated readership of thousands. As the creator of the comic, Tracy will play a role as co-director on the animated short, as well as overseeing art direction.\nFable Siegel is a veteran animation professional, boasting a resume that includes Titmouse, Starburns, the internet phenomenon Hazbin Hotel, and two Game Grumps Animated shorts, along with storyboard work for Cartoon Network (Ben 10), Stoopid Monkey (Adam Ruins Everything: Reanimated History), Warner Brothers (Wacky Races), Shadow Machine (F is for Family), and more, as well as being a board artist, animator, and designer for Six Point Harness (Like Share Die).  Brought onto the Lackadaisy animated short as a production manager, director, and producer, they'll be overseeing the project utilizing their years of professional experience and skill.\n Our awesome line-up of talent, in no particular order:\n Michael Kovach  (@kovox) as Rocky Rickaby! \n Belsheber Rusape (@BelRusapeVO) as Calvin \"Freckle\" McMurray! \n Lisa Reimold (@lisareimold)  as Ivy Pepper! \n Ashe Wagner (@TheQueenViking)  as Mitzi May! \nand SungWon Cho (@ProZD) as Mordecai Heller! \nCharacter Design\nTai (@corvidmonster)\n3D Modeling\nZachary \"Newt\" Nall (https://www.noneuclideandesigns.com/)\nStoryboard Artist\nAshley \"Kilomonster\" Green (@AshGMonstrology)\nSound Direction\nM.

Look no further!\nLackadaisy Essentials is the primary means by which we intend to fund the animated short, and Iron Circus Comics' part in this incredibly ambitious project! Planned as a hardcover volume of about 100 pages, Lackadaisy Essentials contains never-before-published minicomics, one-offs, sketches, and other creative work by Tracy, delving into the world and details of the Lackadaisy webcomic.\n Lackadaisy Volumes 1 & 2 ebooks are the collected Lackadaisy webcomic! Grab the tiers including this reward to read the comic offline at your leisure, at a beautiful, high resolution!\nWant to see the finished product in its snazziest, most high-quality form? Back a tier that grants access to an HD download of the finished animated short! The Lackadaisy short will be a fully-polished final product, professionally animated, voice-acted, and scored by musical and animation professionals!\n There's so much that goes into making a cartoon. Storyboards, animatics, a soundtrack, 3D models! Back at the Goodie Bag level and higher to grab all these cool bits 'n' pieces. The perfect backer level for folks who wanna see how the sausage is made. Higher levels even grant special thanks in the credits!\n ALL IN! Really wanna become an indispensable part of the project? Maybe even make animation history? The very highest tiers of support grant in-story cameos, personalized Lackadaisy-sona designs, original art from Tracy and the crew, and MORE. \n There's something available at practically every level of support!\n $85,000 is the minimum we would need to make sure this one-of-a-kind project comes to fruition. But in case we overfund, we already have some awesome plans to make this Kickstarter even better.\n\nAnd our final two stretch goals...\n\nWhatever you may decide, thanks for getting this far down the page, and reading all about this new venture! We hope to see you on the other side in 2021, with the very first Iron Circus Animation! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Iron Circus Comics' TWENTY-FOURTH Kickstarter project.

Two to five players take the roles of various diverse Princesses, working together, for the most part, to deal with issues and concerns in Princess World, while one player takes the role of Weaver, who works with the other players to gather their ideas and choices into a shared narrative, with everyone playing to find out what will happen next.\nThe game provides the players with the rules and framework to create their own worlds, realms and adventures and is designed to act as an introduction to the exciting world of role-playing games, particularly for younger players.  Extensive play testing with both kids and adults has gone into the creation of Princess World.  While it is a game made for kids, it's not a game just for kids; as well, interviews with younger players produced some surprising information about what they're looking for when it comes to gaming experiences!\nPrincess World takes many of its cues from television shows such as My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power and books like The Princess in Black and Princeless.\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to generate the funds necessary to pay for art, graphic design, layout, written contributions, and physical production of the book.  We at Princess World believe in paying fairly for all work done and abide by the guidelines set out in the  Unified (QT)PoC Standard Requirements.\nPrincess World also fully endorses the efforts of Kickstarter United.\nThe Space, Shadow, Fairy, and Warrior Princesses dealing with a situation.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSince we have now surpassed our funding goal we are pleased to announce stretch goals to increase the beauty and content of Princess World.\nStretch Goal #1 - More Art - **UNLOCKED** - $15,000\nClarissa and Lauren, our illustrious illustrators, will endeavor to show  even more diverse princesses in many challenging and intriguing  situations.  Since the Princess World rulebook  will also double as a, potential, coloring book, we want something that  can be colored in on every page.  This will help us achieve that goal. \nStretch Goal #2 - The Dark Princesses - **UNLOCKED** - $17,500, Dead Princess Sharang Biswas, Dragon Princess Zaire Lanier, Evil Princess Chase Forrester\nThree more Princesses will be made available, along with real-life stories by members of the gaming community.  Now, these three Princesses may have different views and approaches to Princess World, but they are still members of the Council.\n The Dead Princess \u2013 some might find them haunting, spooky, or ethereal. Sometimes a princess may suffer an unfortunate setback, one that brings their story to an end. This princess was strong enough to overcome that, but she came back different.\n The Dragon Princess \u2013 they are often seen as awesome, fearsome, and mighty. While not always actual monsters, they have monstrous power and focus; if something catches their eye, it may soon belong to them. Still, they are better as an ally than an adversary. Usually.\n The Evil Princess \u2013 they may be found to be devious, malevolent, and sinister, but they are still welcome at the Council, because, out there, there are some things that are worse.\nStretch Goal #3 - Evn More Art - LOCKED - $20,000\nClarissa and Lauren will be joined by other illustrators to show varied visions on what it means to be a Princess in Princess World.\nStretch Goal #4 - The Gemini Princesses - LOCKED - $22,500 - Rebel Princess Sarah Kennedy, Power Princess Shayna Cook, Boy Princess Ennis Bashe\n With this goal, another three Princesses will be added to the Council, along with three more real life stories.  These three all express a literal or metaphorical duality when it comes to being a Princess.\n The Rebel Princess \u2013 they can be seen as defiant, outspoken, and revolutionary. They may be part of the system and can work within it, but they know, whether with words or deeds, sometimes, it\u2019s better just to burn it all down.\n The Power Princess \u2013 they show themselves to be heroic, transforming, and surprising. While they must split their time between two worlds, they are more than the sum of their disparate halves. \n The Boy Princess \u2013 they can be found to be gentle, subversive, and tough. Anyone can be a princess; for some it\u2019s a choice, for others it is what they\u2019ve always been.\nStretch Goal #5 - Tying Up Loose Ends - LOCKED - $25,000, Patchwork Princess Kira Magrann\nReaching this goal will unlock the 16th Princess, and their story, and will also provide a bonus for all the story and art contributors to the project.\n The Patchwork Princess \u2013 they are often considered scrappy, one-of-a-kind, and unseemly. Sometimes the mantle of Princess fits and sometimes it has to be made to fit, and, sometimes, something rips and has to be stitched back into place.\nTHE PRINCESS COUNCIL\nThe members of the Princess Council come from many different realms and may not all fit the usual ideas of what a princess is, but they all have a place at the table.  Each princess is represented by a unique playbook, listing their strengths and weaknesses, abilities, special knowledge and the Truths that give them power.\nThe nine core Princesses are:\n The Proper Princess \u2013 they are often dignified, noble, and elegant. Strong-willed, good with rules and social situations, though they may have a surprising trick or two hidden up their sleeve.\n The Pirate Princess \u2013 they might be adventurous, sharp, and dangerous. Following their own code, they can be a great friend or a dire enemy, depending on which way the wind blows!\n The Fairy Princess \u2013 they usually appear free-spirited, enchanting, and unpredictable. Magic and wonder are part of them and sometimes they share it and sometimes they don\u2019t.  Be careful what your wish for!\n The Space Princess \u2013 they generally show themselves to be capable, knowledgeable, and innovative. Discovering answers, uncovering secrets, and making something new with what they find are where they shine.\n The Skateboard Princess \u2013 they tend to be audacious, ready, and independent. Taking risks, breaking rules, and showing off can sometimes cause trouble, but they are always willing to face danger head on.\n The Knight Princess \u2013 they are considered stalwart, persistent, and honorable. Often accompanied by a trusted steed, they are a boon companion who is as at home on the battlefield as they are in the ballroom or even when it\u2019s both at the same time.\n The Warrior Princess \u2013 they present themselves as brave, tough, and steadfast. Occasionally, words are not enough to sway someone from a bad course of action. Sometimes a sword is needed to change someone\u2019s mind, even if it isn\u2019t drawn; that\u2019s why they\u2019ve got two. Just in case.\n The Shadow Princess \u2013 they are observant, resourceful, and mysterious. Moving like smoke and hard to catch, they might appear as anyone. Or no one. A whispered word might have more influence than a battle cry, when they utter it.\n The Pauper Princess \u2013 they must be versatile, tenacious, and resilient. Not everyone has a realm to belong to; they may have lost almost everything, but they still have themselves and their friends. That is more than enough to be a princess.\nAnyone can be a princess\nHOW TO BE A PRINCESS\nThe game play of Princess World is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) engine, using its core systems, supplemented by unique narrative rules.\nThe Princess you create does not have to be a girl, or a human, or anything you might normally think a Princess might be; it is up to the player creating the character to decide which details are important and which are ephemera and they can stretch their creativity as far as they like.  There have been robot Princesses, business-suit-wearing Princesses, insect Princesses, a Princess that was a composite being made of five individual consciousnesses, boy Princesses, a Princess who was completely virtual, and even one Princess who was a Space Cat!\nTo create your Princess, the first thing you do is pick a favorite color.  Everything you write down in the game that is a Truth, will be written in that color.  A Truth is a narrative statement that can be used by a Princess to give them powers and abilities as they play their story, powers and abilities that others might not share. Sometimes, a Truth might be Unpleasant, and this is written in the color of The Fade, usually black; this is a Truth that, while still powerful, might also cause problems for the Princess it belongs to.  And how do we determine if a Truth is Unpleasant?  Well, we ask the rest of the people we are playing with to tell us!\nZoe, playing Pirate Princess Swann, expresses the following Truth about her weapon:\n\"I have a sword that can cut through anything!\"\nEveryone at the table thinks this is cool, except for one player, who says, \"That sounds dangerous.\"  The Truth is immediately considered to be Unpleasant, but Zoe has two options: 1) Accept that her cool sword is dangerous as well, and write it down in the color of The Fade or, 2) re-express it to account for the possible danger.  She chooses option 2) and says:\n\"I have a sword that can cut through anything except its scabbard!\"\nAnd everyone agrees that this is much safer and she writes it down in her color.\nEach Princess has four essential Truths that are unique to their playbook and all four can be drawn on as the characters' stories unfold.  Expressing them to the table and then writing them down is the main part of character creation in Princess World.  Each Princess also has a list of special moves to choose from and each possess a special Knowledge rule, that allows them to take advantage of their unique perspectives.\nBUILDING PRINCESS WORLD\nPrincess World has no default or pre-made setting; building the world and the challenges the Princess face is part of playing the game.  All the players, both those playing Princesses and those playing the Weaver, work together to craft a world of adventure and excitement, with the Princesses themselves deciding which events are important enough to warrant their attention.  There are three tiers of play in which to make this happen:\n Short Story Mode: This mode is best for teaching the game and for one-shot play.  At this tier of play, each player presents a possible problem for the Princess  Council to face and the group of players decide which to tackle, with the Weaver working to incorporate the other players' ideas with their own, perhaps with surprising tangles and complications!\n Chapter Mode: This mode tells the story of the Princesses in linked episodes of play.  In the first session, the players collaborate to craft a shared world, expressing Truths about it as they did for their characters.  Each player briefly recounts a significant event of that happened \"In last chapter...\" to set the start of the story, even if this is the very first session of play! \n Whole Story Mode: To get the whole story, the players craft the Truths of their Princess World and the Truths of the individual Realms their characters come from.  The provides a vast, collaborative world of adventure for the players to explore which should last many sessions of game play.\nIt is easy to switch between modes for every session of play, to tell quick tales of brave Princesses or to launch long spanning epics of daring deeds and grim peril, all depending on the shared desires of the players.\nThe Space Princess scans for anomolies.\nWEAVING THE STORY\nThe Weaver holds an interesting position in Princess World, they are not in the story, but they are a very big part of making it happen.  It is a role that is similar to that of game master in other role-playing games, but every Weaver must accept the following piece of truth, which some might find unpleasant:\nThis is not your story.\nFrom the text: \"Weaver, you are not here to weave a tale by yourself; creating everything, making every decision, leading the other players through a world you have made on your own. Oh, you will be creating things, making decisions, and weaving a tale, but you\u2019ll be doing it with the help of everyone in the game, because it is their story. They are playing the protagonists, the main characters, the individuals the story is about! You, well, you\u2019ll be playing everything else, but they will all be secondary characters and events there to support the story.\" \nIf you find this daunting, take heart in knowing that being the Weaver is not a permanent position. The game is designed to allow changing and rotating Weaver duties; no one player is forced to remain as the Weaver if they wish to play a Princess instead and each Princess player can feel free to take on the mantle of Weaver if they desire, though, in general, there can only be one Weaver at a time. The only hard restriction is that you can not play the role of Weaver and the role of a Princess at the same time.  If you have a princess in the game and, for the next session, decide you wish to be the Weaver, the game is designed to keep your princess, and their Realm, safe from any happenings in the game they don't appear in.  This same protection is afforded to the princesses of players who might have to miss out on a session from time to time.\nSo, everyone can be a Princess and everyone can be a Weaver.\nWHAT IS THE FADE?\nWe don't know.  There are things wrong or troubling in Princess World; maybe things are fading away, maybe they're fading to black, maybe things are getting worse, maybe there's someone or something behind it all.  We'll all be playing the story to find out and the Princess Council will be there to resist it.\nREAL LIFE PRINCESS STORIES\nPrincess World has been developed to act as in introduction to role-playing and story games.  Included in the book are real life stories of how many players and game designers got into gaming and how it influenced their lives.  Each Princess in the game will have a story to share from an experienced member of the gaming community; this will be a story about them, showing the benefits of role-playing games, a tale from their real lives, not a made up story.\nEach fifty (50) followers who join @PrincessWorldRP on Twitter will help fight the Fade and reveal another contributor.\nRevealed: Fairy Princess Alice Kyra, Pirate Princess Zoe Bloom, Warrior Princess Meghan Dornbrok, Knight Princess Kienna Shaw, Space Princess Amr Ammourazz, Shadow Princess Amber Viescas, Skateboard Princess Lucian Kahn, Pauper Princess Amber Autumn Faebrooke, Proper Princess Alex Roberts\nTHE BOOK\nOne of the core concepts of Princess World is that the players, through their characters, will be making their own marks upon the world.  To align with this concept all interior art will be black-and-white line drawings on, at least, #70 paper for all your coloring needs.  The physical book with be a softcover 8.5\"x11\" in dimension.\nReaching certain stretch goals has the potential to unlock a hardcover edition.\nACTUAL PLAY AND INTERVIEWS\nIf you're curious to understand how the game plays, please check out these actual plays and interviews!\nWeaver Kevin runs some of the Fandible crew through a thunderous adventure.\nWeaver Alice shows the She's a Super Geek players the ropes.

But neither were they disappointed when we finally had to put an end to the fun before the game itself was over\u2014it clearly wasn\u2019t about winning, it was just about having a blast playing. Peter Thompson, parent of Princess Eleanor (Brave Young Princess Society)\nKevin is an insightful game designer. The way he sees to the secret  heart of his own games and builds everything to support that is incredible. I got to play a Princess World game run by Kevin and it was a  blessing. I still want to know what happened to my Space Princess who  was thrown out into space!  Come on Kevin WHERE IS SHE. WHERE DID THAT SPACETOPUS THROW HER. LET ME SKATE OFF THE MOON.         James Malloy, Stop Hack and Roll\nThe Truths seem to be a way to work in aspects (Fate) without trying to slam PbtA and Fate together. Rach Shelkey, +1Forward\nVery accessible to new/young players! Worked very well with a mixed group [of adults and kids]. Truths and Maybes are very cool, especially the Unpleasant aspect.  Colors for each and how these impact the world/Truths/Realms is awesome, not anything I've seen before!  Seann Ives, Playtester\nPrincess World is so great you folks! It's the elegant kid-friendly RPG  my heart needed! It's PbtA in a good way, it has Bondfliction-like Truths, it's not afraid of doubling down on princesses! It really feels like a game that works for the very enthusiastic kid I was. Xavid, Playtester\nI liked the versatility of the game with personalities and setting.  I also loved the idea of being able to shift who the GM [Weaver] is every time - encourages everyone to try GMing.

Backers of $15 or more will be able to choose between a Steam key or a Nintendo eShop code!\nHow all great adventures start...\nGastova is a light-hearted 2D adventure game. As the Witch Guardian of Arkana, embark on a journey to track down and defeat the fellow witches that were once Gastova\u2019s classmates and/or closest friends.\nInspired by classics such as Mega Man and Wonder Boy, we are committed to deliver a satisfying single-player experience for all the fans of the retro platforming genre.\nThis is a passion project of ours and we really need your help to make this a reality. We promise that the end result will absolutely blow your mind! Thank you so much for reading all this!\n\nGastova embraces the most fundamental principle of the platforming genre. You jump, dodge, and shoot. The core gameplay revolves around adventuring through 8 distinct landscapes and overcoming the obstacles presented within them. Every area will be divided into two parts, with a challenging boss waiting for you at the end of each area.\nAlong the way, Gastova may find special currency that she\u2019ll be able to use to enhance her abilities. Other power ups may also be hidden throughout the world for the players to discover.\nAs the current Witch Guardian of Arkana, Gastova is able to utilize the power of all the other witches who finds her worthy. Defeat the other witches to receive their blessing and awaken Gastova\u2019s power to channel her friend\u2019s magic!\n\nThe attack of the Waffos\nThe enemies of Gastova consist primarily of Waffos, mysterious creatures with indiscernible origins. They seem to be well trained and follow a strict military doctrine. Whoever their leader is, they have the Waffos trained into a formidable fighting force. \nThe wildlife of Arkana\nOf course, it wouldn't be an adventure game without a host of other creatures that suit the habitat. Monkeys in forests, spooky spiders, giant fishes in the ocean, we got them all!\n\n\nThe landscapes of Arkana\nThe game features an expansive world for the player to progress and explore. From the scorching desert to the frigid snow lands, the deep caverns to the sky fortress, the size of the game will surely provide a satisfying adventure to those who seeks to explore the world.\nThere are 8 distinct worlds within the game that are all inter-connected. Most of the worlds follow the same principle and setup, with two large, explorable areas and two bosses. \n\nBoss fight against Kirincorn\nThe boss fights in Gastova are designed to present sufficient challenges without being overly frustrating or punishing. There will be a save point right before every boss fight to ensure that any failed attempts at the fight will not result in much wasted time. All of the mini bosses of an area will follow a hard coded set of actions whereas the witches will employ a more dynamic strategy based on various conditions of how the battle is progressing.\n\nBoss fight against Nephelle\nDue to the rather linear nature of our story progression, the witches will be fought in a set order. As Gastova\u2019s abilities and power will scale throughout the game due to power-ups, the later witches will naturally be a lot stronger to keep up with the power increase. This will cause the first witch that is fought to appear like a pushover, which we feel is incredibly unfair for her. As such, once all 8 witches are defeated, the player may challenge them to a rematch where their stats will be scaled to be challenging even to a fully-powered Gastova. However, their stat numbers are not the only thing that we will be increasing. All rematches with the witches will feature brand new mechanics and far more brutal attacks to really push the player to the limit.\n\nGastova has two types of attacks. The first one is her regular magic attack, and the second one is the upgraded version of the attack. In the beginning, she will only be able to use her standard Force element, giving her access to the regular Force Missile and the powered up Force Blast. Throughout the game, Gastova can obtain the power of the Fount Guardians she defeats, giving her more elements to choose from.\n\nThe town of Arkana\nArkana will be accessible at the start of the game and will provide Gastova with access to shops, NPCs and other goodies. Throughout her adventures, Gastova will discover game cartridges that she can turn in at the local arcade in exchange for power-ups!\n\nA save shrine with the statue of the First Witch\nProgresses can be saved with these save statues located throughout the world. They also serve as a point of fast travel, allowing Gastova to instantly revisit any shrines that she has previously visited.\nIngrid losing her patience\nAs the most recent graduate of the Witch Academy of Arkana, Gastova and her Fount Guardian classmates were preparing for a graduation trip to the neighboring city of Roundhouse. However, a dark force swept across the town and turned all the Fount Guardians hostile towards her and the rest of Arkana. Worse, mysterious creatures known as Waffos begin appearing throughout the region, causing havoc and chaos. Now, as the Guardian Witch of Arkana, a title Gastova inherited from her mentor, Gastova must set out and confront her classmates and defeat the Waffos for good.\nGastova is being developed by MechWolf Productions, consisting of Andy and Rayane, with the former handling the programming aspect and the latter taking care of the project\u2019s graphical needs. We also work with Aekashics Librarium for many of our monster designs as well as character portraits. For music, we will be using PeriTune's music library.\nA word from Andy: \nHey! Thanks for checking out our project! I hope you like what you're seeing here. A little about myself, I am from Vancouver, Canada and I dropped out of University a few years back in order to pursue my dream of game making. Helping me achieve my dream is truly something that I can never be grateful enough for and I'll absolutely make sure to deliver an experience that you will all be satisfied with.\nA word from Rayane:\nHello! Rayane here. I'm the lead artist and co-creator of this game. I'm from Brazil, and I've been making art for more than decade now as a freelancer artist. Your support will be the key to make our game come true. From the bottom of my heart, I can't thank you enough for being part of this! We will do our very best as a team to make this a game you'll love to play!\nOur target platform is Windows PC and Nintendo Switch. Backers of $15 or more will be able to choose between a Steam key or a Nintendo eShop code!\nGastova will be shipped in English, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional) and Japanese. Please let us know if there are any languages you\u2019d like to see the game translated into and we\u2019ll do the best we can to include them.\nUPDATE: We're also adding Spanish to the list of available languages!\n\nThese goals are really \"stretching\" it\nWe believe for a Kickstarter project, a healthy communication goes a long way so we feel that it is important for us to clearly illustrate our plans as well as the things that we promise to do, versus the things that we want to do.\nOur promise is the basic fundamentals. The delivery of a game that is both satisfying and complete. This will include all the things we\u2019ve listed above, as well as ensuring that there are no major game-breaking bugs when the game is finished and released to the public. This is where our priority lies and what we consider the most important part of this campaign.\nOn the other hand, there are things we have ambitions for, but also realize that they might be beyond the scope of this project. As such, we\u2019ll be implementing them as stretch goals, something that will take a significantly more amount of work to implement, and something that we can only get done if we\u2019re able to get more help. After carefully evaluating our options, as well as our ability to fulfill them, we have decided to implement three stretch goals for the Kickstarter campaign.\nAn ominous tower awaits...\nWe\u2019ve always felt that the importance of end-game contents cannot be overstated. While we\u2019ve somewhat addressed this with boss rematches, there is another set of content that we would like to do. It would be a very long set of linear area that is designed to see how far we can push the difficulty of the game to. It will be long and tediousl. We\u2019re talking about lots of enemies, unfavorable environments, different debuffs for different areas, all to challenge the player to see how far they can go. \nFor some reason, the tower  contains mysterious memory fragments of the past, allowing Gastova to glimpse into various events involving Guardians of the past.\nAn area like this would likely utilize many of the same assets in the main game, with some edits and pallet swap to keep things as fresh as possible which would reduce the graphical needs for this stretch goal, although there will still definitely be new graphical assets in here. Most of the effort will therefore be allocated into designing the stage, mapping, enemies and bosses of this area. As such, this is what we consider to be the easiest of the stretch goals and the one we feel the most confident about.\nThe Will of the Guardian Witch\nWhile we cannot go into detail about our current plans for the game after the defeat of the 8  Guardians, we can say that there are already a significant amount of contents that follows in the work. Our second stretch goal, if met, is to further increase the amount of post-Guardian contents to a level that would feel epic including some extra screen time for the Fount Guardians themselves!\nUnfortunately, unlike the first goal, we really can\u2019t go into too much detail with this one. But it will be graphically intensive in terms of required assets and it\u2019ll also need quite a bit of extra programming done to make it happen. But we will say this. If it does happen, then expect the post-Guardian saga to be as lengthy, if not lengthier than the  Guardian saga!\nAlso, if we reach this stretch goal, we'll provide voice acting to all of the main story cutscenes.\nIngrid the Just and her guiding moonlight.\nThroughout the game, Gastova would often receive communications from Ingrid, her childhood friend and a Knight of a neighboring city. While Gastova is taking care of the Fount Guadians, Ingrid is also having an adventure of her own that ties into the overarching story. Our third stretch goal is simple; we\u2019ll make Ingrid fully playable, with a standalone campaign comparable to that of Gastova\u2019s. \nIngrid's story will play slightly differently than that of Gastova's. Whereas Gastova's gameplay revolves heavily on exploration of various areas and traveling between them, Ingrid's story will more closely resemble that of a classic platformer game, where you pick a stage, and advance from one end of the map to the other to fight the stage boss.\nAs Ingrid will not be fighting the Fount Guardians, her story will require a massive amount of additional graphical assets and will no doubt be the hardest stretch goal to pull off.\nHowever, if we actually do reach this milestone, we will absolutely make sure that we fulfill our promise and deliver an experience that you will not easily forget.\n\nGastova, the loafing Guardian Witch of Arkana\nNephelle, the serious Guardian of the Gale Fount\nRosalia, the dignified Guardian of the Nature Fount\nFelicity, the energetic Guardian of the Fire Fount\nSierra, the perpetually frowning Guardian of the Earth Fount\nIsabelle, the shy Guardian of the Spirit Fount\nNanami, the serene Guardian of the Water Fount\nTenebrea, the eccentric Guardian of the Ice Fount\nAldebaran, the mighty Guardian of the Light Fount\nIngrid, the 13th seat of the Oathsworn", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we have some physical goods to be fulfilled, we are confident in our ability to handle it in the schedule we've outlined.

We got you! You can watch this video instead of reading the article. It also has subtitles in case our accents are too much to handle!\n\nVibrant Venture is a singleplayer 2D adventure platformer game mixed with on the fly puzzle solving! The game features four playable characters each with two unique abilities. By switching between these characters, you can combine their abilities for extremely versatile, fluid and fun movement! The main focus of the game is traditional platforming combined with responsive and open-ended controls in a challenging environment which constantly gives the player fun and rewarding experiences. This also means there are often multiple ways to clear different sections!\nThe game also features an in-game level creator to give you the tools to easily create your own custom levels! You can even modify settings for objects such as the speed of enemies, the path of moving platforms, and so on!\nThe game is playable on keyboard/mouse and Xinput devices! It will be available for Mac and Windows at launch on Steam, and with enough support we would love to port it to consoles like the Nintendo Switch! \nThe base game will feature a total of approximately 22 huge levels (including more bonus stages!) split into multiple unique environment with 5 bosses. This is what we call the campaign mode. It will be filled with goofy cutscenes, tons of charm, and a cast of quirky characters helping to save the day! I've also been working on a level creator, which will be part of the first release with a set of tools and features we intend to expand upon in future updates! Custom levels are stored as a single text file for easy sharing and to make it easily intetragable with Steam Workshop in the future!\n\nWe have a ton of ideas for additional content such as levels where you play as the villain, Violastro, a custom hats/accessories creator, more level builder content, more campaign levels/bosses and so on! Regardless of the level of support we receive, we plan on keeping the game fresh with additional content through its lifespan!\n\nSemag Games is actually just a group of friends \"disguised\" as a company! We all enjoy creating different aspects of video games in our spare time and thus we decided to combine our abilities and form this wacky game called Vibrant Venture.\nMy name is Pattrigue and I'm the lead developer for the game, which means I program, design, test, plan... basically everything that isn't drawing! I study software engineering in college and have been programming in my spare time for around 5 years.\nJurl is the game's artist. He does all the really cool pixel graphics for the game! Jurl studies game design and game art in college and is constantly improving in both pixel art, free-form art, 3D modelling and all sorts of other visually pleasing things!\nBumbleGum is the game's designer/sketcher/general man of many ideas. He outlines, sketches and describes all the content in the game like mechanics, enemies, etc. BumbleGum is extremely passionate about game design and a master of unique concepts!\nThe music is composed by Christoph Jakob, a freelance composer. I picked him because his ability to capture the fun and adventurous atmosphere is fantastic!\nBesides the previously listed members, we have a group of friends who voluntarily tests the game in order to minimize the amount of bugs and issues present within, most notably Erion. This mad lad will sometimes dedicate several hours to finding reproduction steps for a single bug and we're extremely lucky to have his help! He also helps us design certain aspects of the game and polish different mechanics.\n\nRoughly 30%-40% of the game has been completed so far in terms of base content all funded by our personal savings. In order to continue creating the game however, we need your help. It's our goal to finish this game no matter how long it takes, but we can't continue keeping it afloat with our own savings. Music, assets and legal necessities (like having an accountant help us not end up in court - which is nice) are all expenses we must pay in order to fulfill our visions for this game. On top of that, we're students trying to live normal lives while working on the game as soon as our otherwise busy schedules allow it. \nThe more financially stable we are, the more motivated we are to dedicating our precious free time to the game without worrying about food, bills and other boring adult things. On a more personal level, I want to compensate everyone who has helped me bring this project to life.\nIf we reach our goal, the base game should hopefully be finished in 2021 as long as a minimal amount of unforeseen events pop up. Any leftover money is going to help us extend the base game, develop future content updates and hopefully more projects in the future!  \n Thank you for your support! This project means a lot to us and we will give it all the care and attention it needs to ensure it's polished and fun to play <3  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team consists of people developing this game as a hobby - we're either enrolled in college or working for a living. The biggest hurdle we have is finding time to commit to the game while balancing our personal lives at the same time. Luckily that's what this Kickstarter is for! With the additional funding we can safely allocate more time out of each of our lives to completing the project and making it the best game we can.\n\nWe have been developing this game for over a year now. During this period, we've constantly been communicating with fans about the development of the game from title screens to core gameplay changes. We have stayed in touch because players and feedback is important to us. Without either, there is no game. \n\nIn terms of technical difficulties, I'm not too worried since we've already fleshed out the majority of the systems like menus, saving and loading, mechanics, core gameplay, etc. So far I've managed to solve even the most challenging technical issues, but from time to time unexpected difficulties will occur which may take a long time to address.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge DKK 68 or more", "title": "Digital copy of the game", "descp": "(Approx. $10 USD, \u20ac9 EUR)\nYou get a digital download of the game when it's released!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["54 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 102 or more", "title": "Discord role and name in credits", "descp": "(Approx. $15 USD, \u20ac13.5 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server and your name in the game's credits!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 169 or more", "title": "Game OST and HD wallpapers", "descp": "(Approx. $25 USD, \u20ac22.5 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download and HD wallpapers!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 270 or more", "title": "Beta Access", "descp": "(Approx. $40 USD, \u20ac36 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers and early access to the game before the public release!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 338 or more", "title": "Stickers", "descp": "(Approx. $50 USD, \u20ac45 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers, early access to the game before the public release and a sticker sheet!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 676 or more", "title": "Poster", "descp": "(Approx. $100 USD, \u20ac90 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers, early access to the game before the public release and a cool poster!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 812 or more", "title": "Poster + stickers", "descp": "(Approx. $120 USD, \u20ac109 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers, early access to the game before the public release, sticker sheet and a cool poster!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 5,046 or more", "title": "Everything + BONUS LEVEL!", "descp": "(Approx. $750 USD, \u20ac675 EUR)\nYou're actually insane!\nYou get to work with us and design A BONUS LEVEL!

Sealed from the world ages before, he unleashed it anew, dabbling in those strange cards he found there.\nAs he did, the magic of the unknown, of possibilities, of chance, returned to the world, clearly opposed to the stable rigidity and orderly harmony the Four Archetypes. The powers-that-be felt this dissonance, seeing this inevitable change to be a threat to the way of life of everyone in the world.\nA crusade from all nations, far and wide, was called. Justified on the writings of an ancient prophecy, the influence of the Stranger must be sealed again as it mustn\u2019t corrupt the order of The World lest it is destroyed. Bold adventurers from all places and walks of life travel to the land in order to raid the Tower of Potential, stop whoever beckoned its wicked force and return it to its ancient prison.\nYou play as one of these adventurers, traveling to the base camp of the crusade, now called Adventurer's Town, in search of fame, justice or just because she was told to\u2026\nAt the start of the game, an adventurer is selected. Each character has a unique starting deck featuring two archetypes and a unique curio, guiding your initial play-style and giving you an extra step towards building those archetypes.\nPlayable Character - Starting Deck: Oracle & Raider\nRegardless of your initial decision, you may branch out and create any deck you want in the game.\nPlayable Character - Starting Deck: Traveler & Warden\nDungeon crawling is a major aspect of Dungeon Drafters, and while on your journey for cards, fame, and loot, you'll encounter five different dungeons, plus the mysterious Tower of Potential for the true adventurers.\nConcept art for Dune Dome - one of the six dungeons\nDifferent dungeons have their own style, featuring monsters that may teleport, heal, absorb damage or cause massive damage. Beating the final boss of each Dungeon will require a lot of effort. Learn the tricks of each dungeon, make adjustments in your deck and dive further!\nEach dungeon has a unique set of monsters. Learn their tricks and abilities to dive further!\nDungeon Drafters has fishing in it. You may be wondering, \"Why?\" Dear adventurer, you know in your heart the answer to that all-important question: You simply cannot make a good RPG without a fishing minigame in it. It's the glue that keeps the game together. Also, it's fun!\n\"JRPG needs fishing.\" - Yoko Taro\nInspired by the great RPG soundtracks from the past, Dungeon Drafters comes filled with chiptune joy.

Do we still remember who we were outside of this dungeon?\nSelf: The Ancient - You have been in this dungeon longer than anyone else, and you know your fate. You have secret agendas in this dungeon.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $1,500: (UNLOCKED!) Brandon Leon-Gambetta\nBrandon Leon-Gambetta (Pasi\u00f3n de las Pasiones) is the screaming voice from deeper down down ever deeper down. Each discarded skull in this dungeon rattles with his podcasts' names, dreadful names that hiss Stop, Hack, & Roll Network & Protean City Comics. If he were to be found and he won't be found so lost is he, it would be at @bleongambetta.\nRoom: The Maw - They feed this dungeon with offerings. You travel ever tiring the sound of your breath heavy. They feed this dungeon with offerings. You know you've lost companions and you aren't the only ones to do so. They feed this dungeon with offerings. Where do the bodies go and why do they feed this dungeon with offerings? The maw takes the offerings.\nSelf: The Hound - They brought you into this dungeon because you can always find things and they thought you could find the exit of this dungeon. You tell them you can but you can never know if you are truly  smelling a trace of clean air in the rot or if you are chasing a trail long gone cold.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $2,000: (UNLOCKED!) Mahar Abrera Mangahas!\nMahar is a queer game designer from the Philippines who currently lives and works in Hong Kong. He tries to make games that are meaningful tools that reflect his cultures and background in music, theatre, and psychology.  He specialises in dramaturgy, or someone who looks at the theory and practice behind a dramatic composition or narrative. When not being a nerd he's otherwise asking people to support Session Zero or crying over people's beautiful games. Mahar's games can be found on http://maharhar.itch.io.\nRoom: The Hearth - Every dungeon has a place that feels warm and safe. That is a lie. Even a dungeon has its respite. That is a lie. Every sanctuary, every campfire, every place you caught your breath; that is a lie.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $2,500: (UNLOCKED!) Samantha Day!\nSamantha Day is a writer and designer from upstate New York. You can find her on Twitter @passerines, and you can find the things she makes at http://passerines.itch.io. She is a threat to her environment and she refuses to go extinct.\nRoom: The Crucible - You may not have done terrible things outside of this dungeon but you have almost certainly done terrible things inside this dungeon to survive this dungeon and before you can escape this dungeon your deeds must be tallied and accounted for. Your soul will be weighed. Will it be found wanting? Does it even matter?\nSelf: The Saint - You came to this dungeon to hear the voice of your Divine in the quiet hollow space of the world. You came to this dungeon to bring a light into dark places and a darkness into the light. You came to this dungeon. You came to this dungeon. There is no escape from this dungeon.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $3,000: (UNLOCKED!) Pamela Punzalan!\nPamela Punzalan (aka Pammu) grew up rolling dice and wanting to design video games, went for teaching and the academe instead, left those fields, stumbled into the legal practices behind real estate brokerage, occupied herself with pushing community spaces for women and LGBTQIA+ folks in her locale, then stumbled into tabletop game design. She's currently based in Manila, and loves to design things that look at the strange, the intimate, and the queer. You can follow her on Twitter @TheDovetailor.\nRoom: The Altar - After a small eternity of deep shadows, terrible odds, and grueling fights, stumbling upon a spot of quiet unspoiled by monsters can be jarring. But this is not a place where mortals can walk free. This is a god's hallow, a resting place of an Other. They watch. They listen. They demand supplication.\nSelf: The Gravedigger - Nothing stays buried for too long in a dungeon that never ends. Bones, bodies, treasure, love and memories are only as heavy as their attachments. You're comfortable in the in-between space of clinging hard to what seems ready to pass, and letting go of that which has no desire to leave.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $3,500: (UNLOCKED!) Natalie The Knife\nNatalie (she/her) is a trans game designer from Minneapolis, Minnesota. She designs and publishes roleplaying games with a focus on novel mechanics and player support. Natalie's other games can be found at rpgnatalie.itch.io.\nRoom: The Mirror - What lives here is a reflection of you yourselves. Perhaps twisted; perhaps true. Whatever it is, watch out.\nSelf: The Naturalist -Everything has a self, but only you know how to speak the hidden tongues.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $4,000: (UNLOCKED!) Jay Dragon\nJay Dragon (Ask me about my pronouns!) is a young queer game designer and summer camp counselor. She writes lyrical games about feelings, friendship, community, and horror.\nRoom: The Meadow - The walls of the room fall away into fields of flowers and a brilliant constant sunrise. The dew is everywhere, and crickets thrive in the grass. You could spend forever here. But where is the door? And why are you so, so tired?\nSelf: The Mote - We all need a light in the darkness, to navigate this Dungeon. It doesn't feel good to be told that that's all we're good for, a whisp on the wind or a lantern hung in the air. But, let's be honest. That's all the Mote really is. A discardable torch.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $4,500: (UNLOCKED!) Viditya Voleti\nViditya Voleti is an interactive artist and game designer who makes great stuff. He\u2019s been described as Prolific, Awe-inspiring, Has Great Hair, Exudes Pure Goblin Energy, and much more. His work and design reflects these, as Viditya has made straight bangers like Space Goblins!, Spellchitects, Space Between Stars, and Apprentice Quest. You can find his work on vidityavoleti.itch.io and follow him on Twitter @vidityavoleti.\nRoom: The Stars - This room tells of legends, long gone. Stories familiar and guiding, tragic and harrowing. What is learned will stick with you.\nSelf: The Goblin - You come from this dungeon, or one just like it. Others do not understand how you work, or are often quick to dismiss or suspect your actions. Only you understand your rules and the rules of this dungeon, because what will kill you is not this dungeon but those you travel with to seek an exit.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $5,000: (UNLOCKED!) Aaron King\nAaron King lives in Minneapolis, petsitting and making zines. They try to stay technically unemployed as much as possible.\nRoom: The Sporatorium - The fungi here want to communicate, but their spore talk hurts those who are unlike them. One of us is harmed on entering. We must decide who. Each painful inhalation brings us closer to understanding. We must decide whether to keep trying or to fight our way free.\nSelf: The Automaton - You awaken. Good. You were created by another. You are filled with coldly distributed elements and magic devices. This is your programming, and we are speaking to you now. D O   N O T   M A K E   M O R E   A U T O M A T O N S .\nSTRETCH GOAL - $5,500: CROWS DANGER\nCROWS DANGER is a swarm of birds haunting downtown Minneapolis. She is the author of Fight Truck and Petals, or when you fall for her, and seeks to create works that celebrate passionate imperfection.\nRoom: The Ceremony - The dungeon demands blood and wine, ash and soil. Follow the patterns on the walls, perform the rituals with your hands, and you will be different. You will leave someone behind, in this dungeon. You will find someone, in this dungeon. You will not be the same and you will be different.\nSelf: The Witch - You came to this dungeon because your skills are desired. You came to this dungeon because your skills are reviled. In this dungeon, you will do the workings no one else will. In this dungeon, you will do the workings you know in your heart. You stand at the edge of rejection and scorn, at the edge of isolation and outrage; they call you wicked, and you laugh.\nThe Treasure At The End Of This Dungeon Is An Escape From This Dungeon And We Will Never Escape From This Dungeon\nWe are bone and feathers and we will never escape and we want to escape. We want to fly. The treasure at the end of the dungeon is an escape from this dungeon. We will never escape from this dungeon. We are bones and feathers and hope and magic and we will never escape from this dungeon. We want to fly out of here on our busted wings and feel the air on our faces turned up towards the sun, but each room of the dungeon is the same and each room of the dungeon brings something new and we will never escape from this dungeon.\nEach room of this dungeon unlocks more of this dungeon. There are five rooms in this dungeon, and there are many rooms more than five in this dungeon. We have each died in one of the rooms in this dungeon, and we will each die many times more in each of the rooms of this dungeon. Each room of this dungeon is different but each room of this dungeon is the same, only growing larger with each time we enter each room of this dungeon. As we crawl we repeat, the cycle is always the same and we have different faces, the guardians are different beasts, the traps are different traps, the deaths are different deaths, and the treasure is always the same. The treasure at the end of this dungeon is an escape from this dungeon and we will never escape from this dungeon.\nAn image of a circus ticket written \"What is this dungeon? It is a kaleidoscopic roguelike dungeon crawl created by Riverhouse Games. There is no way out of here.\"\n\"some of the most beautiful, poetic game design you can get, a super fun looking story game of a roguelike, AND it's freaking gorgeous.\" - Brandon Leon-Gambetta, game designer & podcaster.\nThis is a roleplaying game for four players and no GM. Each room of this dungeon is different and has its own rules. Each of us crawling this dungeon is different and has our own rules. This is a kaleidoscopic game of an increasingly complicated dungeon from which there is no escape, and what happens to us as we die within its walls.\nThe game is meant for one to four players, each playing a Self, representing the four archetypes of dungeon crawl games: The Muscle, The Thief, The Mage, and The Healer. Each Self has special rules that will alter the play of This Dungeon.\nA screenshot of The Mage Self, with rules about how to cast spells, and how your magic becomes more entangled the more you die.\nAs the Selves crawl through This Dungeon, they enter one of five rooms, and one of an infinite number of rooms. Each Room follows a different dungeon crawl trope, like a Gatekeeper, a Trap, a Puzzle, or a Fight. Pretty straightforward, right?\nA screenshot of The Battle Room, with instructions on how to play out the fights that will happen in this Room.\nThe doors to the Rooms are incredibly heavy. So much so that opening more than one takes all your life from you. Your Self will die, and will change, and as you change so will This Dungeon. You will open the doors to each Room many times, each time spiraling off the Room into a kaleidoscope fractal of evolving Dungeon. \nThis is a Dungeon Crawl Horror Game where the monster is the Dungeon Crawl Genre.\nA fantasy ticket with two wood-cut style knights. The text reads \"What is being funded? A print run of zines and shipping to backers plus any back-stock to sell at conventions. The game is finished already, totally done!\"\nThe game is completely finished! The funds from the Kickstarter will go to producing the copies that will be sent to backers, and cover the shipping costs. Any left over funds will help me pay off student loans, car payments, and credit debt. \nA spread of printed zines, looking gorgeous and ready to ship", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game is finished, with completed art & layout.

Expect to get a couple hours out of it on the first play through! This is an early alpha build of the game so you may run into some issues but otherwise I hope you like it! Controller is HIGHLY recommended!\nConsider following my social media! I HIGHLY recommend my Twitter and Discord!\n Twitter / Discord / Facebook / YouTube \nFunded! - $6500 (REACHED!)\n Nintendo Switch Version - Rose of Starcross has made its initial funding goal which was primarily to support Nintendo Switch development costs! THANK YOU! You're awesome!\n\nStretch Goal 1 - $10,000 (REACHED!)\nMore DCTV Archive footage like this interview with the Father of Starcross Himself!  These will be short videos that can be anything! They can be interviews, sketches, teasers, music oriented, or whatever! These will be great because they won't eat dev time since many of them will be put INTO the game as optional fun content, they will be made using assets from the game, and I can make them pretty fast! I'm not planning to do Early Access or a major Beta test for the game so these would be a cool way to keep giving you guys stuff to chew on and enjoy! I'd like to do one every month or so!\n Wallpapers, Stickers, and Pins! - A $40 tier will be added that will include a sticker sheet with 4 stickers and a pin! These rewards will also be added to all higher tiers! Digital wallpapers will be added to the $25 tier and above. (Shipping only available in the United States)\n\nStretch Goal 2 - PS4 version - $15,000\n PS4 Version! Pretty self explanatory! The game will be released on PS4 too! If this goal is met, any copy of the game can be redeemed as any available option (PC, Switch, PS4) but that won't really matter because...\n Extra copy of the game! Anyone who has pledged at least enough to get a copy of the game, will get another extra copy of the game! Use it for whatever you like! So if you want to, consider upgrading to the OST tier or the new merch tier to get us closer to this goal!\n\nWhat the heck is this??\nIt's an RPG! Rose of Starcross takes inspiration from stuff like The Legend of Zelda, Mario, the MOTHER series, tons of modern indies, Golden Sun, Punch-Out!!, the Souls series, old anime, Scott Pilgrim, Steven Universe, moody lo-fi garbage, modern prog, and about a BILLION other things! Really it's everything I care about put together (which is pretty much just music, video games, and atmospheric stuff)!\nThe Story\n300 years ago, a being known as the Beast appeared and began to tear Starcross apart with cataclysmic magic. This event resulted in the death of almost all of the humans and set in motion the rise of the Undead, the creation of the Anims, and the birth of the Demons... As the world was about to see its absolute end, a being known as the Heavenly Queen rose up to challenge the Beast and the magic it was using to attack Starcross. After their battle, the Heavenly Queen was left mortally wounded and the Beast was destroyed. However, its magic was not gone, and the Heavenly Queen chose to seal herself in the Door locked behind the Rose so that she may one day return with her strength recovered to heal Starcross. Only a single sword was left as the key to re-opening the door and ending her slumber... but again, that was 300 years ago!\nThings might not be so awful now! Or they might be! Depends on who you ask but honestly things have gotten along pretty well thanks to the leadership of some really impressive individuals! A notable feat is that Demons, Anims, and humans live very much in harmony. The Door locked behind the Rose, the Sword, and Mt. Starcross itself are also pretty fun tourist attractions now! So whether or not you even believe that stuff about the Beast and the Heavenly Queen and blahblahblah, you gotta admit that a lot of people seem happy enough!\nNow who knows what would happen if some unknown, idiot kid just came along and actually pulled the sword up. But I doubt we'll ever have to worry about that! Schools out! Summer just started! A perfect time to take a vacation! Go have fun!\nCharacters\nViscera and Annie\nViscera (\"Pronounced 'Viss-air-uh!'\") is normally running her Cafe on the top of Mt. Starcross, and when she's not, she's probably trying to pull the sword, running errands, or spending time with Annie! Annie (short for Anacrusis) is normally at school, and when she's not, she's probably in her room or spending time with Viscera! Viscera and Annie also happen to be witches! Well, mostly Viscera. They are pretty well known in Starcross as the only known humans that are able to use magic! Again, mostly Viscera!\n\n **If some of the GIFs on this page aren't animating (like the one below), playing the video should help them load properly after a couple seconds!**\nA regular occurrence\nDjinn (the Demon) and Tonic (the pumpkin child)\n Djinn and Tonic - a Demon and an Anim pumpkin. Entrepreneurs, purveyors of fine food and drink, handsome, and Long time friends to Viscera and Annie!\nA fateful encounter\nThere will be a large cast of major characters, minor characters, and one-off NPCs, but this is all I can give you right now! We'll see who else we can get on here during the campaign, if they're not too busy with other interviews, of course.\n\nEXPLORATION\nRose of Starcross has been designed to have a pseudo 3D environment meaning... PLATFORMING! I put a lot of work into this since platforming and more interesting movement mechanics in the overworld can be used to create challenges on their own, complement puzzle mechanics, and REALLY enhance exploration and secrets!\nUse magic in the overworld to explore, interact, and solve puzzles in interesting and different ways!\n4 large main areas each with a \"dungeon\" (Not including the first area and dungeon in the Demo)\nOpen design for the main areas and dungeons\nTons of optional things to do in the overworld! Some will be small challenges with little rewards, some will have stories, and some will be full on optional side quests!\nLearning about the world itself will be a matter of you going out and learning about it, picking up on context clues in the environment, and speaking to NPCs. The main story of the game is largely focused on the characters and the scenarios you find yourself in.\n**If some of the GIFs on this page aren't animating, playing the video should help them load properly after a couple seconds!**\nPlatforming and challenges! (If you think something looks too tough OR too boring - don't worry there will be difficulty settings for this stuff too!)\nUse the \"Rose\" ability on magic pads to activate a variety of context specific abilities in the overworld!\nUse the \"Leaf\" magic for stuff like this!\nUse the \"Arrow\" ability for stuff like this!\nBATTLE SYSTEM\n Defending - Enemy attacks can come from above, the left, the right, the ground, or multiple directions at once! All damage can be avoided through blocking, jumping, and \u201cLeaf\u201d dodging!\n Attacking - Mini-game based attacks determine how much damage you do and/or how many successive hits you do. The mini-games are balanced differently or changed based on which enemies you are fighting or what location you\u2019re fighting in!\n Enemy Stats - Enemy defensive stats and abilities are balanced so they could be anywhere from extremely weak to certain attacks to completely immune to them!\n Enemy Emotional Status - Enemies' emotional status can further alter their stats!\n Taunting - Taunts replace a standard DEFEND/FLEE option and can have a variety of different effects on yourself, the enemies, or both! (And maybe some environments?)\n Fleeing battle - There is no RNG-based fleeing option, instead the \"Dispel Rocks\" item can get you out of any battle that you CAN flee! (Can't be used in Boss battles/etc)\n Scoring System - A scoring system will take into account things like efficiency (turns taken), final HP, item use, number of successful perfect blocks, etc to yield higher rewards in battle! (The current version in the demo is pretty basic but will be improved in the final game!)\nDefense!\nSpecial Attacks!\nRose Magic - Play a randomized mini-game to use a powerful AoE attack that does a single strong blast of damage to every enemy! As you get further into the game, more mini-games will be thrown into the mix to keep it more engaging and a bit more tense!\nArrow Magic - Fire multiple arrows at any target(s). Enemy targets are based on their battle positions. Targets can also be blocked by others depending on their position!\nRPG AND PROGRESSION ELEMENTS\n Leveling - Max HP, max MP, max RP (Ring Points), and max Leaf Meter can all be increased by using items like the \"Star Pop\" in the demo! Level up items can be found in different ways by exploring, doing optional mini-dungeons/tasks, or buying them! This is a Zelda thing that I really love and I've always preferred to experience points!\n Rings - Equipping rings can give you new attacks, new taunts, HP/MP/Leaf Meter regeneration, faster battle speed, better stealth in the overworld, more rewards from battle, higher encounter meter, specialized overworld effects, etc! Every ring has its own RP cost so your max RP will determine how many ring combinations you can do!\nDIFFICULTY AND SPECIAL GAME MODES\nDifficulty - The current goal is to keep the normal game fairly challenging so you can feel accomplished when you overcome tough moments! However, I really like having options and everyone's needs are different. I'm going to put as much effort as I can into the alternate difficulties with things as far as alternate enemy animations (especially bosses), revised encounters, and an altered overworld. Lots of individual settings can be customized as well, even down to how tight the window for perfect blocking is! I'm doing my best to make fun alternate difficulties.\nSpecial Modes - I have some fun ideas for more fundamental game altering settings aimed to make repeat playthroughs different. The \"Traditional Mode\" below is an example! (This mode is definitely getting into the game, another mode is a secret, and I have some other ideas that I don't want to commit to yet so this is all you get here!)\nTraditional Mode - Okay blocking and perfect blocking reduce damage to 66% and 33% respectively instead of 50% and 0%. This means your reaction skill will still be tested, but item management and battle optimization will be much more necessary and interwoven into the challenge like more traditional RPGs. ~This mode is actually mostly for me since I know every enemy animation and attack better than the back of my hand but I'm sure there's someone out there who will get familiar enough with the game to really appreciate this mode!~ \nStarcross is a colorful, complex, and surreal place! It's also made up of some of my favorite types of places to explore in games! Like most adventurous RPGs there's a healthy balance between small-scale cozy areas and large-scale set pieces, all of which I do my best to fill with detail, story-telling, and secrets!\nThe Moving Fair that's on Mt. Starcross for the weekend!\nBlue Apartment\nA beach side Resort\nRooftop view of the Demon City Plaza\nMountain Fog\nView from a quieter place\n\nMUSIC\nRose of Starcross will have a fully original Soundtrack done by me! This entire project started a long time ago with JUST music, so it's extremely important to me that I give you some cool sounds. I like to write music with whatever I think works best for that song or moment in the game so I'm not trying to make the whole OST sound like an NES or SNES soundtrack or anything like that, but I love the way that stuff sounds so a lot of the music is meant to mimic those eras! But if I feel like throwing in some Queen guitars I probably will! Here are some examples of stuff I'm putting effort in to!\nDifferent battle themes for each major area and dungeon\nExtended cutscenes and events that are timed to the music\nCompletely unique boss and mini-boss tracks\nSoundscape and atmospheric tracks\nDynamic track shifting and layering for certain moments\nAnd here are a couple tracks taken right out of the Demo and some links to the full Demo OST!\n Bandcamp (Full OST + Quality Download) \n Soundcloud (Full OST) \n Youtube (Full OST) \nArea Battle Theme (with intro): \nCute short one:\nArea Theme: \nBoss Theme (if you're planning on playing the demo and haven't yet, please don't spoil yourself!): \n\nCONCEPTS AND SCREENSHOTS\n\nWho is making this garbage?\nMe! My name is Peyton Burnham and everything in Rose of Starcross has been completely done by me, as evidenced by the fact that there was no one else here to tell me it's not a good idea to refer to my own game as garbage. In all seriousness I love everything about making this game. My absolute favorite things in the world are writing music, writing stories, playing video games, game design, and animation! Specifically the art form of animation. Not the process of animation. The process of animation often makes me want to die. But FINISHING a good animation makes me feel like the absolute coolest kid on the block so it balances out! ANYWAYS if you play the demo of this game you probably have a pretty good idea of who I am!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe main reason I'm doing a Kickstarter is so I can cover the cost for Nintendo Switch development! I would love more than anything to be able to release this game on a console! And as previously mentioned, I really care about the music. Some of the money will be going to improving the soundtrack with some really interesting plugins and instruments! Likewise there will be CD manufacturing costs for the physical OST tier. I have a lot of other things in mind that could really improve my work but I've set the base goal to mostly account for that stuff and Kickstarter's fees!\nProgress\nThat's a tough one since this is my first game! It took a while to make a few of these systems and to get them working properly so the demo took a good while with revisions. However, I've been working on the next area of the game and it's going smoothly! I'd say the Demo is maybe 1/8th or less of the final game (Including the planned optional content), but like I said it's been going much faster than putting the demo together took and pretty much all of the major systems are in now! I suspect I have around 2 years left before I finish the game.\nTHANK YOU!\nIf you got to the bottom of this giant page then thank you for checking out my game and giving me a little bit of your time!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOn the technical side I've already tackled pretty much all of the big hurdles. All of the major systems have been implemented and while they will require more testing and polish, I'm completely confident that I can execute on this vision! As I mentioned, this is still my first game so I have a hard time gauging how long certain tasks will take. The biggest risk is that the game will take longer to finish than I expect. I'm currently expecting the game should take about 2 more years to finish, it'll most likely be a fairly large game but now that all of the systems are in place, the process should move a good bit faster.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Cool Kid", "descp": "Support the game, keep track of the campaign, and get your name in the credits!\nINCLUDES:\nBacker-exclusive updates\nPride\nName in the Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2022"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Get the Game", "descp": "Get a copy of the game!
