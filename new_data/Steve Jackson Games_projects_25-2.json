[{"backer": "Steve Jackson Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Zero-to-Hero with the Dungeon Fantasy RPG \nEven the mightiest delver started somewhere. An apprentice, a squire or man-at-arms, a backup singer with The Backstreet Bards.\nDelvers to Grow allows you to take the part of those starting characters, supporting starting play as low as 62 points.  Delvers to Grow provides pre-built modules and packages enabling a player to create a capable, playable character in minutes. \nGet gaming. Fast.\nFully compatible with the professional template system in the Dungeon Fantasy RPG Adventurers book, Delvers to Grow lets you start much earlier in the hero\u2019s journey, letting both players and GMs ease into the full breadth of capability that the professional delvers of the Dungeon Fantasy RPG bring to the table.\nExplore different challenges or use the modules to effortlessly assemble henchmen...or create a starting character to replace the dearly departed.\nRoll and Shout with Delvers to Grow\nThe Delvers to Grow project supports these goals:\nPlay at point levels lower than the 250-point professional templates in the Dungeon Fantasy RPG boxed set for those who prefer lower tier adventuring.\nEnable getting new players (and old ones!) to the table in minutes by helping minimize \"decision lag\" during character generation.\nIn the main book, Kevin Smyth, author of Nor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk and Hand of Asgard, does most of the work for you, enabling character generation with only a handful of vital decisions. Playtesting revealed the characters thus generated to be both eminently playable...and surprisingly robust!\nThat doesn't mean the fun of character generation and tweaking in Powered by GURPS books is lost...use Delvers to Grow to quickly get in the right ballpark for the chosen profession...and then tweak to taste!\nThe Delvers to Grow project contains four volumes: the construction portions plus three example books. These detail how each of the 12 professions treated in the \"build-a-Bj\u00f6rn\" construction book grow from a 62-point novice to a 187-point master.\nThese fully worked examples include loadouts, traits, and spells and abilities where appropriate.\n Delvers to Grow. The main volume contains the building blocks to quickly make characters based on 62, 125, and 187-point templates...conveniently matching the values for Hirelings from Exploits. Choose a base template, add basic and advanced professional modules, upgrade the character to make them unique, and then choose disadvantage packages. Loadouts and spell lists are also given the package-deal treatment, to allow fast selection of key equipment and thematic powers. \n Fast Delvers. The thief, martial artist, swashbuckler, and scout specialize in precision and deadly accuracy. The Fast Delvers book provides examples for each template and profession. 16 pages.\n Smart Delvers. Spellcasters here! The bard, cleric, druid, and wizard get the Delvers to Grow treatment. Smart Delvers gives examples for creating and tuning spellcasters. 16 pages.\n Strong Delvers. Want to be a mountain of meat? You can be. The barbarian, holy warrior,  knight, and wrestler professions get the workout, the loadout, and the keen edge they need to hit the dungeon fast. 16 pages.\nThese four books comprise the Delvers to Grow material, presented separately for the convenience of the GM and players, much like the Dungeon Fantasy RPG books (Adventurers, Exploits, Spells, and Monsters) are split into smaller chunks.\nThis is a sample layout for the introductory pages. Right now, it's text-dense for playtesting, but some spacer and topical art is certain to be added to make it easier on the eyes. \nHaving the ability to quickly generate characters, ready-to-play in 5 to 20 minutes, is only as good as the adventures you have ready. Fortunately, long-time GURPS writer and blogger Peter Dell\u2019Orto has paired with one of his Felltower players, Marshall LaPira, to bring you The Crypt of Krysuvik.\n\nIn The Hunted Lands northwest of Nordvorn, The bandit Krysuvik is said to have gathered much ill-gotten plunder, and taken it to his grave. It is yours . . . if you can find it and take it. Delvers have tried and failed to find his hoard. But a new clue has come to light that might put adventurers on the true trail of the treasure. The Crypt of Krysuvik provides details for the various locations that contain the clues \u2013 and tricks, traps, and monsters \u2013 that lead to the treasure. Slay, sneak, and negotiate your way to wealth using your own Delvers to Go or the included pre-generated characters.\n\nThis adventure is tuned to 125-150 point characters, making it a perfect entry into adventure in the dangerous lands beyond the Palisade.\nThe Crypt of Krysuvik is also available as an add-on in both PDF-only ($10) and Print+PDF ($20) for those whose pledge level doesn't already include it.\nThe details for each reward level can be found below. \n$35 - PDF only\n$70 - Print and PDF\nThis reward level provides the basic building blocks, complete with ready-to-use worked examples, of character construction with Delvers to Grow. It includes the basic book - referred to unofficially as Build-a-Bj\u00f6rn - as well as the three example books showing growth from a hireling-level starting character to within a stone's short throw of the 250-point professional templates found in the Dungeon Fantasy RPG boxed set.\nTo ensure you can start play right away, it also includes The Crypt of Krysuvik adventure!\nAll unlocked physical and digital stretch goals are included with the Print+PDF reward level; digital stretch goals are included with the PDF-only reward level. All rewards containing the Delvers to Grow PDF will also receive GCA5/GCS files to allow even faster character generation as soon as they can be completed and made available.\n (Covers for Fast, Smart, and Strong Delvers are still in the design stage)\n$40 - PDF only\n$90 - Print and PDF\nThis reward level provides the character generation resources available from Gaming Ballistic to tune characters even further. \nIt includes all four Delvers to Grow volumes, plus:\n Hand of Asgard provides customized cleric templates (and over 20 new Holy Abilities) to allow following an aspect of the Aesir instead of the pantheon as a whole.\nNordlondr Folk gives 16 example racial templates, from the dvergr to fae gnomes, the part-infernal eldhu\u00f0 to the divinely begat himneskur. Plus trigers. Hey, a wizard did it.\nThis \"construction kit\" doesn't include the Crypt of Krysuvik adventure, but it is, of course, available as an add-on during the campaign itself.\nAll unlocked physical and digital stretch goals are included with the Print+PDF reward level; digital stretch goals are included with the PDF-only reward level.\n$100 - PDF only\n$225 - Print and PDF\nThe Nordlond setting for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG keeps growing, and if you are just starting out...here's a chance to catch up all at once.

Each goal provides a volume in the new Ready to Raid series, featuring pre-made characters with some personality and stats for used as pre-generated characters, adversaries, hirelings, or supporting cast.\nReady to Raid: Bandits and Outlaws\nEvery adventure needs bad guys. And in Nordlond, being outcast has significant social problems. Some of the outlaws in this 24-page book are hidden in plain sight, while others rove through the wilds, preying on travelers. Can they be redeemed? Were they wrongly accused? Or are they simply a pestilence to be put down? Each is a complete character, with a bit of background, stats, equipment, and suggested use. Includes a full color icon for each character.\nReady to Raid: Spellcasters\nThis 24-page book contains spellcasters, some powerful, some . . . not so much. Use them as sages, hirelings, crackpots, adversaries, or starting characters. Each is a complete character, with a bit of background, stats, spells, and suggested use. Includes a full color icon for each character.\nReady to Raid: Delvers and Thegns\nIn the spirit of the example characters from Delvers to Grow, this 24-page book presents even more adventurers.

Includes a full color icon for each character.\nReady to Raid: Pirates and Vikings\nArrrr! At 1,000 backers at $35 or more, the final stretch goal is unlocked.

They must journey into the wilds, guided only by their wits, old legends, and a warning: \"Strength and sacrifice from those who seek the Domstollinn.\"\nThe Citadel at Nordvorn\n(128 pages; $15 PDF; $30 Print+PDF)\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0vorn is a setting for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG. It consists of three major settlements, many small villages, a ruin, and two primary adventuring zones: The Hunted Lands to the northwest of The Palisade, and the Endalaus Forest, to the north and east of Audreyn's Wall.\nForest's End\n(96 pages; $13 PDF; $26 Print+PDF)\nFar beyond the safety of Audreyn\u2019s Wall, the ambitious noble Dalmar, his wife Freythor, and their lifetime friend and lieutenant Tobias carved a new settlement out of the dragonkin-infested wilderness. The planning and struggle is to come to fruition with a grand celebration in front of the King\u2019s representative. Dalmar will offer up the Konungsgj\u00f6f and petition to be named Jarl of Sk\u00f3gurenda: Lord of Forest\u2019s End.\nSk\u00f3gurenda is in peril and does not know it. The only questions are if external or internal threats rip the town apart first \u2026 and if a party of adventurers, newly come to the town, are mighty enough to save it.\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth\n(112 pages; $14 PDF; $28 Print+PDF)\nA dragon has come again to Rosgarth Castle. He hopes to ascend, becoming an Elder Dragon. They ruled the world for countless thousands of years. He believes he has found the way to do it. He may be right.\nIn the Norse-inspired realm of Nor\u00f0lond, 100 miles south of Rosgarth, signs and portents, rumors, and reports all say the same thing: If brave thegns do not stop the threat of the dragons of Rosgarth, a new Ragnar\u00f6k threatens.\nHand of Asgard\n(16 pages; $5 PDF; $10 Print+PDF)\nThe Gods of Nor\u00f0lond are not distant and remote. They walk the land, and influence the daily lives of the people.\nTheir disciples\u2014priests of the Allfather, the Lady of Life, the Trickster, the Lord of Warding, and all the Aesir\u2014guard and guide their brothers and sisters.

Increase the nuance and excitement of grappling in the Dungeon Fantasy RPG. Even if your PCs won\u2019t want to use them . . . your monsters will! How else are they going to grab the characters and shove them whole into a toothy maw?\nA project isn't a project without a timeline.\nCampaign Launch: Friday, May 7, 2021 (10am Central Time)\nCampaign End: Tuesday, May 25, 2021 (8pm Central Time)\nBackerkit Phase: End of May, 2021\nProduction: June, 2021\nPDF Distribution: July 2021\nPrinting and Physical Good Manufacture: July-August 2021\nShipping, Fulfillment, and Delivery: September 2021\nEvery effort will be made to beat these times.\nTo help manage post-campaign add-ons, as well as the distribution of the final product(s) to backers, Gaming Ballistic uses Backerkit to conduct the post-Kickstarter surveys and fulfillment.\nBackerkit is a company whose purpose is to help creators manage these details, including add-ons and shipping costs. When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will last between 10-14 days.\nThe Backerkit survey is vitally important for those wanting physical goods. Get your surveys done early, and choose your Add-Ons at this time - and ALL physical goods are add-ons! If you don't fill out your survey by the end of the manufacturing period, your pledge will be cancelled and refunded.\nDigital Fulfillment via DriveThruRPG\nI'm going to try something different this time, and use DriveThruRPG rather than Backerkit to handle Digital rewards. I think that shall handle version control better.\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping! \nShipping is charged in Backerkit,  and not included in pledges. For international customers, taxes are also assessed along with shipping, where appropriate.\nInternational fulfillment OF BOOKS are probably printed in the UK or Amsterdam, and a fulfillment partner will handle such shipping. This is much more costly than it has been in the past.\nAny physical not-book items ship from the USA. The world still labors under the shadow of COVID-19, which complicates staffing on the shippers' side as well. International Shipping of this project is going to be expensive and challenging.

The layout template is in place and proven; for some of the books the layout is already finished, though all need interior artwork.\n\nPhysical goods that require manufacturing and distribution. Given the state of the world right now, this definitely represents a timing risk.\n\nShipping, whether international or domestic, is very challenging. And expensive. Shipping rates and delivery dates are both extremely unpredictable. Any add-ons that are not books are subject to VAT, customs, and even more delays. Some of these duties and fees may be collected on delivery. Gaming Ballistic has no control over international postage fees and methods. GB doesn't control or influence domestic rates either, but at least they're more predictable.\n\nGaming Ballistic provides regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress, and do everything possible to deliver the final PDF on or ahead of schedule.\n\nFor manufacturing timing, the book printer chosen operates in both the USA and UK and provides high quality identical printing at both sites. This eliminates a huge variable in timing: the need to ship from a far-flung location, split shipments, and then do fulfillment. Manufacture and distribution of any phsyical goods is more complicated, and definitely not local for international customers.

It won the game industry\u2019s Origins Award for Best Card Game of 1994. It remains the largest iteration of Illuminati by several times with 535 cards, and the richest in complexity by orders of magnitude. \nIt sold many millions of cards, which collectors still treasure today.\nAn example of Illuminati from the early 1980s.\nThe original edition of Illuminati\u2014recently reprinted!\u2014came out in 1982 as 54 small black-and-white cards.

Illuminati, 2nd Edition (2018) is the most recent, for the first time folding in some more complex game mechanics from New World Order. It\u2019s available in stores now.\n\nIlluminati Confirmed will be a brand-new version of Illuminati: a video game, produced by key creators of 1994\u2019s award-winning Illuminati: New World Order. It uses that version of the game as its starting point, under license from Steve Jackson Games. \n\nClassic Illuminati (1980s)\u2014at least 85 cards adapted from the game that started it all, black-and-white art and all. \nNew World Order (1990s)\u2014at least 160 cards adapted faithfully from Illuminati: New World Order, all with their original \u201990s art\u2014not scans, but the original art that SJ Games sent to the printer back in 1994.

The models were created by 3D scanning real world trees, so they're extremely lifelike (Only mini). \n\nWhy we did it.\nAn essential element of scenery for fantasy tabletop adventuring games is trees. If you imagine traveling through the woods, you imagine a densely forested area with many trees covering the landscape. Other than the visible path ahead or behind, trees block the line-of-sight in all other directions.\nAchieving the feel of a dense forest in a tabletop gaming scenario is difficult for several reasons:\nMiniature trees typically block your view of your characters\nMiniature trees get in the way of being able to move your characters\nMiniature trees are not usually very realistic\nRealistic tree models are a lot of work to make\nRealistic tree models are often fragile\nRealistic tree models take up a lot of storage space to prevent them from being broken\n\nThe Solution.\n3D-scanned, 3D-printable Trees! (This is reward tree 5)\nWe have created 3D printable tree models by 3D-scanning the geometry from real-world tree trunks. By design, our models do not have the leafy parts of the trees so you can see your character models even if they are right next to a tree. Since the models lack the fragile leaf-parts of typical model trees, they can be conveniently stored together in a bin or drawer. The geometry is so tree-like, we've found that we get a very convincing representation of a tree without needing the leaves.\nA real tree and its corresponding digital model\nYou can create scenery that is very reminiscent of a forest by printing these same few tree models at different sizes and positioning them around the tabletop.\nThe same tree model printed at 100% XY-scale on the left and 150% Scale on the right. Bigfoot for scale\nWith just a few of these realistic tree models, you can make an entire forest by printing the trees at different scales and scattering them randomly around the landscape.\n\n Free sample.\nYou can 3D print \"Tree 3\" right now for free. All I ask is that you share this kickstarter on facebook via the link on this webpage. We set it up so that once you do, the download button will reveal itself.\n\nEasy to print.\nThese models print easily and support free on FDM-style printers. Many of the trees can even be printed with zero infill because there are no internal overhangs. Depending on your printer's bridging capability, you might need to print with no top layers if you try to print zero-infill.\n\nTerms & Conditions\nAs a backer, upon successful completion of this Kickstarter campaign you will be rewarded with a license to print and use a set of model files for non-commercial use only. You may not sell, share or distribute any of the digital files or derivative works based on the files. You may modify the files for personal use only. You may not create any derivative works, including printed models, that are to be used in a commercial manner.\nYou will be granted a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to download, access, and 3D print these model files for the purpose of your own personal use, for your own storage, retention and reference. You agree that under no circumstances shall you use, or permit to be used, any model file other than for the aforementioned purpose.

Based on 1990s award-winning game, Illuminati: New World Order. 1-6 players. Love of video games not required.\n\u201c\u2026one of the more creative and innovating games out there.\u201d \u2014Illuminati: New World Order player review, Board Game Geek\n\u201c\u2026the RadioFree.net team has impressed me with their level of communication, engagement, and commitment to this project. \u2026this is shaping up to be one of my favorite projects out of the hundreds I\u2019ve backed.\u201d \u2014M.H.\nIlluminati Confirmed is a game of secret conspiracies, power systems, and a struggling resistance, under license from Austin\u2019s legendary Steve Jackson Games. Newcomers and existing fans will love this updated twist on a classic, with incredible new artwork.\n\nAttack and conquer to build your power structure with cards representing different aspects of our world\u2014complete your pyramid and win! Fun, streamlined game-play. Conspiring and deceitful back-stabbing encouraged\u2014necessary, really. See backer video for examples of gameplay.\n\nThe Servants of Cthulhu are back to destroy all! The global authoritarian Bavarian Illuminati meet their sworn enemy, the chaos-mongering Discordian Society! Will Big-Box Stores turn criminal and align themselves with Anti-Vaxxers to wreak havoc? It\u2019s your turn\u2026\n\nFans, the wait is over! This new twist on a classic design makes possible a video-game version of this long-unavailable treasure from Steve Jackson Games. 150 cards in core game, including 6 Illuminati\u2014now every backer gets duplicates of the 150 cards, all the better to stack the deck with. \n\nSocially-distanced fun for 1-6 players, avg. playtime around 45 minutes. Best on desktops and tablets. Steam. Apple. Google Play. \n\nSample Card Art for Men in Black, Conspiracy Theorists, Social Media, and the Music Industry.\nWhy we need your support\nThis is a passion-project based on an award-winning game with a deep fan base. \nIlluminati: New World Order sold 60+ million cards, though card prices ($1,000 or more for a complete set!) keep it out of the hands of modern players. \nPeople have wanted this video game for years! \nDerek Pearcy, who in 1994 helped produce Illuminati: New World Order for Steve Jackson Games, long wondered how to adapt Illuminati as a satisfying video game\u2014too often, table-top adaptations aren\u2019t that much fun. He finally dreamed up a solution, and with Steve Jackson\u2019s advice and blessing, the project was born.\nProject includes video game development; 150+ cards with art for the core game; 3 seasons of now 40-cards each, introducing new themes, cards, plot twists; and localization (see below).\nGame-play in a nutshell\nIt\u2019s simple once you\u2019re playing. Players take the role of an Illuminati\u2014a secret, global conspiracy\u2014each with a different personality and strategy that works for them\u201a and against their opponents. For example, the Cthulhu player wins by destroying things, the Gnomes of Zurich by amassing money, and Bavaria grows by collecting raw power, and so on. You\u2019re dealt a card at the beginning of each turn, and then try attack and conquer cards\u2014the deck\u2019s or other people\u2019s\u2014to fill your power-structure pyramid.\nTo make the game more interesting, Plot cards allow players to reinforce themselves as well as mess with each other. Plot cards can:\nweaken opponents\nstrengthen your cards or weaken your enemies\u2019\nchange any card's alignments\u2014turn the peaceful Boy Sprouts into violent killers\nand otherwise cause mayhem and make your opponents cry.\nAlong the road to world domination, the unexpected consequences are hilarious. Maybe you'll have the CIA attack the Cycle Gangs. How? Uhh\u2026through the Convenience Stores! With support from\u2026a Swiss Bank Account? In your next turn, the Big-Box Stores become criminal and align themselves with Anti-Vaxxers to wreak havoc! As the night goes on, you\u2019ll see the current world order go sideways. The new world might match your hopes, or your fears.\nFirst one to build their pyramid wins\u2014and the winner collects a card they can use in a future game.\nYour Illuminati can share its vast power with its puppets, helping grow the conspiracy.\nIn Party Mode, everyone draws from the same deck, guaranteed to be well-balanced for whichever Illuminati are in the game. It\u2019s a good way to enter this world and start collecting cards.\nIn Stacked-Deck Mode, people can bring a set of 12 cards of choice to the table. (If anyone know how to stack a deck, it\u2019s the Illuminati.) You can buy Starter Packs, crafted to suit each Illuminati's strengths, or build them yourself from cards you\u2019ll collect after winning games.\nSocial aspect of Illuminati Confirmed: A newsfeed down one side of the screen lets the players have free and frank exchanges of view, almost like a social network for the New World Order. The newsfeed is live, but uses a menu of pre-made responses\u2014to avoid randos creating a bad vibe.\nDifficulty rating: Satisfyingly rich, but not that hard. Includes edgy and nuanced political humor that kids younger than 14 might not be ready for.\nGame duration: around 45 minutes.\n\nHow to Build Your Conspiracy & Take Over the World\nEvery group card is rated by its Power and Resistance as a number from 0 to 5. Subtract the target\u2019s resistance from the attacker\u2019s Power, and that will tell you how likely the attacker can wrestle control over its target.\nThe most unusual and important game mechanic in the game\u2014and most crucial to giving an attacker leverage when a target puts up a fight\u2014are Alignments. There are four pairs of opposing alignments, and two special ones. Here\u2019s how they work: every matching alignment that attacker and target have in common reduces the target\u2019s Resistance by 2 points, while every opposing alignment boosts the target\u2019s Resistance by 2. \nFor example, the Flat Earthers are Weird and Conservative\u2026\n\u2026while the Semiconscious Liberation Army is Criminal, Violent, Liberal, and Weird! \nAttributes & Special Abilities\nIt is rare for cards to have more than two alignments. See Marketing Execs, for example.\nWhat she does have is an Attribute, shown by the broadcasting tower on the right side\u2014that means we\u2019re looking at a Media group. \nWhile the game doesn\u2019t mess with attributes like it does with alignments, they can be just as crucial to success. Several Plot cards can only be powered by a Media group\u2014like Scandal or Miracle Diet Plan\u2014or will only work on a Media group\u2014like Pulitzer Prize and Censorship. \nSome groups are Places\u2014like Germany, Silicon Valley, or Stonehenge\u2014which have special attributes of their own: Coastal, Huge, and Nation. Soon you'll see Disaster cards, special Plots to damage Places. Some disasters, like Tidal Wave, only work on Coastal places, while some disasters, like Meteor Strike, are less effective against Huge places. A Huge place like China can shrug off a single meteor falling from the sky, though the same threat may worry the Pentagon.\n\nTHE PLAN\nWe are racing toward a functional prototype! We\u2019ve recently accelerated our plans, offering Early Access to higher-tier backers from February through April, with a full launch in August. If we meet our Kickstarter goal, we will begin releasing the three seasons in October 2021. Each season will feature at least 20 cards, each bound by a common theme. Here are the seasons we commit to delivering as part of our basic funding plan:\n\nSeason 1: Assassins!\u2014Bringing individual people into the game as controllable cards, and (mostly) bad things to do them\nSeason 2: Ancient Secrets\u2014Magic comes to the world of Illuminati\nSeason 3: Weird Science\u2014Gadgets, gizmos and the shadowy figures who use them\n\nWait\u2014Will There Be More?\nIt should shock no one that we are planning for more than three seasons, taking players through a well-rounded story with wicked twists and turns. Check back in through late-December for updates.\n\nPlatforms\nWe\u2019re committed to making Illuminati Confirmed available for desktop and tablets through Steam, as well as on Google Play and the Apple App Store.\nLocalization\nWe are working with several companies to get Illuminati Confirmed properly localized. Most people think about that as \u201ctranslation,\u201d though that sells short the hard work these professionals perform. Our development lead, Derek Pearcy, spent a decade designing localization support into many complex, widely used user interfaces. Our game will support multiple languages from day one with little to no extra development effort.\nBecause Illuminati has always been extremely popular in Germany and France, those two are first on the list. We\u2019re considering Spanish (with different localization for Spain, Mexico, and South America), as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Simplified Chinese. We can tell you more once the Kickstarter is over, but we will make decisions based on demand, so be sure to let us hear your voices.\n\nTHE ILLUMINATI STORY  \nThe first version of Illuminati, on half-sized cards in 1982.\nIn 1982, Steve Jackson published the original Illuminati card game. It was both darkly serious as well as funny, a satire reflecting conspiracy theories and pop-culture at the time. In 1994, Illuminati: New World Order was released as an early Collectible Card Game with nearly four times as many cards as any previous version of the game, updated with color art and then-modern conspiracy thinking. As a game, it was also fiercely rich and complex. \nConspiracy theorists claim that the 1990s version of the game made uncanny predictions about the future. Will Illuminati Confirmed expose clues to upcoming global struggles? Pledge to find out. For more background on that, check out the Deep Cuts Podcast featuring interviews with Steve Jackson and Derek Pearcy.\nBACKER TIERS\nWe are offering a variety of tiers, including the basic game, additional seasons, starter packs and even lifetime subscriptions to any and all future digital content we release for Illuminati Confirmed. Some items like special Illuminati tile-markers (bronze, silver, gold, as well as the ultra-rare green, glowing neutonium) and the INWO deck will only ever be available through this Kickstarter. See notes at the bottom for details on some of the special rewards.\n We\u2019re giving every player 2 copies of each card\u2014300 cards!\n We\u2019re now doubling the number of cards per season, giving this tier 340 cards!\n After doubling the number of cards per season, this 3-season tier has 420 cards! \nNew! This tier now comes with a playable adaptation of 1994\u2019s award-winning Illuminati: New World Order\u2014at least 300 faithfully adapted cards for a total of 720 cards! \nEach starter deck provides a set of at least 12 cards, each set designed to help an Illuminati shine. Every deck duplicates cards already available in the game, though having duplicates of cards which specifically help you is a good thing. Six decks means 72 more cards for a total of 792 cards.\nLastly, your triangular Illuminati tile will have a bronze border around it, showing everyone your greatness as a Kickstarter campaign backer.\nWe plan to stand up our online services in stages, on-boarding more and more people over time. Even more importantly, we want feedback on the earliest stable versions of the local multiplayer game. Since it\u2019s hard to pick who gets to go first, we thought we\u2019d let people pay to get in line, beginning with this tier. The order of access will be:\nEternally Illuminated + Game with SJ & DP\nYOU ARE ILLUMINATED\nEternally x4 + Derek\u2019s INWO Set\nEternally Illuminated x4\nEternally Illuminated + 2 1994 INWO Decks\nEternally Illuminated\nEsoteric Order of Early Access\nWe expect to begin seeding backers with local multi-player versions of the game\u2014using original cards and art from the 1990s edition\u2014in March, then on-boarding early backers to our online service no later than June 2021. Players in each group above will gain access to the game in the order they backed the project, from earlier to later.\nAlso, your triangular Illuminati tile will have a silver border around it, showing everyone how fantastic you are as a Kickstarter campaign backer.\nAs long as we put out digital ILCO content, you\u2019ll get it. That includes everything, even limited-time card releases. Pretty straightforward. You\u2019ll get 1 or 4 digital keycodes granting your account access to the content you\u2019re owed.\nAlso, your triangular Illuminati tile will have a GOLD border around it, because you're amazing and the other global conspiracies you're playing against should cower before you.\nTucked away in a box for 26 years, Derek\u2019s had a shrink-wrapped Point-of-Purchase display containing 6 pairs of shrink-wrapped Limited Edition INWO decks from among some of the very first cards to show up at the SJ Games offices. You and a friend can bust them open and play just like they did in 1994. \nAs shown in the list above, 2 lucky people will be the first players onboarded once we\u2019re ready to test the game and its online services\u2014andd Steve and Derek will play against you. They\u2019ll probably be too busy sinking each other, so you may actually have a chance of winning. We can work with you to schedule a time mutually available to both backers, though it will be bounded by Steve Jackson\u2019s Central Time Zone, between sunrise and early evening.\nAs long as we put out digital ILCO content, you\u2019ll get it\u2014but you'll get 4 digital keycodes granting access to all that content. Split it with 3 friends for less than any of you could become Eternally Illuminated on your own, or bring a ho-ho-whole lot of diabolical joy to 3 friends you look forward to trouncing in the battle for world domination. \nWhat it says: all the cards available in the original, 1994 retail release of Illuminati: New World Order. Derek has two: one set in individual sleeves and the other in a binder. Pick which one you\u2019d prefer\u2014he\u2019s only parting with one of them.\nEveryone knows what Neutonium is, so we won\u2019t insult anyone\u2019s intelligence by talking about it here. But\u2014do you want to be an agent on the F.B.I. card? Or a guy in a suit getting dragged away in handcuffs on the Wall Street card? We will work with you to get your likeness on something that works for you. It will on everyone\u2019s version of that card, so let\u2019s make it count.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask and we\u2019ll happily update these details.\nEarly Pencils for Upcoming Illuminati Confirmed Cards. Here we have Otaku, the Mafia, Hackers, and Lawyers.\nFUNDING GOAL\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to get feedback from fans, and people are thrilled about what we want to do. Still, it\u2019s a significant investment of time and money. We\u2019re launching this Kickstarter to raise the funds to finish the new art, complete the game development, and build the online services needed to support a modern game-play experience.\nWe can make Illuminati Confirmed, including the core game and three seasons, if we hit our goal of $210,000.

We've approved it and the printer is working on it now, so the chance of anything preventing a Christmas delivery just went way down. At 12\" x 12\", they're huge and really pretty!\nAnnouncing: Stretch Goal Unlock\nI said there would be a major unlock of some kind at $34K, so here it is. As a thank you for erasing the art budget gap, we will be sending extra rewards to all donors at physical reward tiers ($20 and up). \nFor no extra pledge money, you will now also receive a Prince Albert crest fridge magnet, matching the styles of our previous magnets.\nAdditionally, sometime in 2016 (we will not say exactly when), you will also get a special double-sized 24\" x 12\" poster drawn by Xin, called \"Hippiemancer Jamboree.\" The printed version of this poster will be PG rated, but there will also be a NSFW version available for download to donors at all levels (including the $1+ level). This will be the first ever NSFW Erfworld art, which prompted one of our IRC channel regulars to call this the \"Rule 34 Unlock.\"\nDaily Goal Chart:\nProject Background/Introduction\nHi and welcome to Erfworld's latest Kickstarter project! It's a small and simple one; we need a little help to raise the money to print a 2016 wall calendar and make a lapel pin of Prince Albert's battle crest. We'll need about $6000 to get those items made.\nSudden Complications\nWell, the original plan was simple, anyway. But if you're a regular reader, you know that at the beginning of September, we suddenly found ourselves without an artist midway through Book 3. Although that was a big shock and setback, it has led to something unexpectedly great. Our beloved and talented Book 2 artist Xin Ye will be returning to pencil the rest of the book! And she will be backed up by the impressive talents of Erfworld reader and 2-time Eisner nominee Lauri Ahonen on inks and colors.\nEverything over $6000 goes to the artists\nWe'll be paying this team a higher page rate, and Book 3 will run significantly longer than planned. Because of that, there will be an art budget gap of about $28,000 over what we had raised in the project to Print Book 2 & Draw Book 3. We're hoping we can exceed our goals for this one, and that your pledges can make a big dent in that deficit.\nEdit/clarification: since we have reached $34,000 and conquered the whole deficit (woohoo!), then all additional money pledged to this project will be used to increase the rate per page that I pay the artists (see below). I changed the chart to say \"Art Team Bonus\" because some people thought \"Page Rate Increase\" meant we'd be doing more than two updates a week.\nThe 2016 Erfworld Pin-up Calendar\nSo the main purpose for this project is to collect high-quality prints of the first twelve pin-ups drawn by Xin over the last 18 months into a 2016 wall calendar. I have also written some caption text to go with each month's image and tie these pictures in with the character's personal history.\nThe pin-ups have allowed Xin to show off what she's capable of, when she spends weeks on one single image. Each month's picture is a richly-detailed study featuring one of our major or minor characters such as Wanda, Vinny, Jillian or Maggie, in a setting and a moment that is unguarded and personal. Xin and I had many discussions about how to portray our characters in ways that suited them each, but which might not ever come up in the comic.\nBecause she's returning to pencil Book 3 (more info below), Xin's future pin-ups will be less detailed than these, so this calendar will always stand as a special \"master work\" of Erfworld art.\nPrince Albert battle crest pin\nQueen Jillian's newly-popped heir is a real piece of work. He popped with two specials, eight knives, and an attitude.\nWe're adding the new Prince's crest to our collection of Battle Crest lapel pins, with a Kickstarter exclusive run. The pins will be soft white enamel on black metal, 1.25 inches wide cloisonne pins with butterfly-clutch backing. If you have seen any of our earlier lapel pins, this one will be of the same size and style, provided by the same manufacturer.\nThese will never be sold, and we will only make as many as we need to fulfill pledges (plus a handful for ourselves) so this will be your only chance to get one.\nWelcoming back Xin Ye, and Introducing Lauri Ahonen\nDue to terrible events affecting her family, Xin Ye (Erfworld's artist for Book 2) had no choice but to bow out in 2013. She has always been part of the Erfworld family, and fortunately her situation has improved a bit. The heavy personal demands on her time have eased up enough that she can return to Book as penciler.\nThat meant we needed to find some illustration talent to back her up and put Erfworld back on schedule. We looked at portfolios from around two dozen artists. Many of them were Erfworld fans who contacted us when the news broke about our sudden hiatus, and that includes Finnish artist Lauri Ahonen. Lauri's graphic novel Jaybird was nominated for a 2015 Eisner award in two separate categories.\nAlthough we saw some extremely impressive talent and passion among the artists we reviewed and auditioned, Xin and I agreed that the way Lauri brought the pencils to life was something special. Take a look for yourself. \nThis was a panel of roughs by Xin:\n With finer pencils by Xin:\n And this is the inked and colored panel by Lauri:\nOriginally, Lauri wanted to take on the entire role of illustrator by himself. But that was not on the table, in my view, if Xin could return to lead the illustration team. So Lauri agreed to audition for the inker/colorist role. After the audition, he had this to say to Xin:\n\"I haven\u2019t worked in an art team before, and wanted to work solo when I contacted Rob. But working from your pencils changed my mind. I think this work is way better than anything I could have achieved by myself.\"\nWe agree. I think this is some of the prettiest and most evocative Erfworld art I've ever seen, and when Book 3 returns to updates in early October, I think we'll be raising the bar for art over anything in the comic's history. Here are the rest of Lauri and Xin's test panels.\nPaying the Team What They're Worth\nI want to pay the new team a page rate that's about 1/3 more than the prior Book 3 rate. Lauri's obvious talent is in high demand, and he deserves to be making a competitive rate for someone in his skill class. And Xin deserves...the moon, the stars...I'd pay her millions to draw Erfworld, if I could.\nThey'll be getting that rate out of the gate, however I have to make it happen. But it's going to be a tough few months for us, with the sudden hiatus freezing the Toolshed payments and the ad revenue gutted. It would help a lot if this project can raise some of the short term cash I'll need for the artists, and the longer term capital it will take to fund the rest of this book.\nOne Stretch Goal\nWe hit our initial $6000 goal in under 2 hours, before we even officially \"launched\" the project. Woo! Thank you! \nSo then, we only have one stretch goal for this project. If we can get all the way up to $34,000, then that will cover the $28K gap in the Book 3 budget.\nWe'll have a major group goal unlock if we reach that point. And if we go beyond $34K, then all money (after fees, taxes, and fulfillment costs) would go to increasing Xin and Lauri's page rate ($ per page) even further.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are dealing with a printer and a manufacturer who have delivered products reliably for us in the past.

Have you ever wished that your miniature figures could have a greater range of expression and pose-ability?\nEver wish you could do this with your Miniature Figures?\nOR THIS?\nHOW ABOUT THIS?\n  Well NOW YOU CAN!\nThe Crazy Arms system allows you to replace your figure's existing arms with ease and without fear of damaging your figure's torso by repeated replacement of the system arms.\nCrazy Arms are the result of many years of design, prototyping and thought. After numerous incarnations and approaches an amazing  solution was finally discovered.\nMany of the early designs had the same problems as the existing arms. \nCrazy Arms are designed to address the THREE main problems with the current system.\n1. Existing arms, though iconic, are very limited in expression.\n2. Repeated removal and replacement of the existing arms can cause stress on the torso at the shoulder connection resulting in loose-fitting arms and affecting the figure's ability to hold things aloft.\n3. Plastic tubes, Super Glue and/or rubber bands just don't cut it!\nThe Crazy Arms system is completely removable and doesn't require any modification of your existing miniature figures.\nBy using the existing holes in the top of the figure's hips, we get a sound, strong connection point for one or more arms AND we eliminate the danger of damaging your favorite miniature figure torso!  \nThe Crazy Arms bracket gets inserted into either/both of the two hole-cavities in the top of the hips and then the torso is reassembled.  \nOnce the bracket is secured, you can replace and reuse your various Crazy Arms ARMS as much as you like!\n A world of new poses and adventures await you and your figures! \nWhat poses do Crazy Arms come in?\n  To begin, we will offer sets of Crazy Arms that include (2) brackets, a single straight arm and a 90 degree bent elbow arm.  Both of these arms are universal and can be used on either the LEFT or RIGHT side of your figure. ( NOTE: You provide your own head, torso, legs, hands etc.! )\nIf we hit our funding goals, then we may offer additional pose options as Stretch Goal items.\nWe will also offer the opportunity for folks to work with our designers to create a special additional arm pose as part of a pledge level opportunity.\n To begin, we will offer Crazy Arms in FIVE basic colors.  If we meet our funding goals, then we will offer additional colors as stretch goal possibilities.\nThe initial FIVE colors are:\n1. WHITE\n2. BLACK\n3. TAN\n4. DARK TAN\n5. DARK GRAY\nStretch Goals and ADD-ONs\nStretch Goals will include additional color choices for arms and a possible NEW arms pose to include in every Kickstarter set!

These are available at higher pledge levels, or singly as add-ons.\nWith the project about to close, you might be worried about getting your pledge right. You will be able to add funds after we close. If you're unsure, just get your foot in the door with a dollar at the \"FORWARD OBSERVER\" level, and relax for two weeks until the surveys go out.\nWHAT COMES IN MY PLEDGE?\nLet's make sure you're pledging for what you want. Note that when you pledge, there will be additional shipping charges for Canada and the EU above what's posted below. This should be clearly marked in the interface when you pledge.\nCOMPANY COMMANDER + $10 ($85.00 total) gets EVERYTHING: Pledge as a Company Commander, and add $10.00 for the RiPP tokens.

Pledge as a Commodore, and add $10.00 for the RiPP tokens.\nThose are our most popular pledge levels. Are you just here for the Maxims?\nSeventy Maxims  ($20 total) That's all you need to know, really. If you want that book, this is the pledge. Ignore the noise of the MAXIMILLIAN levels. They're broken.\nNow let's cover special cases and the broken things you can ignore (or un-pledge.)\nADMIRALS AND FIELD MARSHALS are spending $500 or more, and will get special treatment. If you're one of these lucky folks, email us. We'll take care of you.\nRETAILERS get special treatment too. The Extended Mag is NOT included, and we can't offer a wholesale discount on it (it's already deeply discounted) but if you email us we'll work with you case-by-case based on what you want to re-sell.\nIgnore MAXIMILLIAN. It's locked because it over-charges you (everybody pays $5.00 too much.) Our mistake, and with backers at that level we can't hide it or remove it.  \nIgnore MAXIMILLIAN + AIR DROP because it under-charges you (EU saves $5.00). We locked it. If you can sneak in, we'll honor that price.\nLet's look at the rest of the pledges.\nFORWARD OBSERVER ($1.00):  If you're still unsure, or are waiting on money that will arrive after May 18th, stand pat at $1.00. You can add funds after we close, and the Backerkit interface will be more like a shopping  cart. You won't miss out on anything. This is true for all non-limited backer levels. If you're pledging when we close, you can add money and itemize later. \nAIR DROPPED GRUNT ($20.00): This gets you all of the PDFs we do. The Seventy Maxims book will NOT be a PDF, so you don't get that. Note that this pledge level has no shipping charges at all. \nSEVENTY MAXIMS book with an AIR DROP ($40.00): All the PDFs, plus the Seventy Maxims book.\nSERGEANT IN MOTION ($45): The core book (now 240 pages,) the card deck, the Kickstarter Backer pin, and all the PDFs. \nLet's repeat something: If you're not sure about what you want, make sure you pledge at some level (any level, Forward Observer will do just fine) and you will be able to add funds in late May, and well into June through Backerkit. \nWhat Is In The Extended Mag?\n\"Extended Mag\" items are extras above and beyond the core book, the cards, and the PDFs. \nPlanet Mercenary/D6\u00b3 Challenge Coin\nTwo 3-die sets of custom six-sided dice (total of six dice)\nThree in-universe manufacturer pins\nA three-panel cardstock Game Chief's screen\nThe Seventy Maxims Book\nThese items are also be available as Add-Ons.  \nIf you want extras of things, or want to order stuff a la carte, here are the prices.\nDice\u2014$8.00 for a set of 6: (two Mayhem dice, and four non-Mayhem dice.)\nPlanet Mercenary/D6\u00b3 Coin\u2014$10.00 ea.\nPins\u2014$5.00 ea, or $15.00 for the set.\nSeventy Maxims hardcopy\u2014$15.00\nRiPP Tokens\u2014$10 for a set of 20\nGame Chief Screens\u2014$5.00\nPlanet Mercenary books and MAYHEM decks\u2014$45 per set\nMAYHEM decks\u2014$5\nEverything except the RiPP tokens will be in the Extended Mag.

As long as you're backing at some level by the time we close, you'll be able to add funds afterward to ensure you get what you want.\nYour pledges have unlocked everything. Wow.\n Seriously. Wow.\nThe Planet Mercenary RPG is set in the Schlock Mercenary universe. Howard Tayler has been publishing Schlock Mercenary to the web since June of 2000. This science fiction setting is tooled up for those with a sense of humor and a sense of wonder, and the comic has been capturing reader imaginations for fifteen years now. The Planet Mercenary RPG is designed to let readers and non-readers alike exploit that depth as they role play stories of their own creation.\nThe Planet Mercenary book is an in-world artifact. The R&D team at the galaxy's largest independent reseller and distributor of weapons and materiel created this \"old-timey\" role playing book as a sneaky way to educate their clients' grunts, who are often unwilling to read briefing materials, let alone actual reference manuals. With this book those grunts will \"accidentally\" learn about their weapons, their enemies, and the places where they may draw their last breath. \n\nThe body of the book is written from the point of view of writers in the Planet Mercenary corporate office, and the margins are sprinkled with comments from the CEO, who was assured that the book absolutely would NOT go to print until the comments had been stripped.\nEarly draft of a page from the Sophonts section\nThe cards in the game will inform your role-play, flesh out your story, and add the Schlock Mercenary universe's ubiquitous humor to your game. \n(Not an actual MAYHEM deck. Thank you, Photoshop.)\nThey're drawn at random following roughly 25% of the player characters' successful skill checks or combat rolls. Here's a sample:\nThose cards are from the \"good, permanent\" and \"good, temporary\" categories. There are also \"bad, temporary\" and \"bad, permanent\" cards which you will learn to love just as much.\nHoward Tayler is the lead writer, canon-checker, and art director. He has fifteen years of writing and illustration experience in this setting, and countless hours of RPG play and GM experience in a dozen different settings and systems\nAlan Bahr is the game designer, and he both coordinates and runs the play-testing. He is intimately familiar with numerous RPG systems, though large portions of his resum\u00e9 remain redacted due to non-disclosure agreements.\nSandra Tayler is the operations chief, editor-in-chief, and production lead. She has overseen the packaging and delivery of tens of thousands of packages shipped to all seven continents.\nThis is not our first book. Howard and Sandra have published eleven print collections of Schlock Mercenary comics, plus XDM: X-Treme Dungeon Mastery (by Tracy and Curtis Hickman), two children's books, and more. \nThis is not our first Kickstarter. Howard and Sandra funded and delivered a very successful project back in 2013, which you can read about here. One deliverable was significantly delayed, but all the paid rewards went out on time.\nIf you're looking for crunchier information about the game, start with the Game-Play Primer page at schlocktroops.com, home of the Planet Mercenary RPG development team. \nA particularly popular post has been Howard's explanation of our design principles. For extra crunch, check out Howard's post on the D6\u00b3 Mayhem engine, and Alan's description of character generation. \nIf you need still more, the schlocktroops.com site has an RSS feed so you can stay apprised as we talk dice, stats, game theory, and post lots of samples from our work in progress. That site will be updated regularly long after this project closes.\nHoward can draw, yes, but just because he's been drawing Schlock Mercenary for 15 years doesn't mean his art style is right for this book. We have already begun contracting artwork, and Howard's job is to work with the artists and ensure that what they create fits the setting and the spirit of the book. \nIf you're familiar with the comic, think of it this way: The art in Schlock Mercenary is a caricature of the universe described in the Planet Mercenary RPG. The comic is a comic, the RPG is reality.\nHere are just a few of the pieces that have already come in.\nCaptain Murtaugh, by Rodolpho Langhi\nWe'll post more samples here as the project progresses, but the majority of that stuff is going to go up alongside our development notes at schlocktroops.com.\nThe Seventy Maxims book is a project that has been close to Howard's heart for a decade now. He's always meant for it to be an in-world artifact, and with this Kickstarter we can make it correctly.  \nThe book will be a hard-bound, saddle-stitched, 80-page volume with nice, sturdy paper. Seventy of those pages will have maxims on them, one per page, with some editorial commentary from the scholars working at the company responsible for creating the 3001CE Special Edition. The remaining ten pages will be front matter, introductory text, and stuff Howard hasn't thought up yet. \nAs an in-universe artifact, this book will be the copy that Karl Tagon received as a gift when he was a young enlistee. His handwritten notes will appear in the margins, as will the notes of various other people through whose hands the book has passed. Have a look!\nMockup of the page for Maxim 4\nWe do not plan to release this as a PDF as part of this Kickstarter. We realize that this may disappoint many of you, but the margin writing is an important part of the book's story, and we don't want to design that for both PDF and hard copy at this time. We might do a PDF or eBook at a later date, but that's not part of this project.\nWhat Does the Rest of This Stuff Look Like?\nWe're still in the design phase on the dice, but we've got suppliers lined up who can give us SIX custom faces rather than one. The current Mayhem die design is purple with bullet-pocks for pips and the MAYHEM text on the six. The non-Mayhem dice will probably be green with manufacturer logos on the six, and we might even do something to distinguish the two green dice from each other if you want to go house-rule crazy with permutations.\nHere's an early draft of the RiPP tokens. The $10 RiPP add-on gives you twenty of these. They'll be aluminum, anodized for color, and will be about the size of a US quarter (25mm in diameter, 3mm thick).\nEarly RiPP Token draft by Howard Tayler\n\n\nHere's what the pins and coins will look like (though there will be some tweaks, like the addition of the missing hyphen.)\nPin and coin proofs by Joey Visser, Signature Coins\n  Joey is the designer who did such brilliant work on our coins two years ago, and I'm happy to be entrusting him with the design work again this time around (though not for quite as many pieces of metal.)\n  We don't yet have images for the Game Chief Screen or the \"All The Ships To Scale\" art. The screen will be 6.5\"x26\", tri-fold. It's smaller than most screens, but it will have everything you need just a glance away.\nHere's a conservative take on our schedule. If it goes faster, that's nice. These are dates we're confident that we can hit while delivering a product that we'll be proud of and you'll be thrilled to own.\n\nApril-May 2015: Project launch! In the 34 days this project runs we'll be updating this page, polishing some rule text, and writing furiously.\nMid-May 2015: After we fund, we start contracting art. Writing and editing continues in parallel.\nAugust 2015: By August all of the commissioned art should be turned in, and the final writing should be done as well. At this point we begin editing and layout in earnest.\n\nNovember 2015: At this point the core book will be ready to be sent to the printer, and all other materials will ready for manufacture (some may have already been completed, but the book is the big one.)\nFebruary 2016: All product components have been manufactured and delivered to us. We begin building packages to ship to you.\n\nApril 2016: Your stuff arrives! \n\nThat's a twelve-month schedule. A year is a long time to wait, we know, but we'll keep this page updated as we plug away on this. \nWe want to create something that remains engaging for you and your players for years to come. Depending on the success of this project, that engagement will almost certainly include Planet Mercenary community pages for sharing your adventure designs, swapping custom equipment, and of course regaling each other with stories of grunts who beat all the odds (or who beat none of them repeatedly.)\nWe are also considering producing some of what the RPG industry calls \"splat-books.\" These would be additional source books that add playable races and additional equipment along with a collection of pre-made adventures in a set of new locations. We don't have a schedule for these yet, let alone pricing, but if this game works as well for you as it has for our play testers, we will all be wanting them.\nThis section might best be described as the \"we are not doing miniatures\" section. \nIf there's one thing we've learned over the last several years of making stuff, it's that a focused project is a more successful project. Here is a list of things that will not be included as stretch goals:\nMiniatures\nClothing\nComputer games\nMobile games\nBags\nDrinkware\nReplica Weapons\nAn MP3 Soundtrack\nKitchen Sinks\nWe might do T-shirts at some future date, but they're not part of this project. Similarly, while Sandra and Howard do have plans for more Schlock Mercenary themed items, like steins, shopping bags, and major appliances, those are not going to be bundled with this project. \nPlanet Mercenary needs, first and foremost, to be a fantastic role-playing book. We are going to spend all of our energy making sure that's what you get. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are three principal risks associated with this project:\n1) Team Complexity\n2) Print Complexity\n3) Unknown Unknowns\n\nTEAM COMPLEXITY: We're working with over a dozen illustrators to create this book. Each of those individuals plays an important role, and is creating things that we want to include. Any team this large and complex is going to run into schedule problems--computer failures, illness, etc. Our April 2016 delivery date accounts for some of this, and makes allowances for rotation of team members if necessary. \n\nMANUFACTURING COMPLEXITY: We're printing thousands of copies of the core book, 50 different cards, and if we hit our stretch goals we'll be making some other things as well. We will be working with at least four different manufacturers. Fortunately, we've worked with each of these manufacturers before, and are confident in their ability to deliver. There may still be schedule issues depending on the size of the final project, but these manufacturers have scaled way up for us in the past with minimum slippage.\n\nUNKNOWN UNKNOWNS: In the field of military intelligence, this is the stuff that sits outside of what we can make contingency plans for. All we can do is set aside time to make those contingency plans if the truly unexpected happens. We know that things we cannot plan for might happen, and we're prepared to adjust in order to deliver the project in spite of hurricanes, earthquakes, or alien invasions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Final Update", "update_content": "Greetings Backers,\nPlanetmercenary.com has now been updated with a Shared Resources page and FAQ section.

Watch a bit of the below video to see how easy it is to put in new tokens to a cube:\nToken designs for the ModCube are made to be compatible with the most popular sci-fi wargames on the market today! Below is pictured some ModCube sets you could make with a \"ModDeux\" pledge (our sweet spot!) to either be compatible with Star Wars: X-wing or Warhammer 40K.\nExample ModDeux Pledge: 2 Dogfight Sets\nExample ModDeux Pledge: SciFi Infantry and SciFi Vehicles\nWhy not just make custom dice???\nWhat sets the ModCube apart is the fact that it can be taken apart and reconfigured, whereas custom dice can never be changed! There are still many, many situations to use custom dice for, but there are also many where the ModCube is a better fit =)\nTo take full advantage of this modularity, we are including 80 tokens with each set of 8 cubes! The only exception is the Dogfight set, which includes a whopping 120 tokens! (This is due to all the half-size tokens in that set). How can we possibly afford to include so many tokens? Watch the below video to see just how efficient our laser cutting process is.\nPLAY\n\nWhat are the choices?\nHere are the ModCube sets that are unlocked:\nDogfight - compatible with Star Wars: X-wing\nFleet - compatible with Star Wars: Armada\nAssault - compatible with Star Wars: Imperial Assault\nSciFi Vehicles - compatible with Warhammer 40K\nSciFi Infantry - compatible with Warhammer 40K\nSciFi Mysterious Objective - compatible with Warhammer 40K\nSteampunk - compatible with Warmachine / Hordes\nInfinite - compatible with Corvus Belli's Infinity\nSciFi Crates - various tokens to use your ModCubes as crates!\nMal - compatible with Wyrd's Malifaux\nMal2 - a set of just Poison and Burning tokens, compatible with Wyrd's Malifaux\nTrek - compatible with Star Trek: Attack Wing\nDnD - compatible with D&D: Attack Wing\nStorm - compatible with Spartan's Firestorm Armada\nGame Creator - a set of numbers and symbols for game creators!\nNumbers Only - a set of numbers only tokens, 1 - 14\nBlank - add your own symbols or art, also available in translucent\nIf you don't see a game you play above just yet, don't despair! There may well be one added before the end of the campaign, as we are working on new sets all the time (our current project: a set compatible with Firestorm Armada!).\nWith each set you pledge for, you can choose from the following colors for the cubes, shown in the picture below. You can also choose token colors for all sets except Dogfight (whose token colors are fixed for gameplay reasons). We'll get all of your color selections in the survey as soon as the campaign ends!\nAll 12 Cube Color Options\nModCubes in action!\nHere's a few pics of each of the already finished sets in use!\nFleet ModCubes in action!\nDogfight ModCubes in action!\nSciFi Vehicles and SciFi Infantry ModCubes in action!\nMysterious Objective ModCubes in action!\nInfinite ModCubes in action!\nAssault ModCubes in action!\nDnD ModCubes in action!\nTrek ModCubes in action!\nDetailed Set Contents\nBelow is a picture of what is currently planned for each full set.

We love 3D printing and all the doors it opens, but we don\u2019t like our printers. It seems like every day something jams, breaks, shifts, or fails. Even when our printers do work, they need fine-tuning to print well. All in all, we probably spend more time working on our printers than on our inventions.\nSure, there are some high-end machines out there that consistently work well\u2014but why do they have to be so expensive?\nGo into a store with $179 and see what you can get. A microwave, a mini-fridge, a vacuum, etc. All of these products are pretty complicated, and no one expects them to require fixing every week. We believe a 3D printer shouldn't be any different.\nThat\u2019s why we designed Tiko.\nTiko is a 3D printer unlike any before it. We meticulously designed every piece of it to make it high quality and easy to use, while keeping costs down in order to achieve a great price. So, what makes Tiko different?\nMost 3D printers have a multipart frame. These are bulky, difficult to assemble, and easily damaged. This is where Tiko is fundamentally different. Tiko is unibody. That means the whole frame is one piece, introducing an amazing array of benefits. Easy to manufacture. Virtually impossible to misalign. That's how you get a quality 3D printer for $179.\nTiko is a delta 3D printer with three sets of arms moving in unison to control the movement of the print head (more on this later). The essence of Tiko\u2019s innovation is our discovery that delta is the ideal configuration to unlock the many benefits of unibody.\nFrom the very beginning, we were determined to make an accurate printer. Tiko\u2019s unibody construction and delta mechanism have been carefully designed to deliver exceptionally high mechanical repeatability without the need for high-precision components. That\u2019s right, you heard us. Even without high-precision components, Tiko is still able to print incredibly consistent layers. \nTiko printed the vase pictured above at a 200 micron-resolution, but it can print as fine as 50 microns.\nThanks to unibody, Tiko is also enclosed. Whereas most 3D printers have problems with warping prints, Tiko\u2019s enclosed print chamber means that prints are isolated from the outside environment, resulting in strong and consistent print results, even when the wind blows.\nTiko\u2019s slender unibody frame, delta mechanism, and ultra-compact liquefier/end-effector enable it to print objects far larger than any similarly sized 3D printer.\nLike most delta printers, we started with a circular print volume. But we wanted more than that, so we expanded Tiko\u2019s print volume into the corners for those extra-long prints, maximizing space efficiency.\nNot only can you print large objects, you can actually remove them easily, too. Tiko\u2019s print bed is flexible, so once your print is done, you simply lift the printer off the bed, then twist to pop off your print. \nAnd with the specially-formulated coating on Tiko's print bed, prints adhere consistently. No more scraping, no blue painter\u2019s tape, and no glue stick shenanigans either.\nYou know what else is flexible? Your choice of filament. Tiko uses non-proprietary 1.75mm filament on a standard 1kg 165mm (6.5 in.) diameter spool, so you can experiment with different materials. Tiko also detects when you\u2019re out of filament and pauses the print so you can reload and resume. \nWires are so 1996. Connect Tiko to the cloud, and you can print from almost anywhere, even from your smartphone. No Wi-Fi? Tiko makes its own wireless access point so you can print directly, too.  \nTiko\u2019s browser-based software is super user-friendly. We\u2019ve already optimized Tiko\u2019s performance, leaving only a few straightforward settings so you can spend more time on your ideas and leave the printing to Tiko.\nTiko\u2019s enclosed build chamber also means children and pets can\u2019t interfere with the liquefier, a small but dangerously hot component that is typically left exposed in other 3D printers. Taking things a step further, Tiko has an onboard accelerometer that automatically shuts the printer down if it\u2019s disturbed.\nThis same accelerometer is used for auto calibration, plus something even cooler. Tiko can measure its own performance, so with your permission, we can use performance data from your printer to help make every Tiko better. This will help us improve our firmware and slicing engine AND keep your Tiko running at peak performance. Everybody wins!\nTiko\u2019s unibody construction also makes it incredibly strong. The stiffness of the frame improves print quality while making Tiko durable and easy to ship.\nBut even with all that strength, unibody makes Tiko surprisingly lightweight.\nBy now you might be wondering: How can a 3D printer this good, with all these features, cost so little? Well, it wasn\u2019t easy. But if you\u2019re not afraid to geek out, neither are we...\nYou emailed us, you asked us technical questions, and we\u2019re happy to deliver. Right off the bat, there are a few things you should know:\n1) Tiko has almost no parts in common with any other 3D printer in the world. Period. With a few exceptions, every component inside Tiko is a bespoke part designed for rapid and inexpensive manufacture.\n2) Every component you see below is a generation or two behind where we actually are. We are in a highly competitive field with rampant product-cloning, so we hold our intellectual property very close to the vest, and a number of these technologies are patent-pending. These older parts worked well, and they\u2019re similar to what\u2019s in the final Tiko, but the latest generation is even better. And secret!\nNow let's get technical...\nONCE AGAIN, UNIBODY\nIt all started with unibody. In most 3D printers, the most expensive (by far) item is the frame. That\u2019s because most 3D printers have a frame built from multiple beams that are fastened together. In delta printers, this frame is often made from three vertical extruded-aluminum beams. We had a simple thought\u2026 what if we extruded all three rails together?\nJust like that, we had it. A unibody chassis. Strong, lightweight, virtually impossible to misalign, but also one we could extrude by the mile at a very low cost. Being made of one piece means no assembly is needed\u2014no fasteners, no alignments, none of that.\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, but an enormous leap forward. And it's only the beginning.\nDELTA\nDeltas really do it better. We don\u2019t want to lecture you on robot kinematics, but it\u2019s no secret that parallel manipulators are inherently more accurate than their gantry/serial counterparts. We\u2019ve said it twice, and we\u2019re proud to say it again. Tiko does not use high-precision mechanical components. Why not?\nBecause we don\u2019t need to! Tiko\u2019s low-part-count parallel-arm mechanism has consistently demonstrated exceptional mechanical repeatability without the use of high-precision rails and linear bearings. That means we can manufacture Tiko using consumer-grade tolerances and relatively simple parts, rather than the crazy-expensive CNC-machine components found in other 3D printers.\nDIRECT-DRIVE SYSTEM\nHaving developed an inexpensive chassis and rails, we didn't want to mess it up with a complicated drive system. Most 3D printers use an eye-popping arrangement of belts, pulleys, and tensioners. Instead, we developed a proprietary direct-drive system in which the motors are mounted onto carriages that drive themselves directly along the rails.\n\nSimple, reliable, and super-inexpensive to make. How we integrated the gear racks into the rails during production, however, is our secret. \nNOTE: Don't worry, we abandoned the above pictured NEMA-14\u2019s ages ago. They were expensive, heavy, and noisy. Tiko now uses a completely different type of motor that has proven far more suitable, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how little it costs. This alone had a major impact on our pricing.\nCUSTOM ELECTRONICS\nOnce we had perfected Tiko\u2019s mechanics, the electronics became the most expensive part of the printer. Most 3D printers use hobbyist electronics, which are great for tinkering but overpriced and underpowered for a consumer-grade product. So, we developed our own.\nTiko\u2019s electronics employ carefully chosen surface-mount components that are optimized for mass manufacture. These make Tiko faster and smarter, while costing less.\nFurthermore, Tiko\u2019s high-efficiency liquefier and motors use only a fraction of the energy required by most 3D printers. This allowed us to use smaller and less expensive electronic components and a standard \u201cbrick\u201d power adapter instead of a bulky PSU, which further reduced costs.\nPASSIVE-COOLED LIQUEFIER\nLastly, there is Tiko\u2019s liquefier assembly. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the only liquefier in the world that can extrude PLA without active cooling\u2014and in an enclosed space at that.\n\nWe spent close to a year getting it right. Why did we bother? Because cooling fans are expensive. Aside from the fan itself, you need a finned heatsink, the wiring to the PCB, the PWM output to drive it, and the added assembly steps to install and wire it in. There\u2019s also the noise, the size (which would compromise print volume) and the problem of dust collecting in the fan/heatsink.\n\nTiko\u2019s one-of-a-kind passive cooled liquefier solves all of these problems, and it's compact, energy efficient, and inexpensive to manufacture.\nAt its core are the carefully designed convection-optimizing heat vents. These vents maximize the upward flow of hot air while shielding the heatsink. The exact specifications are secret, but Tiko's liquefier maintains a remarkably low inlet temperature without any forced airflow\u2014even inside a warm print chamber.\n\nBy incorporating the heat shield into an injection-moldable end effector with integrated ball joints and making a geometrically simple heatsink without any fins, we dropped costs even further.\nTITANIUM NOZZLE\nAchieving our demanding thermal performance criteria also required the use of a one-of-a-kind aerospace-grade Titanium alloy nozzle. The nozzle minimizes conduction to the heatsink without the need for an insulating barrel. The reduced heat flux results in a nozzle that requires very little energy to maintain its temperature, making it exceptionally energy efficient.\nNotice how quickly the temperature drops off. We freakin' LOVE Titanium!\nThis unique nozzle makes for an extremely compact and efficient liquefier, which gives Tiko excellent extrusion control while enabling trouble-free nozzle changing, as no molten filament ever comes into contact with the threads. It also improves print quality by minimizing the effects of radial disturbances in the carriage. \nBut isn't Titanium expensive? Sure it is, but by making the components so small, it actually reduced our costs.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nTiko\u2019s cutting-edge technologies and bespoke parts give it a completely different cost structure than any other 3D printer. It wasn't easy, but we did it, and now we're really excited to take the next step and bring Tiko to you.\nNow for $179, you can have a Tiko. What you create with it is up to you.\nAnd first movers can get a Tiko at our limited Earliest Bird ($99) and Early Bird ($139) prices.\nIf you want multiple Tikos\u2014for your whole family or a school or to simply print more things at the same time\u2014multiply $179 by the number you want and set that as your pledge amount (Example: 3 x $179 = $537 for three Tikos). \nNOTE: Multi-Tiko pledges will only be counted in multiples of $179. Earliest/Early Bird prices are limited to one-per-backer.\nOne of the questions we get asked most is, \u201cCan you use your 3D printer to print another 3D printer?\" Well, kind of! For an $18 pledge, you can get a 1/10th scale Baby Tiko Unibody\u2026 that was printed by a Tiko!\nAnd for any pledge amount, you'll be helping make 3D printing accessible and dependable for a new population of inventors who haven't had easy access before now. We'll keep you informed of our progress through consistent campaign updates, and over time we'll share creations from around the world that came to life thanks to your support. \nFULFILLMENT\nWe\u2019ve been working on Tiko for over a year. During that time, we\u2019ve gone through many iterations, developed some remarkable technologies, and created a strong network of manufacturers to form a solid supply chain. With your help, we can initiate the following steps to bring Tiko to you\u2026\nSHIPPING\nIn order to make sure that all backer information is up-to-date so we can ensure fair rates, we will collect shipping fees when we send backer surveys this Fall. Exact shipping rates will vary depending on destination, but will not exceed $65 USD per Tiko.\nTiko rewards will be shipped according to Kickstarter pledge order, starting this November. If you want your Tiko soon, you should move fast!\nWhat is it about us that makes us so different? How were we able to build Tiko, and why are we the ones to deliver? Let\u2019s get better acquainted.\nMatt Gajkowski (Center)\nMatt was born and raised to be an entrepeneur. He believes in simplicity and relentless progress, and he isn't afraid to challenge established ideas. He is the mind behind Tiko's groundbreaking technologies and the muscle that has brought them to market. Matt worked as a freelance product designer before starting Tiko. He now has a vision for the future of 3D printing and the know-how to realize it.\nSharon Charitar (Left)\nSharon gets things done. She handles Tiko's market research, community management, PR, bookkeeping, etc. You name it, she's done it, expertly. An analyst at heart, Sharon finds data that we use to improve our business and our product. She is the glue that holds all of Tiko's operations together and keeps us running smoothly and efficiently.\nMichael Zhang (Right)\nMichael was born in China and moved to Canada at age 12. He is fluent in Mandarin and has many connections back home. Michael leverages this, along with his sharp technical skill set, to work with experienced manufacturers without language or technical barriers. This enabled us to find new ways to manufacture Tiko's bespoke parts and push the envelope on Tiko's performance while reducing manufacturing costs.\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to bring Tiko to this stage, but we couldn\u2019t have done it alone. It was through the patience, support, and enthusiasm of some amazing partners that we\u2019ve made it this far.\nSpark Centre is a non-profit support organization that helps entrepreneurs bring innovative technologies to market. A passionate team, they have supported us since day one. They are the minds behind the $25,000 Ignite competition and the Thrive accelerator program. Before we met Spark, our prototype was held together with tape and popsicle sticks. If you have an idea, talk to them!\nFallon StarterKit takes the same top creative talent that works on Fallon\u2019s high-profile ad campaigns and lets them create crowdfunding campaigns for select projects. Boy are we glad they selected us! This campaign is the result of our extraordinary partnership with Fallon.\nThere are numerous other amazing companies we\u2019ve worked with for manufacturing, legal, accounting, etc. Building a printer is one thing, building a company is another, and it\u2019s because of their hard work that Tiko is ready for you.\nTiko has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With Tiko, we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create. \n\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Tiko is only as good as its parts, and up until now, all of those parts have been prototyped using 3D printing and machining. In production, our parts will be made using injection molding and other processes, which means they'll have different tolerances and mechanical properties than those we\u2019ve prototyped. If any of these changes compromises performance, we will have to go back and tool them again. This is not a fast process.\n\nFurthermore, we will not release a printer that doesn't meet our high standards, so we'll run endurance tests on every single aspect of Tiko until it's ready. This too, takes time. If something doesn\u2019t pass, it has to be analyzed, fixed, re-tooled, and re-tested.\n\nYou get the idea\u2014perfecting groundbreaking technologies isn't a quick or easy process. As a result, our biggest challenge is getting it right quickly. We don\u2019t want to rush or it will show in the final product, but we also don\u2019t want you to wait a day more than necessary. We feel confident about our timeline, and we have expert manufacturing partners who are eager to speed up the process, but our biggest challenge is staying on schedule.\n\nOther than that, you can sit back and relax\u2014with Tiko, you\u2019re going to get everything you hoped for and then some!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Section 4 Compliance", "update_content": "Hello everyone,  \nIt has been quite some time since we last spoke, and it\u2019s time to bring you up to speed.

This is because of natural curiosity. I want to encourage that curiosity as well as the imaginative thinking that comes with it. I want to remind people there's still so much to discover and explore. \n \"Nanotechnology. The science is good, the engineering is feasible, the paths of approach are many, the consequences are revolutionary-times-revolutionary, and the schedule is: in our lifetimes.\" - Stewart Brand\nWhy is Nanotechnology Important?\nNanotech is a disruptive technology. It creates new possibilities and makes things that once seemed impossible very real. Ferrofluid is just one small example of this. Researchers are currently creating other meta-materials that sound like something straight out of a sci-fi movie or video game. \nFor example, we have created objects that can bend light completely around themselves, making them invisible. We have business suits already on the market that use carbon nanotubes to make the fabric bullet proof. The potential game changing uses for carbon nanotubes alone generates a list too long to post here. New applications and discoveries are being made in this field regularly. \nAdditionally, nanotech fuels Moore's Law...\nExponential growth is explosive. Every 25 years the processing power of computers grows by a factor of 1000!\nMy Past Experience\nI often collaborate with a group known as CZFerro. CZFerro is a ferrofluid knowledge bank that specializes in ferrofluid displays. Members have been offering ferrofluid displays for sale on the internet for over 5 years and have worked with ferrofluid since 2008. Inspired Designs, LLC will have full access to CZFerro members and their expertise if needed.\nThe Science\nOkay, if you've read this far your probably interested in the science behind it. Good for you!\nFirst, I want to highlight the size 10 nm because that is the size of the nanoparticles in the ferrofluid...\nWhat is ferrofuid?\nAs you can see, ferrofluid is a magnetic liquid.\nThis is something special because all known magnetic materials lose their magnetization when they get too hot. And this always happens long before the material reaches it's melting point. The trick is to suspend tiny pieces of solid magnetic material in the liquid.\nNormally, solid particles mixed in a liquid will eventually settle to the bottom because of gravity. Much like mixing sand in water. But, if the particles are small enough (say 10 nm) they won't be pulled down by gravity. This is because of a force called Brownian Motion. \nBrownian Motion is the tendency of liquid molecules to be constantly moving around. As a result, they bombard other particles in the liquid. And when the particles are very small in size this force is strong enough to counteract the force of gravity.\nIt's a lot like a balloon being bounced around by a crowd of people. The sea of waving hands will keep bouncing the balloon back into the air.\nWhy does it spike?\nThe spiking is the result of a few different forces competing with each-other. On a fundamental level these would be the van der Waals force (attractive/repulsive forces between molecules), gravity and the magnetic force. \nIn this case, the first two forces (van der Waals and gravity) manifest themselves as surface tension and play a very big role in how the ferrofluid spikes. \nObviously, the magnetic force plays a major role in forming the spikes because we only see the spikes when we apply a sufficient magnetic field. What's really happening is we are attracting the magnetic nanoparticles with the magnetic field and this creates an uneven distribution of particles, or gradient, within the ferrofluid. This gradient follows the magnetic field lines and rearranges the nanoparticles in the ferrofuid.  \nWhy does it rise and fall (The Inspiration)?\nInitially, the ferrofluid is more dense than the clear liquid and sits at the bottom. But,the ferrofuid changes it's density when it absorbes heat from the lamp at the bottom and becomes 'lighter'. This allows it to float to the top. Then, it begins to cool and it's density changes once again. As it cools it gets 'heavier' and falls back down. Then the process repeats itself.\nWhat are Other Ferrofluid Applications?\nCooling in loudspeakers for better sound\nLiquid O-rings for making computer chips\nMagnetic hyperthermia for better chemotherapy\nTargeted drug delivery for cancer treatment\nVanessa of Ferrotec wrote a wonderful blog post where she explains these applications and more.\nBacking This Project\nBacking our Kickstarter is simple and secure, and open to people from all around the world.

However, it is true that ferrofluid is well known for throwing curve balls. Sometimes there are unexpected snags in the manufacturing process. I have been through this many times over in the past. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't possible this could happen with these new products as well. But, I do have a track record of troubleshooting these issues very well on previous projects with the CZFerro team. I also will take any complaints very seriously and do my very best to resolve any problems as quickly as possible. I will replace anything damaged during shipping free of charge. I will be as transparent as possible with my backers during order fulfillment and keep you updated on the progress as well as any speed bumps that may pop up along the way.\n\nI've watched previous ferrofluid kickstarter projects by others in the past fumble both the R&D as well as transparency and do not wish to follow in their path.

It\u2019s a pair of encryption devices you put in between your phone and headset, which are connected through standard 3.5mm audio jacks. You can secure your phone line by simply pushing the JackPair button, and your voice will be encrypted. There\u2019s no password to remember, no software to install, no service to subscribe to, and it works with any phone through a standard audio jack.\nJackPair in the News\nFrom Bruce Schneier:\n\"JackPair is a clever device encrypts your voice between your headset and the audio jack. The crypto looks competent, and the design looks well-thought-out. I'd use it.\"\nTechCrunch - \"The concept is pretty simple: one box plugs into your phone, whether that\u2019s a smartphone, landline telephone or VoIP client on a PC, via the standard 3.5mm headphone jack ...\"\nArs Technica - \"JackPair is part of a wider movement that has struggled against a darker facet of the Internet\u2014the ease with which it can be monitored.\"\neWeek - \"The hardware approach of cryptography still has a lot of appeal in establishing secure communications.\"\nTechnologyTell - \"How it works is simple.\"\nTechFaster - \"Whether you\u2019re in any of the professions above or you\u2019re just concerned about your privacy, JackPair is definitely worth considering.\"\n[Update]\nMany viewers have expressed that the current look of JackPair can be improved.  So we have worked with professional design firms and come up with a few new designs proposals here:\nYou can vote and comment here on Facebook, leave your feedback in the KS comment section, or contact me for your remarks. We'll pick a winning proposal based on your feedback here and use it as the final industrial design for JackPair.\n\nAffordable Tool For Everyone\nThe existing secure phones on the market today cost anywhere from over six hundred to a few thousand dollars.  It's out of reach for most people, and the worst part is that, you have to give up the phones you're using everyday, and switch to whatever secure phone models dictated by the vendors.  With JackPair, we're enabling every citizen to protect our own privacy by making it under a hundred bucks, and you get to keep using your favorite phones while talking through JackPair's Secure Line.\nOne-Click Solution\nUsing JackPair, you can easily protect your privacy by just pushing the JackPair button.  During a phone call, if both sides have JackPair installed, either side can simply push the JackPair button to pair up the two JackPair devices. This triggers JackPair to encrypt your voice conversation using a One-Time-Secret -Key (OTSK) that is created on the fly. The same OTSK is automatically-created and self-destroyed at both ends without leaving the JackPair box.  This means you don\u2019t have to remember any password, and no one can break into your conversation without this One-Time-Secret-Key.\nNo Trace Left Behind\nAt any time during your phone call, when you push the JackPair button, a new One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK) is generated to encrypt your voice conversation.  This OTSK is created locally in each of the JackPair devices at both ends of the phone call without being exposed over the network(*), and it is destroyed immediately after the phone call is finished, without being stored anywhere outside the JackPair device.  The OTSK is short-lived and self-managed;  it never leaves the JackPair box.  So there is no chance for the OTSK to be compromised by anybody, whether intentionally or accidentally.  This simple security design leaves no trace behind; it not only protects your voice, but also saves us, as the device maker, from the trouble of being harassed by the government or exploited by hackers.\nBesides key exchange protocols, the encryption algorithm in JackPair is based on Salsa20 stream cipher, which is selected by eSTREAM, the ENCRYPT Stream Cipher Project organized by the European Union, as part of its final software portfolio since 2008.  Stream Cipher like Salsa20 is a natural fit with OTSK, which is used as the seed for PRNG (Pseudo Randon Number Generator) to create key streams with similar property of One-Time Pad.  JackPair uses open source encryption software and will stay open sourced.\n(*): The One-Time-Secret-Key in JackPair is generated using Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange protocol, which is a well-known, fundamental protocol in the security industry since 1976; it allows creation of shared secret without exchanging it over the network (see illustration below).\nDirect With No Middleman\nJackPair is designed with end-to-end security in mind: there\u2019s no relay server or service provider involved in either the voice encryption or the One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK) creation, and the OTSK is never disclosed anywhere, not even to the other party on the phone call.  In order to make sure both sides use the same OTSK for voice encryption and there\u2019s no middleman bridging the call, the Pairing Code(*) is designed as a simple way for both parties to authenticate each other through their own voices over the same phone phone.  After your JackPair device has paired up with the other party\u2019s (ie, when the LED light turns from red to green), The first thing you should do is to read the Pairing Code on your screen to the other party over the phone, and verify that the Pairing Code is the same on both ends.  The fact that the other party recognizes your voice and acknowledges with the same Pairing Code means these two JackPair devices are directly connecting with each other, with no middleman bridging the call through any other JackPair devices.\n(*): Pairing Code is the abbreviated hash digest number of One-Time-Secret-Key (OTSK).\nWork With Any Phone\nJackPair is a standard audio adapter that can be plugged into any phone with a headset and microphone. At any time during a phone call, both parties can plug in the JackPair device to continue their conversation in secure mode over the same call.  JackPair is connected with phones through its 3.5 mm audio jack, which is the universal standard as the audio interface for all kinds of devices, including all tablets, laptops, personal computers, and most mobile phones & Voice-Over-IP devices.  For plain old telephone sets, JackPair also includes a RJ9-to-3.5mm converter for handset-free operation(*). Unlike other security devices on the market that are hard to use and work only with specific phones or carriers, JackPair is compatible with all of your favorite phones today. With JackPair, you don\u2019t have to make the trade-off between personal security and life style.\n(*): optional accessories included in Full Pack only.\nIn addition to the 3.5mm audio jack, we also have Bluetooth in our pipeline for the second-generation JackPair. This will make it even easier for you to protect your voice while keep using your favorite phones & gadgets, and it will also prevent Bluetooth headsets from being eavesdropped, since your voice is encrypted by JackPair before it\u2019s transmitted through Bluetooth headsets.  Stay tuned for more update on Bluetooth.\nOpen Source Security\nWe plan to make it open source for the encryption software in JackPair. This allows our code to be scrutinized by the community and, if there\u2019s any security hole, it\u2019ll be identified & fixed quickly. We understand that security cannot be taken for granted and requires constant vigilance, and open source is a great way for the community to help out and for us to stay alert. \n\nIn addition to open source software, we intend to do open hardware for JackPair as well.  The schematics and gerber-files will be publicly available to make it easier for everyone to review.  The licenses we are considering so far is Creative Commons - Attribution - ShareAlike 3.0.  Let us know if you have better ideas here.\n\n\nWhy JackPair? I Have Nothing to Hide\nThe right to privacy is not just about \u201csecrecy\u201d or \u201chaving something to hide\u201d. With modern surveillance technologies, the Government\u2019s massive data collection and mining programs are problematic even if people have nothing to hide. The large-scale harvest of small bits of seemingly innocuous data allows weaving of a much more telling big picture of individuals, but it often failed to reflect the whole story.   The problem lies in not only information \u201cgathering\u201d, but also information \u201cprocessing\u201d, and here\u2019s some examples you should worry about:\nDistortion & Misinterpretation: What if the government mistakenly determines that, based on your pattern of activities, you\u2019re likely to engage in a criminal act? What if the government thinks your financial transactions look odd\u2014even if you've done nothing wrong\u2014and freezes your accounts?\nLeaking & Secondary Use: What if the government or carrier operator leaks your information to third-parties or the public? What if the government doesn't protect your information with adequate security, and an identity thief obtains it and uses it to defraud you? How long will personal data be stored? And what can it be used for in the future? A lot of times we do not even know about the leakage of our records until long after the damage is done.\nExclusion of Access: Most data gathered by the government is kept secret for national security reasons, and people are barred from accessing and correcting errors in that data. What if the government denies you the right to fly without giving you any reason?\nAn argument could be that the government does not intend to hurt average citizens. In many cases that is true, but the government can, and has, also harmed people inadvertently, due to errors, carelessness, or policy changes. These massive surveillance programs are no longer about what information people want to hide; they make the individuals powerless and vulnerable in front of the bureaucracy, and create a power imbalance between People and Government. To change the dynamics, JackPair is the affordable tool that enables average citizens to protect themselves against wiretapping and harassment from Big Brother. \nThe Story Behind JackPair\nJackPair is inspired in large part by Edward Snowden. The first Snowden leak led to the revelation that the NSA collects records of every U.S. phone call under a call log metadata program. It shows that the data collection is no longer about targeted acquisition of information to avert threats. Such a massive scale of surveillance programs has undermined the fundamental American values of freedom and privacy. America is sliding into a state of universal surveillance. This also reminds me of the police state where I grew up, Taiwan. Before the democratic reform, the government could spy on you without reasons and arrest you based on words you have said. Even today, there are still WaterGate-like scandals happening and the politicians get away without any accountability.\nWith all these breaking news unrolled in front of us, I started to ask myself, what can we do to stop the abusive wiretapping and protect the democracy & freedom we all believe in as Americans? If we can\u2019t stop the abuse of power from its root, then what\u2019s the next best thing we can do to protect ordinary citizens from being harassed by the abusive power?\nAs a network security engineer, I've been involved in both sides of the security arm races; on the defense side, I've built computer firewalls and virtual private networks for millions of uses, and on the offensive side, I\u2019ve designed peer-to-peer protocols and network traversal programs that penetrate those firewalls and VPNs. I know how complex the security technologies can be, and how hard it is for average citizens to make use of the security technologies to defend themselves. Existing solutions available on the market are either too difficult to use, way too expensive, or just not secure at all. So we rolled up our sleeves and built one that\u2019s simple, affordable, and compatible with any phone you already have.\nThis is how JackPair was born.\nThe Team At Work\nAWIT is consists of a small engineering team with high-caliber professionals in the field of distributed networking, embedded systems, peer-to-peer, mobile game, security, and online/web technologies. From the very beginning of this JackPair project, we had the debate of whether it should be a pure software, mobile app solution, or a standalone hardware product.\nEvaluation boards for JackPair prototyping\n After surveying the current software solutions on the market, it became clear to us that it\u2019s just too easy to break these mobile apps, and both ends of the conversation must use smart phones for it to work. A hardware product built from scratch is the only way to have the security clearance. The current secure phones on the market costs anywhere from over six hundred to a few thousand dollars, which are out of reach for most people. The challenge is how to build a hardware solution that is affordable, easy-to-use, and compatible with most people\u2019s existing phones at hand.\nInitial Design of JackPair\nWith the requirements in mind, we set out to find appropriated evaluation boards for our design. I had started off with TI\u2019s LaunchPad board, then Dark Shenada, AWIT\u2019s guru in embedded system, had taken over and switched to ST Micro\u2019s Discovery Boards. We had some initial success there, but it don't meet our requirements for audio channels, and we think we can do better in terms of reducing the component complexity & cost. With help from our friends of professional consultants for schematics and gerber-file PCB layout, we began to put together our own circuit design with minimal components.\nJackPair PCB top/side/bottom views\nAfter a few crash and burns, with more helps from team members like Scott and Simon, we are able to pack all the functionality required for JackPair into a small PCB the size of a cigarette lighter. At the same time, Jackie, the Jack of All Trade in AWIT team, has spent time with designer and mechanical engineer to come up with industrial design for the housing of JackPair.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWith software & hardware prototypes in place, we have started to talk with our friends and partners in the field of contract manufactures, as well as housing and industrial designs.  AWIT has long-term EMS partners locally right here in Silicon Valley, California, so JackPair will be manufactured and assembled in the United States, although some of the parts like accessory cables might be sourced through non-domestic channels.\nWe're stretching as far as we can into this project, and the next step is to go into mass production. It costs quite a bit for the tooling & material sourcing in volumes, and we definitely need the Kickstarter community\u2019s help now to fund the project and spread the words. So it\u2019s time to debut JackPair here at Kickstarter.com.\nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign, our next step will be to start the custom tooling & PCB manufacturing process, as well as the testing & certifications required for encryption electronics. Here\u2019s our road map:\nJuly/August: meet our sponsors at Kickstarter, finalize industrial design and negotiate manufacturing agreements.\nSeptember: finalize the mechanical design and place orders for tooling; procurement of electronic parts and materials.\nOctober: pilot productions, tooling build-out, quality verification and certificate qualification.\nNovember: batch manufacturing of PCB, SMT, and housing.\nDecember: assembly and shipment.\n  How You Can Help\nThe cost of tooling, electronic materials, PCB layout, testing and certification approval are quite expensive, and more importantly, in order to make JackPair affordable tool for everyone, we need volume manufacturing with economies of scale to bring down the price of each JackPair device.  Many of our friends have jumped in to help with prototyping of JackPair, and your sponsorship is vital for bringing JackPair to the next step of mass production and making it affordable for ordinary citizens to defend their own right to privacy.  So please pledge your support to make JackPair the tool for everyone.\n                     Dragon Innovation has done a 3rd-party review of JackPair and has pre-qualified that we're a team that knows our stuff and that we have a manufacturable product.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are a seasoned team with vast experiences in embedded system design and implementation. Although we have existing relationships with the suppliers & manufactures we intend to partner with, they are external to us and may introduce delay during the process. We are confident in our choice of vendors, but also looking for backup suppliers, in case any road block may arise.\n\nThe U.S. Government places restrictions on the export of encryption devices like JackPair. Since the encryption software in JackPair is open sourced, we think JackPair is qualified as a self-classified encryption item and can be exported without complex encryption registrations. However, the U.S. exports controls are complex and we are not lawyers. There might be the risk of US government limiting our ability to make JackPair available to citizens worldwide, or even being used within the U.S. In that case, the only alternative would be to have non-U.S. citizens develop the JackPair encryption software from scratch again. This has been referred as the U..S. \u201cexport jobs, not crypto\u201d policy.\n\nShipping JackPair to International users pose another challenge; some countries have made private communications illegal, and there might be risks of confiscation for JackPair shipment. We don\u2019t know the government\u2019s reaction to JackPair yet, and will keep an eye on it. The community can help us in figuring this out collectively, and being creative for workarounds.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Pilot Shipment with Early Feedback", "update_content": "Dear Backer,\nLast month, you should have received email from us to verify and update your shipping address.

One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nPlayers are going to be working together, managing threat and attempting to keep up with the evolving Turn Deck.

Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nWhy YOU should back Tiny Epic Defenders on Kickstarter:\nBesides it being a epic good time, without Kickstarter, and more importantly YOU, the game would not be produced. So waiting around to find it at your FLGS or favorite online retailer would NOT even be an option!\nWe need people to back it on Kickstarter to get it made. So, here are the incentives we've offered:\n\u2022 36% discounted from MSRP (on an already super cheap game). $16 on KS instead of $25 retail.\n\u2022 FREE US Shipping + Discounted International Shipping\n\u2022 Get *Kickstarter Limited Exclusive content through the Deluxe Package. Includes extra Heroes, Dire Enemies, Epic Foes and Artifacts!\n*Kickstarter Limited Exclusives - VERY limited quantity printed. Will never enter regular distribution channels but may become available via contests, conventions, and/or the BGG store.\nWhy we use Kickstarter.\nWe choose to use Kickstarter because of the people. Kickstarter has a very supportive and enthusiastic community that we've grown to love.\nOur experience with Kickstarter began as a project creators. I, personally, had not backed a project prior to making my own, that quickly changed. The philanthropy demonstrated by the backers that so generously supported our projects became contagious. We're not just project creators anymore, we are backers now and we love it! Backing a project is a little bit like being Santa Claus in helping make dreams come true! Then getting it in the mail later is a lot like being a kid on Christmas day! It's a win, win.\nThere's more than one way to fund the publication of a board game and even within the crowd-funding concept there are several options but none that compare to Kickstarter. Without the wonderful community of Kickstarter we would not be where we are today. That is why we feel it is important to give back. Kickstarter has changed our business and our lives in a big way and if we can play a small part in changing someone else's life in a big way we will!\nWe have worked very hard to bring Tiny Epic Defenders to this point. Many people have put a lot of hard work into this game but entering production is very expensive and unfortunately outside the limitations of our resources. The game has been enjoyed by so many and some awesome memories have been made. With your help, we can make this game a reality and share the unique experience within with a lot of people.\nThank you Kickstarter and thank you backers! If you pledge your support to this project we give you our word that we will respect your efforts and use every last penny pledged to deliver the best possible product we can.\nGamelyn Games, LLC. is a board game publishing company based out of Mesa, Arizona and was founded in 2012 by Michael and Brittany Coe.\nGamelyn Games is dedicated to providing innovative games and accessories that attract players of all ages and interests. We are truly dedicated to creating fun and unique products!\nGamelyn Games has published Fantasy Frontier, Dungeon Heroes (board game and iOS), and the Lords of the Undead and The Dragon and the Damsel expansions to Dungeon Heroes. We have also created the Fantasy Gaming Figures and GIANT meeples products. We currently have Tiny Epic Kingdoms in production, scheduled for a Q4 release.

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have experience in successfully fulfilling multiple board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer I have used to create of Rise!, The Lost Dutchman, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures,the GIANT Meeples and Tiny Epic Kingdoms. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Defenders will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes and Fantasy Frontier. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked also handles our pledge management, as well as defected parts and missing pieces. They have proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, we are dedicated to 100% backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, as to involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present daily to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

In recent years, we've set our sights on the gaming community in and around the great city of Wichita, running local gamedays and sponsoring charity events, promoting tabletop gaming, and spreading out to embrace the global community through online publications, gaming podcasts, and social media. Now we're taking our devotion to the next logical level... a major gaming convention located right here in the heartland.\nWichita has cons. We have scifi cons, anime cons, steampunk cons, comic book cons... the list goes on. But no gaming cons. We envision a convention capable of entertaining as many gamers as our surrounding environs can throw at us, with big rooms for tabletop games - board games, card games, miniatures, and RPGs - and organized tournaments for CCGs and minis, LARPs!, specially organized RPG events, a dealer hall/artist alley, cosplaying contests, panels, live media coverage, a VIG lounge, plenty of swag and prizes, and even some live entertainment!\nOur team encompasses decades of experience in running live gaming events and includes a staff of experienced gamers and game masters of every ilk. We will offer preregistration for numerous games and plenty of open gaming opportunities. Attendees can get in on some old school RPG action or sit down and try something new. We also have access to a sizable library of hobby games and knowledgeable folk to help you get started.\nHotel At Old Town\nWichita is a beautiful city with much to offer congoers from outside the area. TsunamiCon 2014 will be held at the Hotel At Old Town in the heart of Wichita's entertainment district, with over 50 shops, restaurants, theatres and nightspots in the surrounding area. Attendees will have access to special room rates at the hotel, as well as some exciting opportunities to participate in organized con-related events right there in the historic Old Town district (pub crawl, anyone!?).  And the hotel has FREE parking for attendees in an attached parking garage.\nWe have the entire convention center for the weekend, around 10,000 square feet that can be broken up to meet our needs. And we want YOU to help us determine how we're going to use it. The bigger the project gets, the bigger and better the con.\nSeveral big gaming companies and area businesses are chipping in with great gaming support, events, and prizes. Gaming events will include a sanctioned Magic tournament, Prismatic Tsunami's convention-spanning Zombie Dice tourney, some organized LARPs, a Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures tournament, some D&D Fifth Edition organized play, Pathfinder Society, and more!  Prize and event supporters include:\nBlack Blade Publishing\nDays of Wonder\nDGS Games\nDicepouch.com\nHero Complex Games and Entertainment\nLone Wolf Development\nMana Vault Casual Gaming and Collectibles\nPinnacle Entertainment\nPost World Games\nReaper Miniatures\nSteve Jackson Games\nThe Burrow: Gifts For Geeks\nWizards of the Coast\nLearn more at our website: http://www.tsunamicon.org\nFollow us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/tsunamiconwichita\nVolunteers and Game Masters\nThe Volunteer and Game Master reward levels are for attendees committed to provided the two vital services that make our convention possible.  Volunteers pledging at this level must sign up for eight (8) hours of volunteer service spread out over the convention, to be employed as needed (registration, checking badges, helping with special events, running errands, handing out swag, assisting Game Masters, and so forth).  You are responsible for reviewing our volunteer policies and submitting an application to volunteer at the event no later than October 1st.  Failure to register as a volunteer will require you to pay the difference at will-call to acquire your badge.\nGame Masters pledging at this level must register to run at least eight (8) hours of gaming (two 4-hour slots with at least 6 seats at the table). Preregistration will be available soon on the TsunamiCon website. Game Masters are encouraged to promote their games on social media to elicit registration, but you are not penalized for failing to fill the seats at your tables.  Failure to register your games by October 31st will require you to pay the difference at will-call to acquire your badge.\nV-I-Gs (Very Important Gamers)\nOur rewards include two V-I-G levels available to gamers looking to milk the most out of their con experience.  Both levels provide you with swag bags stuffed with all the convention swag mentioned in the lower levels - such as custom dice, TsunamiCon tee-shirts, and custom leather key fobs - as well as any other custom gifts we introduce to help support the convention.  You also get exclusive access to our V-I-G lounge, where you can relax, graze from the free snacks and beverages provided only to V-I-Gs, and otherwise spend a little time recouping or visiting with other V-I-Gs and convention guests.\nGold Level V-I-Gs also gain access to an exclusive gaming event featuring an adventure written and published by Prismatic Tsunami Publishing explicitly for the con.  You will also receive signed copies of the adventure and an invitation to a private dinner on Sunday evening with TsunamiCon organizers and guests and the cast of Metagamers Anonymous.\nAdd-ons are available by adding the appropriate amount to your pledge. Note that you are better served by selected The Real Deal pledge level if you simply want to add even a set of dice to your 3-Day Pass.  Whatever your pledge, simply add the following amount to your pledge for each additional item.\n   $15: Add a custom set of TsunamiCon dice to your pledge.\n   $20: Add a TsunamiCon tee-shirt to your pledge.\n   $35: Add an additional 3-Day Pass.\n $120: Add a four-pack of 3-Day Passes.\nNote that the reward levels for dice and shirts include the costs of shipping if you are not attending the convention.

Additionally, a small army of volunteers stand ready to make this convention a success.

It never comes to boredom or breaks, because the players are constantly involved. The atmosphere and the wonderfully exaggerated graphics and texts stimulate the motivation to always step up and roll again, even if the opponent can so often get the better throw. There are very few dice games that can play on the happiness of frustration so well!\"\n- www.HeimSpiele.info\nFor most sport simulation games the results and the scores are delivered in gentle rolls and careful curating of dice. Sums are made and scores are decided; its all very British, it is all very gentlemanly, and civil. Luchador! sweeps all that off the table in one grand gesture...Luchador! deserves its space on your shelf for its simple casual play mechanics and its grand standing, mucho macho bravado, theatrics which it calls out for. For now if you spot a Luchador! box in the wild go ahead and grab it; its the filler your game group deserves.\"\n- Beasts of War\n\"With the theme it has, it\u2019s a great game to end the night. Light, quick, and boisterous enough to wake you up for the drive home. It\u2019s great fun. Loud fun, too \u2013 you better warn the neighbors.\"\n- Meople's Magazine\nI love everything this game brings to the table. Theme, components, gameplay, replayability, ease of tutorial, everything. This game is going to see the table a phenomenal amount of times as it makes a stonking start to a game night or a halfway palette cleanser to put in between heavier games.

Read more now!\nImportant updates, in case you missed them:\nSTRETCH GOALS #1: What we can do if we reach $5,000,000!\nT-SHIRT DESIGNS: Three limited-edition designs to choose from! \nADD-ON REWARDS: Instructions for adding more rewards!\nORIGINAL DVDs: Now available as reward add-ons!\nHi. LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

The Unnatural Axe -  Sculpted by Guest Designer Will Chapman from BrickArms!\n2. The Rat on the Stick - Why? Because!\n3. The Triple-Barreled Shotgun - From Munchkin Cthulhu. Three times the fun!\n4.

We will be adjusting and tweaking some of the details and refining the overall scale of the pieces for the Final versions. The Munchkinomicon has real working hinges and can be held open to reveal special mysteries!\nAs things are progressing we will be sharing with backers via frequent and entertaining project updates.\nHOW DO YOU MAKE AWESOME STUFF LIKE THIS?   \nA long process of digital sculpture in various CAD and art programs is done to create the initial art. Many weeks of refining and direction are used to find the perfect balance of aesthetics and engineering. Real-world prototypes are created from these digital art files and these are then evaluated to make sure they are going to fit the proportions and style of the figure. It takes a long time, but the nice part is that I have already completed this aspect of the project! What remains is to finance the expensive process of machining the steel injection mold tooling followed by the tuning of the production process to create the actual parts via injection molded plastic. This is the same high quality ABS material and colors used in popular brick products.\nTHE CRATE OF HOARDING!\nBrickArms www.brickarms.com  is the #1 provider of custom weapons and parts for your favorite brick figures.\nThey have created these amazing minifig-scaled crates and as part of your pledge offering you can get one of these special custom-printed Munchkin Crates only available through Kickstarter.

With the help of our incredible backers, we have unlocked every stretch goal, funded a staggering 60 worlds, and reached 1000% of our original funding target. This has been an incredible campaign and we are deeply grateful for the support we've received.\n(Are you a backer looking for your Beta invite? Please see the first FAQ at the bottom of this page \u2014 the info you need is there!)\n\u201cStorium is everything I never knew I always wanted in a game.\u201d \u2014 Eve Jacob, playtester\nStories are part of what makes us human. They\u2019re all around us, from books and movies to TV and video games. Experiencing a good story can be one of life\u2019s great pleasures. But telling your own can be even more fun!\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve devoted the last year of our lives to creating Storium, the online storytelling game. We\u2019ve been playtesting an early version for months with hundreds of people. The feedback has been amazing, and we\u2019re ready to bring Storium to the public. We need your help to make it happen.\nStorium is a web-based online game that you play with friends. It works by turning writing into a multiplayer game. With just your computer, tablet, or smartphone, you can choose from a library of imaginary worlds to play in, or build your own. You create your story\u2019s characters and decide what happens to them. You can tell any kind of story with Storium. The only limit is your imagination.\nStorium uses familiar game concepts inspired by card games, role-playing games, video games, and more. In each Storium game, one player is the narrator, and everyone else takes on the role of a character in the story. The narrator creates dramatic challenges for the other players to overcome. In doing so, they move the story forward in a new direction. Everyone gets their turn at telling the story.\n\u201cStory and Game had a baby, and it\u2019s Storium. This is vital stuff, equal parts revolutionary and fundamental \u2014 giving the old ways of storytelling a major digital upgrade.\u201d\u2014 Chuck Wendig, novelist and screenwriter\nThe following three-minute video gives you a glimpse of our current beta playtest:\nWhat makes Storium special?\nTotal freedom: You decide what happens in your story.\nMultiplayer: Write and play with your friends, online.\nAsynchronous: Play at your own pace.\nWorlds: Pre-made playsets that help you tell stories in different settings and styles.\nSomething for everyone: You can tell any kind of story you want!\n\u201cStorium is one of the most fascinating systems I\u2019ve ever used to facilitate games, and it\u2019s helped me fall in love with storytelling all over again.\u201d\u2013 Lillian Cohen-Moore, playtester\nThis campaign funds the work that\u2019s needed to launch Storium to the general public. That means:\n1. Worlds for you to play in\nStorium needs a wider library of what we call worlds. Each world is a complete playset that gives you all the tools you need to play a game in a certain style or fictional setting. This includes virtual playing cards that drive gameplay, ideas for stories, pre-made characters, and backstory. We\u2019ve assembled an award-winning group of novelists, game designers, storytellers, and artists to create these worlds. Some worlds are wholly new, while others are adaptations of worlds you\u2019ll recognize.\n2. Important features\nThere are key features that Storium still needs. Your support will help us build them. This list is subject to change based on prioritization and technical feasibility, but here are a few of the examples we are considering:\nReal-time play: Chat and play live with your friends when they\u2019re online.\nShared narration: Give everyone in your game a chance to be the narrator.\nParallel storytelling: Play out two scenes at the same time with different characters.\nImproved support for tablets and smartphones: Play using interfaces created specifically for your mobile device.\n3. Technology and team\nOperating an online service like Storium can be a labor-intensive and expensive task. While it's easy to use and play, behind the scenes Storium is a complex piece of engineering. It requires dedicated, ongoing developer attention. We also have to pay for servers, storage, and a number of underlying services upon which the system relies. As Storium grows, these costs increase. \n\nWe\u2019ve been working full-time on Storium without pay for over a year now. That\u2019s how much this project means to us. We've set our target goal as low as possible, but anything we raise beyond that helps ensure that as Storium grows and evolves, we\u2019ll be able to keep up by investing in the technology and people we need.\n\n\u201cStorium revolutionizes storytelling not by new bells and whistles but by returning it to its most pure form in this most complex of ages \u2014 dynamic characters and people telling evocative and passionate stories.\u201d \u2014 John Adamus, playtester\n\n\n\nHere's a visual overview of the rewards we're offering!\nAnd here are more details about a few of the more popular rewards:\nBeta player\nEvery backer at the BETA PLAYER ($10) level gets instant access to our current beta test of Storium. You\u2019ll find an invitation URL in campaign update #1 (backers only). This URL enables you to immediately sign-up, start a game, and invite your friends to play with you.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is an early test version of Storium. We expect it to change and grow quite a bit before the public launch. As a beta player, we welcome your feedback. There\u2019s a \u201cGive feedback\u201d button at the top of every page that goes to a built-in playtesters-only feedback system.\n\nMember\nWhen it launches to the public, Storium will have a modest annual membership fee of $25 per year \u2014 the equivalent of just $2 per month. Becoming a backer at the MEMBER ($20) level gets you your first year of Storium membership (starting on the date we launch publicly) for just $20.\n\nMembers will also be granted a special ability when Storium launches publicly: the use of our forthcoming World Creator tools to build their own Storium worlds and share them with the Storium community.\n\n(By the way, there will always be a free version of Storium \u2014 and it will be the full game, not a demo version. You\u2019ll be able to play up to three games, with full functionality, before you have to pay any membership fee!)\n\nWe want to grow Storium into a sustainable business, and we want to do it without plastering the game with advertisements. Our membership fee will help make that possible.\n\nThe Deal\nOur campaign starts by funding ten worlds, but we have dozens more in the works from a wide array of award-winning creators. Every backer at THE DEAL ($40) level will get a year of Storium membership, plus early and ongoing access to every world that we fund through this Kickstarter. This means you'll always be able to play games in these worlds, regardless of whatever they end up costing in the future.\n\n(When Storium launches publicly, many of our Kickstarter worlds will have a small fee for usage. Much like how Apple's App Store works, Storium world creators will have the option of charging app-like prices for their worlds. We will then pass on the majority of the proceeds to the world's creator! We hope this will become great new way for players and fans alike to support the authors and designers whose work they love.)\n\n\"I work nights and weekends and haven\u2019t been able to game with my friends in years.

Help us make this a reality. Better yet: help us make this awesome.\nEndGame in Old Oakland lives in the corner space of the Historic Swan's Market. It's pretty much the best location ever, with great neighbors and easy access for our fans near and far. We're surrounded by wonderful restaurants, we're near to the convention center, and Swan's offers us big windows that let in a lot of light. All of this has added up to make EndGame one of the most distinctive and pleasant game stores you'll ever care to visit.\nTogether with the high quality gaming community of the bay area, we've brought ten years of games and laughter to the neighborhood. As our lease came up for renewal this year, we asked ourselves what more we can do to serve the neighborhood and gaming community. \nWhen we asked ourselves that question, we realized that it was time to take OUR game up a notch, and provide even more incentive for people to come down, enjoy the store, and play games. \nBut how?\nElbow Room\nEndGame was founded on the desire for building the gamestore we always wanted. We started as a one man operation on Lakeshore thirteen years ago and have spent the last ten being a great place to be in Old Oakland. We love community, and that\u2019s why our entire upstairs space is devoted to a place where people from all walks of life can meet, play games, attend special events, and become friends.\nAs we've grown, we've seen that some types of events are great to host but had a huge impact on our regularly scheduled, daily events. The Doubleclicks, Molly Lewis, and Marian Call have all performed musical shows in our space. We've been asked to do author signings, spoken word and improv shows, and more. \nAll we need to keep doing that is a place to make it work. And we found one, right next door. We're even building a small stage in there for the performances!\nWhy a Cafe?\nFor years, we've been one of the only late evening destinations in Old Oakland that isn't a sit-down restaurant or pub. The closest coffee shops close by 7:30pm, leaving folks with few options for quick dining, and no options for warm delicious coffee and tea. \nSo we combined this need with our idea for an event space to come up with the whole plan. Everyone (not just gamers) loves their caffeine at all times of the day\u2014so why not make sure they can get it? It just feels natural!\nWe built the gamestore we had always wanted, and for thirteen years we have been committed to growing that here in Oakland. Now we want to try something new, doing the same with coffee\u2014something else we're passionate about. We need your help to make it a reality. \nIt's also about investing in the neighborhood, in Oakland. The space next door to us has been a perennially empty storefront. Expanding into it to create our cafe gives our little corner of Old Oakland a facelift, and we're happy to do it. \nWe're also committed to bringing in locally sourced coffee and food items. That's something we're still investigating, and we will talk more about as the campaign progresses\u2014if you have any suggestions, please do leave a comment to let us know!\nIn short there are tons of reasons to do this, and they all have to do with serving our neighborhood and our customers as best as we possibly can. The EndGame Cafe isn't just about expanding our store; it's about expanding what Old Oakland has to offer. And we're excited to bring you in as a part of that.\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nWe have secured basic funding to get us started, but we would like to do more. The initial goal on this project gives us the boost we need to get the business up and running right at launch. Your pledge means money for espresso machines, a plumbing buildout, chairs, tables, the construction of the event stage, and more.\nWhen we pass our initial funding target, we will announce stretch goals to make our new space (and maybe even the old one) a whole lot more fun, too. \nIn short, we're looking for your help to make this a cafe that steps up and delivers with EndGame quality and EndGame style. We couldn't have gotten this far without the help of our fans and community, after all!\nMore than money, your social network is our best friend. Please, be loud on our behalf. It means a lot to us, even if you never pledge yourself. :)\nWe also want to give all our fans a way to be a part of EndGame's next evolution. Read on for the details.\nSo how are we gonna get to goal?\nIt's been a tremendous pleasure to be part of many of your lives in the 10 years EndGame has been around. We have fans just a block away, and some across the world in Australia, Finland, and tons of other locations people have visited from. We're super aware (and thrilled) that our community extends well beyond the bounds of Oakland, beyond California. \nSo how do we make sure everyone gets to participate?\nAs you will see, many of our reward tiers are intended for locals, with local pick up. (We have to keep shipping costs at zero to make all this work.) But we have two great ways to show your love for EndGame no matter where you live.\nRewards for Everyone, Wherever You Are\nEveryone at $10 and above gets a PDF of an Exclusive Fiasco Playset by Jason Morningstar, a Fate adventure scenario based around EndGame by Ryan Macklin, and a Print and Play EndGame themed Card game by Eric Vogel. (What are these? See the very end under the plans)\n#1 - Join the Wall of Heroes. \nAs you can see from the image below, the more you pledge, the larger your Hex with your name  (or your company's name) will be appear in our permanent Wall of Heroes display. This will hang on the game store's wall until the end of days. Names given are subject to our approval.\nWith a pledge starting at $10 you will get your name/business in a hex placement on the Wall. The more you pledge, the bigger your hex! These hexes will be put against a dark purple background (seen above), so those high-value hexes should really \"pop\". \nThis is a Mockup only, final concept may appear different.\n#2 - Become a HERO OF GLORY. \nChoose the HERO OF GLORY reward tier and you can sponsor one or more sections of the game store or cafe, one section per $25 contributed. We will add your name to a plaque prominently displayed in the area you have chosen! (More than one backer may sponsor the same section. We'll size the plaque to fit! Names given are subject to our approval.)\nYou may also add a section sponsorship to any higher-value reward tier by adding $25 to your pledge.\nHeroes of Glory\n  #3 - Become a company sponsor. \nWe have a long list of things we will need for our cafe that we will re-order all the time. We'd love to get your logo on there (subject to our approval)! With both the Basic and Advanced sponsorships, you will have a variety of goods to choose from for 2 full years no matter how many we end up printing.\nBasic and Advanced Sponsors\nRewards for Our Local Supporters\nWe have a number of tiers for our locals that offer a wealth of food and beverages. We haven't entirely sussed out the cafe's menu yet, so we've left it easy for you to choose once the cafe is up and running. Choose a level that lets you fill your mug and your belly while hanging out and playing with your friends or attending a gamer-friendly event!\nPlease note, Copper through Elemental Crystal Heroes get the perks for one year from the date the cafe opens for business. (Limited to supply on hand.)\nThe Bottom Line\nWe are eager to bring a new era of EndGame, gaming, and community to our supporters and neighborhood. Let's make this as awesome as we know it can be. With our powers combined, the Cafe will open with a java-powered bang! \nThanks for your support, your voice, and the past ten years, folks. You are why we're looking forward to the our new chapter for EndGame, and we're thrilled to have you as a part of it.\nLet's do this!\nOur Stretch Goals\nCredits\nOwners of EndGame: Aaron Lawn, Chris Hanrahan, Finn Kisch, Chris Ruggiero, Philip Pederson-Hanrahan\nThe Crew at EndGame: Mike Montesa and Matt Sommer-Reid\nCopyWriter and KSer Graphics: Fred Hicks\nPhotos: Ben Krantz\nVideographer: Erik Scanlon\nVideo Editing/Direction: Eric Vogel\nWall of Heroes Concept: Josh Qualtieri\nSpecial thanks to everyone who contributed to the building of the KS. there are WAY too many of you to thank individually.\nElevation Plans for the New Caf\u00e9\nPlans for the New Caf\u00e9\n What are these Digital Awards?\nEndGame is a game store first and foremost, and we know a lot of you are coming here to help make the cafe happen because of what we've meant to you as a game store. So naturally we wanted to thank you all for your pledges with some games!\n\nTwo of the most popular roleplaying games we sell at the store are Fiasco and Fate Core. If you pledge at least $10, we'll be sending you PDFs of new scenarios for each of them after the campaign is over. One will be a brand-new playset for Fiasco by the game's author, Jason Morningstar. Another will be a Fate adventure set around a fictionalized version of EndGame, written by Ryan Macklin.\n\nAnd for those of a more card-game inclination, we'll be providing the print-and-play digital files for a EndGame card game created by local game designer Eric Vogel.\n\nNo matter what you like to play when you visit us \u2014 or wherever you live \u2014 we've got something for you for just a little bit of coin.

When the new website launches, these images will appear in your user lookup.\nCharacter Profile\nUsing photos and information you send us about yourself, Rob Balder will write up a stats sheet and character backstory for your counterpart character in Erfworld. This will resemble the Thinkamancer profiles from Issue 2. Example:\nDavid Hahn will create an illustration of this character, and you will receive his signed, original pencil art. This character sheet will be posted on the main page at Erfworld.com, and when the new site launches it will appear in your user lookup. You will also get a special \u201cCANONIZED\u201d site trophy at the new website, available only to those who have inspired canon elements of the Erfworld universe.\nShort Story\nRob Balder will write a short story about an Erfworld character inspired by you, based on photos and information you share about your life, personality, etc. This story will be at least 5000 words long, and will appear in its entirety at Erfworld.com. You will receive a printed copy of your story, signed by Rob. Also, David Hahn will draw a story illustration featuring this character, and you will receive his signed pencils.\nAn example of such a story, written for Curtis Shaw, a previous Kickstarter donor\nWhen the new website launches, a featured link to your story will appear in your user lookup, and you will get the \u201cCANONIZED\u201d site trophy.\n\n(For legal clarity: the copyright to this story will belong to Rob, but you will have an unlimited lifetime license to print, copy, distribute or publish your story and its accompanying art in any way you like. You will not receive royalties or other compensation from the publication of this story, but you will be credited and thanked.)\nNovella\nSame as \u201cShort Story\u201d above, but the story will be at least 21,000 words long. Here\u2019s an example, written for Doug Molla for his previous Kickstarter donations.\nBOOK 3 - the financial realities\nWhen Jamie Noguchi and I started Erfworld, we were both working on speculation that the comic might grow into something. Neither of us made any money during the first three years until there was a book to sell.\nWhen Xin took over for Jamie, she opted to work for future royalties, rather than being paid by the page. That was helpful for us from a business standpoint, but in her case and Jamie\u2019s both, it was a factor in keeping to a schedule.\nNow we have David, who is a working professional comics illustrator who works on an industry-competitive page rate. That means we\u2019ll be better able to keep Erfworld to a regular update schedule. But it also means that if we want art, we need to have the funds up front to pay for it.\nSo we\u2019re ready to start producing Book 3: Hamsterdance vs. the Charlie Foxtrot right now, but I can\u2019t start writing it, because I don\u2019t know what kind of book it will be. That will depend directly on your support for this project.\nOur little fictional world needs two things to exist: the hard work & creative willpower of Team Erfworld, and the participation & support of Erfworld's readers and fans.\nThere are more stories being told now, more creative dreams being pursued, more authors and artists and filmmakers asking for your contributions than at any time in history. It's up to you to decide what gets made. We think that we're doing something here that's worthwhile, and we'll continue making Erfworld as long as we're able, or until the story says, \"The End.\" We hope you believe in us, and that you'll help us continue.\n\nThank you,\nRob Balder, for Xin and David and Linda and the rest of Team Erfworld", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe made some rookie mistakes in our first big project in 2012. As a lot of Kickstarter creators have found out, it\u2019s too easy to overreach and over-promise.\n\nBy now, we\u2019ve fulfilled all the promised donor rewards for the Year of the Dwagon project (except DVDs, which are pending the eventual video), but most of our stated creative ambitions haven\u2019t yet been met. Our ideas about what it would take to make a motion comic of Book 1 and to build our dream website turned out to be far too optimistic. We also made the huge mistake of not funding the hardcover printing of Book 1. A quarter of the funds raised had to be applied to that, just to fulfill the donor rewards.\n\nWith our second and third projects, we were determined to keep things under control and realistic. We did a much better job with E is for Erfworld and Battle Crest Pins, in terms of meeting our promises to our supporters and ourselves. All rewards for both of those projects have been sent out, and all of our creative/production goals have been met. Both projects are successfully closed.\n\nFor this fourth project, we\u2019re incorporating everything we\u2019ve learned from the previous three. Costs are known, the kinks are worked out of our fulfillment process, and our creative ambitions mostly amount to \u201cplease let us continue making Erfworld for you.\u201d If the support comes in to fund us, then this project should be the smoothest one yet.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Need a 10 minute hero", "update_content": "So I mentioned in previous updates that we wanted to try an EU fulfillment service for our backer rewards as a way to reduce the monstrous postage on these items.

We're still awaiting the list of tracking numbers, so we can't give you that info yet. But your books and statuettes etc, should be arriving within the next week or so.

A website, a magazine and a way of life; not just for geeks or nerds, but the truly strange, phenomenal and retro-loving freaks out there seeking a distraction from adulthood. While the Strange Kids Club website seeks to uncover the more obscure reference points of pop culture on a daily basis, the SK Comics Magazine brings our sense of off-color humor and love of comics to the forefront.\nIn fact, the magazine is genetically engineered to offend, entertain and excite your inner child with some of the most amazing independent illustrators and writers crazy enough to work with us. Past issues have included such famous featured artists as Brent Engstrom (Garbage Pail Kids, Wacky Packages), Emmy-nominated artist David Hartman (Jackie Chan Adventures, Transformers: Prime) and Jason Edmiston (Topps, Hasbro, Alamo Drafthouse). \nIn Issue #4 we've got one of the greatest toy designers and illustrators of the past 30 years, JAMES GROMAN! Most of you may recognize his work on the rude, crude MADBALLS rubber toy line from the mid-80s, but Groman has also worked on brands like Barnyard Commandos, My Pet Monster, Stretch Armstrong, G.I. Joe and more! We go in depth with the artist to discuss his career, some of his favorites projects and how he once ended up stuck in a dinosaur's anus.\nArtwork by James Groman\nThis issue also features the first ever full length Strange Kid comic, written by comic scribe Benito Cereno, in addition to short comics by Z\u00e9 Burnay (Witch Gauntlet), Cartoon Lagoon Studios and Chris Savino (Kick Buttowski, Bigfoot & Gray).\nIn a twisted parody of films like Hellraiser, Toy Story, The Thing and The Gate, Strange Kid and his pals - Lando, an anxious yet highly intelligent boy, and Orwell, a dim-witted and unpredictable purple chupacabra - inadvertently unleash a host of inter-dimensional demons that take over every toy in their clubhouse. Trapped and running out of time, the kids must find a way to survive... which in their case involves loads of crass, juvenile humor, monkey farts, profanity and flamethrowers.\nPoster A - James Groman\nPoster B - Sergio Neri\nThis whole thing wouldn't even happen if not for the time, skill and general levels of radness put forth by these individuals.

Five Separate Hangouts Available!\nNEW GEEKS ADDED:  Mike Selinker and Kid Beyond!\nGEEK A WEEK GLOOM! UNLOCKED!!\nHere's a list of current add-ons, with more coming soon!\nHi! Len Peralta here! For the past four years, I have been drawing geek trading cards.\nThe project is called Geek A Week. It originally started (March 2010) as a personal art project. I challenged myself to see if I could connect with 52 different geeks for 52 weeks, interview them and draw them as trading cards. \nIn the first year,  I ended up meeting and exceeding my goal drawing some of the most notable geeks this side of Yavin including writer Neil Gaiman. Director Guillermo Del Toro. Comic book legend, Stan Lee. I've also created exclusive Geek A Week sets for MythBusters and Discovery Channel that were handed out at San Diego Comic Con. And thanks to you Kickstarterers, I've been able to create and fund three additional mini-sets - including a fan set.\nFor the past year, I've been focused on drawing a full-length graphic novel \"Super-Powered Revenge Christmas\"  (with notable Geek, Bill Corbett of MST3K and Rifftrax) and I've been working on my comic series TenState (with another notable Geek, Tom Merritt). Now I'm back to Geek-a-weekery, with a new goal:\nDo it all over again. That's right. Interview and draw a new group of fifty two geeks.\nI'm calling it Year Five Two.  This will be my fifth season of Geek A Week. And this is the second time I'm going to draw a full year of geeks. Get it? Year. Five. Two. Yowza.\nI modeled the design after the original 1977 Star Wars cards. I was also highly influenced by the look of Wacky Packages from around the same time period.  While I love the design of the original cards, I want to do something new and exciting for this set.  So I am going to redesign the set so that the art and subject takes center stage.  The size of the cards will remain 2.5 x 3.5 (which is good news for all collectors of trading cards - they all remain a standard size).  However, I'm making the entire front of the card the art.  This gives me a bigger canvas to work with and I don't feel like I am boxing the subject into a small area.  \nI am also taking a new approach to the art.  Full color digital paintings of each subject.\nA look at some of my recent digital portrait work.\nCheck out the difference:\nA closer look at the new Geek A Week card fronts!\nThis Pendelton Ward Geek A Week card can be a reality if I fund!\nA painting in progress.\nThe final painted Chloe Dykstra painting!\nA preliminary look at the newly redesigned Geek A Week cardbacks written by Storm DiCostanzo!\nA work in progress card of Kelly Sue DeConnick!\nBecause these new portraits will essentially be little paintings, I'm going to take great care on how these will be printed.  Therefore I am asking more from my printing solution and these cards will look stellar.  They will also come packaged in a newly designed large size tuck box for easy storage.  They may even be shrink-wrapped for future generations.\nThe best of the Old and New.\nSome things ain't broke. Why change them? \n Each Geek A Week card back will be written by \"Storm\" DiCostanzo of the musical comedy duo Paul and Storm.  Storm has written nearly every single Geek A Week card back I've done so far.  Oh my, he is clever. And knowledgable. And good-looking. But mostly clever.\nThere will, as always, be a companion podcast. What makes Geek  A Week unique is that I take the time to connect with the subject, interview them and give them access to the process. Collaboration! Creative synergy! Authenticity! Fun!  So whenever possible, I will include a podcast to go along with the trading card.\nThis project is A LOT of work. While Geek A Week is a labor of  love, love tends to be incredibly time intensive.  \nI have only just begun to start doing interviews and artwork  The majority of the work is not even started yet. You are helping me fund this so the project can be a reality.  If this project funds, I will work through this year to draw all 52 new cards and do all the interviews. My plan is release one new card a week for the next year.  If this project doesn't fund, I don't get to work on it.  <sadface>\nI'm asking for a base goal of $38,000. That money will cover:\nPrinting and design of the set\nWriting and development costs\nCosts for making and fulfilling additional rewards\nEditing of the podcast component of the project\nProject management and admin costs (correspondence, scheduling, quality control)\nShipping, postage and fulfillment costs (boxes, envelopes, etc.)\n10% Kickstarter and Amazon fees\nTaxes\nI have done several different iterations of Geek-a-Week cards. I learned a lot about production costs and printing and delivery.  Hoo boy, did I ever. The biggest lesson is that you'll always need more than you think you do.  I've tried to build a big enough budget into the production costs so that this time, by the end of the year, I will not be scrambling to figure out how I'm going to pay for things.\nThis time, I will be employing a ground team to help me manage the mountain of email and communication that this project generates. And to keep me on track with fulfillment and make sure you get what's coming to you.\nOne thing I discovered about doing the 52 card set the first time is that you need to leave some room to be flexible because you never know what awesomeness will happen along the way. I can say with 99.44% confidence, however, the following geeks will be a part of the Year Five Two set:\nLeading off we have none other than...\nHarry Knowles (the Penultimate HeadGeek and founder of Ain't It Cool News!)\nPendelton Ward (creator of Adventure Time!)\nAmanda Palmer (kick-ass singer/songwriter, formerly of Dresden Dolls)\nMark Millar (creator of Kick Ass, SuperCrooks, Superior & more, writer for Civil War, Ultimates, Swamp Thing etc!)\nThe DoubleClicks (Geek Girl Musicians!)\nJames Urbaniak (comedic actor, voice of Dr. Venture on Venture Brothers)\nPatrick Rothfuss (Writer Extraordinaire!)\nJason Finn (drummer of The Presidents Of The United States of America)\nJanie Haddad (actress, voice of Margaret on Regular Show)\nYuri Lowenthal (Voice Actor for various video games and Ben 10)\nTara Platt (Actress, filmmaker and voice over talent)\nJohn Kovalic (Artist, Dork Tower and Munchkin)\nTeal Sherer (Actress and Creator of My Gimpy Life)\nSean Becker (Director of The Guild, Learning Town and More!)\nScott Johnson (Cartoonist and Host of The Instance)\nBrian Brushwood & Justin Robert Young (Hosts of NSFW)\nKeith Baker (Creator of Gloom)\nRyan Penagos (Marvel social media guru)\nJosh Cagan (Writer and Filmmaker)\nMignon Fogarty (aka Grammar Girl, word nerd extraordinaire!)\nAnne Wheaton (co-founder of VandalEyes, spouse of @wilw)\nJohn Roderick (singer/songwriter of The Long Winters)\nFrank Ippolito (Professional SFX Makeup Wizard, star of SyFy's FaceOff)\nCrabcat - Holly Conrad & Jessica Merizan (cosplayers, youtubers and stars of Syfy's Heroes of Cosplay)\nChloe Dykstra (host of JUST COS on the Nerdist Channel)\nPhil Lamarr (voice actor, Futurama)\nWalter Day (founder of Twin Galaxies and former pro video game scorekeeper)\nKim Evey (web producer, The Guild, Learning Town, Written By A Kid)\nScott Sigler (Bestselling Author and Podcaster)\nBrian Ibbott (Host of the world-renown podcast Coverville)\nKelly Sue DeConnick (comic writer of Captain Marvel and Avengers Assemble)\nSteve Sansweet (founder of Rancho Obi-Wan, the largest collection of Star Wars memorabilia on the planet.)\nDrew Curtis (founder of Fark.com)\nGreg Benson (Famous YouTube prankster and founder of Mediocre Films)\nMax Temkin (creator of Werewolf, Samurai Gunn and Cards Against Humanity)\nBobak Ferdowsi (system engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab)\nHal Lublin (Cast member of Thrilling Adventure Hour)\nAdam Koford (cartoonist and creator of The Laugh Out Loud Cats)\nPatrick Scott Patterson (Video Game Media Personality)\nMikey Neumann (Writer & Chief Creative Champion at Gearbox Software)\nKris Straub (webcomic artist, creator of Broodhollow, Chainsawsuit and Starslip)\nJeff Lewis (actor, The Guild and Jeff Lewis 5-Minute Comedy Hour)\nJason Charles Miller (actor, voice actor, singer/songwriter)\nSarah Lane (tech hostess,TWiT.TV)\nGeeky Hostess -Tara Theoharis (food geek, blogger)\nSumalee Montano (voice actress Transformers/Beware The Batman/Mass Effect 3/Diablo 3)\nClare Grant (actress, member of Team Unicorn)\nBen Blacker and Ben Acker (creators of Thrilling Adventure Hour)\nMike Selinker (Game designer, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game)\nKid Beyond (singer, beat boxer, VO artist, game designer)\nMORE ON THE WAY!\nAnd that's just for starters! I've been e-mailing folks like a madman. So I expect the list will get larger and cooler as I go along. I'm adding new folks on a near daily basis and I have more than half of the set figured out already. That was what was most exciting to me about doing a full year of geeks. In many ways, the geeks in the set influence who else will be in the set. So I never know who exactly I'll end up talking to.\nYou can also choose a reward of ORIGINAL MUSIC written especially for this project by either The DoubleClicks, Molly Lewis or Mike Phirman.  You can choose the $75 reward and choose one or do an Add-On and add all three if you'd like!\nALSO THIS:\nI'm offering this super-cool looking limited edition box created by incredible SFX make-up artist, contestant on SyFy's hit reality show FaceOff and newly minted Geek A Week Frank Ippolito!\nFrank will be creating a limited number of Geekronomicon's (hand sculpted and painted shells to house the Geek A Week Year Five Two card set).  Frank cannot start working on these if 1) no one backs that reward level and 2) if this project doesn't get funded. So it's still a pipe dream at this point.  HOWEVER. check out this sick artist rendering of what The Geekronomicon might look like:\nArtist rendering of The Geekronomicon by Mike Peterson.\n I hope someone backs that level, because I want - NEED-  to see this thing exist.  It's just too frakking cool.\n Speaking of frakking cool, I've added some seriously cool high level rewards ranging from hiring me to draw LIVE at your event, to a full collection of FIFTY-TWO pieces of art for this piece.  But the very high level rewards are the ones I'm most excited about. For a while now, I've wanted to do something that talked to the Cosplay community.  At the two very highest level rewards, you'll get to work with a professional cosplay designer and a professional portrait photographer.  The designer will work with you to create a costume that you'll be able to keep after the Geek A Week photo shoot.  And just to give you an idea of the kind of photo shoot we're talking about here, here are some shots done by the incredible portrait photographer Allan Amato:\nSome of Allan Amato's portrait work\nI've been wanting to work with Allan for a while now, and I feel he is the only  photographer who can match the energy and excitement of my Geek A  Week Portraits.\nHeading up the cosplay and costuming duties will be pro-cosplay designers Samantha and Johnny of Double Monocle Studios.\nCorset for Geek A Weeker Jessica Merizan by Double Monocle\nSam has worked on costume designs for Jinx and Blizzard Entertainment and is hands-down one of the best in the industry.\nHigh-level rewards are just that. But they are so worth it.  Even if no one pledges at that amount, I wanted you all to be exposed to the incredible work of these gracious collaborators.\nBecause this is a pretty huge undertaking, I'm going to need all the help I can get. That's why for the first time I am doing add-ons for pledge levels. How do add-ons work?  Add the amount of each add-on to your base pledge ($25 or more for digital add-ons/ $42 or more for physical shippable add-ons).  At the end of this madness (provided this Kickstarter funds), I will send out an pre-survey email (separate from the Kickstarter survey) that will ask you about what add-ons, if any, you chose.\nHere are a current list of add-ons.\nKeep an eye out for more add-ons as the campaign continues.  I might even add some limited add-ons. We'll see...\nOk, so I've got a long way to go to make my goal. However, if I make my initial goal of $38K, there are several stretch goals I have in mind including bonus geeks and other cool surprises.\nHere's a current list of unlockables below. Hopefully I can see a few of these unlock (fingers crossed):\nThat's right. At $60,000, (formerly $68,000)  I will reprint the elusive Season 1 Geek A Week card set with the Epic Vs. Awesome game component added.  Fewer than 1000 complete sets exist of the Season one set.  So if we can Kickstart this that high, I'll reprint the entire set and turn it into an actual game! <INSERT MANIACAL HOOTING AND HOLLERING HERE> \nThat's it!  I hope you choose to back this project and I look forward to bringing another 52 new Geek A Week cards into the world.\nThanks for looking and thank you for allowing me the chance to work on this project all over again.\nYour friend in Nerdliness:\nLen Peralta\nGeek A Week, Creator", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my sixth Kickstarter project, so I am a battle-hardened veteran.

So please jump in now if you haven't yet, because it would break our hearts to see you live with that kind of regret.\nTHUMBNAIL SUMMARY OF UNLOCKED GOALS\nBALL PIT album of original songs, plus album art\nEXTRA BALLS album of cover song collaborations\n2 music videos for 2 of our brand-new songs\nRPG Soundboard App\nThe KS-exclusive and star-studded PaulandStormonomicon story and art anthology\nAnimated holiday special to be created in collaboration with Mike and Matt Chapman (The Brothers Chaps of homestarruner.com)\n(Holy crap!)\nWHO THE HECK ARE WE?\nWe are Paul and Storm, a comedy-music duo who've been writing and performing music together (and prior to that, as half of a cappella group Da Vinci's Notebook) for nearly 20 years. We perform across the US and internationally, and at numerous cons (such as PAX, PAX East, DragonCon and Emerald City ComicCon). We're co-founders of w00tstock (along with Wil Wheaton and Adam Savage), and we co-produce the annual Jonathan Coulton fan cruise JoCo Cruise Crazy. \nYou also might have seen our George R.R. Martin-themed music video, \"Write Like the Wind\":\nWe've independently recorded and released four albums as Paul and Storm; and in early 2013, we co-created, starred in, and wrote the songs for the musical webseries LearningTown for the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel.\nWHAT THE HECK ARE WE DOING?\nWe're nearly finished recording our fifth full-length album, Ball Pit; but rather than just finish it off and release it the way we usually do, we wanted to do...something more. With your help, we can make a spectacle of the release, and surround it with other, related cool projects to help make a real splash and hopefully garner some extra attention to the new release. Cool projects like professionally-produced music videos. Like a bonus EP with cover songs and collaborations. Like an RPG soundboard app. Maybe even an animated holiday special, a live concert video, or a video project of us going on tour in an ice-cream-and-guacamole truck. YES, AN ICE CREAM TRUCK. WITH GUACAMOLE.\nWe'd love to just go ahead and make all of these projects happen on our own; we've been thinking about several of them for quite some time. But the truth is that we're independent musicians with limited resources. With your support and funding, however, we can make every one of them a reality, which excites us beyond measure.\nTL;DR The more we raise, the more shenanigans and monkeyshines we'll be able to bring you as part of the Ball Pit rollout. Thusly...\nSee? But we're not just here to show you sophisticated graphs. Here are the specifics:\nBall Pit is mostly recorded, but the big cash costs occur when it's time to assemble it into a CD. So there's that. But more importantly, we want to make a whole bunch of Ball Pit-related stuff. So at our main goal, here's where the money will be going:\n1. Finishing Off Ball Pit\nFinal mixing, mastering, packaging, and physical production of Ball Pit. This includes funds paid to guest musicians, producers, and visual artists who help make the project sound and look great. Also, a modest amount for our own time and effort.\n2. Music Video for \"This Song\"\nWe want to make a kick-buttocks music video for \"This Song\", our most viral-worthy tune since \"Write Like the Wind (George R.R. Martin)\". Here's a sneak audio-peek of a couple excerpts from the song demo:\n(Bear in mind the final version will be EVEN MORE EPIC)\n\"This Song\" needs a video, but it needs one done right. As in, not recorded and edited on our smartphones. Even on a \"shoestring\" budget, a GOOD music video with a professional crew can cost quite a lot. (As in, low five-figures) We want to bring in people to help make it Not Suck At All\u2014specifically, director Sean Becker and producer Kim Evey (who both worked on LearningTown and The Guild)\u2014to lead a crew to make a music video worthy of your efforts to fund it.\n 3. Extra Balls Cover Songs EP\nOur main goal will fund a 5-song EP called Extra Balls, featuring cover songs recorded with a few of our musician friends (Jonathan Coulton, The Doubleclicks, Parry Gripp, Mike Phirman, and Sara Watkins), to be made available as a digital download.\n4. Ten New RPG Songlets\nA little while ago, we recorded a number of short songs (\"songlets,\" if you will) designed to be used while playing RPGs. They were very well received, and a couple of them will be included on Ball Pit. We want to make more of them; so when we reach our main goal, we'll record and (separately) release 10 more. Additional funding will mean writing and releasing additional RPG songlets, and potentially an RPG soundboard app if things go really well. (More on that later...)\n5. Kickstarter and Amazon Payments Fees\nThese account for 7-10% of every dollar we collect. Gotta pay The Man!\nAbout the new Ball Pit album\nIn addition to popular songs that haven't appeared on any album (like \"Write Like the Wind (George R. R. Martin)\" and \"Thanksgiving\") and a couple of the original RPG songlets, we have a bunch of brand new original songs that aren't yet available anywhere. And as a backer, you'll get these new songs FIRST, before the rest of the world has access.\nBONUS: The amazing and talented Randall Munroe (xkcd.com) has done the cover art. (!!!)\nDepending on your preference and reward level, you can receive Ball Pit as a physical CD, a download with pdf files of the album art and credits, or on a limited-edition USB flash drive. \nSo that's pretty great right there. But we want to go BIGGER and DO MORE STUFF. So if we exceed our goal, here's a look at what we're gonna do:\nHere comes the science...\nUPDATE 12/10/13: $80k reached! The book is officially happening!\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will be an anthology of very short stories and illustrations based on and/or inspired by Paul and Storm and their songs.\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will include contributions from the following authors:\nJames S. A. Corey (The Expanse series)\nGreg \"Storm\" DiCostanzo\nLev Grossman (The Magicians; The Magician King)\nMary Robinette Kowal (Shades of Milk and Honey; Without a Summer)\nSeanan McGuire (Blackout; Rosemary and Rue)\nMikey Neumann (Vena Cava; The Ending: An Apocalypse Part 1)\nPatrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind; The Wise Man's Fear)\nJohn Scalzi (Old Man's War series; Redshirts)\nScott Sigler (Infection Trilogy; Nocturnal)\n...and will include illustrations by:\nBill Amend (FoxTrot)\nJoel Hodgson (MST3k; Cinematic Titanic)\nScott Johnson (My Extra Life)\nMary Robinette Kowal (yup; an illustration too!)\nLen Peralta (Geek A Week)\nKatie Rice (Camp Weedonwatcha; Penny Arcade's Strip Search)\nKris Straub (Chainsawsuit, Broodhollow)\nZach Weiner (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal)\nAnnie Wu (Venture Bros.; Batgirl)\nWil Wheaton\nand Neil Gaiman\nAnd the cover will be designed by Emily and Matt Fitzpatrick, the cross-stitching wizards behind Steotch.\nWe're hoping to add a few more names to the above lists before we're through. Watch this space...\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will become available in both paperback and ebook form (specific formats TBD; but we promise to try to make it available for all major ebook readers); it'll be available as an add-on ($10 digital version; $15 US /$18 INTL paperback; $20 US / $23 INTL P&S-signed paperback), and/or included in some higher Reward levels.\nThis collection of brand new works from all these great creators will ONLY be available to our Kickstarter backers\u2014once the campaign\u2019s done, this book will disappear back into the \u00c6ther. So act now!\nUPDATED 12/13/13: The Animated Holiday Special, co-created by, co-starring and animated by Homestarrunner.com's Mike and Matt Chapman, and co-written by us, the Brothers Chaps, and LearningTown head writer Josh Cagan, has been FUNDED!\nOur Kickstarter backers will be able to see and hear it before anyone else.\nYes! For years fans have asked us \"When are you going to do a song with [Person X]\", or suggested that \"You should totally do a cover of [Song Y]\". And you know what? We love Person X and Song Y, but it's never seemed quite right to do those things on our \"normal\" comedy albums. And even if we did, the logistics of coordinating such collaborations can be intimidating.\nWell, darnit, the time has come to stop dawdling and start making it happen. And so, with crowdfunding's help, Extra Balls will be born.\nUPDATE 12/02/13: New collaborators announced: MC Frontalot, Hank Green and John Scalzi! Current full list of Extra Balls collaborators:\nJim Boggia\nMarian Call\nChris Collingwood\nJonathan Coulton\nThe Doubleclicks\nMC Frontalot\nHank Green\nParry Gripp\nMolly Lewis\nMike Phirman\nJohn Roderick\nJohn Scalzi\nSara Watkins\nadditional collaborators TBA\nThe Extra Balls CD is now also available as an Add-On item to existing pledges, and comes free with the ALL-IN BUNDLE (and all higher rewards which receive the ALL-IN BUNDLE items).\nAs described above, we've previously recorded a few short \"songlets\" designed to be used while playing RPGs. Songs such as \"Critical Hit\" (Warning: NSFW!):\n ...and \"Don't Blow the Daily\" (NSFW)...\nThese have been very well-received, so we want to make more of them. We'll make 10 more upon reaching our main goal, and then more at the $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000 and $55,000 levels.\nAnd if we reach $65,000, we'll compile all these songlets into a smartphone app you can use in your own gaming sessions, or to just play on a whim wherever you go. (Like the library. Or jury duty. Or a funeral.)\nIt's something we've wanted to make for years, but we got sticker shock when we first saw what quality app development costs. But your funding will enable us to bring in professional developers and artists (who we already have lined up) to make this app as cool, efficient, beautiful and awesome as possible. If funded, the RPG app will be made available as an add-on reward to our Kickstarter campaign.\nBeyond the $65,000 threshold, the more funding we receive, the more songlets, taunts, sound effects, and features we'll add to the app. \nActual app will look way more awesome.\nUPDATE: UNLOCKED! App will have at least 75 sounds, and will be available for iOS and Android.\nThe reality these days is that if your song doesn't have a great video, it's just not gonna go very far. And we know lots of experienced, talented people who do exactly that sort of thing\u2014and with your help we'll be able to pay them to help us put together some more high-quality righteous videos. If funding is crazy-go-nuts, we might even produce videos for some of our pre-Ball Pit fan favorites.\nUPDATE 11/19/13: Thanks to your generosity, we have secured funding for a second music video. Watch the Updates for forthcoming information about that second song and video. \nAs noted above, our cover art for Ball Pit will be done by xkcd's Randall Munroe. But we know quite a few great artists; so we thought, why limit ourselves to just one cover?\nSo a number of stretch goals will unlock alternate Ball Pit cover art created by some of our talented friends:\n$35,000 - Adam Koford (HOBOTOPIA)\n$40,000 - John Kovalic (Dork Tower)\n$55,000 - Ethan Nicolle (AXE COP)\nUPDATE 11/19/13: All three Alternate Cover Art stretch goals have been unlocked! Poster versions of all cover art options are now available as Add-Ons (see chart below for full pricing information). All Ball Pit posters are now included for free in the ALL-IN BUNDLE reward and above (all rewards of $130 and up).\nYES! P&S go on tour in an ice cream truck, document it on video, and make something awesome with it!\nUPDATED 12/09/13: Stretch goal revised to $265,000! Also, Mediocrefilms' Greg Benson will be along both on-camera and behind the scenes to help document the trip and edit it into episodes. \nWhen it comes right down to it, we're not really in the music business. Our true value to society is in doing idiotic things that make other people laugh, smile, or generally feel good, and it just happens that music is our primary means of accomplishing that end.\nSo we have a dream for a Ball Pit tour that combines three of our loves: music, live performance, and FOOD. And if we reach the ludicrous stretch goal of $265,000, we will procure an ice cream truck, take it out on tour, give away ice cream and guacamole, do various good and/or ridiculous deeds (tbd), and document the whole adventure with a professional film crew.\nDo we expect to reach this goal? No. But if you don't dream big, chances are you won't go on tour in an ice cream (and guacamole) truck.\nFull reward details are of course in the right-hand sidebar; but below is a basic summary chart of the items contained in the different rewards, so you know exactly what stuff is included in each package (not counting the reward-specific \"special\" stuff, like the doodles, song review and such):\n*For the CRAPPY ANIMATION and BAND FOR HIRE rewards, subject matter must be non-commercial, and may not contain pornography, excessive profanity, hate speech, illegal or creepy stuff. P&S retain final subject matter approval, but will work with you to make sure we're all happy with the final product. P&S will retain all publishing rights, but you'll be free to use it in any non-commercial setting that you like.\nADD-ONS\nBelow is the list of currently-available add-ons for all reward levels (excluding HEARTY THANKS and HEARTIER THANKS). Please note that some rewards may already include one or more of these items:\nMore add-ons may be opened up at additional funding levels, so watch this space as the campaign progresses!\nTo add any of these items to your existing pledge, click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, increase your pledge by the amount(s) listed above (for example, to add both the T-shirt and USB Drive, add $110 for US orders, $123 for international orders), select \"Continue to Next Step\" and confirm your new pledge. Once the campaign is over, we'll contact you to find out which item(s) your additional pledge was for.\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\nThe question often gets asked of Kickstarters (especially successful ones): \"Where exactly does the money all go?\" When this is over, will we be diving into piles of cash, all Scrooge McDuck-like?\nAnd so we present the chart below, which is a breakdown of where the funds we've collected up to the $65k stretch goal level will go, based on our current best possible budget estimates. (The amount actually going directly to us is the highlighted, sexy gray section.)\nWhile the percentages will vary somewhat if/when we collect more funds, we expect them to stay reasonably close to what's in this graph.\nWE LOVE TALKING ABOUT OUR KICKSTARTER\nBelow is a list of podcasts and interviews with us discussing Ball Pit and the Kickstarter campaign.

So we feel pretty confident that we'll deliver on everything in our Kickstarter, including (especially?) the crazier elements. In the unlikely event that we actually raise $350,000, do we know exactly where we'd get an ice cream truck? No. But we have a good track record for figuring out those sorts of things.\n\nThat said, we're just two people made of flesh and blood, and are subject to the same cataclysms as other carbon-based lifeforms, as are our collaborators. It's also possible that unforeseen obstacles may hinder delivery of some of the project elements. We can't imagine what, but such is the nature of the unforeseen.\n\nBut at the heart of it all, we hope that this entire process will bring you great joy, and that the resultant output of content will bring us wider renown, thereby increasing your satisfaction in supporting us before Everybody Else got in on the act.

Have you ever wondered what kickstarting a board game is REALLY like? Boom or Doom is the documentary that follows the zany adventure of Sean and Alan (that's us) as they attempt to use Kickstarter to \"kickstart\" their upcoming party game Two Rooms and a Boom. This film will transparently reveal our experience with the Kickstarter process, all the way from game design to fulfilling orders at retail stores. Watch us ask professionals for advice, negotiate with manufacturers, hire artists, and wrestle with shipping. \nFilming Boom or Doom has already begun.  We are interviewing experts in the industry, conversing with previous Kickstarters, and are working towards a 90 minute documentary that focuses on all the necessary steps on getting a tabletop game published.  This film will be released in 2014, and will be broadcast online for free. \nHONESTY TIME.  Sean and Alan just started a tabletop game company called Tuesday Knight Games. But by trade, Alan is a college professor and Sean is a professional video editor and graphic designer. At heart, we're both geeky dudes that occasionally swear. We are filming our efforts to kickstart our gaming dreams. We're totally not afraid of hard work and we're doing our research. We want to learn exactly what it takes to have a successful Kickstarter campaign, and we want to share our experience with the world, for free!  \nWe have worked on several creative projects, both professional and for fun.  Check out some of our previous work (Alan usually does the acting, Sean usually does the editing):\n-Agents of SMERSH: Swagman's Hope kickstarter video!\n-Mage Wars tutorial videos\n-Teach My Wife Fox and Chicken\n-Teach My Wife Zombie House Blitz\n-Alan actually proposed to his wife using their favorite game Ascension\n-Alan's inappropriate webcomics (NSFW!)\nASK YOURSELF...\n-Are you thinking of using Kickstarter?\n-Are you an aspiring (or established) game designer?\n-Do you like game conventions?\n-Are you a geek in any shape, way, or form?\n-Do you like documentaries?\n-Do you ever root for the underdogs?\n-Do you like action, drama, and comedy?\n-Do you breathe?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of the above questions, please consider pledging and help us make this documentary come true.  Follow Sean and Alan  through our efforts to use Kickstarter.  Tell your friends that you helped Kickstart a film about using Kickstarter on Kickstarter. Be a part of awesome. \nMONEY TALK TIME. \nMost of the money will go towards helping us with production costs (graphics, editing software, etc.).  Currently, we are only filming on an iPhone and an out of production Flip video camera (without motion stabilization).  Your pledge will help us upgrade our equipment and purchase a hard drive to safely store all of our footage. Our project also involves costly printing, which includes the full color advertisements for our PRODUCT PLACEMENT pledge level. PROTIP: 10% of all funds raised on all Kickstarter campaigns go to Kickstarter and Amazon (that's how they do this magic). \nWe have a modest initial target of $2,200. From that point, extra money will lead to \"Stretch Goals.\"  In Kickstarter lingo, that's the extra money raised above the target $2,200 that funds the overall project.  Any extra cash we earn will also go towards spicing up the quality of the documentary by purchasing better editing software, gear, and even hiring professional artist to truly beautify our film.  We are especially excited because we met our Jay Tholen STRETCH GOAL!!!! Jay is a talented dude that is going to orchestrate some great music for our film, truly turning our documentary into a work of art!  However, Jay is also an amazing animator, and we have a stretch goal to hire him to do some great cut-scenes for the film.

Embla will be expanded, telling you more about its trade, its influence on the region, and the battling dwarves who are attempting to save their town.\nYul\u2019s lair, already mysterious, will have great depth, greater challenge, and be an environment that the PCs will truly learn to fear.

These tiles allow you, as GM, to plan and position interesting and exciting random events for your PCs; their geomorph nature grants many different possibilities, giving many hours of action and excitement for the PCs. \nThese underworld encounter maps will be created by 3x ENnie award winning cartographer Todd Gamble (WotC, Green Ronin, Privateer Press) and include maps from:\nUnderworld Caverns (numerous & varied)\nDwarven City of Embla\nDrow City of Holoth\n\nhttp://www.gamingpaper.com/\nNote that all backers at the $45 pledge level and above will get a free Underworld Encounter Maps PDF Pack, but if you wish for a print copy, you may simply add $10 to your pledge total.\nUNLOCKED $31,500: Underworld Encounter Deck\nEven in times of war, life goes on for those that live in the Underworld. As the PCs travel from the surface to Embla, from Embla to the outskirts of Holoth, and then even into the city itself, they will encounter the citizens of this subterranean realm as they go about their business, whether that is a problem with a previously unseen ooze, a deep gnome hermit in the middle of a 100 year retreat or a government-sanctioned assassin returning, injured, from a kill, with an angry mob on her tail.\nThis deck of cards is made up of over 120 encounters that can be dropped into Embla, Holoth or any of the caverns and tunnels that run from the surface to the drow city. Prepare for the unexpected, for your players are quite likely to encounter it!\nNote that all backers at the $45 pledge level and above will get a Underworld Encounter Card Deck PDF, but if you wish for a physical copy of the Underworld Encounter Card Deck, you may simply add $10 to your pledge total.\nUNLOCKED $32,500: Full Faction Integration\nGet your NPC into the hardbound book with a lucky few seeing their NPCs written into the main story alongside the PCs!\nThe concept for Faction Designation is for each pledger to come up with a human, a dwarf, or drow they would like to see appear as an NPC in the appropriate section of the trilogy.\nThe factions include:\n\nHumans from Rybalka, and elsewhere, which include troops sent to help the PCs, slaves held in Holoth or even agents of Yul and his undead cult.\n\nDrow within Holoth, but maybe who are spies elsewhere. They could be members of House Gullion, House Invidious, or perhaps just renegades.\n\nDwarves within Embla, or perhaps returning traders, or even allies from Stoneholme who have decided to help Embla despite Stoneholme's lockdown!\n\nAll that is needed is a name, a class or activity (Profession/Craft), and a two line description. The NPC will then appear as someone the party can meet and interact with. We are intending to use them as clear encounters for the PCs, so we'll be including chances for Diplomacy, Intimidation, a question or two, or perhaps a purchase from your character.\n\nIn addition, if this stretch goal is reached, we will be producing a special supplement with more than 100 detailed \"random encounters\" suitable for all the main settings. We will be looking to add the best of the NPCs sent to us as the focus of these encounters.\n\nFinally, Stephen Yeardley will be taking the five most interesting NPCs, as decided by the Adventure-a-Week team, and write them up as an alternative party for the GM to use from the very outset of the adventure. Players will encounter this party early in the prequel, and there will be encounters with them throughout the entire Rise of the Drow trilogy. They will grow in stature, and feature as allies or enemies, as the PCs decide. If chosen, Stephen will be in touch with you to get your thoughts on how you would like to see your NPC grow into an important part of the Rise of the Drow!\nTaking the PCs from levels 18-20, this epilogue closes the curtain on the Rise of the Drow trilogy once and for all.\nUNLOCKED 35,500: Epilogue\nA PDF version of the Rise of the Drow Epilogue \"The Commander of Shadows\" will become available as an add-on. This adventure by Jonathan G. Nelson & Stephen Yeardley contains an exciting alternative ending to the trilogy which takes the PCs from levels 18 to 20 with epic encounters that will blow your mind and close the curtain on the Rise of the Drow trilogy once and for all.\nNote that all backers at the $45 pledge level and above will get a PDF copy.\nEpilogue Teaser:  \"As the darkness flickered around the long-dormant body, the soul of the Matron Mother fled Holoth and rushed headlong to the waiting clone. Alone in its deep-buried chamber, resting on a permanently chilled bier, the rush of spirit into it caused it to react as if electricity had passed through it, and the gasp that escaped its lips would've frozen the bones of the most hard-bitten of adventurers.\nMoments later, the dead body of the old Matron Mother arrived next to the now-activated clone of Maelora. The woman looked down at the broken body, still clad in its martial finery ,gave a wry smile, and said to herself \",My vanity blinded me, clouded my judgement, but it won't happen again.\" She striped the body, her former self, and quickly dressed in the equipment. Now the clone still feels weak, but her new strength is rapidly flowing through it, and soon she will be ready. \nNow Maelora glances around the chamber, a 10 feet-per-side cube, and spots what she is looking for. Touching five of the six sides of the chamber, other similar cells appear, each with a body on a sarcophagus - loyal troops, from decades ago, waiting for such a moment as this. Then the Matron Mother touches the final wall, directly in front of her, and door appears. Beyond is a chamber, colossal in size. Within rests the body of a spider, a fully developed, fiendish, monstrous creature that was gifted to Maelora for when revenge was required. The body looks tired, damaged, but Maelora knows it is from beyond the gates of the Abyss, and will fulfill its obligations. \nMaelora reaches for a amulet that is pinned to the doorframe. It burns with venomous cold fire, as gifts from her goddess always do. The Matron Mother steps forward, loudly chanting the liturgy that will activate the amulet. As the words reverberate around the massive hall with all the power they contain, the acid-green gem at the center of the amulet gets brighter, blindingly so; but Maelora continues. As the final phrase passes her lips, she thrusts the goddess's token deep into the spider's body, the passion flowing from her every pore. Then, imperceptibly at first, the corpse stirs; a twitch, a flex of a leg, and then the zombie spider rises. Maelora laughs, uncontrollably, and turns away, her arms raised; \"No, it won't happen again. No more mistakes!\" From back in the cell where her broken previous body lies, the sound of bones and flesh rending can be heard. \"To me!\" Maelora snaps the command, and the feeding stops. From the room steps one, two, three, four, five drow-shaped nightwalkers. \"My real children, let us take back what is truly ours.\"\nUNLOCKED $37,500: Epilogue in Print\nA print version of the Rise of the Drow Epilogue \"The Commander of Shadows\" will become available as an add-on.\nNote that all backers at the $45 pledge level and above will get a PDF copy, but if you wish for a print copy, you may simply add $15 to your pledge total.\nUNLOCKED $40,000: Free 3 month subscription to Adventureaweek.com!\nExisting AaW subscribers will have these bonus months added to their current subscription.\nEligible to all pledge levels $45 and above!\nNOTE: After the Kickstarter ends you will receive a survey.
