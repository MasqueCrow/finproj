[{"backer": "Mattia Forza", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "To our Canadian and other ROW fans: we're so sorry about the insane postal rates. The United States Postal Service is under attack. Unfortunately, that and the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the absurd rates you see reflected in the campaign. \nTo our fans based in the USA: thousands of small businesses like ours depend on the Post Service everyday to stay in business.\nPlease consider signing this petition to save the United States Postal Service. \nSkies of Fire is a limited comic series by Vincenzo Ferriero and Ray Chou, with art by Pablo Peppino and Bryan Valenza. Skies was launched in 2014 and has remained 100% independent through crowdfunding and the support of our fans. For the first time ever we're publishing two issues in one year!\nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to print the seventh issue of Skies of Fire. Any additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of future editions of the series.\nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.\nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince. His actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.\nIn Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.\nIssue Three follows the pair as they recruit members for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead.\nIn Issue Four, the crew of the Zephyr comes together despite their differences.\nIssue Five follows the Zephyr as they embark into the Expanse.\nIssue Six finds the Zephyr in enemy territory deep in the heart of the storm. \nIn Issue Seven, the Zephyr attempts to complete the mission.\nThe creative minds behind Skies of Fire and Mythopoeia, Vincenzo Ferriero  and Ray Chou have been collaborating on creative projects since 2008 despite living 5,437 miles apart.\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art.\nBryan Valenza is a prolific artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects from top publishers in the industry. \n---------------------------------\nBorn in Barcelona, Cristian Docolomansky Cerda (C.D.C.) is an inker and letterer based in Chile. He's worked with several publishers such as Alterna Comics, IDW, and Ariete Producciones. You can find him here.\nGregory Shipp and I am a freelance fantasy and historical cartographer based in the UK. He is the cartographer of issue #7's codex document. \nThe majority of funds from this Kickstarter will go into covering the cost of printing issue #7 and fulfilling orders from this Kickstarter. Any remaining money will be put back into further production of Skies of Fire.\nSkies of Fire Book I is a 8x11\" clothbound hardcover with 120 pages including sequentials, codex documents, and variant covers.. The book features a new wraparound cover by Pablo de Bonis featuring the city of Monterey.\nLike our previous single issues, Skies of Fire #7  will be an 8x11 saddle-stitched floppy comic with 38 pages of interiors.\nThe Variant for Issue #7 features an original front and back cover oil painting of the First Battle of Ryder's Peak by award winning aviation artist Keith Burns. The preview image does not do the illustration one bit of justice! \nEach physical copy of Skies of Fire #7 will also include an 8x11 print of the artwork packed in.\nWe're debuting a new set of Desertlands Postcards from Dimitris Martinos! \nEach physical copy of Skies #7 will come with a random postcard similar in style to his previous set, the Lowlands War:\nWe Own The Sky Badge\nAdd-Ons can be purchased during the time of our post campaign surveys via our fulfillment partners at BackerKit. If you'd like to purchase your add-ons during the campaign, please add the following to your pledge amount (S&H included):\nDigital Posters - $15\nDigital Art Prints - $20\nIndividual Issues - $15\nVariant #7 - $25\nPapercraft Model - $20\nSet of Postcards - $10\nArchival Art Print - $25\nPoster - $30\nBadge - $10", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 13th campaign and third of the year. We have a fairly well tread pipeline from production to publication at this point. The only risk is in delays - the book is completely finished, but we still need to print and ship them out. \n\nLast time around COVID19 slowed us down by an extra month. This time we'll try to close out the campaign once again within two months, which we've so far have managed in around three of our campaigns. The other ones have taken a little bit longer, but in general our arc is towards faster fulfillment and delivery rather than slower. \n\nThe United States Postal Service is under threat by the current administration. We have witnessed firsthand massive delays and rapidly fluctuating shipping rates in the last three months as a result. All signs point to this instability in this vital service increasing as we get closer to the elections in Fall. Thousands of small businesses like ours that depend on USPS for service are at risk. Please consider signing the petition to save our Postal Service linked at the beginning of the campaign and make sure to vote this upcoming November. \n\nAs always, we have a 100% satisfaction guaranteed policy with our backers. Please never hesitate to contact us with questions, comments, and critique. We take everything in mind and are always looking to improve.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "SKIES OF FIRE #7 (DIGITAL)", "descp": "A PDF copy of Skies of Fire #7 for returning fans who want to continue supporting the production of the comic.\nINCLUDES:\nSkies of Fire #7 (Digital)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "SKIES OF FIRE #7", "descp": "A physical copy of Skies of Fire #7.

Designed by Hamm Liu\nGlow is an ongoing comic series by Ray Chou and Vincenzo Ferriero with art by Anny Maulina and Dia Jia.\nGlow takes place in a world where magic catalyzed both industrial revolution and nuclear holocaust. Half a millennia ago, an ancient and powerful empire known as Nymera developed a means to channel and store magical energy into a sticky blue substance known as anima, storing them into massive Towers across the world.\nWith the aid of the Towers, the Nymerans brought peace and paradise into the world. Until one day the Towers fell.\nThe story of Glow takes place two hundred years after that cataclysmic event, and follows the story of those who remain.\nIssue One introduced us to Caszy and Koken, siblings scavengers of the Wastes with extraordinary abilities.\nIssue Two continues the story as the witch Myra makes a compelling proposition.\n\nIssue Three explores the aftermath of a misunderstanding.\nIn Issue Four, the town of Shoddai is given an ultimatum. \nMagic in Glow is channeled through the language of ancient Nymera, the former masters of the world. In order to flesh out this cornerstone of the story, we've been collaborating with Niamh Doyle, an Estonian linguist and enthusiastic conlanger.\nNymeran is used a number of ways in the comic, including sound effects.\nEach digital edition of Glow comes with a language guide that unlocks the secrets of ancient Nymeran.\n\n\nRay Chou and Vincenzo Ferriero are the writers and creators of Glow.

My name is Tom Lintern and this campaign is for my graphic novel series Girrion. This campaign is specifically for funding the creation of Issue #13  which is in the first half of Volume 2 of the overall story. (~pages 299 - 323 .)\nNew to the story? Not to worry! Any Issue from 1 - 13 will be available in this campaign.\nThanks to the amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues #2 - 12 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\nIssue 1 Cover Art\nIssue 13 Cover Art in progress\n\n GIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldly magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\nGirrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially, it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships, and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another, etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, but it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nA lot of influences on my work come from 80/90's films/animations/comics. I remember really feeling transported to these fascinating worlds. Films like Star Wars and Macross really created exciting unique places that felt real. In this age of digital effects, I feel like some of this time that went into creative development is going into special effects. Something has been lost and many sci-fi stories feel hollow, at least for me. Girrion is a lot about just trying to make a new world that feels real.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\nVolume 1 Hardcover\nIf you would like to get a closer look at the different book formats available I have a youtube video here.\n How Do Add-Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add-On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n EXPENSES\nGenerally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n\nYou can also follow the project at:\ntwitter.com/TomLintern1", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience, the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected. Also, keep in mind I have to mix this work in with the day job\u2013 sometimes more than others. I work freelance so it changes depending on the projects that come up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Any single Issue (PDF Format)", "descp": "Start from the beginning or anywhere in the middle.

Skies was launched in 2014 and has remained 100% independent through crowdfunding and the support of our fans. For the first time ever we're publishing two issues in one year! \nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to print the sixth issue of Skies of Fire. Any additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of future editions of the series.\nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.\nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince. His actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.\nIn Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.\nIssue Three follows the pair as they recruit members for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead.\nIn Issue Four, the crew of the Zephyr comes together despite their differences.\nIssue Five follows the Zephyr as they embark into the Expanse.\nWhile Issue Six takes place in the heart of the storm....\nThe creative minds behind Skies of Fire and Mythopoeia, Vincenzo Ferriero  and Ray Chou have been collaborating on creative projects since 2008 despite living 5,437 miles apart. \nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art.\nBryan Valenza is a prolific artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects from top publishers in the industry.\n\n Alexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army.\nCatalin Lartist was born in the plains of Wallachia, a descendant of Vlad the Impaler, and learned the art of pencil and ink from an old master and book keeper.In his years of apprenticeship in the Chronicles Keep he learned the wisdom of the dead and brought back the old mastery of hypnotic drawing.He uses his knowledge to steal people's souls and seal them on paper.\nThe majority of funds from this Kickstarter will go into covering the cost of printing issue #6 and fulfilling orders from this Kickstarter. Any remaining money will be put back into further production of Skies of Fire.\nSkies of Fire Book I is 8x11\" clothbound hardcover with 120 pages including sequentials, codex documents, and variant covers.. The book features a new wraparound cover by Pablo de Bonis featuring the city of Monterey.\nLike our previous single issues, Skies of Fire #6  will be an 8x11 saddle-stitched floppy comic with 38 pages of interiors.\n This issue's variant will be a homage to Herge's Tin-Tin featuring Alex and Baron!\nStay tune as we announce our Variant artist mid campaign! \n\nWe Own the Sky Badge\n Add-Ons can be purchased during the time of our post campaign surveys via our fulfillment partners at BackerKit. If you'd like to purchase your add-ons during the campaign, please add the following to your pledge amount (S&H included):\nDigital Posters - $15\nDigital Art Prints - $20\nIndividual Issues - $15\nVariant #6 - $20\nPapercraft Model - $20\nSet of Postcards - $10\nArchival Art Print - $25\nPoster - $30\nBadge - $15\nWe're happy to announce that should we reach our ultimate stretch goal of $30,000, we'll commission a new set of five postcards from fan favorite Dimitris Martinos! \nSkies of Fire #4 Variant by Dimitris Martinos.\nDimitris worked on the variant cover for issue #4 as well as the Tales of the Lowlands Postcard set. If we hit the goal, we'll include a random postcard in each physical package. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 10th Kickstarter campaign. The biggest risk is in timely fulfillment. We will do our best to fulfill all orders within two months of the campaign's close. Otherwise, the production of the book is finished and it's ready to go.

Half a millennia ago, an ancient and powerful empire known as Nymera developed a means to channel and store magical energy into a sticky blue substance known as anima, storing them into massive Towers across the world.\n With the aid of the Towers, the Nymerans brought peace and paradise into the world. Until one day the Towers fell.\nThe story of Glow takes place two hundred years after that cataclysmic event, and follows the story of those who remain.\nIssue One introduced us to Caszy and Koken, siblings scavengers of the Wastes with extraordinary abilities.\nIssue Two continues the story as the witch Myra makes a compelling proposition.\nWhile Issue Three explores the ramifications of the misunderstanding between Caszy and Myra. \nMagic in Glow is channeled through the language of ancient Nymera, the former masters of the world. In order to flesh out this cornerstone of the story, we've been collaborating with Colm Doyle, an Estonian linguist and enthusiastic conlanger.\nNymeran is used a number of ways in the comic, including sound effects. \nEach digital edition of Glow comes with a language guide that teaches you the secrets of ancient Nymeran. \nRay Chou and Vincenzo Ferriero are the writers and creators of Glow. Together, they\u2019re the founders of the creative imprint known as Mythopoeia. Glow is their second comic book series after the the dieselpunk airship adventure Skies of Fire. Ray is based in Los Angeles and Vince in London.\nAnny Maulina is an artist from Indonesia and creator of the webcomic Raruurien. She also enjoys working on comic and art projects on her spare time. You can find her on Patreon and DeviantArt. \nDia Jamandron was born in Iloilio City, Philippines and moved to California with her family. She currently works for Wild Canary Animation . Check her out on instagram!\n\nBryan Valenza is an artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects, including Skies of Fire and Witchblade. @bryan_valenza\nBorn in Barcelona, Cristian Docolomansky Cerda (C.D.C.) is an inker and letterer based in Chile. He's worked with several publishers such as Alterna Comics, IDW, and Ariete Producciones. You can find him here.\n\n\nFrom Ireland, Colm \u00d3 D\u00faill is a verification specialist at TransferWise's office in Tallinn, Estonia, where he has lived since 2007. He holds an M.Phil. in Applied Linguistics and a B.Comm with French, and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Linguistics. He is married with two children, and has been dabbling in creating constructed languages since 2005; Nymeran is his first developed constructed language.\nHammond Liang is a self taught illustrator who often goes by the name of \"Hammling.\" Growing up in a tiny apartment in Chinatown NY, he always had a fascination in all things art. From martial arts to dance to illustration, he combines all of his experiences to bring motion and life to his artwork. You can find him on Art Station and Instagram. \n\nGiulia Frontoni is an Italian illustrator based in Rome with a focus on creature designs. She helped bring to life many of the beasts found in Glow, as well as the postcards and button pinups! crocodev\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army. He helped bring together many of the technological designs found in Glow. http://wingsofwrath.deviantart.com/\nThe budget for this Kickstarter is extremely straightforward, with most of the funds going into printing our physical issues and reward fulfillment. \nOfficial Glow T-Shirt design by Anny Maulina.

This campaign all of the items have been designed and we're sourcing our manufacturing partners locally to speed up turnaround and hopefully have everything to you by the end of August.

Long live the New Ministry!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeathburger_Unit B378: Agent, there are still a few extra things that you need to know. I have enabled a J.O.S.A.N [Jigsaw Operating System and Autonomous Network] subroutine that will answer to any remaining questions that you might have.\n\nJ.O.S.A.N. about quality: Quality is the main goal when producing the book and the rewards. We already have a chain of suppliers ready to attend to the demands that will arise from this campaign. I like to produce locally and work with supplier that meet ethical and ecological standards. To keep transparency, as Agents, you will be informed about who and where every item is produced. The current edition of Neon Rising has been printed at Agpograf [In my opinion the best printer in Barcelona] and they will print Nightfall as well. Owners of the most recent edition of Neon Rising can vouch for its quality.\n\nJ.O.S.A.N. about shipping: We will use the same shipping system we use at Citadel 9 at the moment. All rewards will be shipped by courier [When custom laws allow it, Russian Federation and Brazil might need a different service] granting detailed tracking and a swift delivery. Shipping rates are calculated by weight, while the rates might seem slightly high keep in mind these are heavy books. Neon Rising weights 1.5kg and Nightfall with similar specs will be around that. Most rewards will be close to 4kg and that is a factor on the rates. \n\nWith a project like this there is always a lot of factors to take into account and the chance of unexpected events. Any problem can be overcome with good planning and forecasting. The current delivery date of October 2020 is an estimate, consider that it might be modified depending on the final results of the campaign, such as unlocks and total number of backers.\n\nCommunication is a central part of this operation, making sure Agents are always informed and updated about any changes or news regarding the progress of Nightfall.\n\nSmall note about Citadel 9: it is basically a small publisher run by me [DBB378/JOSAN] located in the Barcelona area. I ran a very successful and highly praised campaign for what is now Neon Rising and I've shipped more than eight thousand books in the last couple years, plus hundreds of carefully produced T-shirts, posters and other merchandise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac12 or more", "title": "// Digital Agent", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nDigital version of The Future is Now -

Skies was launched in 2014 has remained 100% independent through crowdfunding and the support of our fans. Last year we created a beautiful clothbound hardcover trade edition collecting our first four issues. This year, we're back with the second half of the series! \nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to print the fifth issue of Skies of Fire. Any additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of future editions of the series. \n\n\nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.  \n\nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince. His actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.  \n\nIn Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.  \n\nIssue Three follows the pair as they recruit members for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead. \n\nIn Issue Four, the crew of the Zephyr comes together despite their differences. \nIssue Five follows the Zephyr as they finally embark on their mission into the Expanse...\n\n\n\nVincenzo Ferriero and Ray Chou have been creating stories together since 2008. They met in college and continue to collaborate despite being 5,437 miles apart.\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art. \nBryan Valenza is a prolific artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects from top publishers in the industry. \n\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army.    \nJosephe Vandel is a German cartographer and graphic designer with a love for RPGs and creating fictional worlds.\n The majority of funds from this Kickstarter will go into covering the cost of printing issue #5 and fulfilling orders from this Kickstarter. Any remaining money will be put back into further production of Skies of Fire. \nSkies of Fire Book I is 8x11\" clothbound hardcover with 120 pages including sequentials, codex documents, and variant covers.. The book features a new wraparound cover by Pablo de Bonis featuring the city of Monterey. \nSkies of Fire Book I. Collects the first four issues. 8x11, Clothbound, 120 Pages. Includes past covers and variant documents.\nInterior of Book I featuring issue four.\nLike our previous single issues, Skies of Fire #5 will be an 8x11 saddle-stitched floppy comic with 38 pages of interiors.  \nSkies of Fire single issues are beautiful oversized 8x11 comic books printed.\nThis issue's featured variant cover features the dark and gothic work of  Gabriela Bacila. \nThe illustration will depict the two elder gods, Nihil and Amika, raging against their eternal prison walls that form the Expanse. \nThe full variant will be revealed towards the middle of the campaign. \nCollector's Edition Limited Bookplate (numbered out of 1000).\nZephyr Papercraft Model designed by Guardadobosque.\nAdd-Ons will be handled post campaign by our partners at Backerkit. You will be able to select additional a la carte items for purchase after you confirm your shipping information. Funds in excess of your chosen reward tier can also be used to purchase add-ons in Backerkit. If you have a specific question about an add-on, please don't hesitate to directly message us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our eighth crowdfunding campaign.

We have not yet printed the comics for Issue #5, and in the event of unforeseen circumstances the books may take longer to arrive in our hands.\n\nWe're doing our best to decrease the time between campaign end and shipping.

Dick wrote in the 1950s.\nAbout Kickstarter Rewards\nAbout the Story\nThe Pipers is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, who wrote over 100 short stories and over 40 books \u2014 many of which are responsible for films such as Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall and The Man in the High Castle.\nAbout the Creators\nWe are siblings! We were born 18 months apart in Portland, Oregon to parents who self-published over 20 books \u2014 books are in our blood! Paul du Coudray is a designer / artist / illustrator living in Taos, New Mexico. Beth is an author, speaker, and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon. She has illustrated books such as Before They Were Authors, I, Parrot, and The Girl Who Named Pluto.\nWhy Print?\nMascot is publishing books as a way of creating 'artifacts' and some artifacts deserve to be held. We also recognize that making a book requires resources and the actual impact of consuming resources is exponentially more complicated than just what goes into making a book. As we strive to make all printed works as tree-worthy as possible, we are additionally donating money for at least 1 tree to be planted per printed book.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is the perfect platform to fund the completion and printing of this book, and offers us the ability to produce books for exactly how many people would like to buy them! We already have a print broker lined up, a warehouse in Colorado ready for shipping & fulfillment \u2014 so why are we asking for money? We want to know how many books to print for you! One of the most exciting things about this project is that we are done... with the WHOLE book... let's go to print!\nAffordability\nWe're offering an e-book for international supporters because shipping books outside of the U.S.A. is crazy expensive. We also want to make this book accessible to anyone in the world, and to honor the rights-free status of Philip K. Dick\u2019s story. If for any reason you can\u2019t afford the print version and don\u2019t have a dollar to spare for the digital version, you can direct message Paul on Instagram when the Kickstarter is over and we\u2019ll send you a link for free download.\nGifts\nDo you want to give this as a gift to someone for the holiday or just because? Send the following link, or download the PDF to give to loved ones while they await the book in the mail! Check it out:\n\nhttps://www.mascot.studio/gift\nTiming\nWhen the Kickstarter ends we'll know how many books to print and we'll place an order shortly thereafter! The process of printing takes about 3 months, so you could expect your book(s) sometime in early Spring :-)\nCredit\nPaul du Coudray\nCo-creator of The Pipers\nFounder / Studio Mascot\ninstagram.com/paulducoudray\nmascot.studio\nBeth Haidle\nCo-creator of The Pipers\nArt Director / Collaborator / Studio Mascot\nCreative Director / Illustoria Magazine\ninstagram.com/ehaidle\ndocucomix.com\nd.rip/ehaidle\nFern \u2022 animated trailer \u2022 website\nJonathan Haidle \u2022 music \u2022 instagram\nMegan Dailey \u2022 layout and design \u2022 website\nJoz Martinez \u2022 video \u2022 instagram\nSamantha Bunn \u2022 making it all happen \u2022 linkedIn\nChyna Dixon \u2022 making it all happen \u2022 instagram\nMascot\nStudio Mascot, founded by Paul du Coudray, is growing up to be a group of practitioners who are exploring a variety of themes within multiple mediums.\n\nMascot Press \u2022 A small press devoted to important works.

This campaign is specifically for funding the creation of Issue #11  and 12 which are at the beginning of Volume 2. (Pages 251 - 298 in the overall story.)\nNew to the story? Not to worry! All of Volume 1 is available in this campaign as well. \nThanks to the amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues #2 - 10 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\n GIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldly magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\nArtwork in progress\nIn issues 11 and 12 Jarra is finally setting foot outside of Winchwing. He wakes up and finds himself in strange surroundings aboard a giant ship brimming with the very pirates that invaded his city. He knows he must escape as soon as possible but even with all his hi-tech gadgets at his disposal-- it's not going to be that easy.\nABOUT THE BOOK\nGirrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially, it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships, and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nA lot of influences on my work come from 80/90's films/animations/comics. I remember really feeling transported to these fascinating worlds. Films like Star Wars and Macross really created exciting unique places that felt real. In this age of digital effects I feel like some of this time that went to into creative development is going into special effects. Something has been lost and many sci-fi stories feel hollow, at least for me. Girrion is a lot about just trying to make a new world that feels real.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\nIf you would like get a closer look at the different book formats available I have a youtube video here.\nHow Do Add-Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add-On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\nAll Hardcover orders come \"deluxe\" automatically.\nEXPENSES\nGenerally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours.

Any additional funds will go directly towards the production of further issues of the series. \nGlow takes place in a world where magic catalyzed both industrial revolution and nuclear holocaust. Half a millennia ago, an ancient and powerful empire known as Nymera developed a means to channel and store magical energy into a sticky blue substance known as anima, storing them into massive Towers across the world.\n With the aid of the Towers, the Nymerans brought peace and paradise into the world. Until one day the Towers fell.\nThe story of Glow takes place two hundred years after that cataclysmic event, and follows the story of those who remain.\nIssue One introduced us to Caszy and Koken, siblings scavengers of the Wastes with extraordinary abilities.\nIssue Two continues the story as the witch Myra makes a compelling proposition.\nVariant Cover illustrated by Melissa Pagluica. Image links to her website.\nMagic in Glow is channeled through the language of ancient Nymera, the former masters of the world. In order to flesh out this cornerstone of the story, we've been collaborating with Colm Doyle, an Estonian linguist and enthusiastic conlanger.\nNymeran is used a number of ways in the comic, including sound effects. \nEach digital edition of Glow comes with a language guide that teaches you the secrets of ancient Nymeran. \nRay Chou and Vincenzo Ferriero are the writers and creators of Glow. Together, they\u2019re the founders of the creative imprint known as Mythopoeia. Glow is their second comic book series after the the dieselpunk airship adventure Skies of Fire. Ray is based in Los Angeles and Vince in London.\nAnny Maulina is an artist from Indonesia and creator of the webcomic Raruurien. She also enjoys working on comic and art projects on her spare time. You can find her on Patreon and DeviantArt. \nDia Ja was born in Iloilio City, Philippines and moved to California with her family. She graduated at Los Angeles County High School for the Arts in 2014, and is currently attending ArtCenter College of Design for Illustration. Check out her tumblr.\nBryan Valenza is an artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects, including Skies of Fire and Witchblade. @bryan_valenza\nBorn in Barcelona, Cristian Docolomansky Cerda (C.D.C.) is an inker and letterer based in Chile. He's worked with several publishers such as Alterna Comics, IDW, and Ariete Producciones. You can find him here.\nFrom Ireland, Colm \u00d3 D\u00faill is a verification specialist at TransferWise's office in Tallinn, Estonia, where he has lived since 2007. He holds an M.Phil. in Applied Linguistics and a B.Comm with French, and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Linguistics. He is married with two children, and has been dabbling in creating constructed languages since 2005; Nymeran is his first developed constructed language.\nKendrick See is a full time concept artist and illustrator from Malaysia. He is currently working in the video game industry, and his job scope ranges from creating various idea development pieces, to breakdowns and 3D paintovers. He helped bring Shoddai to life with a map! http://sourshade.deviantart.com/\nGiulia Frontoni is an Italian illustrator based in Rome with a focus on creature designs. She helped bring to life many of the beasts found in Glow, as well as the postcards and button pinups! http://nondev.deviantart.com/\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army.

Last year we had a lot of issues regarding our manufacturers, and the lesson we took at the end of it all was that we need to be better.\n\nFor 2018, we want to ship our projects in as timely a manner as possible. We've set a deadline for this project of April and think we can wrap everything up by then. The only new manufacturing needed for this Kickstarter are the print copies for #2 as well as some runic pendants. Everything else is in stock and ready to go.\n\nWe'll do our best to improve our logistics, but are also committed to top quality customer support. If you ever have an issue, please let us know and we'll do our best to fix it. You can ask our previous backers - we do our best to make sure they're 100% satisfied.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mythopoeia is just Vince and Ray. We both have full time jobs outside of comics, but we're passionate about what we do and are committed to grow.

You want stretch goals and more cool stuff, and so do we! \nHere it comes: Help us reach the fabulous 50.000, and we\u2019ll create a Bestiary for you. It will be a whole new section in the book, with in-depth descriptions and illustrations of the creatures and characters in the Fall of Gods universe. \nYes, a new section. In the book. Print as well as digital. Available to all of you, as big thanks for your support and enthusiasm! Hurry up and upgrade your pledge, or tell a friend.\nFALL OF GODS is a series of cinematic illustrated novels, set in a realm inspired by Norse mythology\n1670 backers helped us launch FALL OF GODS here at kickstarter with a massive roar - So huge, that 20th Century Fox picked it up, now developing it into a feature film. \nNow the saga continues in The Nomad; volume two in the planned trilogy;\nThe Eldest have awakened from their age-old slumber and Midgard and Jotunheim are at the brink of war. When Vali learns of a legendary Jotun witch who can bring back his wife from the dead, he travels North, across a realm torn by fear and xenophobia. But he soon finds himself on a collision course with Rolf Krake, Midgard\u2019s cunning and war-mongering high chieftain, who may hold the key to Vali\u2019s dark past - and the truth about the demon who dwells inside him.   \n      Fall of Gods - the Nomad is the exhilarating sequel to Fall of Gods - She Is Gone, combining the written novel with epic illustration. \n   PLAY\n\nOur unique approach to the book medium, is combining the massive amount of illustration with the written novel on every spread of the book. It gives an immersive experience, rarely found in books - we call it a cinematic novel. \nFall of Gods - the Nomad is 11.7 x 8.7\", 144 pages. Fall of Gods logo on frontcover will be debossed.  \n        You can add the following products to your pledge, at a discounted price. These will be delivered together with your copy of Fall of Gods, at no extra shipping cost. Please note that you can only order addons if you are a backer at level STANDARD or above.\nTo buy an addon, click the Manage My Pledge button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in US $) for the addons you want. Your total pledge also needs to cover the shipping. When this Kickstarter is over, we will send out a backer survey in which you can mark exactly which addons you want. \nBrimstone: The Demon Within is a contemporary coming-of-age tale set in a treacherous realm that exists beneath our world. It is the story of a gifted girl thrust into a wilderness of wonder and terror, where she is forced to face her deepest fears. We have teamed up with Hollywood screenwriter Will Simmons to create this epic dark fantasy universe. \nThe book is 156 pages, hardcover, and was successfully funded on kickstarter. See the campaign HERE\nFall of gods - She is Gone was our first Cinematic Novel, and we have learned a lot since then. We are really grateful for all the feedback we have received from our backers. We listened to your great thoughts on the book and redesigned our book format, for our second project, Brimstone.\nAs soon as we saw it, we knew had found a better format to communicate our vision, and show the enhanced quality in story, illustration and layout.\nWe know it is not ideal to have the first volume in another format than the second, but we need to make this change to create a stunning product that can hold up in the future. At some point we hope to do the entire trilogy in this format.\nYou get more illustrations, more pages and a bigger format..\nHere is a comparison of the two volumes: \n    Fall of Gods started as a passion project- a collaboration between Art Director and co-founder of MOOD Rasmus Berggreen and Hitman writer Michael Vogt - and you all helped us get the story out to the world. \nMOOD is an entertainment design agency, located in Copenhagen, Denmark. At MOOD we love designing universes and building worlds for the biggest brands. See more here: moodvisuals.com\nOur world class team at MOOD is doing all the artwork, and it will be stunning. MOOD is also handling layout and print, to deliver a quality product to you. \n  We are so excited that 20th century Fox is developing Fall of Gods into an epic motion picture! Maze Runner director Wes Ball is attached to direct the movie and the script has been adapted by Stuart Beattie, writer of Pirates of the Caribbean, Collateral, 30 days of night and many more. \n  From the Hollywood Reporter\n    The story is already written and the storyboard done for the entire book. We need your support to finish the Artwork and layout, printing of the book and shipping. We want to give you the coolest book possible and that comes with a cost. This is how we plan our budget: \n  We are really excited to have been invited to Kickstarter's DRIP.\nDrip is a subscription platform, where creators can share their creative work and release ongoing content for the subscribers.\nIt is the perfect place for us to show all the work that goes into creating our universes, and to give exclusive content and updates for backers. You can check out our profile here:  MOOD DRIP\n      When we launched Fall of Gods, the very talented composer Fran\u00e7ois Jolin wrote a beautiful and haunting book score, to contribute to the Cinematic experience. Listen to the first track Hunt below or go to spotify for the full score.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been running two succesful kickstarter campaigns with Fall of Gods 1 and Brimstone, and delivered on time. We have also been partner on Rise of the Necromancers, a very cool board game launched on Kickstarter earlier this year. So at this stage we have quite some experience dealing with a production cycle and handling print and shipping.\n\nShipping is always a little challenging, but we are confident we will get the product out on time and with our quality trademark.\n\nWe will be shipping with a German Partner within EU, and with an American partner in the US and to the rest of the world.

Kanji Combat is an educational game, designed to be the ideal introductory course to the Japanese language! It's the third game in a smash-hit series, following Hiragana Battle and Katakana War - but you don't need to have played those!\nThis new game teaches you a separate part of Japanese: the Kanji writing system.\nCompatible with PC & Mac, Learn Japanese To Survive! Kanji Combat is a spectacular mixture of learning, action, adventure and intrigue! Everything you need to start learning Japanese is contained within the game!\nJapanese is a language that can be very daunting to begin learning. It contains a unique alphabet of intricate symbols that can be very confusing to newcomers. How do you write these symbols? How do you even pronounce them?! If you're asking yourself these questions, don't worry - that's completely normal!\nThe best way to learn a new language is with a learning tool that's going to keep you interested, challenge you at the right pace, and most importantly, keep you coming back for more. Learn Japanese To Survive! Kanji Combat is your ticket to easy Japanese learning! \nBattle fierce Kanji monsters!\nWant to grab some sweet rewards outside of your pledge level? Well, now you can! Add-ons are the ideal way to pick up specific rewards that you like, without having to pledge more than you want.\nYou can add an extra amount to your pledge to receive the following goodies. You can do this anytime after backing the project via the BackerKit survey we will send out when the campaign wraps up!\nThe Japanese language combines 3 different sets of characters to form written works: Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji.\nThis game focuses solely on Kanji, the biggest set of characters. Kanji are unique pictorial symbols borrowed from the Chinese language. Because each Kanji is so intricately designed, many students find them hard to learn. This game will teach you the correct way to write and pronounce Kanji, and your memorisation exercises will take the form of exciting gameplay!\nThis game features over 200 Kanji characters to learn and master. With this knowledge under your belt, you can begin reading and writing Japanese!\nLearn useful Kanji in every lesson!\n  At the start of each of the game's chapters, you'll learn a new set of Kanji characters. Following that, you're free to go on adventures and explore.  \nYou'll encounter dangerous enemies that have taken the shape of Kanji. To defeat them, you'll need to correctly translate them! If you give the wrong answer, your attack will be reflected and used against you. It's a learn & live situation!\nMuch like the other games in this series, you will also have the opportunity to learn some Japanese vocabulary! You'll see how words are constructed using Kanji, and learn the translations of useful words and phrases.\nPut your knowledge to the test in battle!\n      Learn over 200 Kanji characters, with detailed instructions on how to read and write each character.\nLearn useful mnemonic techniques to recognise each Kanji.\nAudio speech examples from native Japanese speakers demonstrate how to pronounce each Kanji character.\nFollow along with the exciting story that will see you travel to Japan to defend the country from shape-shifting monsters!\nExciting gameplay with familiar RPG elements - collect items, complete quests, engage in batles!\nBuild a new town from the ground up. Customise your town with different features!\nForm new friendships and get to know each of your companions with unlockable story sequences.\nEarn experience points and level up your characters.\nReview completed lessons to brush up on your knowledge.\nIn-game quizzes test what you're learning.\nIn addition to all of these features, the game will have an original soundtrack! We have partnered with some of the most talented composers on the planet to bring you a musical score worthy of praise. You can listen to some samples right here! \n[Courage In Your Heart] composed by Sam Luff. Performed by Sam Luff & Kelly Mahoney.\n\n[The True Self Contains Unlimited Potential] and [Let Destiny Give Way To Your Ambitions] composed by Alec Shea. Performed by Alec Shea.\nUpgrade your town and expand your learning opportunities!\n      Ready to learn Japanese? You bet you are!\nLearn Japanese To Survive! Kanji Combat is on track for release on PC and Mac in August, 2018. Back this project to receive updates and get some sweet rewards!\nWhile you wait for the release date, why not check out the other games in this series? Available now on Steam, these games are solid introductions to the language and will make you even more prepared to play Kanji Combat.\nLearn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle [on Steam]\nLearn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War [on Steam]\n  For this game, we are including a lot of content that our previous games unlocked as stretch goals (such as voice acting, flash cards and more characters). Because of this, our initial Kickstarter goal is higher than previous projects. We want this game to be as complete as possible, without having to rely on hitting stretch goals.\n\nAs such, the stretch goals outlined here will not enhance the core game, but will help us improve the game's presentation and the overall experience.\n$40,000: \u300cAudio drama!\u300d\nA collection of short stories featuring the characters and their endeavours to learn Japanese. Fully voice acted and provided in an audio file so you can listen on your computer, smart phone or music player! Audio dramas are popular accompaniments to manga and anime releases in Japan, so we'd love to produce one for this game!\n$70,000: \u300cFully animated sequence!\u300d\nA short anime-style sequence developed by a Japanese animation studio! This will feature the main characters in some new and exciting situations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've learned a lot from our last two successful Kickstarter projects!\n\nHiragana Battle was praised by the gaming community, but there was definitely room for improvement. So, we enhanced Katakana War to please newcomers and hardcore gamers alike.\n\nBoth of our previous games managed to meet the promised release dates and rollout on Steam successfully. We've shipped thousands of physical rewards too, which proved very popular.\n\nSo, even though we've done this twice before, there will always be challenges. Kanji Combat is a very large game, and we will be drawing upon all our previous experience to bring it to life. We'll be counting on dozens of beta testers to punish the game and highlight anything that needs improvement.\n\nWe are actively seeking feedback from backers and fans. Tell us what you want to see in the game, and most importantly, tell us what works for you and what doesn't.\n\nWith your help, we can create an educational game that is a joy to play and a pleasure to learn with!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 8 or more", "title": "[Digital] Kanji Warrior", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the game!

Techniques like matte paintings and rear projections would make \u201eSlice of Life\u201c even more atmospheric and visually appealing, so it was always our wish to include them in our movie. If we reach this goal, that wish would become a reality! Plus, we would build even more more miniatures and that means a bigger, more vibrant cityscape!\n Our first stretch goal would enrich the visual appeal of the movie, and this one would add more drama and tension to its story. It is a scene that demands a brand new set, made from scratch, but it would be well worth it because that scene would give more gravitas to our main character and the struggle he has with himself, his nemesis and this damn city he's stuck in!\n\nEven though \u201eSlice of Life\u201c premiere will be held in Zagreb, Croatia, we always wanted to have another, international one. And what better place to do it than the center of film industry: Los Angeles. Not to mention that our movie is set in the streets and on the platforms of that same, albeit futuristic LA, so it would be kind of poetic! \u201eSlice of Life\u201c on the big screen, in-depth and detailed film-makers show and tell and a chance to hang out with you guys (and a couple of cold ones)... yap, that would be a dream come through!\n       When we started working on \u201cSlice of Life\u201d, we wanted to make an original movie set in a rather familiar world, and the biggest influence for us was clearly \u201cBlade Runner\u201d, as Ridley Scott, Jordan Cronenweth, and other movie legends envisioned it back in 1982.\nWet, foggy, and gritty streets of futuristic Los Angeles were a perfect place for our story, but we didn\u2019t want to just copy/paste it and shoot a replica\u2026 We wanted to pay our tribute to \u201cBlade Runner\u201d in terms of aesthetics, and at the same time make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d something more than a mere fan-film or a sequel, with an unique storyline that doesn\u2019t rely on anything seen in the \u201cBlade Runner\u201d universe.\nThat being said, \u201cSlice of Life\u201d is a tasteful homage to the masterpiece that inspired us on so many levels and we are honored if anyone can put our little movie in the same sentence as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of our time, but that is where the connections between these two movies end and our paths diverge. \nThe duration of the short film will be approximately 20 minutes.\n    Follow Slice Of Life on: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n  It is just another damp, rainy, and foggy night on the streets of the futuristic Los Angeles. Beneath the flashy neon signs and heavy traffic, scum of this megalopolis tries to make a living and hopefully survive to see another day.\nCriminals, junkies, prostitutes, punks\u2026 and one lonesome drug dealer in the middle of it all, fed up with this ever expanding city and lowlife parasites that inhabit it. He may be well on his way to leave it all behind, but fate has made other plans and his whole world will come crumbling down when a dirty cop with an agenda of his own enters his life.\n  A big part of that 70s and 80s Sci-Fi allure comes from the use of practical special effects. Visionaries of that era relied on miniatures and models, animatronics, matte paintings, and other techniques for creation of those lavish imaginary worlds. Even today, 30 or 40 years later, the charm and depth of their work remains unparalleled. We are not against CGI and other modern era tools (we use it heavily in our commercial work), but in order to pay a worthy homage to our predecessors, we wanted to make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d as authentic as we could.\nSo, everything you see in our trailer and will see in the completed movie is made the \u201cold-school\u201d way.\nWe learned to build miniatures, light them properly, learned how to create practical effects, so that we could film everything in camera like people did back in the 80s. We filmed on real sets that we built from scratch for \u201cSlice of Life\u201d. All of the miniatures and real-sized sets were created from cheap materials, junk, computer parts, and lots of imagination.\nBuilding the \"car set\":\nOld Citro\u00ebn BX 1986 bought for the production\n    Finished car interior\n Building the miniature car for exterior scenes:\nMiniature car model\n    We have spent the last three years in a garage, taking every spare moment of our time and all of our skill, dedicating it to bringing \u201cSlice of Life\u201d to\u2026 well, life.\nOur core team consists of only three people, and with some help of our friends and family, we carried this project on our backs for as long as we could, but we realized that, in order to finish our movie in the way we envisioned it, we need the help from our fans and the wider community. As a platform best suited for our needs, we chose Kickstarter to present this movie, connect us with our audience, and give you a chance to be an essential part in the creation of \u201cSlice of Life\u201d.\nFilming the miniature city\n  Filming the car interior\n    We need you guys to help us finish the movie. A big part of the movie is shot, but we have an extensive miniature shoot ahead of us and a complicated post-production process.\nFor the miniature shoot we need better equipment like new lenses and additional lighting, and a professional motion control system (because everything will be shot in passes*).\n*Shooting in passes - a complicated and slow process of shooting the same shot multiple times in different lighting conditions, the same way it was done in the 80's.\nThere\u2019s also lots of additional miniature building which is very time consuming so we need to put our daily commercial work on hold.\nUnpainted building made from junk / Finished miniature building\nThe cherry on top will be the soundtrack. Vangelis is infiltrated in our minds and souls, so we have a pretty big mountain to climb. Help us, and together we\u2019ll put our \u201cSlice of Life\u201d flag on top of it!\n  First and foremost, you get our deepest gratitude, not just for helping us financially, but for believing in us and our project. We want to thank you for your support and trust, and give you something to remember \"Slice of Life\" as one of your fondest memories in the years to come.\nThat being said, we prepared lots of cool \u201cSlice of Life\u201d props, T-shirts, special \u201cSlice of Life\u201d collectors\u2019 boxes and a beautiful movie soundtrack, exclusively pressed on vinyl. Of course, there will be one more thing - this finished short film called \u201cSlice of Life\u201d, which you will be able to enjoy for a very long time in the years to come.\n    Limited edition police badge, cast from the production molds\n    This cute spaceship is looking for a new home!\n  With less than 2 weeks to go, we\u2019ve decided to stir things up a bit and offer you something really special: two new awesome and unique rewards!\nIt\u2019s the one that our character drives throughout the whole movie and basically is a character of its own. This is not just a screen used model or fun looking prop that would look nice on your shelf, it is a true piece of craftsmanship, and a piece of our film\u2019s history.\nWe\u2019ll create a unique 15-second retro sci-fi commercial for your business, that will be featured in \u201cSlice of Life\u201d as one of the commercials projected on those huge building screens for 5 seconds. And now the best part, you\u2019ll get full copyright for the 15-second commercial to use it in real life promotion for your company! Show the ad to the world on your web site, social media, YouTube, TV etc.!\n You like our reward tiers and want to contribute, but feel like you\u2019re missing out on something?

We want to make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d an unforgettable experience for fans of the genre and also for those who don\u2019t really know that much about it, and to pay a truly worthy tribute to the classics that kept inspiring us for so many years.\n\nWe hope that we are not alone in this and that you share our love and admiration of those classics (and movies in general), and we welcome you to join us on our adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "** Exclusive Featurette **", "descp": "Wanna learn about the magic of miniatures?

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation Issues 8 and 9, which will complete Volume1. That means MOST of the book is already complete. I only have about 50 pages to go out of the 225+ pages in the series.\nNew to the story? Not to worry!  All of Volume 1 is available in this campaign. Also Issues 8 and 9 will be of course available as well for those who have already been following along.\nThanks to the lovely and amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 7 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\nGIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\n        Inking in progress\n        Volume 1 cover art in progress\n     Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n            This will be the first campaign where a full volume book is available. It will be 225+ pages in length. 6.14\" x 9.2\"\nVolume 1 mockup. Cover art and design are in progress.\n Previous campaigns single issues were available in hardcover or softcover, and these formats will be available in this campaign as well. \nSample Hardcover (Issue #7)\n Hardcover comic issues are 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket. Each issue is anywhere from 22 - 26 pages in length.\nSoftcover samples (Issues 1-9)\nSoftcover comic issues are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSample Character Sketch\n  Sample 4\" x 6\" print\n  How Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n  Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n  Scout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 last October and will be releasing books up through this Fall. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site. www.scoutcomics.com\nFollow\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/\nMusic from Kickstarter Video: \"Night Owl\" by Broke For Free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience, the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected. Also, keep in mind I have to mix this work in with the day job.\n\nI've learned a lot from previous Kickstarter campaigns, and I am getting more and more efficient. I'm also trying to find ways to make rewards as cost-effective as possible too. One way of doing this is to do more than one issue per campaign, which cuts down on mailing costs. Before it took so long to complete just one issue and I could only offer one per campaign, but now I plan on doing 2 -3 issues per campaign from now on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "CURIOUS ABOUT GIRRION", "descp": "-Issue 1 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 4 or more", "title": "ISSUE 8 & 9 (PDF)", "descp": "Continuing the Saga!\n-Issue 8 & 9 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["52 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "CHOOSE ANY 3 ISSUES (PDF)", "descp": "-Miss an issue or want to start from the beginning?

Nima is a combination of all my childhood influences and inspirations and I want to inject every bit of life from the grand adventures I experienced as a kid into my own personal world.\nNima\u2019s story takes place in a world with hauntingly beautiful and vibrant locations. I want Nima\u2019s world to excite people the way I was drawn into the world of Avatar the Last Airbender. I draw a lot of inspiration from anime like Full Metal Alchemist, fighting games like Super Smash Bros., and movies like Spirited Away. Nima\u2019s world will take you through an expansive and magical journey with a dynamic cast of companions, travelers, and enemies. This book will show my vision from start to finish, depicting this vivid world with scribbles, sketches, key scenes and cinematic paintings.\nEvery page will be crafted with care with a mixture of Typography, Layout, Graphic Design and Digital Illustrations.\n  The book is the first step into introducing Nima to the world.\n           SHIPPING - \nShipping will be handled through the Pledge Manager!

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation of Issue 7 (pages 182 -206 of Book 1).\nNew to the story? Not to worry! All issues will be available in this campaign.\nThanks to the lovely Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 6 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\n    GIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\n              Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n              Hard cover sample\n Hardcover are 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket.\nSoft cover samples\nSoftcover books are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSample Character Sketch\n  How Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n    Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\nScout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 in last October and will be releasing books up through this Fall. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site.\nFollow\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/\nMusic from Kickstarter Video: \"Night Owl\" by Broke For Free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected.

As you can see, our campaign has already ended. But you still have an opportunity to join the ranks of those selected backers who\u2019ll get our watches before the retail selling starts, and with the special price too. Check our site www.divided-0.com and Indiegogo page.\nHello again, Kickstarter! Divided By Zero watches are back! After our first successful campaign we return to you to present the more superior and advanced \u03b2eta series. And more scientifically designed, of course :)\nBETA SERIES: PASCAL / NEWTON / TURING / VOLTA\nWe're the small watchmaking company from Canada and also the creators of the first watches with mathematically approved design. Our previous \u03b1lpha series appeared on Kickstarter a year ago and attracted a small army of backers, raising 300% of initially requested funds. \nBETA SERIES: GALILEO / ARCHIMEDES\nThe main feature of Divided By Zero watches is its design concept. We prefer neat minimal design, monochrome palette and the highest quality with an affordable price. And we're totally crazy about accuracy and precision! That's why we used the miraculous power of science - all of our concepts are based on the researches, strict recommendations and direct involvement of actual mathematicians, architects and engineers, who helped us to create ultimate design with perfection in every detail.\nWe decided that our next project must explore the evolution of the design concept further. It blends accuracy of calculations with the beauty of natural science. The \u03b2eta series is inspired with the greatest minds of mankind and their inventions and the greatest minds of our team put a lot of effort to achieve absolution in every line, curve and index mark on the watch dial. Divided By Zero is the golden section of watch design!\nThis time we wanted to make every watch in the new series more individual and distinctive. Each watch has a strong connection between its design and concept, and for more character we added some prominent unique details to it. Meet the \u03b2eta series!\nNEWTON\nNEWTON\nNewton explores the idea of the trinity concept which is the basis for an every object we create. And it's a very attractive shape, too ;) The main feature of Newton is the dial's reflective surface with a slightly changing tone of its color. It's named after Isaac Newton, referring to his teachings and laws of motion.\nGALILEO\nGALILEO\nGalileo relies on pure minimalism in design. The concentric dial refers to orbits and the sub-dials are planet and its satellite. The most interesting feature is the partly sandwich dial which creates a multi-layer effect. This watch was named after the one of the greatest astronomers in history \u2014 Galileo Galilei.\nARCHIMEDES\nARCHIMEDES\nArchimedes is the second one in our sub-dial department. It also has a sandwich volume dial and an ideally symmetrical face, supporting the whole idea of our mathematical design. Archimedes watch is the homage to the famous ancient Greek mathematician.\nPASCAL\nPASCAL\nPascal watch is the most complicated in the series! Yet simple to read the time, as always. It has a classic Nodus structure image on its dial. But the most notable thing is the handcrafted outer layer which is cut by the shape of the dial image! The watch's inspiration source is Blaise Pascal's researches. \nVOLTA\nVOLTA\nVolta is and ode to the geometrical beauty of the basic shape \u2014 circle, which is also a foundation in design for almost every watch. The model shares its name with the prominent Italian scientist Alessandro Volta.\nTURING\nTURING\nTuring follows up the minimalist path in the \u03b2eta series. Its dial is decorated with an infinite loop to depict the idea of the abstraction of time itself. It bears the name of a swift minded genius of Alan Turing.\nThe second stretch goal is UNLOCKED!\nThe newest stretch goal is Copernicus watch. It's inspired by famous Medieval astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus. Design of the model refers both to his personal astrolabe and to the theory of Copernican heliocentrism.\nCopernicus is available in two different color options: black or white.\nCOPERNICUS\nCOPERNICUS BLACK\nThe first stretch goal is UNLOCKED!  \n\nWe are very proud with our concept we've brought to the first launch. That's why we decided to revise the \u03b1lpha series and present you the new enhanced versions of Gauss, Kepler, Plato and Euclid models. All \u03b1lpha watches come with the new thick strap with a spectacular red or blue edging and artificially weathered leather, domed crystal and reworked design, which slightly improves the initial developments preserving the main features. Suitable for those, who prefers more traditional outlook!\nNEW ALPHA SERIES: GAUSS & KEPLER\nNEW ALPHA SERIES: EUCLID & PLATO\nDivided By Zero is a watch for everyone.\nWe may be over our heads with the obsession with maths and science, but our goal is to create watches you'd like to wear! That's why we try to make it perfect in every aspect.\nWe want Divided By Zero to become a part of everyone's wardrobe in the world! It's universality affords an easy strap change and suits every wrist with its massive yet sophisticated construction.\nWe give our watches the character to fit the individuality of its owner. You can easily find the specific watch that'll become a part of yourself.\nThe development of every model of Divided By Zero watches is a hardworking process. We study a lot of watches, try tons of designs and make infinite tests before we come up with a solid prototype.  \nThanks to our backers, we had a lot of feedback on our previous campaign. That's why we exactly know what we need to improve in our second series.\nThe DBZ team did their homework! First of all, there were some backers who wasn't very satisfied with our straps. The issue is solved! Now we offer the more superior high quality genuine leather straps, which are much thicker and more sturdy than before.\nWe wanted to add some distinctive features in our design, which would be unique and memorable and make our watches stand out. The new DBZ \u03b2eta series comes in a pitch black color palette with the signature blue square root second hand.\nFor the new series we've also replaced flat crystal with domed to make more \u201cout of this world\u201d impression and offer you a better view on our trademark design.\nOne of our experimental features is the hand cut bezel for the Archimedes model corresponding to the design pattern.\nAll of our straps have the blue edging \u2014 main color of Divided By Zero watches.\nGalileo and Pascal have minimalist sub-dials placed on the different layers with the main dial. Both models have artificially aged case and strap buckles.\nThe other thing, rather than design, a lot of people love Divided By Zero watches for, is its affordable price. Our primary goal is to bring our projects to life and make happy as much people as we can with our watches. That's why we offer such an attractive price on the DBZ watches, which is only $95 USD! There are several factors that affect the price.\nNo retail margin at all! That\u2019s right! You get your watches directly from the manufacturer, avoiding any middlemen with their commissions on the way to your wrists.\nProduction costs. We\u2019re always transparent and honest about it. There\u2019s a graph below showing how we could achieve such an affordable price with an every stage of manufacturing and every piece of the watch itself priced accordingly as well as company profit.\nThis graph depicts the difference in pricing policy between Divided By Zero and most of other watch brands in similar price range. Such an attractive price formed by avoiding any extra distribution costs and retail markups, as well as significantly cutting the brand\u2019s profit.\nThe new \u03b2eta series watches are made of high grade 316L stainless steel with a black PVD coating with the total weight of 45 g for each timepiece! It comes with a thick genuine leather ZULU strap, domed crystal and offers 5 ATM water resistance. The movement is the accurate and reliable Japanese-made Miyota.\nCase Diameter: 43 mm\nCase Thickness: 9.5 mm\nFace Diameter: 37 mm \nTotal Weight: 45 gram\nBand Material: Genuine Leather \nBand Width / Length / Thickness: 20 mm / 255 mm / 2.0 mm   \nCase Material: 316L Stainless Steel \nBuckle: 316L Stainless Steel \nCrystal: Domed mineral\nMovement: Miyota 2035 / Miyota 6P25 (Japan) \nWater Resistant: 5 ATM\nHere\u2019s the graph showing estimated production period \u2013 from the Kickstarter campaign to the shipping. We\u2019re confident in terms and that each stage will be completed in time because of our experience with the previous campaign. Last time we delivered the watches to our backers in a month ahead of the schedule!\nSocial media are the perfect tool to influence the success of the campaign.

We still work with them, so there's no need to worry about the watch quality and production issues. We also have the final prototypes of our current project so there will be no need in testing it.\n\nWe learned a lot about how to struggle with difficulties previous time and even managed to deliver our watches in a month ahead of the schedule.

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation of Issue 6 (pages 128 -156 of the Book 1).  \nNew to the story? Not to worry! All issues will be available in this campaign.\nThanks to the lovely Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 5 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\n  GIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\nSamples from Issue 1:\n     Samples from Issues 2, 3, 4 & 5:\n   Page in progress from Issue 6\n     Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments. \nMuch of my inspiration still came from things like Star Wars, Robotech and Appleseed and I wanted to do something where I was creating a new world. Something that felt original. \nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. One scene led to another, then another etc. Five yeas passed, then 10 and I had the story but I didn't have the professional illustration chops STILL, and the comic just didn't look how I wanted it to. Luckily all the time I put in over the years not helped the art, but also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n                 Softcover books are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nHardcover are also 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket.\nIn days where sci-fi movies and video games often get so caught up in special effects, crazy camera edits (all the glitz basically), I feel like something has been lost. All these distractions often take me out of the story rather than make me more interested. \nWhen it comes to fantasy and science fiction I want two things: immersion and creativity. That's what I'm trying to do with Girrion- to simply make a new type of story in an imaginary world that feels real. Instead of creating dozens of worlds that we get to go to one-by-one, I'm focusing heavily on one.\nI'm also a fan of the hero's journey, which is an influence, but I feel like the same story is getting told over and over again. Girrion's storyline has a rhythm to it, but I've done my best to make it unpredictable. Instead of an underdog versus and overwhelming powerful antangonist, it's about different races trying to get their foothold in a situation where everyone is vulnerable. So far this approach has lead to some interesting options for me as a writer, and I feel it is hard for the reader to guess what will happen next.\nHow Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button)\n Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected \nYou are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n  Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n    Well, since last campaign there's been some major news:\nScout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 in October and most recently Issue 3 hit comic book stores just the other day. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site.\nReading with a Flight Ring: Girrion #1\nA Place to Hang Your Cape: REVIEW: GIRRION: Book 1: The Chrysalis & The Stone #1-3\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long.

Miles Dunn\u2019s epic Grinidon is now funding on Kickstarter and I was able to ask a few more questions about the series.\nThe first volume, now available in print and digital, was successfully funded about a year ago. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain just how satisfying of an experience this Kickstarter has been. The physical book is great, full of all that wonderful art by Erwin Arroza (interviewed here). Seeing the samples and random pages was one thing, but being able to sit and enjoy it all at once was\u2026well, wonderful.\n   Of course, all is a relative term. The story is epic and in Volume One we have still only encountered two of the three Kingdoms vying for control of Calloway. There is so much more to be told\u2026  \nThanks again to J. Miles Dunn for taking the time for this interview. New readers should also check out Moby\u2019s first interview with J. Miles Dunn for even more background regarding Grinidon and the history behind the project and it\u2019s artist.\n-\nMoby\u2019s \u2013 Volume 1 of Grinidon, your labor of love, is finally out there and it\u2019s beautiful. Tell us a little about the experience of seeing your project become a reality.\nJ. Miles Dunn \u2013 It\u2019s just so unbelievable. The amount of thought and labor I put into this is not just beyond anything I\u2019ve ever done, it\u2019s beyond anything I ever thought I could do.   \nMy \u201cto do\u201d list just seemed to grow exponentially, and beyond the writing, technical, and logistical challenges, I actually had to start the book over three times. There\u2019s just no preparing for something like that \u2013 but honestly, I don\u2019t think it could have happened any other way.  \nThe whole thing is just such an incredible whirlwind of research, rewrites, luck, edits, and patience, that unless a person is wholly dedicated to their project and it comes from a place of real passion, I don\u2019t see how anyone could see it through to the end.  \nI hope that doesn\u2019t dissuade anyone though, because after it\u2019s finished, there\u2019s no greater feeling than seeing your dream come to life. When you put that much work into something and it\u2019s suddenly there before you, I also think that\u2019s when you really know if this was something you had to do, or were meant to do.\n-\nIn Vol. 1, we\u2019ve only met two of the three Kingdoms of Calaway, and we\u2019re left wondering if that mention of elves is foreshadowing anything. Can you tell us what new characters or races we might meet in Vol.2?\nOne of my favorite aspects of the story, after having worked on it for more than two decades, is its level of depth. I try to never throw too much at the reader, but a living and breathing world will always have new things to explore and discover.  \nI will say that in Volume 2 you get to meet the last of the three kingdoms, which includes several new characters, but this journey of discovery is really only just beginning. You\u2019re definitely in for some surprises!\n-\nI liked how at the start of the story it was about the war, but then that moved to the background as the characters and their mission moved to the front. And then the subplots\u2026 and it\u2019s all great! Can I get some of your thoughts on this and where things are headed?\nTo me, the mysteries are always the greatest thrill. What would Star Wars be without the Force and each character\u2019s own backstory and motivations? The same is true of the relationship between the between the characters, races and kingdoms of the Lord of the Rings. Every new encounter holds new answers, but also adds an infinite number of questions.   \nIf a story is done right, I think it is all very organic because everything is part of a whole. Fleshed-out stories and characters will always complement one another because each piece is part of a greater puzzle \u2013 and each section of that puzzle will come together in ways that may be unexpected.  \nAt this point, the reader doesn\u2019t truly know what the puzzle even is.\n-\nThough the enemy of our heroes, Prince Demetrius is such a tragic figure. We only meet him at the end of Vol. 1, but he seemed to perhaps have the most potential of any of the characters in the story. Am I far off?\nI like Demetrius because he immediately shatters the reader\u2019s perception of \u201cwho\u201d the group\u2019s enemy really is \u2013 or at least that was my hope.  \nIn literature and in history, I often find that the internal struggles are far more interesting than the external ones \u2013 and you can\u2019t fully appreciate one without the other. I guess it goes back to what I was saying before that each kingdom and character has their own story. There is a reason that people fight \u2013 even if that reason is a petty one.\nThroughout each of the three kingdoms there are rifts and secrets. Demetrius is the first example of this within the North, but he definitely won\u2019t be the last. You\u2019re definitely not wrong to ask or speculate about his potential, and I\u2019m genuinely excited to see your reaction to where things are headed, and who you question next.\n-\nArtist Erwin Arroza has already begun working on the art for Vol. 2, how is that coming along?  \nHonestly, it is going even better than Volume 1. We couldn\u2019t be happier with how things are moving.  \nHe is currently about fifty-pages into the second volume, but since I have so much of the story outlined, I am somewhat free to jump-around and tackle different sections of the issue where inspiration leads me. It is being illustrated in order, but I can\u2019t say for sure how long the volume will actually be at this point. The first was 156 pages, so I guess we\u2019ll have to see where this one ends-up.  \nI really like that freedom in doing this as graphic novels and not smaller issues. It gives me greater flexibility to tell the story as it naturally unfolds. Having to compact things can be incredibly restrictive in terms of letting emotions, action, and dialogue play-out naturally. It definitely gives me a newfound sense of respect for comic book creators.\n-\nHow many Volumes might there be in the Grinidon saga?\nThat is a somewhat difficult question to answer, but not altogether impossible.  \nOriginally I wrote them as novels but was fortunate enough to be able to make the transition into graphic novels \u2013 and by fortunate, I mean through luck and stubborn determination.  \nThe first novel, as I have it outlined currently, should come in at seven volumes. There are twelve books in the series if I take it to completion, but some are longer and shorter than others. I don\u2019t think sixty would be too far from accurate \u2013 which means that if I\u2019m lucky, I have a very long road ahead of me.\n-\nhttp://www.mobys.ws/01/08/7780/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNearly everything is made locally, so the only foreseeable problem we could encounter is a minor delay in shipping.

You play an astronaut aboard the Daedalus Space Station, a man plagued by prophetic nightmares of death and destruction. You tell yourself they are only dreams, but after the first crewmate dies\u2026 what will you tell yourself then?\n(click to move on the Daedalus Patreon page)\nThe game takes place in the hard sci-fi After Reset\u2122 universe. In the 22nd century, several years before the \"Reset\" (a thermonuclear apocalypse that nearly ended human civilization), the crew aboard the Daedalus Space Station is eager to return home from a yearlong orbital exploration of Venus and Sun. Only thirty days remain until the next crew rotation, but Matt Cramer, an astronaut from the crew, begins to has unnatural dreams full of horrors that are about to become a reality.\nYet as the days count down to zero, strange events begin to unfold. Crewmates succumb to accidents or rumors of murder, communications go dark, and everyone grows increasingly on edge as conspiracy theories abound. Though help is on its way, you must survive long enough for it to arrive.\nThroughout the game you will interact with six characters aboard the Daedalus Space Station, and below you\u2019ll find an in-depth look at each of them with our character bios and HD art.\nHiroto Yoshida: JAXA, mission commander.\nMatt Cramer: NASA, mission specialist (engineering science).\nJill Scott: NASA, mission specialist (biological science).\nEitan Levy: ISA, mission specialist (physical science).\nLia Medvedeva: Roskosmos, mission payload specialist.\nRon Armentos: AES, mission pilot.\n  The Daedalus game will emphasize story, character development, and relationships over puzzle solving. The story is affected by the player\u2019s dialogue choices and actions during timed events that can often lead to some of the station\u2019s components being lost or damaged. It\u2019s also possible to uncover new research or knowledge of various threats under investigation, to affect the outcomes of certain characters being killed, as well as the player\u2019s relationship with the crew and the way they perceive each other. The choices made by the player will carry over from episode to episode.\nThe visual style for the game will be like a graphic adventure similar to The Walking Dead Game and Heavy Rain, with painted 3d characters and environments, and a third-person perspective gameplay POV with a variety of cinematic camera angles.\nConcept Gameplay: Main Menu\nConcept Gameplay: Loading\nConcept Gameplay: Dialogs\nDaedalus OST - Main Theme:\n  \u2022 HARSH EMOTIONAL STORY: Each crewmember of the space station has the unique personality, background, story, desires and fears, friends and enemies on Earth. As one of them, you\u2019ve worked with those people shoulder to shoulder for the last year between the blazing Sun and melting Venus, surrounded by the emptiness of space. With only thirty days left before you head home to Earth, something dark and older than the paleocortex takes your friends one after another. Something more dreadful than death itself, something that now leaks through your nightmares and envelops your reality by devouring everyone and everything that might escape from the station.\n\u2022 REALISTIC HARD SCI-FI ENVIRONMENT: Developed with scientific realism, the Daedalus Space Station represents the latest technologies of the XXII century, the Golden Age of united humanity in the After Reset setting. The environment, equipment, and lore of the game represent the traditions of hard science fiction and an emphasis on scientific accuracy or technical details. Details about the Sun, Venus, spacecraft, and living conditions aboard the space station have been worked out in consult with scientists and NASA's Reddit forum so we can bring you a plausible and realistic version of the future that awaits humanity.\nGENRE: Interactive Movie, Graphic Adventure.\nTARGET PLATFORM: PC (Windows, Linux), Mac OS X. GAME MODE: single-player.\nAtmospherically, it is inspired by: Solaris (by Stanislaw Lem), The Invincible (by Stanislaw Lem), Echopraxia (by Peter Watts), 2001: A Space Odyssey (by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke), The Ego Tunnel (by Thomas Metzinger).\nAt Black Clouds Studios we strive for transparency throughout the development process, and that includes financial data. Below you will find our planned budget for the development of the first chapter of the Daedalus video game. We\u2019ll need roughly $168,879 to do everything we\u2019d like to do, but our initial goal of $55,492 will still allow us to achieve a high quality experience that we think you\u2019ll enjoy. While we\u2019re hoping to meet our stretch goals, our experienced team can handle either funding strategy.\nBUDGET (for the first episode):\nWriting [2ppl]: $5,000\nPainting (~400 arts*$100 + GUI) [4ppl]: $45,000\nProgramming [2ppl]: $8,000\nAudio (music, vfx) [1ppl]: $5,000\nVoiceover [6ppl]: $6,000\nVideo (cinematic) [2ppl]: $4,000\n3D Modelling (6 chars, 16 environments) [studio] = $33,000\nEngine Upgrade: $750\nProject Management (10months) [1ppl] = $10,000\n\u2022 Rough Summary: $116,750\nForce Majeure (20%): $23,350\nKickstarter Project Costs: $9,350\n\u2022 Pre-final Summary: $149,450\nKS/Payments/Bank Fees (13%): $19,429\n\u2022 TOTAL (before taxes) = $168,879\nIf the full costs are estimated at $168,879, WHY are we asking for only $55,492?\nWe\u2019ll need $55k to accomplish our minimum goals and launch this production, but there\u2019s a lot more we\u2019d like to do that will make the game more immersive and enjoyable. We\u2019re also including a financial buffer to pay for unexpected developments and setbacks.\nThough it quite common for Kickstarter campaigns to leverage an initial fund with the hope of future investors, if we are unable to reach our final budget goal with stretch goals then our producer will pay the difference out of pocket. Rest assured that we will not release a buggy and incomplete product if we fall short. Please bear in mind that this budget is for the first episode or chapter of our game, and not the complete title, but your purchase includes all future episodes in this series.\nWhy EXACTLY $55,492?\nMost of you have probably heard about the infamous \u201cPotato Salad\u201d project, a Kickstarter campaign that successfully collected a whopping $55,492 from 6,911 backers just to watch some guy make and eat potato salad. Granted there were t-shirts and social media advertising at play, but ever since that campaign we\u2019ve used that figure as our criteria for our products. If we can\u2019t raise at least that much for a game, then we must be doing something wrong.\nLikewise, if a project takes off and achieves numerous stretch goals, it\u2019s an excellent proof of concept for luring investors and building a franchise. Essentially, this is a tipping point for many developers.\nFrom the budget we derive our estimated development timeline. Delays are always possible and should be expected, but keep in mind that every month of delay only increases our expenses \u2014 we don\u2019t like it either! Still, we believe in delivering a functional and fun product over meeting an arbitrary deadline.\nTIMELINE (for the first episode):\n2016\n\u2022 November \u2013 KS campaign completion; all team members meeting; modelling.\n\u2022 December/January \u2013 scenario workout; team members coaching; modelling.\n2017\n\u2022 February \u2013 animatic and staging; engine modification; GUI/mechanics approving.\n\u2022 March/April/May \u2013 painting; gameplay programming.\n\u2022 June/July/August \u2013 VFX; voiceover; music.\n\u2022 September \u2013 release.\nTOTAL: 10 months.\nEach further episode would take roughly 4 months.\nUsing Telltale\u2019s The Walking Dead video game as a base model for our project, each episode should provide at least 120 minutes of gameplay and 400 scene-arts (roughly 3-5 minutes of gameplay each).\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nAs the Daedalus video game takes place in our vast, hard sci-fi After Reset setting, we would like to keep the atmosphere by giving each goals the names of the lore concepts which are considered in the game.\n1. \u201cPotato Salad\u201d [$55,492 goal] \u2013 this is the basic goal to be reached, an indicator that our backers want to see this project come to life, a sufficient sum for us to proceed with quality development and guarantee the initial episode.\n2. \u201cRydberg Matter\u201d [$131,927 goal] \u2013 this is our estimated final budget that we need to achieve to do everything we want to do and not have to pay for it out of pocket.\n3. \u201cWilliam Molyneux's Problem\u201d [$168,879 goal] \u2013 at this point we feel prepared for anything, except perhaps the apocalypse itself. Our budget is solid and flexible, but there\u2019s a lot more we could do if we had the time and money.\n4. \u201cMethanococcus Maripaludis\u201d [$\u0425\u0425\u0425,\u0425\u0425\u0425 goal] \u2013 for now this goal is a secret, but we look forward to sharing it with you!\n5. \u201cSolipsism Syndrome\u201d [$\u0425\u0425\u0425,\u0425\u0425\u0425 goal] \u2013 Top Secret :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u201cThe best predictor of future behavior - previous behavior.\u201d (c)\n\nBased on our previous experience (posted here and here), you can count on our team to deliver a product.

He pledges to cover any missed funding goals out of pocket to ensure the successful delivery of the product, just as he has done with The Fall of Gyes and After Reset RPG. \n\nDelays, and the expense they incur, are the only significant risk to our project. Our team is experienced, our goals are reasonable, and we feel very confident about this production. \n\nAlso, there will be no Steam Early Access for the Daedalus game, but we will share our progress with you and our alpha build on Kickstarter, in closed update (with NDA), as soon possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Black Cloud Studios\n4 created \u00b7 8 backed\n\"We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.\" Black Cloud Studious\u2122 - independent game developer.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "\"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for the project.\" With your small help, we'll be one step close on our way to a successful sci-fi thriller video game.

This Kickstarter is to help print Issue #0!\nThe Chasing Arrows Issue #1 is also available on this Kickstarter campaign! Issue #1 is also 40 full color pages! They will be signed copies of the first printing (1000).\nHere's an idea of what's included in Issue #0...\nPrelude: Flotsam and Jetsam\nPrologue\n3x Interludes with strange new characters\nEphemera\nHere's an idea of what's to come in The Chasing Arrows series...\nIssue #2 will be Onas's pilot issue (also 40 pages)\nIssue #3 will focus on both Onas and Inara and we will see a lot more character interaction on the atoll.\nMore on the magic system\nEco-friendly shirts!\n      To give you a quick idea of what The Chasing Arrows is think Waterworld meets Wall-E meets a Brandon Sanderson novel.\nThe Chasing Arrows story explores a future where earth has flooded and floating garbage patches, known as middens, cover the seas. The story will follow two main characters, Inara and Onas.\nBoth Inara and Onas are Chasing Arrows, people who scavenge the middens and lead lives of thrift. To be a Chasing Arrow is to follow the Old Codes and The Way of the Arrow. To be a Chasing Arrow is to find use for the useless, to readdress the value of things, and to indeed find trash to be treasure.\nInara and Onas are orphans who live on Kaisei Atoll, a floating island of scrap located in the Trash Belt Doldrums. Onas spends his days diving for scrap on the middens while Inara works as an engineer in the Underbelly of the atoll.\n  \"...feel like the abyss is calling me.\"\n  \"...can't stand crocheting plarn.\"\n  \"...they say he's lost his marbles, but really he's got millions.\"\n  \"...fork and bubble wand divination.\"\n  \"...the secret component.\"\nI started writing The Chasing Arrows in prose. As I was writing it I realized I was spending huge amounts of time world building and writing long winded descriptions (two things that can get a novel writer in trouble). I wanted the story to have really cool magic system too. What I came up with was a system based on color. With all this in mind I realized a graphic novel would work great for this story and give me an excuse to do all the really fun novelty things behind making a story world (writing these long descriptions now as a script for my illustrator, making maps, drawing character sheets, seeing my characters come to life on the page, actually seeing the color of the magic system, and just in general being able to address the novelty book aspect with the story).\nWe're on the 'second' issue now and I'm so excited to keep them coming for you guys and gals. Your support makes this story happen!\nI also think the health of our planet is important! As should we all! My characters fight for this, as I do, and as all the real Chasing Arrows of this world do!\nThe Chasing Arrows is a long-form, character driven story. The first story arc will most likely be 8 issues.\nThe Trash Belt: Made up of floating islands of trash known as middens. The middens circle the Tear in never ending drift. The Trash Belt is modeled after real life trash gyres.\nThe Tear: Asteroid-like landmass jutting from the sea. The Tear flooded the world long ago (this time was known as The Weeping). The Tear is about twice the size of Mount Everest to give an idea of scale. The Tear is at the center of the Inner Circle. The Inner Circle is the densest area of the Trash Belt. Earthquake-like atmosphere (midden-mass constantly shifting). Electrical storms. Serpents. Untraveled by humans.\nThe Himalayan Islands: Some of the last remaining area of dry land. Also known as the Mainland or Roof of the World. The Crescent Empire and rich noble houses reside here.\nKaisei Atoll: Floating island made up of scrap and old boats from the Time Before. Located in the Trash Belt Doldrums. Inara and Onas live here. The Underbelly is the underwater area of the atoll.\nThe Kelp Islands: Islands consisting entirely of mutated kelp. Ever shifting tides here. Rumored to be slave islands controlled by the Crescent Empire.\nThe Coral City: Mutated Great Barrier Reef. Now jutting five hundred feet above sea surface.

We shipped some physical rewards too, which proved very popular.\n\nSo, even though we've done this before, there will always be challenges. We're going to run a larger beta program this time around to catch errors early on, instead of patching the game after release.\n\nWe are actively seeking feedback from backers and fans.

Hailing from Rome, Italy, he is a founding member of the collective SuperAmici studio and BRUTUS/CHIMP Co. He was animation director for the documentary \u201cThe Dark Side of the Sun,\u201d concept artist on the live action sci-fi short film \"The Nostalgist,\" and production designer for both the graphic novel and upcoming live action feature film \u201cMonolith\u201d due for release this year.\nRobot design for The Nostalgist\nWith a passion for music, video games, animation, and film, he has blended all of these inspirations into a unique visual style that mixes line art, painted brushwork, and graphic design. His work sets him apart within a peer group of masters such as Terada, Moebius, Otomo, Bilal, Darrow, Madureira, Steranko, Sienkiewicz, and Stout.\nHe has also applied this talent to storytelling, with a handful of short comic book stories leading up to his first full-length graphic novel, GOLEM, which has been translated into numerous languages to date. It is a 280-page tale filled with sci-fi adventure, futuristic intrigue, political commentary, and spiritual metaphor using the universal archetype of visual storytelling: sequential art.\n GOLEM was published in English by Magnetic Press, who proudly introduced this spectacular visionary work to North American audiences.\n  Being a small, self-funded independent publishing company, Magnetic Press is looking to raise funds to cover the printing costs of what will undoubtedly be a beautiful library edition art book by an emerging, influential artistic figurehead.

Message us with the list of items you are adding to your pledge and we\u2019ll make sure they are added to your reward! Get your Christmas shopping done early!\nNOTE: Add-ons can now be added to your pledge when filling out the survey with BACKERKIT! This will make adding and changing your information easier to track!\nEARLY PLEDGE INCENTIVE!\nWhile we appreciate your interest in following the campaign, what we really need is your financial support. So to encourage you to pledge early, rather than \"star for later\", we're including a LIMITED EDITION 5x7\" textured cardstock print to the first 250 backers at the $30 tier and above.  We will only print 250 of these, just enough for those backers who help us reach our initial goal.\nTHANKS TO YOUR SUPPORT, THESE ARE ALL NOW CLAIMED!\n    Based on previous experience producing books such as this, with actual quotes from vendors, as well as experience running and fulfilling three previous successful Kickstarter campaigns, we're confident that our goal amount will cover what is necessary to print and ship a minimum print run of this book.  Half will go towards fees and fulfillment, with the remainder going towards printing costs.  Should we raise more than our minimum goal, the costs will change, but the proportion will stay roughly the same. \nWhile our original goal will allow us to release the new 120 page softcover edition of this art collection, we have planned a set of stretch goals to further encourage your support, including additional pages (up to 200!) and a premium hardcover edition!This deluxe version will be the same book contents, but wrapped in a lush hardcover casing with a classy ribbon book mark.\nALL GOALS MET! 200 pages and Hardcover for everyone!\n                Magnetic Press was formed in 2014 by Mike Kennedy and Wes Harris, both former publishers at other well-established comic book companies, as an opportunity to showcase amazing artists and creators from around the world who they felt had not yet reached a deserving audience in the US/North America.\nFirst year releases included NAJA, MEKA, and LUMINAE from artist Bengal (who went on to become a frequent contributor at both DC and Marvel, with regular and celebrated contributions to BATGIRL, SUPERGIRL, ALL-NEW WOLVERINE, and most recently SPIDER-GWEN). This was followed by DOOMBOY and A GLANCE BACKWARD by artist Tony Sandoval, who collected Eisner nominations for both titles, as well as a 2016 Eisner nomination for Best Painter/Multimedia Artist. Other extraordinary visual artists introduced by Magnetic Press include Matteo De Longis (VOX), Eisner-nominated Federico Bertolucci (for the LOVE series), Joel Jurion (KLAW), Djet (POET ANDERSON), and Miki Montllo (WARSHIP JOLLY ROGER).\n\"Do backers at the $25 Early Bird tier get the Limited Edition 'first 250' print too?\"\nABSOLUTELY! The first 250 backers at any tier that includes a physical shipment are included! (Sorry digital-only backers... still time to upgrade for yours!)\n\"Why is International shipping so expensive? The shipping is as much as the book alone! It's a lot cheaper to order things on Amazon...\"\nYeah, shipping costs are rough, but that's really the most affordable rate to ship outside the US. Having shipped three other campaigns now, and regularly shipping internationally through our webstore, we've become pretty familiar with all of the options to different countries and the shipping rates that are attached to the tiers are the best we can do without actually losing money (which defeats the purpose of a fundraising campaign)... we've seen dozens, if not hundreds, of other Kickstarters that failed to account for how expensive international shipping really is, and it hurt them. The rates we've attached are genuinely what it costs! In fact, to some territories, it will probably be much more ($60 in some cases!), but we wanted to offer the most fair average rate. Wish we had a better answer or solution, but that's the sad truth of international postage these days. Companies like Amazon not only have warehouses all around the world, but HUGE bulk rates and their own fleet of planes, trains, and automobiles to keep their costs down. Not us, unfortunately.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough Magnetic Press has released a number of well-respected, high-quality, hardcover artbooks and graphic novels, with over 24 releases since our first release in 2014, each project has been funded completely out-of-pocket. We are only two people managing every detail and aspect of the publishing pipeline, from translation to layout to print production, shipping, and distribution, as well as all marketing and PR efforts. It is a time-consuming passion, and we have loads of experience producing excellent, celebrated books, but we are constantly facing the challenge of gathering the funds necessary to put these beautiful projects together.\n\nAll of LRNZ\u2019s content already exists. The only thing preventing this book from going to press is funding the cost of printing and shipment. Should we hit our goal, we will be able to upload to the printer within 2-3 weeks of campaign completion, with books then expected to be in-hand by mid-October. There is very little, outside of unexpected force majeur, that would delay fulfillment past November.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANKS", "descp": "Our eternal gratitude.

Mystery. Science Fiction. Romance. We know these genres from TV and comics and more, but in Genrenauts, each genre is also a world unto itself, inhabited by archetypal characters and filled with the tropes we all know and love.\nWhen stories on these worlds go off-track, you send in the Genrenauts. This team of narrative specialists travels across dimensions to find, analyze, and fix broken stories. If they don't, the ripples manifest as violence and upheaval in our own world (when Science Fiction World goes off-track, scientific innovation stagnates and exploration halts; when Fantasy World goes off-track, xenophobia rises and cultural rifts widen, etc.).\nStand-up comedian Leah Tang is recruited to join the Genrenauts as stories are breaking at a record pace. Will she adapt to the bizarre and dangerous life of a Genrenaut, or will she end up as just another broken story?\nIntroduction\nHi! I'm Michael R. Underwood, an author, podcaster, and publishing professional. I've written seven books across the science fiction & fantasy genres, including the Ree Reyes geeky urban fantasy series (Geekomancy, Celebromancy, Attack the Geek, Hexomancy), weird fantasy superhero novel Shield and Crocus, and supernatural thriller The Younger Gods. You might also know me from Hugo-finalist The Skiffy & Fanty Show, Speculate! The Podcast for Writers, Readers, and Fans, or as the Sales & Marketing Manager at Angry Robot Books. I'm coming to Kickstarter for Genrenauts, a series of science fiction adventure novellas.\n\nSome backstory:\n\nIn November 2015, I launched The Shootout Solution, the first episode in Genrenauts, a science fiction series in novellas. Episode two - The Absconded Ambassador - followed in February of 2016. And in April, Tor.com published \"There Will Always Be a Max,\" a Genrenauts short story.\n\nFor more on the series, here's a video introduction:\n\nThe first two episodes were released with Tor.com Publishing, and they did a great job launching the series and helping get the word out. \n\nBut honestly, I\u2019m champing at the bit to get these stories out to readers. Genrenauts was designed to feel like a weekly TV show or a radio serial, and I want to increase the speed of release to fit that feel. In discussions with Lee Harris, my editor at Tor.com, I realized that they weren\u2019t in a position to publish four more Genrenauts novellas in 2016 in order to get the whole season out this year, so we agreed that I\u2019d go ahead and publish the rest of the season myself. They have been and remain very supportive of the series.\n\nThere Will Always Be a Max - Art by Go\u00f1i Montes\n  Now I\u2019m coming to you, the Wonderful People of the Internet, to ask for your help in continuing the series. All six episodes of Season One are written. Episode 3 is ready to publish, and Episode 4 is in final edits. The cost of publishing these novellas on my own, to the same standard as Tor.com Publishing has set, will be high.\n\nThe Campaign\nTherefore, I\u2019ve decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to fund a Complete Genrenauts Season One Collection, including Episodes 1-6 and special extras (approximately 170,000 words in total). If we succeed, I will be able to publish ebook and paperback editions of the complete first season. And with stretch goals, possibly even audiobooks for Episodes 3-6. The very flexible contract terms with Tor.com Publishing explicitly allow me to publish this collected edition, and I\u2019m really excited to bring it to life. \n\n\nEpisode Guide \nIn Genrenauts, each book is an 'episode,' organized into 'seasons' of six episodes each. Each episode tells its own story, while building a season arc and the overall arc of the series. The series is planned to run five seasons in total. \n\n\nHere's a run-down of season one:\n\nThe Shootout Solution\n  Episode 1 - The Shootout Solution \u2013 Struggling stand-up comic Leah Tang is offered a once-in-a-lifetime chance to join the Genreauts as they head to the Western world to stop a bandit posse on the rampage. But the Western\u2019s hero isn\u2019t interested in winning, and the safety of Earth hangs in the balance\u2026 (Read a free excerpt)\n\n\nThe Absconded Ambassador\n  Episode 2 - The Absconded Ambassador \u2013 When a breach is discovered in Science Fiction World, Leah gets her first taste of space flight. A peace treaty is about to be signed on space station Ahura-3, guaranteeing the end of hostilities between some of the galaxy\u2019s most ferocious races, but when the head architect of the treaty is unexpectedly kidnapped, it\u2019s up to Leah and her new colleagues to save the day. (Read a free excerpt)\n    The Cupid Reconciliation cover\n\nEpisode 3 \u2013 The Cupid Reconciliation \u2013 Wounded Genrenaut Mallery York returns to active duty just in time for the team to deploy to the Romantic Comedy story region. Mallery takes the lead, bringing her expertise to bear as the team plots a grand reunion between two estranged lovers \u2013 hacking social networks, running confidence games, and doing whatever it takes to make sure the story ends in Happily Ever After.\n\nEpisode 4 \u2013 The Substitute Sleuth \u2013 A scouting mission to the Police Procedural region of Crime World becomes a scramble to fill the shoes of detective archetypes in order to solve a pair of nested mysteries. King and Leah become an odd-couple-style pair of detectives. But there's more going on here than a simple crime of passion...\n\nEpisode 5 & 6 \u2013 The Failed Fellowship \u2013 The two-part season finale! Our team travels to Traditional Fantasy-land where the prophesied hero has died just before his moment of triumph. The Genrenauts have to take on the roles of Wizard, Paladin, Bard, and more. They'll need to find a new MacGuffin in order to defeat the Night-Lord before his arcane power brings about an eternal night of terror. In Episode 5, the heroes arrive in the story world and seek the new MacGuffin. In Episode 6, they confront the Night-Lord and uncover a secret with implications across the multiverse.\n\nSome reviews for Genrenauts:\n\n \u201cA clever, exciting, and seriously fun twist on portal fantasy\u2026Sign me up to be a Genrenaut, too!\u201d \n\u2013Delilah S. Dawson, author of the Blud series, Hit, and Wake of Vultures, written as Lila Bowen \n\n\n\u201cI have this sinking feeling that the Genrenauts series, with its raucous meta-commentary upon the stories of pop culture, is going to say important things that I might not be clever enough to catch the first time around because I\u2019m too busy enjoying the books.\u201d \n\u2013Howard Tayler, Hugo Award winner and creator of Schlock Mercenary \n\n \u201c\u2026a rollicking exploration of western tropes, with hints of a larger conspiracy afoot. Underwood has plans for a lot more of these, and I can\u2019t wait to read them.\u201d \n\u2013Joel Cunningham, B&N Sci-Fi & Fantasy Blog \n\n \u201cIn a real sense, [Genrenauts] will help make me a reader more cognizant and aware of conventions and devices in genre fiction, making me a savvier reader for it.\u201d \n-Paul Weimer, SF Signal \n\n \u201c\u2026it\u2019s a heck of a lot of fun the way Galaxy Quest is: a little goofy, a little serious but not taking itself too seriously, and filled with a fondness for the source material that gives it weight without weighing down the story.\u201d \n-Samantha Holloway, New York Journal of Books\n\nBreakdown of costs:\nBreakdown of costs\n34% = Editing - This pays for professional developmental edits, copyedits, and proofing for Episodes 3-6.\n12% = Art & Design-  This pays for the cover art/design for the omnibus.\n25% = Printing- This pays for printing the estimated first batch of print editions to fulfill the campaign.\n16% = Shipping - This pays to ship the physical rewards.\n5% = Formatting & Title Costs - This pays for getting the omnibus set up in retailer systems to sell after the Kickstarter rewards are fulfilled.\n8% = Fees - This covers Kickstarter's portion as well as credit card processing fees.\n\n\nStretch Goals\nUNLOCKED! - 150 Backers - STORY WORLD DOSSIERS \u2013 If we reach 150 backers to the project, I will create a separate ebook (approximately 10,000 words) of genre analyses for the genres visited in season one (Western, Space-based Science Fiction, Romantic Comedy, Odd Couple Police Procedural, and Traditional Fantasy). Each essay will talk about the (sub)genre in question, its thematic and cultural uses on earth, and how I worked it into the Genrenauts universe. All backer levels receiving ebook editions of the Season One omnibus will receive DRM-free copies of the Story World Dossiers.\n\nUNLOCKED - 200 Backers - HARDCOVER EDITION! I've added the SPECIALIST backer level for a signed & numbered limited hardcover of the Season One Omnibus. You can also upgrade your paperback copy to a hardcover - instructions below.\n\nThe following backer levels will automatically get a hardcover edition of the omnibus without needing to upgrade - VETERAN GENRENAUT, NARRATIVE TRAINING, GENRENAUTS CONSULTATION, DINE WITH THE GENRENAUTS, HIGH COUNCIL.\n\n$9,000 - EPISODE THREE AUDIOBOOK \u2013 At this level, we will be able to produce a high-quality audiobook edition of Episode Three \u2013 The Cupid Reconciliation, which will then be made available at audio retailers. We'll bring back acclaimed audiobook performer, puppeteer, and multiple Hugo Award Winner Mary Robinette Kowal, who performed the audiobook for Episodes One and Two, as well as Celebromancy and Attack the Geek from my Ree Reyes series. \n\nMary and her audio producer are excited to continue with Genrenauts, so they're giving me a competitive rate. Like any professionals, they must be paid for their time and expertise, and quality audiobooks are expensive to produce. These stretch goals are the lowest I can reasonably set them, and will include personal investment from me for each - but I really love audio fiction, and want to make these happen.\n\nIf we hit this level, I'll add the audio edition as a new reward level, and a digital copy of the audiobook for Episode 3 will be added to the OPERATIONS backer level and above.\n\n$12,500 - EPISODE FOUR AUDIOBOOK \u2013 At this level, we will be able to pay to record Episode Four \u2013 The Substitute Sleuth, as well. \n\nAs with the first audio goal, backers will be able to pick an audio-only level for all available editions, and audio will be added to the OPERATIONS level and above.\n\n$16,000 - EPISODE FIVE & SIX \u2013 At this level, we'll be able to record The Failed Fellowship, completing the entire season in audio! This will make sure that audio listeners will be able to complete the season. \n\nAs with the first audio goal, backers will be able to pick an audio-only level for all available editions, and audio will be added to the OPERATIONS level and above.\n\n\nWhimsy Goals\nThose that know me may be aware that I am a fan of whimsy. And I am not afraid to be shameless in order to support this campaign. to that end, here are some whimsy goals:\n\nYOUTHFUL EMBARRASSMENT - If the campaign reaches 300 backers, I will record a reading of some of my early fiction, including stories written in college. It will be embarrassing, and it will be awesome.\n\nHAMILTON COVER - If we sell out of the NARRATIVE TRAINING ($250) OR GENRENAUTS CONSULTATION ($500) backer levels during the campaign, I will post a video of me covering \"You\u2019ll be Back\" from the Hamilton musical. Backers will see the video first. If we sell out of both levels, I will cosplay as Balmer King George III for the performance (Balmer King George = Kitschy as hell, because Baltimore)\n\nLIVE-TWEET OF SUFFERING - For every audiobook stretch goal we hit, I will live-tweet a ridiculous SF/F movie. Options include CLASH OF THE TITANS, STARCRASH, and LADYHAWKE. Backers will vote on which movie(s) to watch.\n\nADD-ONS\nSince we hit the 200 backers level, I've made Hardcover editions available. You can adjust your pledge to the SPECIALIST level, or you can modify your pledge to get the hardcover as an add-on instead of your paperback. It will cost $50 per hardcover if you pledged at GENRENAUT or below (Max 3), $25 if you backed at OPERATIONS (Max 1) or $20 per copy upgraded from paperback to HC for GENRENAUTS FIELD OFFICE (Max 5).\n\nInstructions:\n\n1) Press the 'Manage Pledge' button above. If you have not yet backed the project, it will say 'Back This Project.'\n\n2) Increase your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' by the total of the add-ons you want to add.\n\n3) At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned.\n\n\n\nThe Team\nMichael R.

Glow is Mythopoeia\u2019s second comic series after the Kickstarter-supported Skies of Fire. \nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to raise both production and print funds for the creation of Glow #1. We currently have 10 pages already done, but need completion funds to bring the rest of the project to fruition. Any additional funds we raise beyond our goal will go directly towards further issues of the series. \nGlow takes place in a world where magic catalyzed both industrial revolution and nuclear holocaust. Half a millennia ago, an ancient and powerful empire known as Nymera developed a means to channel and store magical energy into a sticky blue substance known as anima, storing them into massive Towers across the world.\nWith the aid of the Towers, the Nymerans brought peace and paradise into the world.\nUntil one day the Towers fell. \nThe story of Glow takes place two hundred years after that cataclysmic event, and follows the story of those who remain.\nPage 01 of Issue One.

In order to flesh out this cornerstone of the story, we've been collaborating with Colm Doyle, an Estonian linguist and enthusiastic conlanger.  \nBesides helping to inform us about the history and culture of the world, we plan on implementing Nymeran in several interesting ways.\nRune scavenging plays a huge role in the world of Glow. Ancient Nymeran technology is constantly bartered and fought over in the Wastes. Simple runes contain just a single character, while more complicated runes are combinations - or phrases - amalgamated together in an intricate design.\nThe rune, phonetic, and translation of a phrase in Nymeran, all created by Colm.\nWe pass along the created runic phrase to Anny, who then creates an intricate, calligraphic runic design for the complete piece:\n    Ray Chou and Vincenzo Ferriero are the writers and creators of Glow.

The book will have mostly black and white drawings sprinkled with red accent colors for characters that begged for extra TLC. I've been working on these pop culture characters for about eighteen months on and off. At first it was just for fun but then it grew into and obsession.  After tabling at a hand full of \"Cons\" and selling hundreds of them - I realized I had to put them in this book.\nIf we reach $25k I'm going to have all 100 characters printed up into a 16\" x 20\" poster of \"Little\". I'll included it in each package from $40 pledge levels and up. It will be folded and fit in with your book(s) and prints like the posters we used to get in magazines back in the day. \nI'm still working on the characters so I'll post updates after the KS is over with new drawings in place of the question marks. \nIf you are pledged at a lower level you can always manage your pledge to a higher level to get the poster if you want it.  \nThis will be my bestest and final stretch goal!. To say thank you to everyone who pledged at the physical reward levels I decided to include these three 8x10 prints in EVERY order if we reach $35K! I'm going to need your help to get the word out - I know we can do it!\n...............................\nI've been illustrating all my life and eventually became a freelance children's book illustrator. I took my passion for creating children's art to the world of pop culture characters. \nThis book will have 120 pages complete with all 100 characters and quotes from each character on the opposite pages. I'll also include rejected ideas, process sketches, and a bit about how I created these images on the iPad Pro and on my Wacom Cintiq monitor. \nBelow are characters that will appear in the book as well as on prints for some of the reward levels. \nEach illustration was drawn at 11x14 at 300dpi so there is a lot of detail reflected in each print.\nAll of my prints are on high quality acid free heavy print stock and all of them fit standard frame sizes: 8x10, 11x14, 18x24. Below is the Star poster framed by my local frame store.\nI will be updating this kickstarter as I complete new characters to reach the finish line of 100 characters total.\nThank you and if you like my project please share it - and please check out more of my work at my website: http://willterry.com/\nHere is a link to my online illustration school at https://svslearn.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI really don't see any problems in finishing this book if successfully funded.

The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\nNew to Girrion? Not to worry! All issues will be available in this campaign.\nGIRRION Book 1 The Chrysalis and the Stone is approximately 200 pages long, and is the first installment of a three-book series. Currently Issue 1- 3 are complete (pages 1 - 78). This Kickstarter is for the production of Issue 4 and 5 (pages 79 -130), but I am including previous books in some of the rewards as well.\nWhy two issues?\nNormally I won't be doing more than one issue per Kickstarter. I'm doing this only because of the way the story plays out. Without spoiling anything, there are some important upcoming scenes and it will be better for the reader to get both of issues at once. I think it would just be more enjoyable. \nFollow the project: \nwebsite: www.girrion.com\ntwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\ninstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\nSamples from Issue 1:\nRewards / Book Format:\nSoftcover books are glossy and have some weight to them. They are not the flimsy thin type like some of the standard comics seen at stores.\nThe interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nLongterm goals (Outside of this campaign)\nMy main goal is of course to finish the graphic novel. This is something I've spent years and years developing and plan to spend many more years to complete. So far I've enjoyed publishing them through Kickstarter so there is no reason to stop.\nI think Girrion would be great for video games and animation as well. Hopefully after the book is complete that is something to look forward to! I've actually already started working with 3D artist on making some character figurines.\nFirst Girrion 3D model (not actual 3D print)\nAdditional Rewards\nAfter selecting a reward tier you can add these options on top of it. Just add the additional amount during the pledge and message me personally to let me know.\n6\" x 9\" Concept art - signed vehicle Illustration on sketch paper (pencil or ink)   $50\nSpecial Thanks\nMusic for animation : Kahan James", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nLearning from the last Kickstarter campaign there were some things I had to learn in terms of submitting art to the book printer. If anything was even a little off with art files, it meant delays. Being that I have more experience dealing with them - there should be less problems this time around.\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected.

All pages have been completed! But I need your help! This Kickstarter is to help print the first issue.\nUpdate!!! - Just posted more stretch goals to unlock - see bottom of campaign page.\nUpdate!!! - I'll have some Issue #0 sample pages to show before this Issue #1 Kickstarter is over. Woohoo!\nCover by Joe Nash\nLove this page! -- Bonus page I promised from the next issue: The Chasing Arrows Issue #0.\nThe Chasing Arrows story explores a future where earth has flooded and floating garbage patches, known as middens, cover the seas. The story will follow two main characters, Inara and Onas.\nBoth Inara and Onas are Chasing Arrows, people who scavenge the middens and lead lives of thrift. To be a Chasing Arrow is to follow the Old Codes and The Way of the Arrow. To be a Chasing Arrow is to find use for the useless, to readdress the value of things, and to indeed find trash to be treasure.\nInara and Onas are orphans who live on Kaisei Atoll, a floating island of scrap located in the Trash Belt Doldrums. Onas spends his days diving for scrap on the middens while Inara works as an engineer in the Underbelly of the atoll.\nOnas\nInara\nI started writing The Chasing Arrows in prose. As I was writing it I realized I was spending huge amounts of time world building and writing long winded descriptions (two things that can get a novel writer in trouble). I wanted the story to have really cool magic system too. What I came up with was a system based on color. With all this in mind I realized a graphic novel would work great for this story and give me an excuse to do all the really fun novelty things behind making a story world (writing these long descriptions now as a script for my illustrator [I'm pretty sure I drive him crazy], making maps, drawing character sheets, seeing my characters come to life on the page, actually seeing the color of the magic system, and just in general being able to address the novelty book aspect with the story). I'm the kind of person who thinks the backmatter in a comic book is so frikkin' awesome.\nI also think the health of our planet is important! As should we all! My characters fight for this, as I do, and as all the real Chasing Arrows of this world do!\nThe Chasing Arrows is an ongoing story. The first story arc will most likely be 8 issues.\nThe Trash Belt: Made up of floating islands of trash known as middens. The middens circle the Tear in never ending drift. The Trash Belt is modeled after real life trash gyres.\nThe Tear: Asteroid-like landmass jutting from the sea. The Tear flooded the world long ago (this time was known as The Weeping). The Tear is about twice the size of Mount Everest to give an idea of scale. The Tear is at the center of the Inner Circle. The Inner Circle is the densest area of the Trash Belt. Earthquake-like atmosphere (midden-mass constantly shifting). Electrical storms. Serpents. Untraveled by humans.\nThe Himalayan Islands: Some of the last remaining area of dry land. Also known as the Mainland or Roof of the World. The Crescent Empire and other rich noble houses reside here.\nKaisei Atoll: Floating island made up of scrap and old boats from the Time Before. Located in the Trash Belt Doldrums. Inara and Onas live here. The Underbelly is the underwater area of the atoll.\nThe Kelp Islands: Islands consisting entirely of mutated kelp. Ever shifting tides here. Rumored to be slave islands controlled by the Crescent Empire.\nThe Coral City: Mutated Great Barrier Reef. Now jutting five hundred feet above sea surface. Inhabited by humans?\nEarly concept of the middens\nEarly concept of the Water Reclamation Facility, Kaisei Atoll\nEarly concept of The Tear\nConcept work (Old Codes and other logo design)\nTommy Miller-Donnelly: Writer\nNeal Anderson: Illustrator - He can also be reached here.\nOther concept work done by:\nNathan Anderson\nJoe Nash\nJohn Miller\nMoko R.\nEmiliano H.

Skies was launched in on Kickstarter and subsequently releases each new issue on the platform. \nThis Kickstarter's goal is to raise funds to print issue #3. Any additional funds will go directly into the production of issue #4 and the reprinting of #1-2. \nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.\nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince.\nHis actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.\nIn Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.\nIssue Three follows the pair as they continue assembling the rest of the crew for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead.\nVincenzo Ferriero and Ray Chou have been creating stories together since 2008. They met in college and continue to collaborate despite being 5,437 miles apart.\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art. His work can be found in publications from Mythopoeia to Marvel to Boom! He recently moved to Valencia where he now draws full time.  \nBryan Valenza is an artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects, including Skies of Fire and Aftershock's InSexts. \nNic J Shaw is a writer, letterer, and graphic designer. His work can be found everywhere - no seriously, Nic seems to know everyone. He lives in Sydney, Australia with his fianc\u00e9e and their schnauzer, Archer. \nJosephe Vandel is a German cartographer and graphic designer with a love for RPGs and creating fictional worlds.\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army.\nPawel Fotek is a self taught artist from Poland who jumped on the art train pretty late, at the age of 21. Since his early years he's always scribbled on the back of his notebooks during most classes. After graduating from high school, Pawel went to study economics at a local university, yet deep inside he felt that it's wasn't something he'd like to pursue in life, and that place was only ensuring him in his beliefs. One cold winter morning he woke up and simply decided to quit the uni and train very hard to become a professional artist. He has not looked back ever since. \nThe Skies of Fire team stands by their policy of transparency when it comes to crowdfunding. The funds for this Kickstarter will be used as follows:\nSkies of Fire is printed in a beautiful 8x11\" oversized format that showcases the incredible talent of our artists. The size harkens to a European aesthetic, reflecting the diverse background of the people working on the project.\n In addition to the story, each issue contains a 3-4 page codex in the back of the book. The codex provides additional background and context to the world much like an old school video game manual or tabletop rulebook.\nThe Aquilan Calendar by Alex Bucur.\nVariant covers give us an opportunity to showcase and collaborate with artists whose work otherwise might not be shown in comics. For issue two, our variant cover is done by the extremely talented Pawel Fotek with letters by Alex Bucur.\nGet your poster copy of the variant with the \"I want you in royal blue\" slogan!\nWe mail our comics bagged and boarded in sturdy chipboard mailers. Chipboard mailers are incredibly durable and almost impossible to bend. They'll keep the comics safe as they're in transit to you while the bags and boards will ensure they'll continue to remain in mint condition for years to come.\nThe rest of our of packaging includes three inch diameter cardboard tubes for posters and cardboard parcel packages for large orders, along with bubble wrap.\n See a closeup of our Poster Prints here. \nTo purchase Add-Ons, simply add the amount in red to your order. Additionally, you may also wait until the end of the campaign and purchase add-ons through BackerKit, where you will be able to select additional a la carte items for purchase after you confirm your shipping information.\nShow your allegiance with a KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE wax seal on your issue today!\nIf you are adding-on a poster print and are based outside of the US, please add the following amount for shipping ONLY IF you do not have any other posters included in your backer reward:\nCanada / Mexico: $10\nUnited Kingdom / EU: $6\nRest of World: $14\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 3rd Kickstarter project and at this point we have a good idea of what to expect before, during, and after the campaign. The main challenge we've faced in our past two is delivery - we strive always to deliver rewards to our backers in a timely manner, and though we've gotten faster each time, there is still room for improvement. \n\nFor this campaign we plan on ordering the books as soon as we have a good guess about the demand, potentially 1-2 weeks in. We also plan on streamlining the logistics for some of our higher-end reward tiers, and are looking into the possibility of a fulfillment service if the demand is great enough. \n\nThe production of issue three is completely done, so the timeline is all about printing and shipping the books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Skies of Fire #4 - Digital Final + Codexes", "update_content": "The Kickstarter for Issue #4 has gone live!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Skies of Fire #4 Kickstarter - Live!", "update_content": "Hey Folks,\nJust a quick update today.

A community based library, where you could watch any movie online. A library where you could swap films with contributors all over the world and discover an infinite number of stories. This is the revolutionary idea behind MovieSwap.\nTo make such a dream come true, we worked on a collaborative and crowdsourced approach. Why? Because during the last 15 years, over 25 billion DVDs were sold worldwide. Those movies are now waiting for a second life and MovieSwap is the solution. \nToday, we're all set... but definitely need your support to make it real. Are you ready to free the movies with us?\nMovieSwap will be a subscription-based service... BUT all of the Kickstarter backers will be considered \"founding members\": they will be granted a 6 months exclusive full access to the early beta version available this summer... and then they will get FREE access to MovieSwap for LIFE. \nMovieSwap will be available on PC, Mac, Android tablets and of course on TV thanks to our HDMI SwapStick.\nIt's simple and fair: It's exactly like in real life, when you trade a book, swap clothes or give an object to a friend. With MovieSwap, you will be able to swap films with any member of the community. You want to watch a movie? Look if the film is available on the online library and swap it instantly in just one click! You don't even need to wait for the other user's approval (he already agreed to make his DVD swappable). It's that simple!\nThe video below shows the actual process (it's just a draft, we're still working on the User Interface):\nPLAY\n\nUsers can choose to either contribute to this Kickstarter campaign and receive some DVDs in their digital library, or send in their physical DVD collections in order to enjoy them or swap them with the community. This process ensures that users are always swapping one DVD for another, thus making the process legal.\nAs MovieSwap is building its library from individuals\u2019 personal collections, there will soon be the largest film choice ever, ranging from mainstream to indie titles.\nAny question? Feel free to ask in the comments section.\n\"Hats off to the MovieSwap team for having the guts to put together something as innovative as this. It\u2019s not only a brilliant use for a dying format but also an excellent way to make use of already-paid-for content that people have lying around their homes. There\u2019s no doubt that the public will absolutely love this service.\" \u2013 TorrentFreak\n\"The campaign is till in its early days too, and will come to a close next month on April 15. So unless something goes drastically wrong, the campaign will be a success.\" - DigitalTrends\n\"MovieSwap on Tuesday launched a Kickstarter campaign (...) backers are promised free access for life after the service first lauches in beta this summer.\" - Variety\n\"MovieSwap says that during the last 15 years, over 25 billion DVDs were sold worldwide with many remaining unwatched. This is why the new service could become the perfect solution.\"   - DailyStar\nMy momma always said, \"Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you gonna get\". Well with MovieSwap you do. Here are the details:\nThe process is quite simple, actually, it's fully based on those good old DVDs, that were sold by billions over the past 15 years... but are now going obsolete :(\nWe already collected over 200,000 DVDs in our warehouse\nBecause people already PAID for them, we invented a fair way to give them a brilliant second life. That's the logistical and technical basis of MovieSwap, which is ready to:\n1. collect millions of DVDs from all over the world\n2. register them on behalf of their owners\n3. put them into the cloud\n4. store them in warehouses\n5. and remotely play them on any device across their personal libraries.\nThis beauty can take care of 300 DVDs/hour, we call it \"The Monster\".\nThen, just like you can legally lend, swap, or offer a DVD to a friend, MovieSwap works in the same way, but on a much larger scale thanks to its remote playback technology. \nAdditionally, users can get the full DVD experience including bonuses, deleted scenes, director's commentaries, and other unique features not available when streaming videos online.\nThe service will be available on PC, Mac, Android tablets and of course on TV thanks to our HDMI SwapStick.\nThe HDMI SwapStick, based on Android 5.\nOur best friend is the famous VLC video player, that has been downloaded over 1 billion times in the world. Just like it allows to read a DVD on any device, it now can read them over the internet. And guess what? VLC was born in France, just like us ;)\nA 15 people team is already behind the project : software engineers, warehousemen, project managers... Here are the leaders of this incredible and passionate team.\n(From left to right: Cyril Barthet, Julien Navas, Chris Navas and David Honnorat)\nThose four bearded friends previously founded Vodkaster, a famous social and disruptive marketplace for French movie buffs.

No information what happened or why. Nothing about you, nothing about your life. You are in a world you don\u2019t remember seeing before at a place forgotten by time and space. Wake up and explore this majestic world that has been waiting of your return so long. \nRemember your being and remember your abilities which are hidden in ancient structures. Structures that will challenge your mind with anomalous puzzles. Wander freely through these lands and beyond to find yourself. And finally discover the truth, the past and the future of places, you never believed would exist...\nESSENCE is a new cross over between an first person exploration and none violent adventure game with metroidvania elements, beautiful landscapes and interwoven open world areas.\nIts as much about exploring the different worlds of ESSENCE and collecting lost fragments of the world as discovering secret places filled with mysterious messages. Also it is about solving puzzles and learning new abilities that help you proceed further on otherwise hidden paths. The further you will go the more possibilities you will have to interact with the world and its surroundings. Every world has its very own theme and therefore is different in color, gameplay and overall feeling. \nThe game has a narration, that will combine classic messages from different characters with a dense environmental storytelling. By uncovering all these places and messages you will experience a story that slowly leads you closer to one much larger conclusion ...\nTo learn more about the gameplay, the look and feel of ESSENCE we have created a first prototype to show roughly our vision for the game. It features a handfull parts of the worlds and some features. When you have pledged, you get instant download access to our prototype (available for Win, Mac, Linux)\nESSENCE will launch on Windows, Mac, Linux ( Steam / DRM Free) and if we reach the early on stretch goal also on Xbox One and PS4 (digital). We also think it is going to be a great experience for Virtual Reality and included VR support in our early on stretch goals too.\nWhile the prototype is only available in English the final game will be localised in several other languages. If no stretch goal is reached we will release ESSENCE in English and German. More languages will be available as subtitles. For more information please check out our stretch goals.\nThe gameplay of ESSENCE has many different aspects. First there is the exploration. Move freely through wide lands and breathtaking blends of nature and surrealism, interact with your surroundings and sense different feelings trought the environment itself.\nThe gameworld is divided into 5 huge core worlds which again have different areas and a couple of smaller sub-worlds which slightly differ in design and style. All worlds are connected with each other and form a huge universe. The core worlds follow the open world principles, which makes it possible for you to move freely through the worlds and explore ESSENCE exactly the way you want.\nHere is another impression of the different worlds that you will discover in ESSENCE.\nWhile playing Essence you will slowly learn more abilities which will help you to continue your journey. The abilities can be used in many different ways and can often open paths or reveal secrets that you have never seen before. Abilities that we are currently working on are floating and flying in some worlds, using a light ball to enlighten your way, freezing and reverting time to rebuild a setting or to create new paths and many more.\nESSENCE is packed with riddles and puzzles. Also every core world contains a huge and unique Puzzle itself that is integrated in the way you play. It might be the solution to a maze, changing gravity, a sound based puzzle or even a specific the way you can activate an item or open a new path.\nSome worlds will try to keep you captive in their sheer infinity, and sometimes you will not notice that you're caught. You will have to use your skills and unusual approaches to escape from these anomalous labyrinths. \nAlong your journey you will encounter enigmatic characters, whose motivations are unknown. You have to figure out who they are and what they want. Some seems to want to help you, but some are trying to keep you away from something.\nAlong your journey you will discover gigantic and abandoned structures. You have to revive the mechanisms of their ancient and sophisticated technology to enter them. Inside these structures it is up to your interpretation what you will discover. \nOf course, the miraculous atmosphere is only possible with an equally fitting music and ambience. We have already worked with our friends Jaye Arcuve and Richard Evans togehter to find the appropriate style for ESSENCE. Please consider this is still a early development stage, but we are looking forward to continue the collaboration and bring you true memorable moments through the soundtrack.\nAlso we have already some music for you that we have produced, here you can get a taste of the atmosphere. (You can also hear these themes in our prototype)\nINCEPTA | SECOND BIRTH\nVAPORA | LOST REMINDER\n VAPORA | ASCENT\nWe want to embed these and other feelings in ESSENCE. We will do everything to evoke those emotions in our players during and after gaming. We want to create a world in where you decide to go first and which will not restrict you, instead it will slowly open itself to you.  \nESSENCE will be a mesmerizing game full of wonder in which you can loose yourself simply by walking through the world, diving deep in a atmosphere, filled with feelings about ancient civilisation, arcane technology and lost philosophy...\nWe dare to start an attempt to bring the games medium in the direction of consummate art, and to endow it with a particular philosophical core point. And only in this way we want to convey our secret conclusion... which is determined out there for the players.  \nBecause our vision goes beyond creating just games...\nAs a little thank you for supporting us we would like to put your name on an in-game monument. The higher pledges will get more prominent places on the monument. The monument world will be playable within the actual game.\nThe world of ESSENCE is populated with spirits. These spirits can rather give useful tips, tell you a short story about their life or tell you a secret. Just as humans every spirit has its own character, voice and name. Once a spirit is found its name will appear on a central monument of the level. Now you can become one of these spirits. You can choose a name, color, shape and short text that the spirit should tell the player (of course the content needs to be appropriate).\nGenerally there are different there are 2 different kinds of spirits. \nthe advising spirit: it lives at a specific place and whispers or talks  to the player once he comes close \nthe companion spirit: it companies the player for a while and might even show him hidden paths. While the spirit is the companion of the player it can say several sentences. While the advising spirit is restricted to a short story or quote.\nBesides the spirit there is also the possibility to become a titan. Titans are giant creatures who rule and protect the world of Essence. If you decide to become a titan we will talk with you about the designs you like and about the image you have of the titan and how it should look like up to the point where you are satisfied with your titan. The titan will of course also have the name of your choice.\nWe are a small indie team of 2 students exploding with ideas beyond the mainstream, we want to enrich the world with unusual, experimental and beautiful games, leaving the gamer with a truly new experience.\nHere is a very brief introduction of ourselves:\nHe is creating and representing the Soul of ESSENCE, building all these worlds, filling life in every corner, creating mysteries and ornamenting huge and little anomalous entities, edifying the gigantic and unknown structures with the ardent desire to fulfill something that you have never seen and felt.\nHe is creating and representing the Heart of ESSENCE, filling the objects and entities with life and a character. He breathes life into the worlds and their riddles with purpose and function, entangled moments into a story in which you're going to immerse. Besides he is providing people constantly with new information and handles the numbers.\nTogether we have been inspired by games like the Zelda series, ICO, the Metroid series and Shadow of the Colossus in early age. Today we are inspired by games like Journey, NaissanceE and The Talos Principle. It has always been our dream to create games like this, and maybe we can even reach another level of those particular kind of games in the future.\nWe are working like 24/7 on ESSSENCE for around 8 months now. But as we love the project and are good friends for a long time already we have a lot of fun while working on game, but this is just the beginning and there is plenty of work to do and new horizions to be discoverd. Our team is very new and ESSENCE is our first bigger game. So there is a certain risk, but as germans and aspiring developer we stand by our word to build up the future of ONEVISION GAMES. \nBefore ESSENCE we have already developed several other little games and prototypes and are thus familiar with the workflow of unity. Alone in the last year we learned a lot, trough working on the game itself and trough the shared experience with other people, and developers. We have improved our efficiency for the next steps of development and achieved many small successes on the way. We are convinced we are on a very good way with ESSENCE.\nHere is a quick overviev how we will split the funding, the numbers may vary slightly over the development but it's nothing special. ;)\n Here we have a rough overview for you how the journey will continue in the coming months, if all goes well. Of course things can change, because in game development something can always get in the way and we will expect some issues to be better prepared. Of course we will always give you updates at first if anything changes!\nINITIAL FUNDING                              [ MARCH ] \nMAIN DEVELOPMENT                      [ MARCH - JULY ] \nALPHA RELEASE FOR BACKERS    [ JULY ] \nsubsequently feedback phase\nSECOND DEVELOPMENT PHASE     [ JULY - SEPTEMBER ] \nBETA RELEASE FOR BACKERS      [ SEPTEMBER ]\nsubsequently feedback phase II\nSENDING REWARDS                         [ OCTOBER ]\nFINAL RELEASE / PUBLIC DEMO    [ OCTOBER / NOVEMBER ]\nPOST UPDATES / FIXES                   [ OCTOBER - DECEMBER ]\nXBOX ONE / PS4 RELEASE              [ DECEMBER / JANUARY ]\nNow we are at the end and we would like to thank you for taking the time and listening to us. \nThen we want to give a thank you to Jaye Arcuve for creating epic music for the gameplay trailer and the official trailer which introduced the first worlds. And Richard Evans for providing a lot of the in-game music and sounds for the prototype, which helped us a lot to enhance the feeling of the prototype and even shaping the vision of ESSENCE further. \nAnd finally a special thanks to our family, our friends, our new backers and of course to our lovely pioniers, which were already with us in our first campaign.

BOYD; I'm a scriptwriter and lover of all things literary since I could write my first letter. I've always had an aspiration to work in film, ever since I was five. This dream led me to get my film degree from Columbia in Chicago and then to work on various tv and film sets  such as \"E.R\", \"The Magnificent Seven\" and various other independent projects. Now, as I grow older I want to obtain one of my deepest dreams to become a Graphic Novelist.\nI have so many stories to tell because I've been writing them since I was little but I wanted to show you one of the biggest, and dearest personal projects I've ever created. I wanted to show you an idea. A thought that became a story and eventually now in my older years has come to life with the help of the amazing up and coming Illustrator MIKE REDMAN, and the editorial assitance and story consulting of Editor M.J. SAAM, known for \"Andrew Jackson in Space\" \"Stronghold\" \"Xenopians\".\nThis sci-fi/horror series chronicles the life of a young, amnesia stricken Amelia as she awakens in the aftermath of the invasion of Earth from a army of beings called the Shriekers - a race that has survived since the beginning of time, bent on consuming all energies of the universe. As Amelia traverses this terrifying apocalypse she will uncover the horror of who she is and find that she has the power inside of her to save what remains of her world - our world. A world where those who remain will now have to survive at any cost - even if it means killing each other. There will be blood, there will be horror; there will be grisly villains at every turn in Amelia\u2019s journey to become our ultimate super heroine. But there is also beauty and hope in the allies she meets, a new family she obtains along her way. \nConcept Art of Futuristic New York\nConcept Art of Futuristic New York #2\nThis project has been constructed in shards piece by piece. I do have bigger plan for it outside of the graphic novel series. So rest assured old fans, no matter what it\u2019s an idea that will never die. Today, however I\u2019m coming to all of you, asking you to join my idea, my story, and it starts with Issue #1: ANTI-ALIASING AWAKENING PT 1 Your help raising $5,830 dollars will bring Issue #1 to life and I will give you exclusive access to every part of its construction from page one to the end. \nCharacter Concepts Illustrated By: Mike Redman\nConcept Character Art By. Mike Redman\nTHE SHRIEKERS\nAs Issue #1 gets under way I want to make sure I keep all of you up to date from start to finish.  In my opinion that means letting all of you in on the ground floor.  I want to give all of you the perspective of the creators.  You'll get to see certain pages in construction, or to better phrase it in processing. \nPreliminary of Page 1 of Issue #1\nIt all starts with A\nThe story of Amelia has been an idea I've had since I was very young. Yes, Amelia is a girl but this was what I\u2019ve always intended her to be. When I was a child I didn\u2019t see people through my eyes. I saw them through words. Through words I saw great beauty but also enormous inequalities. Those that most touched my heart were stories I read about the plight of women. As you\u2019ll see a good portion of my characters in my stories are women, why you ask? Because I still believe what I believed when I was a child. The best stories are yet to be told through the lens of great women, heroines and villains.\nSo, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re asking yourself why should I contribute to this project. I will tell you that you should contribute if you love sci-fi, horror, and drama. You should contribute if you love epic tales with beautiful character development. Ultimately, you should contribute if you want to see a new type of heroine. Characters, that will inspire a new generation of not just women but everyone to hopefully one day reach for the Sky.\nConcept Art of Amelia Sky\n -Message from the Creator-\nI wanted to be absolutely clear on the maturity level of this story. Amelia Sky exist in a very terrifying, gruesome world there will be blood, and gore. The horror that she'll have to see and endure to become a super heroine will be tremendous. The drama that faces Amelia will be very meaningful. The story is my vision of what would happen if there was no more law or order. A reality of an almost extinct human race driven back to the dormant part of humanity, survivalism.

The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\nGIRRION Book 1 The Chrysalis and the Stone is approximately 150 pages long, and is the first installment of a three-book series. Currently Issue 1 and 2 are complete (pages 1 - 52), and Issue 3 (pages 53 - 78) is now in production.

My earliest heroes were Spider-man, the Hulk, Superman, and Batman. Before I could read, I would flip through pages in awe, only having a taste for their words through morning cartoons.\nIn middle school, I became a huge fan of fantasy films and novels, and began creating characters, stories, and a world of my own. My passion for drawing turned into an obsession for writing, and I have spent more than two decades creating the fantasy world where Grinidon takes place. \nI have devoted the last three years to bringing this series to life, and now the time has finally come to release the first volume. This is an absolute work of passion and I am so proud of how far it has come. I have worked with many AMAZING artists, and Erwin's illustrations and enthusiasm are brilliant and inspiring beyond words.\nI thank you for taking the time to view this page and see what we have been up to, and I give you my solemn promise that I will forever reward your time and contributions with a product worthy of that investment.\nThe Story\nGrinidon is an epic saga of kingdoms and factions fighting for control of a newly discovered island, Calaway.  You join the story fifty years into this conflict, after its lords and people have successfully won their independence from their homeland - and now wage war against each other.  \nLords and families from the old lands have risked everything to come here and find their fortune.  Alliances have been formed and broken, guilds and kingdoms have risen and fallen, and heroes have come from the most unlikely of places.  \nIn Volume 1, the southern kingdom of Carnasus is preparing its capital for an attack from the north.  The council has sent word for all those loyal to the realm to aid them, but they know that this is a battle they cannot hope to win. The northern army is impossibly large and their king has taken steps to ensure victory. \nAll appears lost until a figure from Carnasus\u2019 past reemerges - but the slim hope he offers comes with great risk, for he knows a dark secret that must never be told. The council must decide if they will place their lives into the hands of those they cannot trust, or risk annihilation on the battlefield and leave their end to fate.\nTIER ITEMS\nWallpaper\nPrints - 11\" x 17\":\nLaden and Demetrius\nGideon, Alycea, and Veradon\nLoric\nGrinidon \nT-Shirts\nLogo 1\nLogo 2\nAcrylics\nThese may also be personalized with your name, contribution, or a similar message.  \nJade Acrylic: 9\" x 6\"\nGold Acrylic: 7\" x 6\"\nPersonalized Drawing\n Erwin Arroza will sign and send you an 11\"x17\" Original Commission, done in bw pencil with ink wash, complete with certificate of authenticity!\nThis picture will never be recreated in any print or poster, and we will absolutely consider any special requests you may have -  though of course, within reason\nYour Likeness In The Book\n We are offering a limited number of opportunities for your likeness to appear within Volume 1, or to even be a recurring character within the series\nAutographs\nIf you would like your posters autographed by Erwin, and your Issue signed by Erwin and Jeremy, please add $20 to your purchase and we will be happy to do so.  \nWe hate to charge for this, but Erwin is located in the Philippines, so we will have to send everything to him specifically to be signed - but we are more than happy to do so!\nLinks\nFacebook\nTumblr\nTwitter\nInstagram \nMusic Credit: \"Lost Frontier\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\nFrom a recent interview on Moby's - 1/9/2016\nhttp://www.mobys.ws/01/09/interview-with-j-miles-dunn-creator-of-grinidon-a-fantasy-graphic-novel/\nGrinidon is \u2018A Fantasy Graphic Novel\u2019, but what more is it? From what I can tell, Grinidon promises war, adventure, mystery\u2026but there\u2019s more to it than that, isn\u2019t there?\nJ. Miles Dunn \u2013 This is definitely a story with all of those elements, but I can quickly name a few things that may separate it from similar works in this genre.\nOne, I have been working on this story for more than twenty years. This has allowed me to really delve deeply into this world and create a place that truly feels authentic. There are reasons why the people and kingdoms look and behave the way they do, having differing cultures and motivations.\nSecondly, the island where the book takes place, Calaway, has only been settled by humans within the last fifty years. I can talk more about this later, but I love this aspect of the series. You are not just part of a struggle between people and kingdoms; you are in a place with endless opportunities for new discoveries. There are already mysteries that they cannot explain, and many of the answers they find will only create new questions and added dangers.\nThirdly, I would have to say the characters. You can\u2019t have a great story without great characters, and to achieve this, they need to have genuine reasons for why they act the way they do and what has brought them into the situation they are in. Just as with people in our world, Grinidon\u2019s characters have complex backgrounds and personalities, and they continue to evolve through their relationships with other people and the changing world around them. Their actions will have consequences, and the reader will be able to see how these ripple and affect one another.\nThe artwork is truly outstanding and really seems to suit the story you\u2019re telling. Can you tell us about how Erwin came to join the project?\nErwin (Arroza) is such a great person \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t mean that more sincerely. I have been lucky to have worked with many great people along the way, which is an absolute necessity when you\u2019re setting out to do something as involved and demanding as creating a new company and series from the ground up.\nI made the decision to issue a refund to our supporters from a previously successful Kickstarter campaign after Erwin came on board. His style was very different from what we had done before, much darker and grittier, and we had moved away from color and were essentially starting the book over.\nEven though it was the same story, the differences were undeniable, and I wanted our contributors to make the decision whether or not they would support this new approach. Believe me, when you\u2019re in the difficult position of being a start-up company with little money and no revenue coming in, this decision came with a great deal of personal sacrifice.\nI am grateful that it has worked out thus far and that my original artist, Jasmine Monterroso (Kikiface), has passed on her approval and admiration for Erwin\u2019s work. This really meant a lot to me because I know how much this project meant to her, and she was pleased that it was in good hands.\nThe style is eye-catching, and those splash pages showing the landscapes and vistas give the sense that the land, the island of Calaway itself, will play a large role in the tale. Perhaps the land still has many secrets hidden in its valleys and forests?\nThat statement couldn\u2019t be any truer. In a sense, Calaway is a character of its own. It has a history that extends beyond what its inhabitants know, and each race, kingdom and location holds secrets that will continuously come into play. The more the readers come to understand the lore and mysteries of the island, the more they will begin to form opinions of their own as to what things mean and where the story is headed.\nIs Calaway a place of magic?\nMagic is one of the greatest components of Grinidon. The series is actually named after a tower that houses a secret assembly of wizards \u2013 the most powerful magic users in the realm. During the story, you find out who these characters are and why they have come together. Each is very unique in both personality, and how they have chosen to use their power. Some know each other well, others have even been enemies, and one particular wizard of interest is a stranger of completely unknown origin. This makes for a very interesting dynamic and allows the reader to learn more about magic and the realm through the character\u2019s interactions.\nYou\u2019ve spent three years working on turning this story into a graphic novel. What inspired Grinidon?\nWhen I was about thirteen-years-old, I began to slowly piece this world together. I had originally wanted to be an illustrator, but over time, I fell more-and-more in love with writing. I had wanted to try making a novel out of this place I had created but I just couldn\u2019t find the right story to do it. It took about five or six years before I finally came up with an idea that I truly believed in and could really pour myself into.\nUltimately, I found the more I was willing to express myself through my characters, the easier the story became to write. Symptomatically, as I became more personally invested in the story, it also made it much more interesting and meaningful to work on.\nThis is why I am so passionate about this story and project, because it is very much a part of who I am. This has kept me from taking shortcuts in regards to plot and development, and really stay true to my vision and remain loyal to the reader. I hope people are able to identify with these characters and circumstances, and find value and meaning as well as entertainment.\nAs the author, is there anything in particular about the series that you would like the readers to be aware of?\nI think one of the greatest strengths of this series is that since I have written so much of the story already, I have been able to include small clues and various pieces of information in earlier volumes that won\u2019t immediately be obvious \u2013 or even recognizable at all. This was one of the most challenging aspects of writing the books because I had to change so many things throughout the series simultaneously, but the benefit is, as you progress through it, you can reread any of the volumes at any time and see things that you may have missed before. To me, this makes the series infinitely more enjoyable because you will always be finding something new as you revisit it.\n If you have read this far, you have my thanks!

The attached leather strip on the band to push out the card. If you push the card too far, the complete leather strip is visible. Now when you want to slide it back, it gets stuck, because of the small lip at the end of the leather strip.

Now, we're excited to announce Wally Micro: our smallest wallet featuring Wally's signature pull-tab design. And while Micro is super small, he sure isn't small on functionality \u2013 or surprises...\nHere's a quick demo of Micro carrying 1 card + a folded bill, and how Micro expands to carry 10 cards and back down to 1 again:\nAnd did we mention \u2013 Wally Micro is reversible!\nSimply by threading the ribbon through the body, you can easily switch between colors. The only hard part is deciding on which color combo... But no pressure, you don't have to decide until after the Kickstarter is over and we send out a Backer Survey.\nWe've sourced vibrant, vegetable-tanned leather from Italy \u2013 and since Wally Micro is easily reversible, you get twice the beautiful leather:\nThe open sleeve-style construction flexes to hold up to 10 or so cards, as well as folded bills. The reinforced-elastic band means you can carry as few as 1 card snugly in place:\nThe first Wally was actually born on Kickstarter 3 years ago as the iPhone wallet reinvented as a discreet, stick-on leather pocket with pull-tab. Since then, the Wally Wallet family has expanded \u2013 including Wally Bifold, which Slate.com said \"just might be the perfect men's wallet\"!   \nOf course, Wally Bifold isn't perfect for everyone, which is why we designed Wally Micro for those with an even more minimal carry: 1-10 cards and a few folded bills. Wally Micro is:\n+ the ideal front-pocket wallet for the true minimalist\n+ a handy business-card holder\n+ the perfect complement to a Wally iPhone Wallet\n+ and oh yeah, did we mention \u2013 he's reversible?! \nThe Kickstarter community has been the driving force behind our development \u2013 not just of products, but the growth and development of our small business. Nothing compares to the feedback and community involvement here on Kickstarter, so we're back to raise the funds we need to produce Micro!\nDistil Union is a micro-collective of designers who are having fun (and working hard) creating solutions to real-life problems. Our incentive to innovate comes from a deep desire to create objects that people love. \nFor Wally Micro, we're seeking the funding needed to cover the cost of materials and tooling (the leather-cutting dies), to manufacture our first production run to meet minimum quantities, and also cover Kickstarter / credit-card processing fees (up to 10%).

Digital book pledgers will receive the wallpapers)\nWhat is Fall of Gods?\nFall of Gods is an illustrated book inspired by Norse mythology, following Vali, a warrior haunted by his past, but who has found peace in the arms of a woman. For years he has lived far from society, tending to his farm and trying to forget the battles he fought\u2026and the crimes he committed. But one day his love disappears, and he must set out to find her. He will once again have to face the creatures of Jotunheim and the powerful Aesir. Suddenly, the man he thought he had buried deep down inside has risen to the surface once more...and he comes seeking vengeance.\nFall of Gods is all about love for Norse heritage. It\u2019s made with a desire to reinvent the mythology and come up with a new and exiting story that captures the essence of the brutal world within the old north. It unfolds in a fantastic universe inspired by Scandinavian nature, with an epic scale and inherent drama. The book will be anchored by detailed illustrations like the ones you see on this page.\nWho are Rasmus Berggreen and MOOD?\nHello, my name is Rasmus Berggreen. I am a concept designer and a co-founder of the visual development studio, MOOD, located in Copenhagen Denmark. I worked for several years as a concept artist for films and games before taking the leap and starting my own studio with fellow artists Jan Ditlev, Christopher Rabenhorst, and Jonas Springborg. We believe every universe and story can be turned into something unique, that place where story and art meet to make a fantastic experience. As a studio we\u2019ve worked on many different projects, like the Hitman franchise, but this time we thought it would be great to get some of our own original ideas out to the world.\nI have always wanted to make my own interpretation of Norse mythology and make a book written and illustrated with that special Scandinavian tone. I imagine the Norse universe as brutal, dirty, and powerful, and that is what I want to deliver - that full experience where you have been in the dirt with the protagonist. The project started out as an open community on Facebook and then as a published project at Behance, where it was very well received with more than 95,000 views and a lot of appreciations. The support from the community really convinced me that more people would like to see this specific take on the Norse mythology, so that is why I and MOOD are making this project.\nTo make a book stand out you need a great team. Therefore I have teamed up with the lead writer on the Hitman game, Michael Vogt. Michael shares the same passion for the Norse universe as me, and together we will write the saga of Val\u00ed's life. \nDuring the last year I have been focused on the tone and sense of epic scale throughout my illustration work, though I have the full support of our awesome artists here at MOOD if I need an extra hand. This will guarantee that the art will be both of a very high quality and delivered on time. Everything will be in the style you see on this page, with one coherent artistic direction.\nWhat is the final product?\nOur goal with this project is to create the first volume of the adventures of Vali. It will be a hardcover book of approximately 80 pages. Below you can see an example of the layout. Each page will consist of a full color illustration as well as a chapter of the story. There will also be extra illustrations covering the world of Fall of Gods. To me it is important that everything is beautifully presented and of a high quality. To do this, your help is extremely valuable. By becoming a backer, you will get a beautifully illustrated story book, and can even pave the way to ensuring more stories in this epic Norse universe continue. I see this as the beginning for a very cool series about the life of Vali. With your help I will be able to take the needed time to write the story with Michael Vogt, make the full color illustrations, hire help to lay out the book, and ensure high quality print for final deliver.\nProcess\nIf you are interested in my process, you can see a small timelapse video here. I have tried to break down how I usually tackle an illustration. First of all I am focusing on telling the best possible story, before getting into starting the actual painting.\nPLAY\n\nReward breakdown\nADD ONS\nYou can now add the unique 'Fall Of Gods' t-shirt to your reward!

My name's Frank Chimero. I've spent the better part of the last two years writing and speaking on design and thinking about the topics that orbit the practice: storytelling, concept, craft, and improvisation. I want to take all of the ideas I've had and connected these past few months and capture them in a book format.\nI've been teaching for the past 5 years, and I've always been a bit frustrated that there isn't a nice, concise book that overviews the mental state of a successful designer while they go through their creative process. For instance, many say that graphic design is visual communication. A cornerstone of communication is storytelling, and yet you'd be hard-pressed to find any discussion of how to tell stories with design in any design book. This should be remedied.\nThere are new challenges in the world that need to be discussed, and I think design is a prime lens to consider these topics. As our world moves faster and as things become less stable, it becomes more important for individuals to embrace ambiguity, understand paradox, and realize that two things can conflict and still somehow both be true. We must realize that logic doesn't always work, and that sometimes nonsense is the best answer. These are the topics I intend to address in the book.\nThe Shape of Design isn't going to be a text book. The project will be focused on Why instead of How. We have enough How; it's time for a thoughtful analysis of our practice and its characteristics so we can better practice our craft. After reading the book, I want you to look at what you do in a whole new light. Design is more than working for clients.\nBut really, this book aims to look at the mindset and worldview that designing develops in order to answer one big, important question: How can we make things that help all of us live better?\nA Video\nAs I said, these aren't new topics for me. Most of the ideas are already developed. In fact, I've given several lectures on the subject. Fortunately, the good people at the Build Conference in Belfast recorded one of these talks, so I'd like to show it to you. It's also called The Shape of Design. The video is about 40 minutes long, so you might want to come back to it later, but I think it should give you a great idea of how the book will be. I consider this talk the book's little brother, the seed-form of the ideas that will be in The Shape of Design.\nRewards\nSee right for the specifics on how to get each, but here's a bit of a preview:\nThe Book!\nDonor Special Edition Book (with the \"Shape Jacket\")\nMidnight Oil Poster (18x24\")\nPaper Cuts Original Art Pieces by Frank Chimero (previous works, you'd be getting new work)\n\"Shape Art,\" Original Art Pieces by Frank Chimero (previous works, you'd be getting new work)\nThe Artifact\nI love books. If I'm going to write one, I want it to be beautiful, inside and out. My current intentions are to have it be a cloth-bound hardcover book. I'm a designer by trade, so I'll be working hard to have this title be a gem on your bookshelf. I want to be proud of it. I want you to be proud of it too.\nI'm currently planning on the book being between 150 and 200 pages. I'd like not to ramble on. The longer the book becomes, the less impact it has. (And the less likely you are to read it, which is the point of all of this, right?)\neBook\nThere are going to be three digital versions of the book:\nFree, full-content HTML-based web edition of the book optimized for the iPad.\nA \"no-glow\" edition specifically made for the Kindle\nStandards-compliant, open EPUB version for general reading on the iPad and other devices.\nI'll be doing considerable work on how to craft more pleasant reading experiences on all these devices. The same care and attention to detail in the physical book will also be brought to these digital editions. There's no reason the digital version of a good book should be a ghetto.\nFunds\nWhere's this money going? Most of it will be sunk into production costs, and after that a small bit will be used to allow me to focus exclusively on writing for a few months. Additional money is going towards the production the book: things like hiring a professional editor, further refinements on the digital editions, and maybe a few surprises in the print edition as well.\nThanks for your time and consideration!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "The End", "update_content": "Hello,\n\nLong time no speak.

The tattered and gritty signs, scrawls and messages, seemed to be telling a story, creating a narrative for the land and the communities these signs inhabited. I photographed hundreds of signs and lettering throughout the island, in cities and in small towns. The archaic and raw landscape of Sicilian towns and cities juxtaposed with these signs create a wonderful mixture of the new with the old, while showcasing the coarse reality of communication.\nWith my love for typography and photography, I started laying out a book to help narrate the story the signs tell, about communication and Sicily as a modern and historical island of harsh realities and their proud independence.\nI have been color correcting, editing and pacing the pages of the book for the past 3 years. I have written the introduction, edited down the book to 117 pages of full color photographs, and now I am finally ready to go to press with the book! You can take a look at some of the images, and some extras at the book's website http://www.tipografiadisicilia.com\nThis has been a dream of mine to make this project come alive, so others can see the blend of type and environments come together in such a unique place on earth.\nThere are two main aspects to this project which are in need of funding.\nI am looking to produce a limited run of a premium high quality hard cover book. The cost of printing short runs of books is extremely high and my goal is to print 50 books to start. 90% of my funding goal will go to the printing of the book\nThe second part to this which I am currently in the process of doing is finding the venue for an exhibition of selected photographs from the book which all funders will be invited to. This aspect of the project will vary in scale depending on how much I can raise to help pay for the venue.\nThank you for your generous support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "2011 Updates", "update_content": "Thank you all!
