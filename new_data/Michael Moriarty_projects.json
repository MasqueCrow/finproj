[{"backer": "Michael Moriarty", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Do you remember the game from your childhood \"Rock Paper Scissors\"?   \n Well it's is Back! Stronger, Faster, Bolder : \nThe Origin\nRock Paper SlingShot is a table game based on the popular hand game Rock \nPaper Scissors. When we look back to our childhood, that hand game was one of the first game we learn, it was quick, simple and every one know it. Furthermore, you need nothing else then your hand to play it... and there was that catching song! \nWell, it's with the same spirit that we build Rock Paper SlingShot... rest assured there is no catching song...Not Yet!  In Rock Paper Scissors you had 3 signs, each sign beat one and is beaten by the other one. In our table game we add two new signs; Flames & Slingshot. So now, each sign beat 2 and are beaten by 2. Now, to makes thing interesting, we make evolution come along, not once, but twice (Darwin would be so pride!) for each 5 signs. Meaning that the Rock become Boulder and Mud Slide, the SlingShot become Catapult and Noah's Arch (hey! it's all woods), and so long for the other signs. They forms 5 families that share the same family Fonts as well. \nNow we were getting somewhere, but we needed something to keep them in line... \nSo we add 4 Jokers to the mix. We have Tornado, Deluge, Nuclear Bomb and Trump Wall (why not!)\nSo now when someone ask you : what Noah's Arch, the Trump Wall and a flamethrower has in common? You can said Rock Paper SlingShot! \n\nThe Game\nThe aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards before every one else. It's a turn based game. All cards are equally distributed among players. The first player start by putting one or many instance of a card. The next player need to beat it with the same number of card(s), or use a joker, or pass his turn. It's easy, because on each card there is a drawings that indicate which cards you can beat. A six-year-old child can play without the help of an adult, and have good chance of winning too. \n The Spirit\nOur goal was to create a game that is easy to learn and can be played quickly (the game lasts 8 to 15 minutes). The best part, you never know who's going to win, because there are no absolute cards that beat all the others. When you play a joker (the highest ranking card in the game), you can always be beaten by the next player with a lower ranked cards with special power\". Speaking of special cards, there is a very special one in the game: it is a joker with the famous Trump Wall. You can use it to beat your friends, but be careful, several cards of lower rank can destroy it... \n\n For Everyone  \nFor every age group that can enjoy a game that is quick to play and easy to learn. Super simple rules : become a skilled player after just one game!\nSo what is the target audience? Everyone. Really everyone. If you have family, colleagues, friends, you can play with them. If you don't, it's sad... But there is also a solitary mode!\n3 Ways To Play\nFor the people who want more strategies or want to keep score, we add 5 different types of tokens to the game. One for each family of cards ; Rock, Paper Foil, Scissors, Flames, and SlingShot.  \n Play for fun ; No need for tokens, each game has his winner, no need to keep score. \nPlay for points : The first to finish playing all his cards get a token. The one with the most tokens at the end of the night, is the real winner. \nPlay with Strategies : In this mode, each player want to be the first to collect all 5 family token. For that, the player need not only to finish first, but he also need to play his last move with a card(s) of the same family as the token he need to get. So, if you finish with a joker... No token for you!  If you finish with a token you already have, no token for you.\n\nThe Stretch Goals\nThere is 7 stretch goals (cards) to be add to the game :\n1) Trump Wall Joker : You can use it to beat your friends, but be careful, several cards of lower rank can destroy it... It is the less powerful joker in the deck. Goal : 25 000$\n2) Justin Trudeau Selfie : This card add an extra instance to the card(s) your are about to play. Goal : 50 000$\n3) Putin Election : Put this card after someone play multiple cards, and it become the value of only 1 card instance for you to beat. Goal : 75 000$ \n4) Mao's Red Book : With this card you can convince any of you card to become another one (except joker). Goal : 150 000$\n5) Obama Care : When a player play this card everyone must dump one of their cards. Goal : 300 000$\n6) Your name Hacker : With this card you can dump one of your cards just before your turn to play. Goal : if someone take the Pledge \u00abHacker card\u00bb\n7)Your name Challenge : With this card you can challenge someone that just play something hard to beat (except Joker) to beat his own hand. If the challenged player pass, the next player to play is you with a new set of card(s). Goal : if someone take the Pledge \u00abChallenge card\u00bb\n\n The Deck   \nThe set of 64 cards, plus stretch cards.\n\nThe Rewards   \n The Main Creator \nMy name is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e9ron (ok! just call me Jeff). I've study in marketing and used to work in customer service. Trust me when I says; every body wants to have more time on their hands to do the things they loved. Bad news! This game wont help you save time. Ok, it's playable quickly, but you will want to play it again and again.  \n\nRock-Paper-SlingShot is my first game, but I did my homework. I worked on it for the last four years. I took the time to test the gameplay with a lot of peoples from different backgrounds and used their suggestions to improve the game. I am still open to suggestions and I want this game to keep evolving. So by the time you get your copy of Rock-Paper-SlingShot, there will be a section on the game website for you to suggest rules variations to renew the game for the joy of every one. You may event suggest an adaptation of another game to be played with the Rock Paper SlingShot deck. I want you to be a part of this game & love it, as I do. \n\nMy Belief\nI believe that success is measured by the number of lives you have positively touched, even if it is only for the duration of a game. The important thing is to share good times with your loved ones. Have fun & stay safe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce we reach our funding goal, we need to print and package the games fast so they can be in your hands way before Christmas.

After each player has had their turn, the player whose total is nearest 21 wins the game.\nEach turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to \"hold\": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and the game will switch to the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to \"hold\", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

At the end - that means after six rounds - the player with the highest overall score of the six rounds wins!\nEach player in turn throws the dice two times and scores points whenever a double is thrown. Double-6 scores 25 points. A double-3 cancels out a player's score and puts them back to zero. Any double other than a 3 or 6 scores 5 points.

This group primarily consisted of artists known as The Ferus Gang: Moses, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Craig Kaufman, Edward Kienholz, Ken Price, Ed Ruscha, Larry Bell, John Altoon and Wallace Berman. They were the first generation of post-WWII artists who rose to prominence between the years 1957 - 1966 at the Ferus Gallery under owners Walter Hopps and later Irving Blum. Moses\u2019 path to this group began about 10 years earlier with an unlikely encounter.\nMoses had been with the Medical Corps when he was in the Navy. Afterward, he thought he might want to become a doctor, which led to taking pre-med classes at Long Beach City College. But it wasn\u2019t taking. He was having difficulty doing the math and memorizing. Someone suggested he take an art course. They talked about this kind of crazy bohemian guy, Pedro Miller, who ran the art department.\nMoses went to his first art class, where Miller began to discuss copies of C\u00e9zannes, Van Goghs and Picassos that leaned on a shelf around the room. Moses was intrigued. Then Miller set up a still life and said, \u201cNow we\u2019re all going to make a painting.\u201d Moses really wasn\u2019t sure what to do. As Miller came around to each of the students, he knew he had to do something. Sort of out of exasperation, he dipped his fingers in the paint and did this whole thing with his fingers. Miller took that painting up to the head of the class. He put it on an easel, and said, \"I want you all to see something. That\u2019s a real artist.\" Afterward, Moses got a reputation as the talented artist in the group, who they nicknamed Picasso.\nMoses always spoke of this as a defining, pivotal moment in his life, one that opened the possibility of being an artist.\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine today, but there was almost no art scene in the 1950s, except for the burgeoning film industry. There were surfers, Bohemians and beatniks. The Los Angeles Board of Supervisor\u2019s even banned Art Fairs as a form of communism. The powerful New York art scene thought we were just a desert wasteland. Little did they know we were soon to become the Wild West of the art world. That\u2019s when Ferus Gallery and the Cool School came along. Ferus is the latin word for wild. This gallery was located behind Streeter Blair\u2019s antique shop at 736 La Cienega in Los Angeles, an area better known today as West Hollywood. It was on what soon became known as Gallery Row.\nAfter a somewhat circuitous period, Moses enrolled in the graduate art program at UCLA, where he met and became friends with Craig Kaufman. Kaufman introduced Moses to Walter Hopps, who had just opened the Ferus Gallery. Walter put Moses into the first group show at Ferus in 1957, and then offered Moses a solo show at Ferus, comprised of the work that was also to be in Moses\u2019 graduate show at UCLA. This created some small controversy with the faculty, who felt like Moses had crossed some sort of line by showing his work off campus at a commercial gallery. This early recognition led Moses to this group of artists who would become life-long friends and form the core of the emergent contemporary art scene in Los Angles known as The Ferus Gang.\nIn its nine year lifetime, Ferus held important exhibitions for major east coast art stars as well, namely Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd and Frank Stella. Andy Warhol had his first solo show at Ferus in 1962, exhibiting the famous Campbell\u2019s soup cans for the first time. Then there were others on the scene like John Baldessari, Dennis Hopper, Frank Gehry, Joe Goode, Tony Berlant, and feminists artists like Vija Celmins.\nKienholz ran the store during the day and used it as a studio. According to Peter Goulds, Founding Director of LA Louver in his work Kienhholz Before LACMA, Hopps was an autodidact intellectual, very much into art history and had connections with Cubist and Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, contemporary collecting interests and the Arensberg Family Collection, and with the emerging young Los Angeles collectors of that era.\nAfter Hopps and Kienholz parted ways, Ferus Gallery was in the red and changed hands to Irving Blum, who was a smooth personality and groomed Ferus and the LA art scene until the gallery got out of the red. Blum took the gallery from a loose knit group of beatniks and molded them into a competitive and brilliant group of artists that brought about the commercialization of the LA art scene. History says there was much lost and much gained in that process. Blum ran the gallery until its closure in 1966.\nWhat Ed did, his unique path, was very different. He was very iconoclastic, as they all were, but early on he explored mark making to an intense and unusual degree,\u201d said Turner. \u201cIf you look at his early graphite drawings in the sixties, made at a time when pop art imagery, primary color, large bold eye-catching works were taking hold, you see that Moses was headed in a very different direction.\nHe was doing these works on paper with graphite, not using huge amounts of color. But they were remarkable. You can feel the intense pressure of the graphite onto, and into the paper, almost like he was trying to push through to the other side! There is one very well-known series of huge graphite drawings of dense rose patterns, inspired by a tablecloth that he and his wife, Avilda, found when they were in Tijuana. That pattern interested him. You get this sense of curiosity from these pieces, a sense that he was asking, how far could you push that idea and find something that was magical by doing something to an unusual degree, very intensely and with a laser focus.\nA lot of that early work of his seems counterintuitive to that macho bluster that the Ferus Gang had. You had these very intense, very intricate, delicate, monochromatic works on paper that were in some instances somewhat intimate in scale. You can see when you look at the arc of Moses' career, he was really exploring, and pushing through from the familiar to get to another dimension with the material. That became a hallmark of his work throughout the rest of his career \u2013 pushing the possibilities of his materials.\nThe Ferus Gang\n  Ed Moses Foghorn #10 2017\nFerus Gallery 1962", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy big hope with the film is to uncover the true story of Ed Moses and his art and that of the Ferus Gallery. There is also a love story behind Moses, his art and life. The process of unearthing the footage and further interviewing will bring to screen those moments.\n\nOne of the big challenges of this project is a significant portion of the footage is already shot (e.g. prior artists interviews). It is a matter of cataloging and finding out what the footage was shot on. Then we will need to convert the footage to 4K for broadcast. That is a significant portion of the budget.\n\nThen the next challenge will be to further interview other people who knew Ed Moses to continue the story line. \n\nWe have contacts within the art community to help create the secondary necessary footage to make this project happen. \n\nWe also have access to the original footage of Ed Moses in talks with gallery owners and other artists. \n\nWe also have access to Ed Moses' art.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ruptured Media Films\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nKriss Perras is a screenwriter and director.

Well, you may now say hello to the world\u2019s first ever 3-arc electric lighter, and it is rechargeable too.  \n      Brush That Comes With Lighter\n      All available colors Blue, Silver, Gold, Black, Anodized\n      Brush and charger\n    Matchboxes and sticks have been replaced by lighters a while ago because someone was looking out for our pockets and safety while making flames. Now, it is time to perfect the lighter story, and in a bid to do this we came up with our own unique idea to get anyone who still has a \u201clighter budget\u201d to discard it already. The finished prototype of the electric 3-arc lighter is a functional and beautiful piece of hardware.  \n JUST HOW AWESOME IS THE 3-ARC LIGHTER?  \nLifetime investment:  \nA lighter as a lifetime investment is probably unheard of, but the bold 3-arc lighter can only be defined in those terms. The rechargeable feature of the lighter means users can now actually use one lighter for years. Of course, if you want to, but if you do some arithmetic you\u2019ll see just how much you\u2019d be saving if you didn\u2019t buy any of those unreliable lighters monthly.\nSAFETY:  \nMost people do not know this, but unless you are looking to burn something up, you only need flames not fire. The 3-arc lighter is electricity driven and works in a process that involves electricity jumping between set 3 electrodes and producing a dazzling electric arc because the air between both sets of electrodes has now become ionized.  \n This arc is simply beautiful flames forged from electricity, different from the wild fire other basic lighters produce. The 3 arcs of gentle flames are as safer than the uncontrolled flames we have become accustomed to. You can hardly go wrong from pushing a button to start a lighter than scratching on matchboxes.  \nDURABILITY:  \nAll materials featured in the design of the lighter are authentic and newly refined including the prominent zinc alloy.  \nFUNCTIONALITY:  \nAll the most awesome gadgets these days are one touch. The electronic 3-arc lighter matches up in this one touch functionality; it takes just a gentle push of the only button on the device to trigger the lighter and reveal it\u2019s 3 gentle arcs of flame.  \nThe charging system is as simple as can be too, just place the lighter in its charging stand and plug to electricity and watch your investment charge back.  \nDESIGN:  \nThis is where all the ideas come together. The 3-arc lighter does not heat up, lighters that produce fire get hot in little time because the flames pour everywhere and the induction heats up the whole lighter.  \nThis is not only dangerous considering those lighters are highly flammable, it is also not fun to hold a heated lighter. However, the 3-arc lighter stays cool even throughout intense use because it is mere technology producing gentle flames. The cutely designed 3-arc lighter will put some spice to how you light your birthday cake candles or romantic dinner night candles.  \nRECHARGABLE:  \n Making a product that will serve people for pretty much decades was our goal, and in these modern times where electric power is everywhere, a rechargeable lighter cannot go wrong. In 1.5 to 2 hours, you can charge the 450mAh battery of the 3-arc electric lighter.  \nFEATURES:  \nELECTRIC POWERED \n 3-ARCS\n VARIETY OF COLORS\n 450MAH BATTERY\nCOVER IS ZINC ALLOY \nVERY AFFORDABLE PRICE \nUsability:\nThe 3-arc lighters are not just pretty, they can be used in a diversity of applications, for candles, paper, gas cooker, incense and more. Tilting the lighter to awkward degrees doesn\u2019t affect its functionality, so, if you are in a tight spot and you need to light it up, go ahead, it\u2019ll work. \n Waste: \n The only time any waste comes from the 3-arc lighter is if for some reason you must trash it. Otherwise, you do not have to worry about fumes or smoke from burning fuel. \n WHY WE NEED YOUR BACKING? \n The lighter industry is not where a lot of investors turn their attention towards. So, when we finalized the prototype 3-arc lighter, we were confident no one else has this product out there. So together, with your backing we can produce more of the prototype on a commercial scale and get the 3 arc-lighters to people who need them. \n With a little thinking, we figured it\u2019s best to let the people who might appreciate this product do the backing and join in the story.\n WHOLESALE INQUIRIES\n  If you are interested in carrying our product in your online shop, please send us an email to zenlighter1@gmail.com before the end of the campaign.  \nAPPRECIATION\nI would just like to take the time and say thank you to all the backers, and customers.

That\u2019s why I decided to develop Strategic Collaboration\u2026 An Educational Business Game.\nThe initial feedback has been amazing and I am confident that with your support (financial and promotional) we will provide more people, of all backgrounds and ages, with an important tool to compete cost-effectively in the new collaborative economy and help spur the socio-economic development of their community.\u201d\nVictor M Rivera\nReviews on the Strategic Collaboration Workbook for Entrepreneurs:\n 5.0 out of 5 stars\n\"This is a go-to book for any entrepreneur that is looking to create, build and grow a business\"\nBy Vanessa Kings on October 30, 2015 Format: Kindle Edition \n \u201cMany entrepreneurship books that I have read focus on several aspects of being an entrepreneur and how to launch a successful business, such as lean business plans, scale of funding, process, market analysis, strengths and weaknesses, and so on.\nHowever, in \"Strategic Collaboration Workbook for Entrepreneurs: A How-To Guide for finding the Right Collaborators to help grow your Business\", author Victor M. Rivera places the focus on relationships. After all, running a business involves many interactions and what will make or break it are the people. Both customers and partners. So, finding the right collaborators is key to building any business.\nAnother strong point is that the book is not written as a narrative or full of theory, but rather a very practical workbook with easy to follow steps and useful guides that range from assessing business capabilities to determining which strategic collaborators are right for you to tips for creating a Strategic Collaborator Management Manual.\nThis is a go-to book for any entrepreneur that is looking to create, build and grow a business by focusing on collaborative relationships.\u201d\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\"Great resource for entrepreneurs\"\n By A. Martin on August 27, 2015 Format: Kindle Edition|\n\u201cEntrepreneurs advance by collaborating, but there are few guides on what strategies to follow. Rivera bases this guide on his years of experience to help entrepreneurs form lucrative relationships that benefit all involved. The practical steps are clear to guarantee viable outcomes. A must-have in the entrepreneur\u2019s library.\u201d\nDefinition of Collaborative Relationships\n \u201cCollaboration is when two or more persons/businesses with complementary resources, get together to share them to create greater efficiencies and help each other grow their business. Collaborations are generally for specific time periods and resources.\u201d\nWho is the Strategic Collaboration Educational Business Game designed for?\nThe target buyers/users of the game are:\n\u2022 Entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs seeking to learn about forming collaborative business relationships and how to maximize their benefits and minimize risks. \n\u2022 Business Development Organizations can use the game for training their staff and clients on the process of forming collaborative business relationships.\n\u2022 Employers promoting \"intrapreneurship\" at their company. \n\u2022 Parents who detect an entrepreneurial potential in their 16+ aged children.\nHow do you Play and Win?\n1. Start by reviewing contents of the Business Game Manual. \n  2. Fill out Business Game Profile on the Scoreboard. \n3. Select the type of business you will represent from industry cards on the Board. In each game you assume a different collaborator's role in a different industry.\n4. Roll die around the Gameboard until the six elements of your Company Profile on the Scoreboard are identified. These include:\n    a. Type of business seeking collaborator(s).\n    b. Capabilities to be shared.\n    c. Type of collaborative relationship desired.\n    d. Type of potential collaborator.\n    e. Where you will look for them.\n    f.  How you will minimize collaboration risks.\n5. When all players complete their Company Profile, including needs and circumstances, they will simulate a 3-5-minute presentation to a potential collaborator using Guidelines provided in the Game Manual. Sample written presentations will also be provided. Persons can also follow instructions and play by themselves, at their own pace.\n6. It is highly recommended that a video copy of each player's presentation be recorded (using a smart phone or similar device) for review and future comparison purposes. \n7. Players will listen, critique, score, and learn from each other's presentation. \n8. Player with the highest score wins the game. Actually, everyone wins because of the learning experience gained each time they play, assuming different roles in different types of businesses, and collaborative relationships. \nBusiness and Communication Skills you can learn from playing the Game.\nThrough role-playing exercises, players will learn about:\n1. Different needs and capabilities shared in collaborative business relationships.\n\n2. Types of collaborative relationships.  \n3. Types of potential collaborators.\n4. Where to find business collaborators.\n5. Ways to minimize collaboration risk factors.\n6. Ways to monitor a collaborative business relationship  to ensure success.  \n7. Making practice video presentations / elevator pitches to various types of potential collaborator(s) and sharing them via social media for feedback. \nHow long will it take us to complete the project?\n We estimate that 30 days after receiving the pledges via the Kickstarter crowdfunding process, we will begin to distribute the Strategic Collaboration\u2026An Educational Business Game to our project supporters.\nHow much backing do I need to complete the project?\n Financial: We are seeking 205 project supporters who submit pre- order pledges of $49 for each \u201cFirst Edition\u201d copy of the new business game within the next 30 days. The total of $10,000 will cover all pending project completion and U.S. delivery costs.\nPromotional Support: We are especially interested in finding project supporters who also see the many benefits of using collaborative relationships as a strategic business building tool that will contribute to the socio-economic development of their community.                        \nTheir willingness to encourage like-minded friends and families, to join our community of promoters of business collaborative relationships as a means of helping local entrepreneurs start or grow their business faster, will also be greatly appreciated.\n\nProject supporters can easily share this Kickstarter page by pressing the Share button at the top of this presentation.\n How will I use the pre-order funds?\nTogether with existing project funds:\n1. Test and fine-tune the final game product, including instructions, artwork, game pieces, packaging, game delivery costs, etc..\n2. Establish a cost-effective game production and distribution system.\n3. Funds will be used to fulfill all game pre-orders on time.\nHow will I keep in touch with my backers during the campaign and after the game is released?  \nBackers can view weekly informative postings on project status. They can also share ideas on how they can best utilize and help promote collaborative relationships within their business and educational/training communities.\nMy background relevant to the Project.\n I was introduced to the business world when I was 12 years old and worked after school and during summers at my father\u2019s grocery store in Brooklyn, NY, until I graduated from New York University with my degree in Economics.\nMy business development-related experience since then, at the local, state, national, and international level, includes holding senior management positions at the U.S. Small Business Administration (New York District Director, SBA Regional Director for six-states based in Denver,CO; and Senior Advocate, Office of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy; National Director at the Minority Business Development Agency/U.S. Department of Commerce; and headed the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean at the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). This position required U.S. Senate Confirmation.\nHave served as a consultant to investment banking firms, federal and local government agencies, telecommunications firms, and the World Bank.\nMost recently, I\u2019ve focused my services on helping small and medium size firms expand their operations by building collaborative business relationships. Last year, I published an e-Book, \u201cStrategic Collaboration Workbook for Entrepreneurs \u2026a How-To Guide for finding the Right Collaborators to help grow your business\u201d\nI realized recently, that another way of helping persons acquire the know-how on the power of collaborative business relationships was to utilize the principle of \u201cgame-learning\u201d. That\u2019s why I decided to develop Strategic Collaboration\u2026An Educational Business Game.\nThe initial feedback on the concept has been amazing. I am confident that with your timely support we will serve a good purpose by providing aspiring entrepreneurs with an important, and easy to use tool, that will help them quickly learn the basics of forming collaborative business-relationships. This in turn, will enable them to compete cost-effectively in the new collaborative economy.\nYour support in helping to bring this worthwhile educational business game project to life will be greatly appreciated, Just press the Back the Project button at the top of page now.

It has greatly expanded the horizons of individuals who want to develop creative projects and start entrepreneurial ventures. Still, existing crowdfunding platforms, while being great avenues of empowerment, often work under rules that are too strict and which ultimately lead many crowdfunding project authors to fail in their campaigns, or to shy away from getting started in the first place.\nCrowdfunding\nWe believe it is time to create a \"before crowdfunding platform\" \u2013 that people can use while taking their first crowdfunding steps. \nWe noticed 3 interesting things\nA lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family\nFriend and family fund half of all \u201cself-financed entrepreneurs\u201d\nGetting funded by friends and family is expected to be used before using crowdfunding. Indeed, many investors invest in people before they invest in ideas or products. Since they don\u2019t know you, their first integrity check on you as a person is whether your friends and family believe in you strongly enough to give you seed money for your new idea. If they won\u2019t do it, they ask, why would strangers invest in you?\nThat\u2019s why we decided to create Friend Funding, where the chances of feeling shy or failing to crowdfund a project are very low. Through Friend Funding, we will help you in a funny, smart and witty way to fund your projects, starting with your circle of friends and family.\nFriend Funding think of crowdfunding Campaign as a \"\u00a9 digital piggy bank\", that your friends and family can contribute in a funnier and smoother experience.\nThe premise is simple. You reach out to your friends and family, and instead of just asking for a contribution, you ask for a contribution in a fun way, a way that makes the whole seem like a game.\nWe will also offer your friends and your project\u2019s fans badges whenever they contribute, while also offering you points as they support your project.\nBadge Friend-funding.com\nEvery month the top 3 most popular projects which have the most points will receive the Crowdfunding Package (Website creation, logo, advertising for a month, contibution to your Crowdfunding Campaign up to 1500\u20ac and much more...).\nTop 3 project\nFeaturing both a free and an affordable premium subscription for getting funding, crowdfunding project authors will find on our Friend Funding website a crowdfunding avenue that they can easily pursue and that they can successfully use, by understanding its simple rules and letting its structure work for them.\nPlus, Friend Funding\u2019s premium subscription offers a wealth of features that greatly enhance your chances of getting the funding that you need. It includes support from mentors, premium advice, social advertising, design support, brand name support, pitch validation and much more.\nSo this is it! With Friend Funding, you\u2019ll no longer need to feel pressured by all-or-nothing campaigns, or by a crowd of potential backers who knows nothing about you, and whose attention is being fought for by endless crowdfunding initiatives.\nAt Friend Funding, we are creating an even more fun and entertaining method for raising startup capital, a method that will help you reach out to the people most likely to support your campaign.\nYou\u2019ll have a flexible, rewarding, friends and family-based crowdfunding source that can actually work \u2013 just as you want it to.\nSince Friend Funding needs to operate from a technologically smart, safe, user-friendly and dynamic platform, we are seeking to raise 5.000,00 \u20ac to fund its full operational creation, by covering the following expenses:\nThese amounts are for a 3 month development schedule.

Imagine, then, that technician remotely logging in to your computer and fixing the issue for you at the push of a button.\nAt 'The Ready' we make that possible. We connect users with computer technicians over a secure cellphone connection. Using verbal instruction or a remote connection to the computer, technicians troubleshoot the issue together to solve the problem. It's like having a technician on call all the time. \nCreating an App for Technicians and Users\nThe Ready provides easy, at-home assistance with common issues like virus removal, backup assistance, computer optimization, and software configuration. It makes it easier for anyone who needs assistance to have it and anyone who is able to give assistance to give it. \nUnlike other apps, The Ready puts the technician at the center of the solution. By allowing qualified technicians the opportunity to provide tech support from anywhere, we're able to source and qualify many more technicians, with varying levels of expertise. \nFor users, the cost is significantly less than taking their device to a computer shop or having a technician physically visit their house to fix their issue. This lack of overhead allows more money to go directly to the technician. It gives them the opportunity to make money using the skills they already use everyday. \nEmbracing the Future  \nThis platform leverages the experience of seasoned IT technicians to help users anywhere, anytime. It puts them at the push of a button for users who need them. \nService when you want it, where you want it. In today's day, you can access just about anything you need with the push of a button. Car service. Groceries. Lawn care. Childcare. We're bringing this type of service to tech support by creating a quick, easy, secure way for users to connect to technicians.\nAs the number of consumer devices increases over time, so does the cost to maintain those devices. So does the need for a different solution. Get connected to the future of home-based technical support. \nHow it Works\nBoth the user and the tech have the app installed on their mobile device. The user initiates a \"ticket\" in the app, which notifies the right type of tech that there's a user who needs help. The ticket comes with a brief description of the issue. Techs can then accept the incoming call using the app if they are available and feel they can help the user. There is a reasonable per minute fee associated with the call.\nThe User Experience\nMillions of people need tech support everyday, but they don't know where to look, don't want to take their device somewhere and drop it off, or don't want to be routed through a call center. They probably wish they had a tech friend, right? Someone they could pick up and call who would be glad to help them through their issue. The Ready gives qualified technicians the ability to be that tech friend at the touch of a button.\nUsers will carry around the power of infinite technical knowledge in their pockets -- always an instant away from getting an answer or solution to almost any technical issue, simply and efficiently.\nAnd users can rate the techs, creating a user-based rating system visible to other users. \nThe Technician Experience\nAfter development is complete and The Ready officially launches, technicians can join and and earn extra money solving technical issues for everyday users. \nOff work early and want to make a few extra dollars? Turn on the app and be ready. Slow night or weekend? Turn on the app and be ready.\nTechs can work from anywhere there is an internet and phone connection for any length of time they choose.  \nThey'll use their knowledge and experience to build an online reputation through user reviews. \nThe Dream\nThe Ready team has worked diligently to get this app this far, but we need help. We thought there was no better way to raise money for a user-, in-home-based app than to crowdfund to those people who will use the app. Whether you're a technician or a potential user, it's clear to see the benefits of having on-hand tech support. Help us take it to the next step by helping us do the nitty-gritty, technical development. \nWe're at a good spot. We've worked through the model itself, the design and flow of the app, the preliminary legalities, and all that jazz.

Once I obtained my dream job, I realized how close first responders are to the community. A first responder is an employee of an emergency service who is likely to be among the first people to arrive at and assist at the scene of an emergency, such as an accident, natural disaster, or terrorist attack. First responders include police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians.\nI have been to many law enforcement funerals and emergency scenes involving fire department personnel, emergency medical responders and law enforcement. I have been approached by many citizens asking, how they can support their local first responders. I have been trying to find a way to bring together local community support and first responders.\nEarlier this year, I was talking with a good friend, who is a retired police officer and previous fire fighter. During our chat, that\u2019s when this business idea and the community support model began. I was excited to get this idea moving, as I knew this was a great way to bring together the community and first responders. My business plan is to establish a private gourmet coffee brand, Thin Blue Grind, in which coffee consumers could purchase fresh local coffee and 10% of the proceeds would go directly back to the first responder community through non-profit organizations. I want to be the Northern California\u2019s premier coffee supplier. All orders will be donated to the customer\u2019s local community where they reside. As I expand, I want to support the nation through a daily cup of coffee offering \u201cCoffee with a Cause.\u201d\nSince I\u2019ve also always enjoyed my daily cup of coffee before a hard day\u2019s work, I knew I had to build the perfect coffee blend. I roast green coffee beans at home and love the taste of the fresh roast. After doing extensive research and considering all financial aspects, I realized, I need to have my coffee bean roasted at a local commercial coffee roaster. Having my beans roasted close to home, will provide the same quality and freshness I want to offer. This will allow me to provide great quality coffee beans with unlimited distribution potential. This partnership will also allow me to expand and offer other coffee roast as the business grows. I am a firm believer in partnering with other local businesses where I can build close relationships.\nWe are close to launching an online store with local delivery and pickup. We will be selling our House Blend (The Lineup), French Roast (Night Shift) and Light Roast (The Recruit) to launch the business. We also will offer other coffee merchandise with our logo to support first responder awareness in the community. Kickstarter funds will be used to offset and reduce our start up business costs, which includes equipment, packaging, branding, and marketing. This will enable Thin Blue Grind to open our business and donate to local first responder organizations.\nI want the community to know purchasing coffee from the \"Thin Blue Grind\" will make a substantial impact to our community by doing the thing they do every day \"DRINKING COFFEE.\" Thank you and please support the Thin Blue Grind, Coffee with a Cause.   \n\nOur Roasts\n  -SECOND TIER FUNDING-\nWe are thinking BIG here!\nIf we reach our projected goal, we will shoot for the stars. Any money raised over the original goal will go towards bringing \"Thin Blue Grind\" on the road. We have a small family vintage camping trailer that would make a great mobile coffee business. We would build out something like the picture below. It needs some work to make it into a useable mobile business, but would easily be retrofitted. This would allow us to bring my love of coffee, family history, community support along with awareness of our first responders!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur risk is very minimal based on our ability to have freshly roasted product available next day after roasting for pick up or delivery.

Effective preventative measures to help individuals withstand the threats of illness include having suitable footwear together with advice on foot hygiene.\n\n\u2022 Saving the Cost of Medical Bills In developing countries where medical resources are limited, costly, and oftentimes ineffective in curing diseases, for those on little means - medical treatment can financially cripple already-struggling individuals and families. Therefore, preventing illnesses that stem from wounds to the feet can hugely help in preventing needless expenses in the long run.\n\n\u2022 Allowing Access to Work/Education Shoes are often a prerequisite for being allowed into schools or places of work in many developing countries, thus having access to shoes will positively impact one\u2019s prospects in receiving education or securing work.\nBODO Footwear - Infographic\nDonation Sandal Infographic\nBODO Sandal - Light Blue, Ariel Image\n\nEVERY pair of BODO sandals sold will fund a second pair of sandals for someone in recognized need in (initially) South America and the Caribbean.\nThe Barefoot Foundation\nCrafted from recycled tyres\nHow it all began\nBODO Sandal - Construction Image\nBODO Sandal, 1st draft design, Pink\n  BODO Sandal - Concept\n\n\nWhile Peter Lochan, founder of BODO, was on a trip to see family in Trinidad and Tobago, the two-island nation where his parents were born and raised, he was told a story about his late uncle who used scrap tyres to make durable footwear, which helped prevent injuries in the Trinidadian oil fields during the 1960s. Peter, impressed by his uncle's brilliance and ingenuity, began thinking about this concept as a means of recycling the millions of discarded tyres the world over.\nFollowing his trip, two discussions led to the current BODO business model.\nDISCUSSION ONE The first talks focused on the short lifespan of footwear versus the warranty on vehicle tyre tread. Once warranties expire, the majority of the world\u2019s tyres lie in waste dumps. Yet the material from these tyres could be re-used and recycled to make other durable products. A question came to the fore: could footwear made of tyres offer more durability and provide a way of recycling this waste?\nDISCUSSION TWO The next set of talks addressed the inadequacy of footwear amongst people living in poverty and the impact this has on their lives, plus what solutions could be provided from recycled tyres to make comfortable and long-lasting footwear.    \nThe concept behind BODO sandals is not original. The world\u2019s poor and innovative have been making sandals from used tyres since vehicles and roads came into existence. Yet for Peter Lochan, founder of BODO, it seemed an amazing discovery.\nWhat we need\nBODO is inviting YOU, and the rest of the Kickstarter community to be a part of our campaign. The Kickstarter funding will enable BODO to kick-off its public launch by allowing us to do the following:\n1. Complete the manufacture our first run of BODO sandals - including creating and developing our product range (Our products are completed and waiting to be shipped over) \nBODO Sandals - Packed and ready to be shipped.\n2. Create sales and marketing campaigns for customer acquisition\n3. Targeted digital marketing in order to continue to raise awareness of our product within retail and fashion industries\n4. Grow our team by recruiting top quality staff to work alongside the current team.\nWhat have we been doing ?\nBODO, though a young company, is spirited in its endeavours to create a solid foundation for the company so it can thrust its success well into the future.\nIt has already triumphantly achieved vital milestones in forging distinct relationships with key suppliers and partners within its industry, and continues to tirelessly foster these close networks.\nNotable examples of its accomplishments include passing entry requirements and a board to become members of SATRA, an independent research and testing organisation.\nIt has technical facilities in the UK and China serving customers throughout the world. As well as testing products and components to European and international standards across a wide range of industry sectors, SATRA develops, manufactures and sells test equipment. SATRA is a Notified Body for various European directives including personal protection equipment (PPE), which is one of SATRA\u2019s largest sector operations.\nSATRA has its own chemicals analysis laboratory for testing restricted substances in accordance with European REACH, and US chemicals regulations for which it is CPSC-accredited. This was a very crucial step for BODO as its product testing is key to succeeding in its market. BODO will continue this work with SATRA and consider them invaluable to the development of BODO products.\nSatra - Infographic\nThe BODO Sandal - Infographic.2\n\nBODO Sandal - Red\nBODO Sandal - Red\nOur work with the Barefoot Foundation\nBODO has also been successful in negotiating a key contract with The Barefoot Foundation, based in Columbia, to distribute its donation sandals.\nThe Barefoot Foundation, aside from enabling BODO Footwear to distribute its donation sandals to those who need it most, will also open many doors for BODO Footwear in partner networks, and gives BODO an exclusive and accredited edge. It helps BODO move away from normal charity status, and allows their customers to embark on the BODO journey with them\nThe Barefoot Foundation\nWe have been busy...\nOne of the most crucial deals BODO has negotiated and secured is with the UK\u2019s leading footwear distributor, William Lamb Footwear, who have worked with some of the biggest, established footwear brands across the world and currently has a waiting list of customers. They will be involved in manufacturing the donation sandal.\n\nThe firm involvement of William Lamb Footwear speaks volumes about BODO\u2019s potential as a main contender in the market and is testament to BODO\u2019s professionalism, ethos and ability to create and maintain its relationships.\n\nThe sandal soles in BODO\u2019s collection are all made from recycled vehicle tyres, and are heavy on style and comfort.\nbodofootwear.com\nBODO's Key Achievements to Date\n1.

BODO Footwear will work with retailers to maximise sales, and thus donations, rather than working to maximise margins. BODO\u2019s assumption is that as sales grow, low margins will become more profitable as unit production costs fall.\n\u2022 Vigorously promoting BODO Footwear and the work of its partner social projects, through marketing and social media.\nBODO Sandals - Female", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1 - Unable to obtain enough sales distribution or partners lose interest\n\nBODO is working daily to develop these relationships, and already has several interested partners. However, we recognise that distribution must grow in order to increase sales and show donation results. We will not stop at the first few interested parties, but will continue to seek out and approach new partners as we develop. Should the sale of BODO sandals become less interesting to certain partners, we will have a reserve of other partners ready to commit.\n\n2 - Donation organisations\n\nBODO has full commitment from our first donation organisation, Whisper Orphans, and continues to vet others who operate in countries where adequate footwear is in need. Should issues arise with the donation distribution or with any organisation, BODO would be able to act quickly to identify a new distributor.\n\n3 - Loss of manufacturer (due to quality, breach of contract, etc.)\n\nBODO has identified several possibilities for making both the commercial and the donation sandals. Our preferred manufacturer, based in China, has proven the best choice for quality and price. However, since we aspire to find facilities that reduce shipping costs and help local economies, we continue dialoguing with other manufacturers. With these alternative contingencies at hand, if the existing contract were compromised in any way, we would swiftly revert to our backup manufacturer and lose no time.\n\n4 - Quality of either sales or donation sandals not up to standard\n\nThe importance of quality has been addressed with our chosen manufacturer. We will conduct periodic quality control on both sandals in order to determine any issues that need adjustment. We would then quickly be able to address them either with the existing manufacturer, or with a new partner.\n\n5 - Intellectual property infringement\n\nThanks to our expertise in online intellectual property protection, we have implemented a robust online protection plan against potential hackers. As for the sandals themselves, we will continue to conduct periodic assessments of existing and upcoming competitors.\n\n6. Bad press (seen as copying, quality-related, any problems with associated partners)\n\nWe are very active on the Internet, as well as in target markets, and are constantly monitoring media related to our product and our partners.

I am a published author but over the past few years have felt that I want to publish a book with meaning and purpose. And so this project was born.\n In 1994 I started dating a great guy with a wonderful family. I met his Aunt Renee shortly after and she was very quiet and shy. Being developmentally disabled it was hard for me to relate to her at first Over the following years I would see Renee from time to time however she was sheltered and protected by her mother. In 2008 we sadly lost her mom and Renee\u2019s protected and secure world was thrown into turmoil. Being unemployed at the time I took the opportunity to try and help Renee through this time and also to get to know her better. The years have flown by and she is such a joy to be around. Society would consider her not normal but I always chuckle and think society has it backwards. She is more sure of herself and what she wants than I am. This project was actually her idea during one our many overnight outings she said \u201cI wish I could write one.\u201d (a book) And so this project begins.\nIn doing this project I battled with how to go about it. I wanted stories from many people dealing with a variety of disabilities but I wasn't sure how it would be received. I have been overwhelmed by the support and contributions.\nProject Funds Overview (Where will the money go?)\n   Marketing $280.00 - The Marketing funds will be used for promoting the book online and create a website to bring additional awareness.\n   Contributors Gift Book $350.00 -  For contributing and supporting this project we would like to gift each contributor to the book a copy.\n   Publishing Costs for 250 Black and White Books $870.00\nIt would not be possible for this project to happen without the support and guidance of a great many individuals including but not limited to: All the amazing writers, poets and artists who contributed, the Abilities Solution for all of their support and giving my Aunt a home all of these years, the SBTS team who volunteered countless hours going through submissions and every single person with a disability visible to the human eye or not who struggles to be understood and accepted.\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are fortunate to have many submissions coming in.

It's a \"Clash-of-Clans\" type strategy game.\nWe studied more than 25 games of the same type and took the best parts of them and removing what wasn't so cool. So this game should have all the best parts without the frustration encountered sometimes in these kind of games. \n Here are a few of the features of the game: \nPlay without waiting! You won't have to purchase gems to be able to fight as many times as you want !\nCoop Mode : attack hard-to-beat bases with the help of other players and share the loots! Auto-detection of nearby devices to play with your friends !\nSix game modes: Solo and Multiplayer, but also Coop, Arena, Defend and Missions. You will never get bored with this game diversity ! \nTransformable robots : up to 8 heroes assemblies have to be found during Missions. Once you get all the right parts, you can add new transformable heroes to your army ! \nTrade or buy parts on the black market ! \nSteal other players' expansions ! You can win up to 5 subsidiary bases and get many more resources from these expansions! \nBrotherhood : send gifts and exchange resources or even help other members of your corporation ! \nCatch giant monsters when they attack your base and re-use them during your attacks. You can also collect DNA samples and create your own rare monster ! \nStrategy-based attacks : you can beat hard bases if you have a good attack strategy \nRPG elements : you can assign points at each new level! For example increase life points, agility, armour, or even attack range ! Each unit has its built-in characteristics (ground or air unit, melee or shooting, etc) but you can customize each unit as you like ! \nDestroying the headquarter : destroys all the other buildings as they are all linked to the main building. \nAuto Graphic Detection : The first time the game is launched, it automatically lowers graphic complexity according to processing power available so that each gaming experience is fluid no matter what device it's played on.\nBuildings\nGold and Uranium are the two main resources. You can gather and stock them in the appropriate buildings: \nEach building is upgradable : you start at level 1 and when you have enough gold, you can upgrade it . There will be a total of 16 buildings levels for each building\nHeroes\nEach hero will be transformable and upgradable..\nSnowPiercer\nBasilisk\nUnits\nHere are some samples of units. Each unit will be customizable\nthe units will be upgradable infinitely! but it will become harder and harder to upgrade to the next level.\nGiant monsters\nIn the game, you will have the opportunity to catch or to create giant monsters, and use them in battle ! Be careful, because training them is quite a challenge, so they sometimes go berserk and start attacking your own troops. But this is a skill and you can improve it at a point where it will never occur. You can equip them with armors, like a regular human to protect them from damages.\nGodzilla\nHelldog\nKing Kong\nDefense Turrets\nRocket-launcher (terre/air) Ground/air.\nMissiles (air only) Vertical.\nCanons balls can be destroyed by shooting them ! (zone damages).\nLaser (ground).\nLightning strike type that progresses from unit to unit until there is no more power.\nFreeze tower (zone : slow down the units).\nTower that changes the behaviour of one unit by making him attack his own side (only 1 available).\nTower that launch a subterranean wave that makes a group of units jump into the air then crash on the ground (does also damages to buildings nearby).\nTower that sends a ring of fire that damages everything on its path \nRadiating tower that affects only biologic creatures.\nBlack Market   \nA market will be available for the players and will give them useful objects to develop units. The more the building will be developped, the more it will have good items in store (DNAs, armors, speedup bonuses, etc.).\nItem examples :\nExperience points\nHero Experience points\n1 free update (rarely)\nBuilding time speedup\nNew hero part\nMonsters armories\nSalt, mercury and alchemix sulfur\nUranium/gold production speedups\nArmy creation cost rebate\nMonsters genetic code Shields (1 per day with monthly pack)\nRessources\nSelling & buying units   \n Each player will have the opportunity to sell units when they are not online, in exchange for ressources or even gems. This wil allow other players to attack bases otherwise unbeatable by buying stronger units.\nAlchemy laboratory\nAn alchemy laboratory will be available at the fifth level. The player will have the opportunity to gather sulfur, mercury of salt during his missions or buy some on the black market. When the quantity of each ingredient is sufficient, he will have the opportunity to complete a new alchemic work. The final work (iosis) will allow players to produce Alkaest. Alkaest will give opportunity to tranform gold into uranium and vice-versa.\nThere will be a total of 6 game modes\nEach mode brings its uniqueness to the game. Of course there will be the very requested Coop mode to play with your friends (the devices close to you will be automatically detected so you can play with friends easily) !\nAnd of course there will also be Clan Wars and many Events !\nhttp://GlobGlobGames.com\nhttp://Mechapunk.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat will we do with the money?\n The money will be used in 6 main areas:\n 1) programming : I'm a Digital Signal Processing engineer and I am also a programmer so my task will be to gather all the code parts and assemble them in the main program.

GPS, point of sale, maps, weather. Space-enabled data makes our modern life possible. Yet few people know the companies operating the satellites. Fewer still have access to the satellites themselves.\nWeebill wants to change that. \nWhy? Because we now stand on the cusp of a new era of space adventure. Advances in technology and changes in communication are rewriting the rules of the business. \nThe fundamental vision of Weebill is a simple one; we see a future where space becomes easily accessible, affordable and open to all.    \nWe want to spark this movement.\nWeebill\u2019s HyperQube satellite offers the most powerful CubeSat available on the market in an incredibly small 10cm\u00b3 chassis while being readily available to the public for the extraordinary price of $50 000AUD.\nAvailable to all, capable of limitless missions, the HyperQube will be the best orbiting platform for the surging space-enabled data market.* With a new space economy springing up, this unit will be able to conduct a greater variety of tasks than similarly sized, less powerful satellites. \nEarly motherboard prototypes of the HyperQube\nThe HyperQube encrypts incoming and outgoing data with the best in industry standards \u2013 AES-256bit, Serpent 256bit & TwoFish 256bit on all incoming and outgoing data with absolutely no interruption to operations.\nMost satellites have little to no encryption system in place, a worrying trend given the expected growth in orbitals and their applications. With HyperQube, your data will be scanned and encrypted through your browser, which is then sent to our master servers. From there, the data is compressed and encrypted further, making sure it's safe to send. It is then transferred to the ground-stations for transmission. The whole process is fast, easy and safe.\nFunding will allow further testing of shielding and on-board redundancies to ensure smooth operation in space.\nIn the heart of the HyperQube lies 6 Weebill Atom X1 motherboards working together as one, otherwise known as the X6. The Atom X1 is based of the 64bit ARM architecture and has been tested and proven for reliability and low-energy requirements. The X6 features 24-cores at 1.6GHz and 12GB of high-performance DDR3 RAM. That's up to 700GFLOPS of processing power available from a 10cm\u00b3 satellite. Something unheard of until now.\nThe heart of the HyperQube, the Weebill Atom X1 Mark II & III\nThe HyperQube will be powered by atomOS, our non-embedded Linux-based distribution built from the ground up. It provides a hardened operating system built for security, stability and speed. The OS will be released once the HyperQube has flown at least once. Regular security patches will be updated over the air, ensuring the HyperQube will always be the the most secure satellite out there.\nBackers will also receive a copy of the Weebill Ground Control application. Allowing you to check on the satellite's location and status, see the latest images, check on development updates and much more. \nWeebill ATOM X6 ARM CPU - 24 Cores @ 1.6GHz \n12GB DDR3 RAM\nAES - Serpent - TwoFish 256bit encryption on all communications \nNext-Generation S-Band communication systems \n1.2TB SSD \n2x 35mm 13MP 4K Cameras \n1U High Efficiency Solar Panels (28% Efficiency)\nLifetime in space (Without propulsion): 6-12 months. \nEarly prototype of the HyperQube running completely on its internal power.\nThe HyperQube is versatile machine, with an open-ended design that can support a variety of functions both in communication with the ground and autonomously. The CubeSat can be deployed for single purpose or mixed missions. For those who purchase the CubeSat, or obtain time on it as a perk, a HyperQube will allow you to:\nPerform complex calculations and see the results\nAccess the camera for photos and videos\nObtain data from sensors\nConduct scientific research\nSupport games in orbit\nDid we miss something? Send your idea to us and if we can do it, we will!\nAfter successful funding, the Weebill HyperQube will be available to the public from July 2017 on our website for $50 000AUD. \nCompanies are recognizing the wide application of space-enabled data, and consequently, the new commercial uses of space itself. Financial technology start-ups are nibbling into the transaction flows of legacy banks. They are matching lenders with borrowers, distributing pay via mobile phones, and flocking to niches existing banks are prevented from servicing. Weebill represents an early-to-market solution for a domain where regulated banks don't currently dominate. It has the ability to conduct transactions on a highly encrypted platform. As the nature of banking changes and splinters, Weebill will be positioned to service the flow of transactions including Bitcoin and digital currency Hyper Ledger.\nBut the business uses for the HyperQube aren't just limited to banking.  A few others are:\nShort and and medium term off-the-grid and secure data storage\nEncrypted communications\nEvent monitoring (Space weather and Earth weather)\nEarth Remote Sensing (Real-time magnetometer observations, real-time Geiger counter observations and more)\nThe Weebill Atom X1 Mark II\nCurrently, our demonstrator mission can be ready for the launch to Low Earth Orbit with spectrum access available by January 2017. The launch window is between February - July 2017. If Weebill raises the $AUD230,000 needed for the first launch, a powerful new tool will become a reality for the space-faring public. The HyperQube\u2019s applications are limited only by your imagination.\nMy name is Gavrilo \"Gav\" Koncar. I'm the founder of Weebill. I believe that the advances in computing that have revolutionised communication will soon redefine define space, opening up the frontier to individuals in a way unthinkable only a few years before. I believe space activity will soon be in everyone\u2019s hands. Weebill will make that possible. \nWeebill was founded in 2014 with the simple goal of placing an imaging telescope in space. After a few months had passed, we decided that the marketplace for imaging devices was already well-served. But in our design-phase we came upon something: inside the core of the telescope was one of the most powerful motherboards designed for space. Since then we have focused on perfecting the board and making it available on a mass scale, with one core belief; space needs to be open, secure and available to many. \nOur team includes Dr Jason Held as our principle adviser. Jason is a former US Army expert in military space missions. Jason's experience with the Hubble and International Space Station provides Weebill Space Systems with connections to other manufacturers and partners within the industry as well as direct contact to various government organisations.\nOur primary satellite engineer is Dusan Djordjevic, who holds a dual bachelors in Science and Engineering.\nSo, what's in the name? The smallest bird in Australia is the Weebill. It's an extremely nimble creature, fast and more than able to thrive alongside Australia's larger, louder species. Weebill Space Systems is also a native of Australia. We develop our technologies in the same spirit: small, nimble and incredibly effective. All our products are designed and created in Melbourne, Australia.\nMission Control is supplied by Saber Astronautics. The founders represent a wide array of backgrounds and capabilities, combining traditional space engineering, and military space operations. Their engineers helped develop the Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station. Saber is based in Sydney and Denver.\nOur primary rocket launch contractors are AU Aerospace, who specialize in CubeSat launches. They're based in Adelaide.\nThe build of the satellite itself will be in-house here in Melbourne, Australia while extensive testing will occur at UNSW Space Research Facility in Canberra. This will be done multiple times to ensure a maximum chance of success. \nOf the funding sought, $AUD55,000 will be used for the production of the first HyperQube. The launch window (February 2016 - July 2017) is expected to cost $AUD50,000. There is an additional cost of $AUD75,000 for insurance of the launch and $AUD20,000 for mission control by Saber Astronautics. Regulatory changes in Australia may soon favor small satellite launches, which may possibly reduce costs, as well.\nThe same technological progress that has seen computers shrink from room-sized boxes, to desktop units and finally, to smart phones, is now changing space. The space age will finally be in everyone\u2019s reach. Help make Weebill\u2019s HypeQube a reality. Be a part of the future. \n*Subject to any applicable export control restrictions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is the risk radiation interferes with the HyperQube's computing functions. We will test the CubeSats circuitry in space-like conditions at UNSW Canberra before launch. The funding we are seeking will cover the laboratory testing cost needed for maximum assurance of space-readiness.\n\nIt's possible there will be communication problems with the HyperCube, which can lead to a loss of the high-speed communications systems. Our backup UHF system will be in place for this specific situation and can be used to diagnose and restart the communications in full speed.\n\nThe HyperQube could fail to function upon launch. If that happened, it would likely be possible to collect data which could help advance a follow-on mission. In the event that the rocket carrying the HyperQube fails, insurance could reimburse company for the cost - providing funding for a second attempt.\n\nPlease understand that space is extremely difficult and unpredictable in regards to satellites operating.

The story follows Daniel Grey and the events behind the disappearance of his brother and friends. Remote addresses several key themes and important issues in our society, including missing persons, the dangers of social media, addiction, obsession, and the profound impact of deep personal loss. We have assembled a diverse, experienced, passionate team that is both eager and committed to this project.\nThis film is the first chapter in a much larger universe, The Red String Theory. This complex storyline was first conceived of in 2011 by Dakota R. Kuhlman. Dakota founded Exit Reality Entertainment in the summer of 2015, with the goal of bringing Remote and The Red String Theory to a wide audience. Exit Reality Entertainment is a young, dedicated, media production company with the goal of bringing entertaining, original media to film, the web, and print.\nWe are currently in the final stages of pre-production. We have the team, the cast, the screenplay, and the budget. Our team is ready and excited to make the jump to production.\nTHE MOVIE - SYNOPSIS\nRemote is a psychological thriller and independent film with underlying elements of comradery and humor. The story introduces the character Daniel Grey, who is compelled to perform his own investigation after the disappearance of his brother and friends. During this investigation, he discovers a series of disturbing, unsolved cases too similar to be coincidence. Daniel Grey receives a call from Charles Dawson, a realtor, who informs him there may be a link between one of his listings and the missing students. The film reveals the shocking and sometimes hilarious events that take place leading up to the disappearance of Daniel's brother and friends.\nABOUT OUR CAMPAIGN\nOur production budget for Remote is $25,000. By achieving this goal, we can move forward and begin production in early June.\nWe decided the best way to fund Remote is in two iterations: production and post production. We have chosen this approach so we can begin principal filming as soon as possible and to ensure an accurate, post-production budget.\nThis Kickstarter campaign only covers the production stage of this film. If the community likes our project, we hope to cover post-production costs later this year through a second, smaller campaign.\nWe have designed a solid production budget that cuts all possible costs without sacrificing production quality. The Exit Reality Entertainment team has opted-out of any payment for the film - we are not paying ourselves from this campaign. We have diligently polished and reduced our budget to it\u2019s lowest possible level. Our total production costs are approximately $17,000, excluding the cost of running this crowdfunding campaign. Ultimately, there are some costs we simply cannot cut.\nThis is our most ambitious project. However, we believe this story is worth telling and that we can deliver a great film - which is why we\u2019re asking for your help in the development of this film.\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\nOur costs are broken down into nine major categories: equipment, essential personnel, location and legal, craft services, props and set design, hair and makeup, contingency, incentive costs, and crowdfunding fees.\nSome of our costs have been mitigated and delayed. Specifically, we are hiring three essential outside personnel who are willing to delay the bulk of their payment. While we still need to rent or purchase some equipment, we are borrowing what we can from within our network. We are even opting to build our own jib, rails, dolly, frame, slider and other rigs.\nWe have reduced other costs, such as hair, makeup, props, and set design to their bare minimum.\nWe believe we have a realistic, accurate, and frugal budget for this production, and are taking every opportunity to minimize costs, while also ensuring the quality of the film.\nMEET THE TEAM \nWe\u2019ve hand-picked a fantastic, talented team for this project. Our team is both committed and capable of producing a compelling film. We are all very grateful and excited to work on this project.

Over the next several years, we will release a series of films within the larger universe of The Red String Theory.\nThe Red String theory follows the interconnected storylines of several individuals and revolves around the concept of predetermined circumstances. As the characters develop, they all eventually discover they are not there by chance. In fact, they should not be there at all.\nThe Red String Theory follows three families through stories of hidden political agendas, power struggles, military conspiracy, global affairs, and the manipulation and control of human experience.\nEverything you\u2019ve done, everything you believe, is a result of the choices you\u2019ve made in the past. This is the undeniable truth. But is everything you believe a result of actions within your control? Is it possible that the choices you have made - the choices that have brought you down this path to where you are today - were designed and intentionally placed in front of you by an unseen person, one with a hidden agenda? What if every choice you\u2019ve made has been designed and orchestrated. Not predestined, but predetermined, calculated, implemented.\nAfter three generations of these families, three young individuals discover that their very existence is due to events that took place framed within this illusion of choice. As this discovery is made, a dark plot unfolds to transform the entire world that they know into something different.\nThe question remains: if every choice you ever made was predetermined, how can you stop the inevitable?\nOUR REWARDS\nWe thought about our incentives carefully.\nOur incentives are designed to be engaging, to provide additional insight into our characters and story, to give credit where credit is due, and to be unique, handcrafted, and personal.

We put a lot of time and thought into them and would love to hear from you.\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nTHANK YOU for reading about Remote and getting to know us and the scope of this project. This project, like anything worth doing, is difficult, but we are very excited to be a part of it. Remote and The Red String Theory are stories we want to share with the world.\nTo make this movie happen, we just need your support. Everything else in place.\nPlease help support this project by making a Kickstarter contribution on the right side of this page.\nWe can\u2019t do this without you. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS & CHALLENGES\n\nAs with any film production or entrepreneurial endeavor, there is an element of risk - both to the producers and the financiers. There will be challenges we must overcome, some which are expected (and that can be planned for), and others that may arise without notice.\n\nRisk to this project include: underestimating our budget, scheduling conflicts, breach of contract, film delays, conflicts within the team, copyright protection, successful distribution and audience reach, and of course, not achieving our Kickstarter goal.\n\nWe believe our budget is tuned to near perfection, and should sufficiently cover production, with post-production funding to come later. We\u2019ve done our best to factor in the cost of this Kickstarter campaign and all production costs while keeping a modest 10% contingency fund of our budget before factoring in crowdfunding costs.\n\nOther challenges will have to be solved if they arise, and will be mitigated by clear contracts, prudence, good team communication, and advanced planning.\n\nIn examining the risk to you, our supporters, there is the risk of non-delivery, delays in production, and delays in shipping. We believe we\u2019ve taken all possible steps to mitigate these risks.\n\nThis project will be completed.\n\nWe have a team extremely committed to this project, as can be seen in our Kickstarter video. To show our progress, we will post weekly video updates, announcements on our production journal, and social media updates.\n\nWe will monitor and allocate our funds closely to ensure they are spent only where needed and pre-allocated, and that spending is done so frugally. To ensure this, we are requiring approval from two of the following positions: Executive Producer, Operations Manager, and Finance Director.\n\nLastly, there is the risk that our incentives may be delayed. Unfortunately, this is a common issue on crowdfunding platforms. We are taking steps to ensure we meet our projected timeline by planning deadlines for incentive production, setting internal shipping deadlines, developing content-delivery systems, significantly overestimating our delivery dates, and delegating responsibilities.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Exit Reality Entertainment\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nExit Reality Entertainment is a small, media production company, focusing on the creation of film and digital media.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "ANNOUNCEMENT: Our New Campaign", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWe'd like to thank you for backing our project here on Kickstarter.

Dating is already difficult and staying in a relationship is even harder. \nThe #1 dating disaster is being ignored while on a date because someone is twifing (twifing is the act of using social media, e.g., twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, or facebook just to name a few), it makes you feel like a second fiddle to a smartphone. Social media is also a major factor in the increase of divorces.

The object of the game is to purchase stock. The player with the most stock at the time is the boss and controls the game and makes all the decisions that arise during the game.  As the boss you decide peoples' fate, if they should be fired, fined, and any other decisions that need to be made. You manage strikes and negotiate what employees will get or not get. you\u2019re the boss!

We know how frustrating it is to read through a bunch of rules before you can play a game.\nTime Card & Will\nEvery employee must fill out their will and indicate where they want their money and stock to go if you happen to pull the death card! You can leave it all to one player, split it or give it back to the company.  Don't worry if you die; in this game you will have the opportunity to rejoin the game and still can take it all!\nHuman Resources\nStart the game on this spot. You are not automatically hired. You must roll an odd number to get hired and start the game.\nRestroom & Cafeteria\nNo one can leave the game for drinks, snacks, bathroom, etc until someone lands on one of these spots. If you do, you must pay a fine for leaving your work area. \nTraining\nLand here and you can do a training session on anything you want for the boss. If the boss feels like you did a good job, you will be rewarded with a bonus. If not, you get nothing.\nConference Room\nWhen you land here you have the opportunity to meet with the boss and negotiate a pay increase, stock, vacation and sick time. Fight for all you can get!\nStrike\nWhen someone lands here all the players' team up and strike! Take this opportunity to negotiate for more pay, vacation & sick time and possibly more stock.\nLose Stock\nWhen landing here you could lose your position as the boss, or maybe even the game.\nWrite-Up, Achievement and Life Happens Cards\nDrawing on these cards can make or break you in this game. Many of these cards require decision making.  Don't worry, you will not be making them unless you\u2019re the boss.\nVacation Day & Sick Day cards\nEarn as many of these as you can, not having them will result in lost turns which means less opportunities to buy stock.\nExpansion Packs\nTo bring even more excitement to the game we will be developing expansion card packs. The current cards are generic in nature to most jobs. The expansion pack will replace the write-up, achievement and life happens cards. They will be job specific to bring more of a personal experience to the game when you get an expansion pack related to your current job. It would also be fun to try expansion packs for jobs you have never done.

This will make for even more exciting game play.\nWith your generous donation we can finish the printing of the money, stock, game cards, directions, quick start rules and score pads.

From driving down the road to your favorite park to over-indulging in too much coffee. Well, publishing a comic book is no different. Sure there are tangible challenges like will the printer come through, is everything formatted correctly, can this get out on time; but things like that are somewhat controllable. Probably the biggest challenge is questioning yourself. Is this good enough? Will people like it? If it's not funded, is that a testament to how much I suck?

FIND WHERE TO GET IT AT: www.qndgames.com\nSimply the most outrageous fun you\u2019ll have with friends at your next party. It\u2019s an offensively fun card game that rewards quick wits and dirty minds. Suitable for ages 17+, Quick And Dirty is easy to learn and a typical game takes between 10-30 minutes. Players can join and leave at any time and it supports a virtually unlimited amount of players with no slowdown in the game at all!\nIt\u2019s the perfect addition to liven up your next party, games night or pregame. Our game is even small enough to fit in your pocket or purse, so you can easily play it at a bar or take it travelling with you. We even made a waterproof plastic version that\u2019s perfect for the pool, beach, or spilling drinks on! So get some friends together, maybe some drinks too, open Quick And Dirty and let the good times roll\u2026\nA category card and a letter card get flipped over. First to say an answer starting with the letter that fits the category wins the round! Give the round winner the black card to keep score, then flip two new cards to do it all over again. The champion is whoever has the most black cards at the end of the game.\nQuick And Dirty is a social game, there are no strict right or wrong answers and part of the fun is justifying why your answer is correct. A typical game finishes once all the black cards have been played, but you can play for as long, or as little as you like. Because each round comprises both a category card and a letter card, our regular game deck gives you over 1000 unique round combinations to play through, meaning you can play for hours without the game repeating itself.\nWe encourage you to play the game however you like, but you can check out our suggested rules for social or competitive play on our website at: http://www.quickanddirtygames.com/rules \nWe came up with the idea over a year ago. Whenever we had friends over we liked to play games, but we ran into some common issues:\nsome people didn\u2019t know how to play \ngames would slow down with too many players \npeople became distracted\ngames took too long to finish \nnot enough social interaction\nNone of the games we played were quite perfect so we decided to make our own. The result was Quick And Dirty. \nThe original idea started on handwritten scraps of paper. Quick readability was important for a fair game, so we ended up deciding 4 sided cards worked best. We then experimented printing some of our categories onto cardboard at a local print shop, and it was starting to feel like a real game! By now we\u2019d received encouraging feedback from everyone who played and began to think about how we could turn it into an actual polished game.\nWe racked our brains to come up with about 250 potential categories between us, but found that not all of them worked well in the game. To be a good category it had to have a wide range of possible answers, be easily answered with a single word or short phrase, and most of all lead to funny responses! So out of our initial 250 potential categories, only about 1 in 10 would meet our criteria for a good category. We then reached out to writers and paid to have over 500 more potential categories made for us. After thoroughly evaluating all the potential categories and exhaustive playtesting, we came up with the best 42 categories you see in this deck!\nThe many stages of prototypes\nAfter settling on our categories, we then tested a series of different card designs to find which worked best. Everything from the logo shading on the card, to line widths and placement, to the font type used. We worked with printers to get professional prototypes made, including custom storage boxes, prepared graphical instruction cards, formalized the rules, and ended up with something beyond what we ever could have imagined at the start.\n\nThe last phase has been preparing to bring it to market, we had to set up a company, website, and film the Kickstarter video you see here today, as well as determine pricing, costs and the logistics of how we would fulfill a successful Kickstarter. All our hard work has finally come to this and we hope it brings you as much fun as we had creating it!\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve worked with printers and designers over the last year to develop a production ready prototype. After playtesting many iterations and hundreds of categories, the game is now 100% complete and ready to go. In order to bring the game to market we need to commit to a sufficient size production run, which is why we need your help. If we achieve our Kickstarter funding target we can put the game into production and get copies into your hands within weeks of the campaign ending!\nOur cards will be professionally printed 3.5\u201dx3.5\u201d squares with their own custom compact tuck box. Our printers also specialize in Kickstarter fulfillment services and will be assisting us with shipping and fulfillment worldwide, which is how we are able to provide cheap postage to US customers and only a small additional fee for customers worldwide.

We also have friendly shipping to Australia/Canada with no hidden fees.\nBack us today with full confidence that you\u2019ll be enjoying Quick And Dirty in the very near future!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur main risk would be a delay in delivery due to issues at our printing company or delivery networks. In the event of catastrophic issues with our primary printing company, we have an alternate supplier in place and will be able to fulfill orders with only minimal additional delays.\n\nA note for EU customers: in order to facilitate EU friendly shipping and deal with customs and VAT complications we need to use a third party mail forwarding service in Europe.

Battery life is a major problem now that smartphones and other devices are being used to do more and more. EZ SMART SHELF is an innovative solution that offers freedom and convenience with wireless charging technology embedded into our shelf surface. You can wirelessly charge any make, model or manufacturer\u2019s Qi compatible device by simply placing it on top of the EZ SMART SHELF surface. The rate of charge automatically reduces once the battery is full to prevent damage and to extend battery life. The wireless charging unit maintains a safe transfer of power with built-in high voltage and overheating detection. EZ SMART SHELF\u2019s embedded wireless charging technology is UL and FCC Standard Certified for international safety guidelines, and simply plugs into a standard 110 volt wall outlet. International outlets more than likely will require a plug adapter.\nPLAY\n\nEZ SMART SHELF -- A Simple, Safe and Smarter Way to Charge. Inductive charging allows the consumption of electricity to be minimal, providing a low cost, low maintenance surface solution for safe power transfer compared with the traditional cable-based contact method. Wireless charging helps mobile devices become more energy efficient and sustainable while reducing the number of disposable cables and batteries.\nHOW IT WORKS\nSimply place it on the ez Smart Shelf surface.\n1. Place your phone or other compatible electronic device onto the EZ Smart Shelf surface, ensure proper alignment and let the charging begin.\n2. The battery indicator of your device will change to charging status after a good connection is made.\nThe embedded wireless charger is compatible with the Qi universal standard for wireless charging of battery operated mobile devices. Many of today\u2019s cell phones come equipped with Qi compatibility. Older devices that do not have a Qi receiver built in can buy compatible Qi charging receivers to retrofit their phones compatibility. Receiver accessory types consist of a Built In Case, Apple Lightening Plug, Battery Cover, Flip Cover, Receiver Coil (external), Receiver Coil (internal), Universal Android Clip, Universal Dongle, iPhone 5/6 Clip.\nHow Qi Inductive Charging Works\nThe wireless power transfer occurs through electromagnetic induction. With inductive charging, electricity is transmitted wirelessly through the use of electromagnetic fields instead of traditional cables.\nThe principle is simple. The Qi enabled EZ SMART SHELF surface houses a transmitter coil that transfers energy to your phone through a receiver coil. The alternating current in the transmitter generates a magnetic field that resonates with the receiver and induces voltage powering the wireless charging technology.\nRemovable push-button battery operated light\nThe 60 lumens LED Light is powered by (3) AAA batteries (included!), and turns on/off with a simple downward push. The Night Light serves a useful purpose of illumination without leaving your bed. LED bulbs shine bright and are made to last for years. The LED light fits snug inside EZ Smart Shelf and is made for easy removal and reattachment when used as a reading light or flashlight.\nHolds a wide variety of beverages\nThe removable flush-mount recessed drink holder accepts a wide variety of beverages with molded in stand-offs on the bottom of the holder to help prevent condensation build-up and keep containers from sticking to the bottom. Remove the beverage holder to accommodate larger taper shaped cups, mugs, glasses, wine glasses and containers whose top dimensions are 3\" or more in diameter. Receptacles can be used to extend the Smart Shelf\u2019s storage capabilities by allowing personal items and larger items like eye glasses, remote controls, jewelry and various other items to be stored.\nOUR STORY\nIn short, our story is a simple one The President of Smart Shelf invented the product concept from a terrible experience that happened not once, but twice\u2026 With no nightstand in his modest sized room, he used to place his glass of water on the window sill with his phone plugged in on the floor. One night he reached for a glass of water to quench his thirst and accidentally spilled it on the floor, damaging his cell phone. That\u2019s when he decided to get a nightstand. The second time it happened, he reached for a glass of water in the middle of the night -- it spilled and damaged his cell phone along with the items and finish on his nightstand. Each incident was a costly disaster. Out of frustration and the need to correct the problem, an idea was born. Once shared with family and friends, we knew we had a novel idea.\nFor the past year and a half, we have been working with dozens of people perfecting the idea for the perfect solution. It was important to create something effortless to install, easy to use; environmentally friendly; and something convenient and reliable enough to securely keep a phone, and hold a drink in place. The journey has been long perfecting our product, but we wanted to make sure we did everything right. We applied for a patent early last year, and we put a lot of work into designing and building the first prototypes. We recently completed our pre-production runs and our EZ Smart Shelf is now ready for production.\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\nWith your help, we can purchase the needed quantities of raw materials at volume prices and meet the minimum requirements needed to go into production.\nIf you would like to help us achieve our goal, please donate to this campaign.

As many have probably heard or have seen on the news, the city of Flint is dealing with a water crisis that has become well documented on the national news. \nThe Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, United States that started in April 2014. After Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (which was sourced from Lake Huron as well as the Detroit River) to the Flint River (to which officials had failed to apply corrosion inhibitors), its drinking water had a series of problems that culminated with lead contamination, creating a serious public health danger. The corrosive Flint River water caused lead from aging pipes to leach into the water supply, causing extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal. In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead and they may experience a range of serious health problems.[1] The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the county that has killed 10 people and affected another 77.

From a simple idea, the label offers a range of useful and design products for adventurers, travelers, or surfers. We realized that a multifunctional sleeping bag was missing. A design and technical sleeping bag which helps his user to use it with many ways. That\u2019s why we invente the World's Most Functional Sleeping Bag : the Lazysack\u2122. We create a poncho with removable hood, outdoor blanket and a technical sleeping bag. Your contribution will help us to carry on our project in the best conditions. You'll allow our team to carry on Capata Pyrenees to create and offer new colors and products in the future, always in a spirit of adventure and a continuous care of design.\n___\nCapata est avant tout le projet d'une jeune cr\u00e9atrice passionn\u00e9e d'outdoor et des aventures de derni\u00e8re minute. A partir d'une id\u00e9e simple Capata cr\u00e9e des produits utiles et design destin\u00e9s \u00e0 tous les nomades, les voyageurs ou encore les surfeurs. Nous avons r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'il manquait un sac de couchage multi fonctions, m\u00ealant mode et technicit\u00e9, qui permette \u00e0 son utilisateur de s'en servir de diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons. C\u2019est pour cela que nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 l'un des sacs de couchage les plus fonctionnels : le Lazysack\u2122: \u00e0 la fois sac de couchage technique, poncho dot\u00e9 d\u2019une capuche amovible et couverture outdoor. Votre contribution va nous aider \u00e0 poursuivre notre projet dans les meilleures conditions. Vous permettrez \u00e0 notre team de mener \u00e0 bien Capata pour cr\u00e9er et vous proposer dans le futur de nouveaux coloris et produits, toujours dans un esprit d'aventure et un souci design permanent.\nWe follow a real development process to create our Lazysack\u2122. At first, we thought and thought about details, colors and materials which can make the difference and be sure that it will be a make-able sleeping bag. Finally, after doing \u00ab monsters \u00bb we found the good compromise and we made about a lot of samples. We did tests into the wild and approve what we wanted in adequacy with ours values and ours desires : a well thought, design and technical sleeping bag. Our sleeping bag is unisex and made for all heights. \n__\n/X\\   CONCEPT  /X\\\nNous avons suivi un processus de d\u00e9veloppement s\u00e9rieux pour cr\u00e9er notre Lazysack\u2122. Au d\u00e9part, nous avons pens\u00e9 et repens\u00e9 les d\u00e9tails, les coloris et les mati\u00e8res afin de faire toute la diff\u00e9rence et \u00eatre s\u00fbrs de faire un sac de couchage r\u00e9alisable. Finalement, apr\u00e8s fabrication de prototypes \"maison\" nous avons trouv\u00e9 le bon compromis et avons fait des \u00e9chantillons. Nous avons \u00e9galement fait des tests grandeur nature et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ce que nous voulions en ad\u00e9quation avec nos valeurs et nos envies : un sac de couchage bien pens\u00e9, design et technique. Notre sac de couchage est unisexe et est cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour tout type de taille.\nConscious about ecological problems, we choose to produce Eco fabric, to respect the environment. Contrary to ours competitors of sleeping bags, we choose quality superior Premium 210T Polyester. Designed with Durable Water Repellent technology, our Lazysack\u2122 lets water slide on the surface to let the Lazysack\u2122dry. The filling of our Lazysack\u2122 is made of synthetical fiber which allows to be warm because we estimate that even ducks have the right to keep warm ( and keep theirs feathers !) . We called this 3D fiber\u00ab Xwarmfiber \u00bb, a technology which allows to keep the warmth into the Lazysack\u2122 using the best insulator in the market. The comfort temperature is 46 degrees Fahrenheit ; the limit temperature is 39 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature risk is 15 degrees Fahrenheit.  And to be sure you\u2019ll have the biggest comfort during your lazy trip, we added an anti cold flap. To finish we put the best quality zippers to guarantee the better durability of opening and closing possible. \n____\n/X\\   CARACTERISTIQUES  /X\\\nConscients des probl\u00e8mes \u00e9cologiques, nous avons choisi de fabriquer notre Lazysack\u2122 sous le label Eco Fabric, permettant ainsi de respecter l\u2019environnement. Contrairement \u00e0 nos concurrents, nous avons choisi le 210T Polyester Premium de qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure. Con\u00e7u avec la technologie DWR notre Lazysack\u2122 laisse l\u2019eau d\u00e9perler sur sa surface pour laisser le Lazysack\u2122 au sec. L\u2019int\u00e9rieur de notre Lazysack\u2122 est constitu\u00e9 de fibres synth\u00e9tiques qui permettent d\u2019avoir bien chaud car nous estimons que m\u00eame les canards ont le droit d\u2019avoir chaud ( et de garder leurs plumes! ). Nous avons appel\u00e9 cette fibre 3D \u00ab Xwarmfiber \u00bb, une technologie qui permet de conserver la chaleur \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Lazysack\u2122 en utilisant le meilleur isolant existant sur le march\u00e9. La temp\u00e9rature de confort se situe \u00e0 9 degr\u00e9s ; la temp\u00e9rature limite se situe quant \u00e0 elle \u00e0 4 degr\u00e9s et enfin la temp\u00e9rature de risque est \u00e0 -9 degr\u00e9s. Et pour encore plus de chaleur, nous ajoutons un rabat anti-froid afin d\u2019assurer au maximum \u00e0 l\u2019utilisateur un confort absolu. Pour finir nous mettons les meilleurs zips afin de garantir la meilleure long\u00e9vit\u00e9 possible des ouvertures et fermetures.\n                 Our goal is to make our project of Lazysack\u2122, real. It means that we want to offer you the best design and qualitative product. We want you to enjoy a new way to explore the wild with our Lazysack\u2122. If we succeed, you\u2019ll help us to offer new colors and carry on the Capata project.\nStretch goals :\nOur first stretch goal is 15 000 \u20ac to be the campaign a success. In this case, you\u2019ll have the choice between the Royal Blue Lazysack\u2122 or the Black Marble. if we reach 25 000 \u20ac we\u2019ll make a new color : the Tomato Red. If we reach 50 000 \u20ac, the Inca Ritual with its colorful universe and inspired by the traditional poncho will come out. If we reach 100 000 \u20ac, it will be so awesome ! In this case, we\u2019ll make a neutral and timeless color of the Lazysack\u2122 : the Fog Grey! It will be amazing, no? And the icing on the cake, if we reach 150 000 \u20ac we\u2019ll develop the Purple Swell, in the flashy and geometrical spirit of the 90\u2019s.\n____\n/X\\   NOTRE OBJECTIF   /X\\\nNotre objectif est de donner naissance \u00e0 notre projet de Lazysack\u2122.

Unlike most other bags on the market, the 365 hat can sustain the sun, snow, and any weather in between. \nUsing Ballistic Nylon and full grain leather, we were able to give the S+A bag a tough exterior without sacrificing aesthetics.Ballistic nylon is a thick, tough, synthetic nylon fabric used for a variety of applications. Ballistic nylon was originally developed by the DuPont corporation as a material for flak jackets to be worn by World War II airmen. The nylon is ideal for extreme weather conditions and heavy usage.\nThe quality of hardware on any item is crucial to its lifespan. We cut no corners in ensuring that our zippers would last. Everything from the zipper puller to the tape width have been tested to sustain heavy usage.\nWe used TSS to enforce all seams from ever falling apart. The sewing machine sews the first stitch, then it sews over that same stitch twice more before moving on to the second stitch. On the second stitch, it sews three times, then moves on to the third stitch.\nFunctionality\nBad weather can hit us anytime, and protecting our electronics can be a mission. With our unique water proof storage, you can rest easy. Keep your electronics and wallet safe from water damage on the river or in the field with this touchscreen-compatible pocket. This 7.5\" x 7.5\" TPU pouch features a Ziploc-style closure and a Velcro strip along the back, allowing for easy, secure fastening.\nAdd $25 for the 100% cotton S+A t-shirt\nAll logistics are in place to start production in December 2015. January we will be focusing on a very detailed production process. Delivery is scheduled for February 2016. The Sea+Air backpack is made to last you your lifetime, but are backing it up for a decade. If your backpack gets damaged due to construction, send it back and we will replace it. With your early support today, we'll use the funds to begin the production of the Sea+Air Travel collection.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Sea+Air Backpacks are hand made by skilled craftsmen who take pride in their work.

We strongly believe that it is our responsibility to give back to our community in order to create something larger than ourselves. ---As fuel costs rise and people become more aware of the environmental impact involved with car use, bicycle riding has become a more common form of transportation, even on busy streets and highways. Because few cities have designated bike paths or lanes, cyclists must share the road with both small and large motor vehicles; sometimes those vehicles do not pay proper attention to bike riders and engage in unsafe driving habits. Compared to a car or truck driver, bikers have little to no protection if they are involved in an accident. As a result, the injuries a cyclist incurs during a crash, even when wearing a helmet and protective gear, are often more severe than those sustained by motorists. Common bicycle accident injuries include road burn, fractured limbs, head and neck injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and even death. One-third of American workers commute 1-5 miles each way to the office, which is a short enough distance that the number of cyclists may continue to increase. Commuting to work by bike has increased 60 percent in the last decade.\n\nHelp us make save lives and #BeBrighter by supporting our KickStarter campaign!

We are B-My\u2019s Homemade Salsa! Our products are 100% all-natural, completely organic with no preservatives, artificial colors or flavors, and are NON GMO without the use of pesticides! We use the freshest, most local ingredients we can find, and avoid filling our salsa with added water for filler. Our ingredients include all \u201creal\u201d foods; we don\u2019t bother with things like garlic powder or chili powder, we use the real thing! Our deliciously chunky salsa will show you the actual vegetables that were used in the recipe!\nB-My\u2019s started shortly after I became a first-time home owner, most importantly, with my very own garden! I was blessed with a bumper crop that year, and had 2 dozen habanero peppers left over at the end of the season. Not wanting them to go to waste, I created my own salsa recipe and began canning my top-secret salsa for friends and family. Everyone agreed this was better than any salsa on the market, and that I\u2019d be a fool not to sell it! And so, B-My\u2019s Homemade Salsa was born!\nWe have already had a super successful campaign for our first batch of homemade salsa, and are ready to give it another go with this season\u2019s crop!\nImpact:\nEveryone wants to eat healthy, and as sustainably as possible. But with store-bought products, you can never really be sure what\u2019s going into your food! At B-My\u2019s Homemade Salsa, we pride ourselves in being completely, 100% organic, with locally sourced ingredients and no filler, dried spices, or anything else getting in the way of delicious, spicy flavor!\nWhat We Need:\nWe are seeking a minimum funding amount of $500 to be used to purchase a mega quantity of 16 oz jars, at a reasonable price, to be used for our winning salsa products. We are also planning on purchasing a higher-end color labeling machine so we can upgrade our label designs, with the next goal of getting our salsa into retail stores! If we are able to raise enough, our stretch goal will help us rent a commercial kitchen, and ultimately purchase a plot of land so we can make this enterprise a 100% self-sustaining and growing process!\nWhat kinds of salsas will we have available right away?\nRegular Salsa (no spice, just awesome salsa)\nMild Salsa (A little bit of spice, but not overwhelming)\nJalapeno Salsa (Just a little more spicy)\nBreath of Fire Salsa (Almost unbearable)\nDragons Breath Salsa (Made with Ghost peppers - with over 1 million SHU (Scoville Heat Units) you might need to sign a waiver before trying this!)\nNote: All of our salsas are cooked and sealed air-tight, and made to be shelf-stable for 12-18 months!\nBackers who donate at least $7 will receive their very own jar of salsa, in their choice of flavor, as well as a mention on our website, a sticker showing our logo, and a thank you postcard to show our appreciation!\nNeed more than one jar to get by? No problem! Select the corresponding reward level and order as many jars of salsa as you\u2019d like!\nAnd don\u2019t forget! We also have T-Shirts available! If you are interested in one, just add $25.00 to your order as an adder!!\nOther Ways You Can Help:\nIf you can\u2019t make a donation at this time, there are still ways you can help support our campaign! Please take a few moments to share our campaign and company information with your friends and family via social media, email, and through word of mouth!\nThank you in advance for your support and generous donations!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any online funding campaign, we understand that there may be some snags along the way as we reach our funding goals and bring our next batch out for our tremendous backers.

It draws inspiration from: Would You Rather?, Poker, Rock-Paper-Scissors and people who like to argue on Facebook (everyone).\nThe Product\nInside and out, Devil's Advocate is a beautifully designed card game. You'll be proud to display it on your shelf, and even prouder when you use the game to prove to your friends how much better at arguing you are. The final deck will be composed of 504 poker-sized playing cards inside a boldly colored box. Those choosing the \"Hellfire Package\" will receive additional items (see rewards section).\nWhat's Unique\nLike most creative products, Devil's Advocate is a combination of many ideas. In terms of game mechanics, the reason DA is superior to other games on the market is that it requires each player to be involved in every round. And because it's not a winner take all scenario during each of those rounds, all players will feel motivated to participate throughout the entire game. If you'd like to see more detailed instructions, you can do so here.\nWhy Pledge Now\nSupporting this Kickstarter will ensure Devil's Advocate becomes a reality. And by backing it here and now, not only will you be getting it for less than retail, but the first 1000 backers will also get the game before the holidays.\nGratitude\nDesigner: The extremely talented Josh Boston\nAdvisors: Katie Kendall, Steve Kendall, Adam Kmiec, Adam DeVarney, Tyler Travitz, John Geletka, Tim Dres, Tim Harris.\nEmail Provider: Active Campaign and John Morrison ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPaper cuts. Lots of paper cuts. But seriously, this is a pretty simple project for anyone who is good at planning ahead (which I am). I have the designs, I have a local printer in Chicago, and I have a partner for distribution. My biggest challenge is getting these games to everyone before the holidays, but assuming the funding is on course mid-way through I'll get started early on printing before the campaign is even over. As you can imagine, small delays may pop-up here and there, but my aim is to make sure that the first 1000 backers get this game before they slice the first Christmas ham, light the first Hanukkah candle, or perform the first feat of strength for Festivus.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Devil's Advocate Update", "update_content": "Guess who collectively helped Devil's Advocate reach $20,000 and now will receive a free upgraded stainless steel reader card?

If you are here, you may have a love for great grandma Gloria's mahogany coffee table and a fierce hatred for condensation. Maybe your constant ceramic coffee cup companion calls for a custom coaster. Perhaps, your affection for fine furniture frustrates you for lack of matching accessories. Whatever your need, we assume you are here to solve a problem and we have just the solution for you!\nEverybody needs a coaster!\nWant to add a handsome accessory to your drink-ware? Looking to protect your heirloom furniture? Want a personalized piece of art in your dining room? Our simple, elegant, and customizable coasters crafted from verified sustainable or reclaimed hardwoods will be an eye-catching addition to your table or bar.\nThese hardwood coasters are available in 3 shapes and 4 wood varieties, each measuring 4\" across and 1/4\" thick. Choose from circle, rounded square, and curved square (see image below for exact shapes). Finished with multiple coats of acrylic lacquer for a great shine, long life, and water resistance.\nAbout Our Wood\nOne of the core principles at our woodshop has always been to use reclaimed, salvaged, and sustainable wood sources. The Walnut, Maple, and Cherry woods used in our coasters are harvested as part of Appalachian Hardwood Verified Sustainable program. Click on the image below to find out more!\nThe \"Blue Pine\" wood that is used for our coasters is actually from a tree called the Lodgepole Pine. These trees have been killed by beetles carrying a fungus that changes the color of the wood. These trees are removed from the forest floor and milled into lumber to prevent risk of injury and forest fires. To learn more about the Pine Beetle Epidemic, head over to National Geographic.\nCoaster Wood Choices\nCoaster Shape Choices\nWe are currently offering 3 basic shapes for our coasters. We may add a few more options as stretch goals, but the 3 starter shapes are below:\nMonogram Options\nFor the custom engraved coaster rewards, a monogram is included. Monograms come in two varieties. A single letter monogram usually represents a family name. A 3 letter monogram can represent a person's initials or two individuals' first name initials and their last name initial in the middle. You can select from one of the 3 styles below for your monogram:\nRewards\nAdd-ons\nIn addition to a coaster reward, you can add on the following items by increasing your pledge the appropriate amount:\n$5 - Whidden's Woodshop Tote Bag\n$8 - Resuable Alder Wood Thank You Card\n$10 Reward: Alder Wood Thank You Card\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhidden's Woodshop is currently our young family's primary income. We have been running our small family business for almost a year at this point. We currently have Etsy shop and sell items locally at craft fairs and art shows, but that isn't enough to provide for our growing family of 6 (and 2 cats).\nKickstarter allows for global exposure and creates permanent relationships with people who are passionate about what we create and also with potential retail buyers.\nOur goal for this campaign is to raise enough funds to fulfill all our rewards, purchase additional equipment for our shop, and to provide for monthly expenses for our family.\nCheck out our campaign statistics at Kicktraq!\nOur coaster cuddling cat, Bubbas.\nCheck out our Etsy store to see what else we create!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is only one risk associated with this campaign.

There is nothing worse than trying to charge your phone at one outlet, but realizing that the nearest flat surface, or where you were planning to store your phone, is on the other side of the room! This is never a problem with our strong cable.\n\u25cf Tangles = Breakage For those of us who have used charging cables, we know that tangles aren\u2019t only unsightly, but a tangle left to its own devices can cause breakage along the length or end of the cable. Eventually, it causes the cable to rip or break altogether. Not only does our unique cover protect the cable from breakage, but it also prevents tangles outright with a nylon fabric casing.\n\u25cf Cheaply Made Products Don\u2019t Last Sure, you could buy a dollar-store charging cable as a last resort, but how long will that last? Cheaply made charging cables are notorious for breaking, not holding the charge, or even completely falling out of the device mid-charge. Why risk your expensive device with a cable that could possible break your phone? Our product contains quality materials produced by careful craftsmanship by a small, independent company. \nImpact:  The Strong Cable features incredible innovation, and vastly improves upon the average charging cable. We have built solid relationships with our suppliers, and we have already thoroughly vetted their supplies and our resulting products. We have a strong foundation for this product, but we need your support to help us get there! \nWhat We Need & What You Get: We are seeking the support of the community to help us meet our 400 item MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity). By donating to our campaign, you are helping us reach our goals and push towards wide distribution of our product, marketing the Strong Cable, and much more. \nAdditional funding will be used towards the costs related to rewards, furthering our campaign and more! To thank our generous backers, we are offering numerous exciting rewards at a variety of donation levels. Please view the rewards on the right-hand side of the page and select the reward that works for you!\nOther Ways You Can Help: If you can\u2019t make a donation at this time, there are still other ways you can help us reach our goals! Please take a moment to share our campaign with your friends and family via social media, email, and word of mouth. With your support, we can reach our funding goals and meet our minimum order quantity requirements!\niPhone 6s, 6, 5s, 5c, 5\niPad Air 2, Air, Mini\niPod Nano 7\niPod Touch 5\nAndroid Devices (Micro USB)\nWindows Phones (Micro USB)\nThis timeline provides us with an adequate amount to deliver the Strong Cable. We do not foresee any potential delays and have done our best to smooth out any kinks in our process. If any further delays are expected our backers will be notified immediately! \nThe Strong Cable will be sent to Apple to receive MFI certification. This will allow us to use the \"Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad\" logo on our product. MFI certified accessories use certified Apple connectors purchased directly from Apple. This means that you will receive a higher quality product. We have built solid relationships with our suppliers who have experience producing MFI certified products. We have no worries that our product will receive this certification and have a strong faith in our product.\nThank you in advance for your support and donations!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any project, there are risks and challenges that must be considered before going forward. These can include:\n\n\u25cf Supply Chain: Manufacturing Delay\nA delay in the supply chain would cause us to miss our promised shipping deadlines.

However, we have worked out a schedule for our project to ensure that we allow plenty of time to ship our orders in a timely fashion. We will be devoting our full-time efforts to this project.\n\nAbove all, we want our potential backers to know that we plan to be very upfront and honest about any delays or challenges that we run into along the way.

Both Bags have a contrast interor, made from a soft but very strong fabric which is also used in the sailing industry and is available in different colors. There is enough space for your laptop, a tablet a note book and pens. \nThe Paisly Bag Q is a bit bigger than the Paisly Bag W. The handles go around the bag and carry all your belongings. The interior is made from finest Italien suede and is available in different colors. There is enough space for your laptop, a charger, a tablet a note book, pens and even more.\nEach of our bags are handmade by skilled leather artisans in Bavaria in Germany with more than 100 years of experience in the business. These artisans have served high-end luxury companies such as Maybach, Mercedes Benz, Bogner, Fendi and Bugatti, so they know a thing or two about quality. Combining years of experience with traditional techniques and modern tools to create some of the world\u2019s finest leather goods.\nTo find the best materials for our products, we tested hundreds of leathers, zippers and closures. We travelled through USA and Europe and visited the best suppliers ourselves. Only that's how we can make sure that every leather, zipper and strap is made from the best in their field.\nThe most important material is the leather.\nWe are proud to work together with the most premier tanneries in the world:\nThe Horween Leather Company from Chicago, USA\nBonaudo SRL, Italy\nArtigiano del Cuoio, Italy\nHorween is one of the famoust tanneries worldwide and is one out of two tanneries in the world who can make Shell Cordovan leather. Horween lethers is without a doubt the best available leather.\n\nBoth Italien tanneries only produce vegetable tanned leathers and supply many top luxury brands worldwide.\nENQUEUR was founded with the vision of producing high quality and reasonably priced leather products by cutting out the middleman. At ENQUEUR, we work directly with manufacturers and the tanneries to bring you the highest quality products at the best prices possible.\nIn order to produce the Paisly Bag, we need your help raising at least 6,000\u20ac. \nHere is what we will do with higher amounts of funding:  \nWith 6,000\u20ac, we will be able to afford the minimum quantity from our tanneries\nWith 7,000\u20ac we can produce gift boxes and dust bags \nWith 8,000\u20ac, we can provide more Horween leather types and color options, like Latigo, Chromexcel (Hores Front), all Nappa leather colors will be unlocked\nWith 10,000\u20ac, we can provide more interior color options and more fabrics, like silk and suede, we will also add three colors for the metal hardware (Zippers, Closure, Holders etc.)\nWith 12,000\u20ac, we can provide the Paisly Bag made from Shell Cordovan leather \nWith 15,000\u20ac, we can design & manufacture a Paisly bag for women \nfrom 20,000\u20ac, we can start to design more premium bags, such as weekender bag which is already designed in our sketchbook\n50,000\u20ac - 100,000\u20ac we will invest in retail store interior and will open a pop-up store\nfrom 100,000\u20ac we will launch our first retail store\n Special Rewards!\nAs soon as funding successfully closes, we\u2019ll get the ball rolling with production and deliveries. We will already have backer choices for design and color so the team will be focused entirely on fulfilling orders and getting them delivered. \nIf we reach our founding goal earlier than expacted we will deilver sooner.\nThanks! \nThanks to everyone who dedicated their time, energy and good mojo towards helping us get this up and running!

However we are confident and trust in our team of leather artisans that we will deliver on time and of course with the exceptional quality.

Traditional bike lights have a limited choice of light patterns for various purposes while riding and suiting our taste. Bikers\u2019 control over the lights, especially the rear one, is not convenient either.\nAspired to work for the good of bikers, Grabo targeted at designing biker-friendly, personalized and customizable bike lights which at the same time make use of our QR code sharing system (Patent Pending) to make the whole light more helpful and enjoyable.\nPutting our creativity into practice, we proudly present to you the new generation of bike lights \u2013 STELLIGHT.\nStellight - \"THE FRONT\"\nStellight - \"THE REAR\"\nThe metal housing makes STELLIGHT strong, durable and fashionable.\nCheck out on the different colors to match you bike and suit your taste.\nStandard Color - Silver Grey\nSpecial Color - Blue\nSpecial Color - Orange\nSpecial Color - Red\nSpecial Color - Black\nThe prerequisite of bike light is safety for bikers. STELLIGHT has the brightness of 360 lumen (\u201cTHE FRONT\u201d) for you to be seen clearly on the road. Enjoy carefree riding. \nAs bikers, we understand it is annoying to adjust the rear light while cycling, because it isn\u2019t convenient and does not look cool. STELLIGHT is designed to be biker-friendly. Simply rotate the FRONT KNOB to turn on and/or alter the light pattern of the \u201cTHE REAR\u201d, without fetching your arm backwards.\nControl \u201cTHE REAR\u201d with the FRONT KNOB\nMatch your Bike, Match your Mood. Every little part of your bike is a reflection of your personality and deserves to be noticed. With STELLIGHT, biking will be more than enjoyable when you can show your mood and personality through self-defined light patterns. Different light patterns also go for different purposes, say high frequency alert and energy-saving patterns.\nIf you\u2019re not satisfied with our six built-in customizable light patterns, why not download from our STELLIGHT WEB?\nUp till now 60+ light patterns have been constructed and will be available soon on STELLIGHT WEB! Have a preview of some of them in our promotional video!\nWide range of light patterns\n  Not content with the above? Quench your thirst by watching more!\nPlus any pattern you can imagine!\nThe power of creativity lies in the human mind and can never be underestimated. Each of the \u201cTHE FRONT\u201d and \u201cTHE REAR\u201d consists of six LEDs. You can design the brightness of each LED and interval of flash with the user-friendly STELLIGHT APP, which supports Android and iPhone. The change of brightness for each LED can be up to 50Hz, which is adequate for smooth fade-in and fade-out patterns or high frequency flashing alert patterns.\nWith your creativity, there can be more than a million possible light patterns. Learn how to:\nDIY whatever light pattern of your taste\nSTELLIGHT APP\nFascinated by your own creation? Share your masterpiece with us on STELLIGHT WEB and enjoy the applause!\nTo offer you the greatest room for creativity and free you from worries, STELLIGHT APP gives you an estimate of the burn time of your designed light pattern and re-estimates it upon your every tiny change to the pattern. With the help of STELLIGHT and STELLIGHT APP, you can always design the optimal light pattern for your taste and the length of the cycling journey, but never be bothered by inability to estimate the burn time! Happy cycling!\nCycling can be more fun if you do it with friends who enjoy the same interest. If you\u2019re generous, share your light pattern, be it hunt from STELLIGHT WEB or self-designed with your creative mind, by letting your friends scan the QR code and uploading it onto their own STELLIGHT. The sharing of light patterns among various STELLIGHT is done offline WITHOUT connection to the Internet, i.e. anywhere, anytime! The fun will be more than expected!\n  The same light pattern can also help you locate your biking friends while riding on the busy road without verbally speak to them.\nSystem Workflow\nThe housing of STELLIGHT can resist the splash of water and free you from frustration under unstable weather. Rain? Not a problem anymore! Look cool in any ride, anywhere, anytime.\nEveryone deserves the right to have fun. STELLIGHT is designed with love and care, and can be mounted and dismounted no matter you are left-handed or right-handed. The FRONT KNOB can be rotated with either hand.\nFlexible Mounting - Leaving space for other gadgets\nFor Left-handers & Right-handers\nThe magic is, even when STELLIGHT is mounted at different orientations, say upside down for left-handers or right-handers, the set light pattern will remain unchanged in terms of its direction. The rotation direction for the FRONT KNOB for turning on \"THE REAR\" or altering light patterns is also the same in whatever orientation STELLIGHT is set. We keep everything simple for you! Be worry-free!\nWho wants to be upset by running out power? STELLIGHT keeps going with AAA alkaline or rechargeable batteries. Simply grab equivalents in nearby convenience stores and keep going in your cycling journey.\nSTELLIGHT offers flexibility in terms of number of batteries used:\nAt least 2 batteries: to maintain optimal performance, for longer rides.\n1 battery: for emergency use\nTo ensure stable brightness of the light, three individual power channels are used and each supplies current to two LEDs. Each power channel has its exclusive power management IC and power circuit.\nSTELLIGHT adopts the latest BLE technology (Bluetooth Low Energy Connectivity) to maximize the convenience for bikers. The upload of light patterns from smartphone to \u201cTHE FRONT\u201d and \u201cTHE REAR\u201d is done wirelessly by BLE.\nWhile bikers may like to make everything simple and be carefree while riding, the use of smartphone is NOT a must once light patterns have been uploaded to \u201cTHE FRONT\u201d or \u201cTHE REAR\u201d. Patterns of \u201cTHE FRONT\u201d can be changed by rotating FRONT KNOB, and those of \u201cTHE REAR\u201d can be changed also by rotating FRONT KNOB since the two lights are connected wirelessly by BLE. We make everything simple for you!\nTo design a bike light best for biker\u2019 use, we have poured hours into researching and surveying a large number of bikers. What\u2019s good about the current bike lights? What needs to be improved? What do they look for if they buy a new bike light? If they can be a little bit greedy, what funny points would they like to add to the light?\nThere have been a lot of changes from the very first design of STELLIGHT.\nInitial Designs of STELLIGHT\nAnd here comes the final version.\nFinal Design\nCNC Prototyping\nField Testing and Photo Shooting\nDimension of \"THE FRONT\" and \"THE REAR\"\nSize Comparison with Garmin Edge 510 Bike Computer\n(#)For reference. The actual burn time depends on the light pattern customized and adopted by the biker.\n(*)Available upon meeting USD 100K stretch goal\nSuper early birds will enjoy our Kickstarter Limited Edition which has the eye-catching color of metallic \u201cKickstarter\u201d green for both the housing and the mount.

Boh Inventors, inc is a US based consumer and medical product think tank. We dream it up! Do our best to get it out to you, the consumer! We are also #quirkyinventors with the 'BEAM' work light scheduled to be released in the near future.  (to find out more about Boh inventing check out our youtube channel, search: \"bohinventing,\" and also find us on quirky.com {search: boh inventing}). \"boh inventing\" everywhere!\n     Today we are introducing the #audiojackalarm security application to the world. Upfront, the reason you would want this product is if you tend to lose your phone, or feel your phone could be stolen you want 'data' security as well, (kids especially). If you have ever lost a phone, or had this happen to you, or a loved one and you would like it to STOP then let me tell you why #audiojackalarm is right for you. Instantaneous results! #audiojackalarm lets you know the second your device becomes disconnected with alarm, and also keep others out of your stuff it it should become lost, or stolen. All for just $3! The alarm trigger system activates to all your favorite ports, not just one. We incorporate most common ports today (audiojack, usb, hdmi) that exist on your smart phone and tablet, laptop...etc. The application developed will download from google play, or istore and work on any fully equipped device and work to be perfectly functional and protect your from theft, hijack, or loss. \n     #Audiojackalarm security app ever defeats theft and drop loss, and device disconnection the second it happends on all your smart devices.\n      As a serial inventor I try and remember to share how I came up with my ideas. This app concept struck me of course after losing my phone in a public area. I know this has happened to more than myself before. I plan my night out and then go out w/ wallet and phone. I keep my phone in my pocket and somehow at the end of my night it has slipped out, or gotten lost due to loose pockets, pickpocketing, a drop I failed to notice, I was having too much fun...etc..etc. Truthfully, the specifics are not important just that I lost my phone and had some very important data on my phone, who knew if I would ever get my stuff back? What if there was a better way? How can I use people and technology to help others who lose their phones as well? \n     These thoughts resulted in #audiojackalarm. I came up with a tether concept system that is pretty much infalable while the device is powered. Now you can charge in a public setting and turn your back. Instead, using your headphones for only music how about we give them a second purpose, why not? Thus #audiojackalarm repurposes the existing ports in a very specific function as an security alarm trigger device that is activated upon disconnect. Boh was the 1st to turn your headphones into security devices and I keep at it. Make no mistake #audiojackalarm will be born, but we need your help...,\n     Yes, there are other newer apps that use bluetooth to tether devices, but they actually have some very interesting limitations that our app does not. (For example: #audiojackalarm notifies the \"instant\" loss happens, whereas bluetooth tethering only activates with \"distance seperation,\" thus #audiojackalarm leaves no margin for error. This one simple advantage seems menial, but it will only take one loss to prove to you would prefer our methodology. For example: If you were hi-jacked in a van, you and your phone together the bluetooth app goes along for the ride. Seems pretty expensive and kind of useless when you think there is no gonna be any activation?!? The first time this ever happens to you, or a loved one, you will be my customer for life...!)\n       These simple and small key differences make giant arguments for the existance of such an app. Here's another example: #audiojackalarm locks users out with activation, whereas bluetooth will leave your phone open for inspection within a certain amount of distance, even if someone pic your phone up and sifts through the data. Keep in mind there is way to tell #auadiojackalarm, so someone who has been going through your stuff might in for a real surprise in the office! Plus there is no putting the kids to sleep via bluetooth tether. With us you just pull the cord and let #audiojackalarm do the rest. \n       Plus #audiojackalarm is capable of single alarm activation with single finger operation just by pulling the cord. We ensure your phone screams bloody murder, if its ever disconnected! The instant the loss happens, you will know it!  Whereas bluetooth cannot promise anything,\n      The #audiojackalarm community will grow and you will benefit from this, as everybody wins. It is with our users best interest to grow the network as more people will receive 'vicinity notices' from other activated alarms in the area. That helps to assure your data and phone get returned/ recovered safely. If your phone does get lost additionally just locate it using global GPS, works anywhere in the world. \n      Bonuses of the app include policing the kids while sitting at the house as the video explains. You can use this app as a tool to get the kids to bed, or ground your daughter, or son when they misbehave with parental control over their favorite smart device.\n       If any of this sounds like a good idea to you then I encourage you to become a part of the #audiojackalarm team and help us get this product to the global market. Follow us on the socials (@audiojackalarm) and contribute, play our soundtrack, if nothing else. Together we are making the community responsible for returning your precious lost devices. This is \"good looking out\" for one another app and a very easy and a new way to ensure you our your loved one \"Never loses their smart phone, ipad, or tablet again!\n   As stated we will deliver on the listing, the app works as described. #audiojackalarm needs to be funded and finalized to come to fruition.\n        Please note that Boh inventing is the 1st to conceptualize and invent this app concept for the world and this is why we feel we would should be the 1st to bring this awesome security application to market.

Remember that there is a reason for everyone who downloads that app to get involved. You can all get involved and for good reason!

Players take turns drawing cards until the cards or the players hit the deck. The deck is made up of two types of cards that allow  you to deal out forfeits to your friends forcing them to take a drink or carry out a ridiculous action.\nThe game gets more and more intense with each white card put in play, the different combination of rules work together with the black cards making for fun and twisted gameplay that will keep you on your toes.\nSo if you\u2019re into drinking, card games and chilling with your friends then we think you will love our game as much as we do!\nThe Origin Story\nIn my first year as a university student, I lived in a massive residence hall. I brought with me a lifetime love of board and card games.\nLast year, I created a new game called \u201cTwist of Fate\u201d which I developed with my University class mates  board game society.\nThe feedback we got was astounding. When we first debuted it, people were literally running toward us to ask us about the game and give it a try. Seeing their enthusiasm sparked a passion in me to create games that connect people. \nAt the same time, drinking games like Kings was a great way to meet new people. I loved going to different rooms and seeing the different rules everyone played with. \nThis got me thinking...\nWhat if you could take all those 'house rules' and put them into one game? There was no way to do it with a conventional deck of cards, because you can\u2019t assign two different rules to one card. I needed to create a new game with its own dedicated cards. I got in contact with Vincent to help me carry this game forward and thus, Deal With It and our little team was born.\n\nThe Game \nDeal With It is a drinking card game that takes ideas from your favourite games and puts a twist on them. The deck currently consists of 52 cards (just like a conventional playing card deck) containing two different types of cards.\nBlack cards are Action cards. These are the standard Kings rules you\u2019re used to (\u201c2 is you,\u201d \u201c3 is me,\u201d etc). In order to come up with the best collection of Actions, we surveyed students at my university and beyond about their favourite \"house rules\" and compiled a database of rules. The Action cards in Deal With It include such cards as \u201cMercy,\u201d \u201cFuck You,\u201d \u201cCategories,\u201d and \u201cKings Cup.\u201d \nWhite cards are Active cards. These are permanent rules that affect everyone at the table for as long as the cards are in play. For example, if you play \u201cNo D Words,\u201d no one is allowed to use a word that starts with \u2018D.\u2019 If you break the rule and the other players catch you, you drink! There is also a special Deal With It! card. If you draw this card, keep it hidden, and when someone tells you to drink, you can play this card and turn the tables, forcing that player to drink for you. They\u2019ll just have to \u201cDeal with it!\u201d\n                  We have a finished design, a working prototype, and now we are ready to put Deal With It into mass production. In order to do so, we need help from you to reach the funding goal and to put the first run into production. Funding will also go toward marketing and promotion. By backing this campaign, you will be guaranteed a deck of your own and be one of the first people to begin play testing Deal With It on a wider scale. \n\nIf we exceed the funding goal, we will be able to offer all kinds of fantastic perks to our loyal contributors. We will be able to get to work on creating expansions for the game, and higher tier contributors can get access to limited edition cards, design their own cards for future expansions, or even play test the game with us, the creators! We want to offer as many incentives as possible to those who are able to donate the money we need to make this happen. \n\n\n If you enjoy drinking games or card games like Cards Against Humanity, then Deal With It is perfect for you. Sharing your enthusiasm for Deal With It with your friends is just as valuable as a financial contribution. The more people who get excited about this, the bigger and better the final product will be.\n\nWe are committed to creating games that connect people, and I hope you will share this commitment with me. Please take a moment to share this campaign on your social media profiles and get the word out there.\n\n#dealwithitgame\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @dealwithitgame \n                 Facebook: Deal With It game", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project was big, but rewarding.

My group also changed the rules for how cards are played where we have a hand of 3 cards, if a card comes up in your hand that specifically makes YOU drink, you HAVE to play that right then and there, and then redraw a card for that card that was played. That way no one knows if you have a Deal With It card. Just having that card sitting in front of you made it so no one played anything on you in fear of you flipping that card, which led to some of us not drinking.", "time": "almost 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Silf", "content": ":)", "time": "almost 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Richard Wetherall", "content": "is the UK getting there decks yet?, just nothing here and wondering if you could do a quick look up and see where about it is?", "time": "almost 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Nirav Haria", "content": "Hi @adam, I have not received this game yet - starting to get a bit worried. do you have a tracking number?", "time": "almost 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Lucifer \"The Fallen\" Angel", "content": "I'm a tad worried I still haven't received mine, I am a shot glass backer", "time": "almost 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Christopher Tinney", "content": "@ Adam Thank you for the quick response.

Made in America.\nPLAY\n\nOur Story...\nBeginning of last year my fiancee and I, started selling vintage clothing on Etsy under Savvy Ladies in Bangkok, Thailand. Later that year we opened, www.savvyladiesboutique.com. At the same time, back home, we opened a brick & mortar store, Savvy Boutique, in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nWe always dreamed of creating our own clothing however. Dina was a seamstress, and knew just the people to contact. We realized there were more able bodies than work very quickly. So we bought a few sewing machines and started producing prototypes. \nWe sent many samples back home to our shop. Our parents, along with my brothers would try everything on, giving us valuable feedback. We made many revisions, until we finally got it right. We knew then, we had created something that didn't exist, we had created what maybe the world's most comfortable pants!\nBut that's not all. Why we started selling vintage to begin with was with one goal in mind. Dina was from Pakistan. She had opened my eyes to the suffering, poverty and oppression in her home country. From the beginning we have been donating 10% of all our proceeds to women's charity causes in Pakistan.\nPakistani artist made this for us, we just had to share!\nYou can't ask for donations on Kickstarter. But we can certainly give back 10% of our sales! \nAs a VIP member, we want to keep our customers posted on the things we're doing to help improve the lives of young women in Pakistan. So long after this campaign is over, your pledges will go a long way, and may change someones life forever!\nOur Qualifications:\nBusiness expertise and execution are the two biggest and most important aspects of any business or project. Myself I've been selling for a living, online and offline for well over a decade. I've worked both in the retail clothing sector, as well as managed a retail jewelry store. Online, operated two major eBay Gold Powerseller accounts, selling gemstones, jewelry and electronics. \nFor projects like this, you need a team however. And I'm proud to say our team is more like a family than just co-workers. Everyone is close, friendly, and is specialized in their field. \nTEP Team:  \nMy fiancee, co-founder, full-time designer, part-time model.\nTwo stitchers, working together in tandem, with years of experience.\nMyself, who primarily handles online affairs, including social media.\nFactory manager, product quality control, handles orders, and shipping.\nMore than a few people off site that, help us with graphics work and advertising.\nQuestions?\nWe'd love to hear from you! We'll be checking multiple times a day, everyday, for 30 days, so please don't hesitate to write us!\nThank you everybody for your generosity and support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has years of experience creating some of the world's most comfortable pants. All customers will receive a survey at the end of the campaign, where we ask for the type, pattern, color and size of selected pledge. Each one is printed out and made to order. During the campaign we can gauge what fabric we need to buy, and how much we'll need. We operate by the wire, meaning we won't have to wait until the project is over to start working. This saves a lot of time, and ensures we can get our items to our beloved customers quickly as possible.\n\nTo speed up the process further we will ship all US orders to our hub in Charlotte, NC by DHL Express. Within a few days our pants will be stateside and will be ready to be forwarded by USPS. International customers will have all orders processed here in Bangkok, Thailand and sent by Thailand Post Economy Air SAL. For those interested in faster shipping time, please contact us. Usually Priority from Economy is about 50% more expensive; cost is based on weight.\n\nWe understand some transactions may fail upon completion of the project for various reasons. No worries, we communicate with all our customers and in cases like that, we will contact you first.

We own a farm meaning we have the animals and hay fields and equipment but we don\u2019t own farm land. We rent hay fields in exchange for part of the hay and we rent barns in exchange for livestock feed. What this means basically is that after work we go to the rented barns or rented hay fields and do what needs to be done whether it is making hay or milking goats. We are farmers without a farm, farming none the less.\nThe name of our farm started out as a joke when we bought 3 goats because we didn\u2019t own a house or farm land. The name really grew on us though and it was a very accurate name so it stuck.\nOur Goal\nWe would like to be a place where the community can come for free to spend some time on a working farm. We want to have school children come learn about animals and plants. We want foster kids to be able to learn that the world can be a wonderful place and new things can be fun and exciting. We want people of all ages to be able to come have moonlit picnics under the stars or come pick apples in the fall and berries in the spring for free. We want to take extra produce and eggs to Detroit and Flint and any other areas that need more access to low cost vegetables and nutritious eggs. We want to offer summer programs for urban youth to come stay on the farm for a few days or weeks so they can learn there is more than just life in a big city. We want to offer classes for butchery, soap making, milking, cheese making, herb growing as well as gardening and maintaining a healthy orchard. We have big dreams, ideas and hopes to make a difference in other people\u2019s lives.\nWhat we have\nFor this season we have about 60 acres of hay field we will turn into hay bales to feed our animals and pay the landowners, this means we get about 40 acres of baled hay but must do the work to make 60 acres worth including machinery maintenance, gas, oil, and drive time to get to the separate fields.\nWe have a lot of farm animals for our farm, we put the cart before the horse so to speak. Right now Nein Haus Farms owns the following.\n20 Dairy Goats - Alpines, Nubians, Nigerians, LaManchas and Boer\n11 Muscovy Ducks - Young Adults\n14 Pekin Ducks - Juvenile Ducks about 10 weeks old\n13 Rouen Ducks - Juvenile Ducks about 10 weeks old\n11 Mixed Breed Rabbits\n19 Leghorn Hens\n4 Polish Hens with 2 Roosters\n3 Mille Fleur D\u2019uccle Bantams\nA few Barred Buffs, Barred Rocks, Iowa Blue, bantams and other mixed breed adults.\n4 Chinese Ring neck Pheasants\nA lot of variously aged chicks (we hatch our own)\nAnd a meal worm farm\nWhat we do\nYou might be wondering what we do with all these animals? The goats are a dairy herd and get milked daily we are hoping to do herd shares with the goats as they are raised organically but right now we have no place they can come pick up milk and no place for an extra fridge to hold large amounts of milk. Goat kids are sold as pets or 4-h goats. The chickens and ducks lay eggs that we sell; they are organic, non-soy, non-gmo and cage free. There is a large need for farm eggs in our area and even with us selling 7 dozen eggs a week and some of our friends selling 22 dozen eggs a week there is still a 6 week wait or longer to get into the egg rotation which is why we have so many chicks because they will grow up and lay eggs hopefully easing some of the demand and allowing more people access to more nutritious eggs. The rabbits are used for meat rabbits or on occasion pets and 4-h rabbits. We are big fans of re-using things such as pallets, the tin off a old carport, snow fencing, safety fence, crating boards from steel shipments, even nails and screws.\nLast year we rented 2 acres of land at two different locations to plant gardens. We had sweet corn, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, kohlrabi, cauliflower, broccoli, snap peas, green beans, brussel sprouts, beets, onions, pie pumpkins, field pumpkins, squashes and cabbage.\nWe are members of the local farmers market. Most think we are underpriced. Really for us it is more important that the community has a place to get affordable produce and eggs then it is to make a large profit. As long as the farm can sustain itself that is all we require\nWhat we need\nHopefully you\u2019re still with me. The reason we started our Kickstarter campaign is because we are farming without a farm and the logistics of doing it costs a lot of money, so much money in fact we cannot save enough money for a down payment on a farm. We have good credit and the bank approved us for a loan but we would need to have more down payment money. At the peak of summer we will be traveling over 100 miles some days just to be able to complete our farm activities. We are hardworking people who just need a little help to try to make a difference in our community.\nOur daily routine\nA typical day starts with getting up at 6am to go to my full time job, I work 7am to 4pm Monday-Friday. i get home at about 4:30pm, chickens, ducks and rabbits are feed and watered. Then we drive over to our friend Holli's place about 8 miles away to where we keep our goats, goats are watered, hayed, milked, and grained. After that we either go another 8 miles to the garden sites and weed or plant and water the garden, pick vegetables that are ready or we go make hay which involves mowing, raking, drying, baling, or transporting the hay another 6+ miles away to where we rent barn space for hay storage. Then we go home ducklings and chicks get another round of food and water, the meal worm farm gets veggies/fruit and the dogs get fed. Then we candle or set eggs and moves eggs that need to hatch to the hatcher and clean incubators. Then I make human food and clean up the house as best as I can then go to bed at midnight so i can get up at 6am again.  \nWhat you can offer\nIf we could just get some soil (buy the farm) so everything was in one place we could accomplish so much more. A lot of time and energy is spent in logistics right now that could be put to far better use. If we could place gardens at our own farm we could plant more vegetables, as well as trees and berries. It is not feasible to plant fruit trees and shrubs any place right now because of the long establishment period before they bear fruit. With more vegetables and fruits we could share more good quality food with more disadvantaged people. If we had a central place (the farm) where people knew they could come to get fresh vegetables, fruits, eggs and meat at little or no cost it would make a very big difference. We personally know people who live meal to meal and most of those meals are \"cheap\" meaning they are processed foods with almost no nutritional value. The number of people only just scraping by in our local communities and the large inner cities weighs heavy on us and reminds us to be happy and thankful with any opportunities that are placed before us. If you can help make a difference to some small and large communities in northern Michigan please pledge.\n Goal #1\nInstalling a night time blooming garden with \"fairy type\" lighting. This would be a very unique and fun addition to the moonlit picnics we would be offering.\nGoal #2\nPurchase and install a High Tunnel to extend our growing season by 4-6 weeks. The Ag office will extend a grant to us so we would only be required to pay 8% of the tunnel cost plus labor cost to erect the tunnel.\nGoal #3\nCSA shares along with offering handmade organic soap, laundry detergent, and lotions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGreg's famous quote when everything goes wrong or breaks \"We're farming now\" As a farmer you learn to take the good and the bad and tomorrow there will be another sunrise and more to do so there is no reason to get to worked up about whatever did or didnt happen as you planned today...it will get done.\n\nThe biggest risks on a farm are always animals and the weather. \n\nWe could have a horrid growing season, lack of rainfall can be compensated for by watering plants manually but a spring/summer/fall that are to cold will have a much greater impact on your plants ability to grow and produce. For example last year a field that should have yielded 600+ square bales of hay only gave us about 230 bales because spring was late and summer was not warm enough. This meant we were short on winter hay so we made a deal to clean out someones barn for hay and to haul hay for someone else in exchange for hay.\n\nHeavy animal losses are always bad for any unplanned reason. We had high hopes for our first kidding season a combination of bred does we bought(previous owners bred to early) and a cold winter along with an open barn made for a lot of frostbite scares and bottle babies. we had a few kids die before we got to them due to the cold of winter being born in january and febuary. We also lost a doe we bought who was bred (to young by previous owners) and the twin doe kids she was pregnant with. Losing animals is always a sad upsetting day for any farm, the question becomes how you to stop it from happening again. We keep young does away from the bucks and we do not breed them until later in the year so we miss the coldest months of january and febuary.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Katherine Brown\nFirst created \u00b7 16 backed\nWe are a 34 yr old male named Greg and a 31yr old female named Katherine.

We started Tynker in order to give our own kids a more engaging introduction to programming. We knew learning how to code would be important for building a career in the twenty-first century - but, while there were several languages and tools to choose from, we found that strings of letters and punctuation on a screen were not an attention-grabbing medium for kids. Our product, Tynker, offers a new way to learn to program. Over 23 million kids have started coding with Tynker, and every day we are inspired by what they do with it! \nPLAY\n\nWhat is Tynker?\nTynker is an interactive platform where kids solve puzzles while learning how to build web and mobile games, create interactive stories, animations, and music, and share their creations with friends!\nDoes Tynker Work?\nAt Tynker, we are constantly striving to find the right balance of fun and learning when we build products for kids. We work with the best game designers, developers, instructional designers, art directors and producers to design high quality educational content, deeper storylines, engaging themes and likable characters. \nTwenty-three million kids (and counting) can\u2019t be wrong - Tynker is a new way to learn.

Discover hidden secrets and unlock treasure chests with the help of sprites. Play through the ten levels and 50+ fun activities.\nTuring\u2019s Tower: Once you\u2019ve gained some basic coding skills in Glitch Manor, traverse a steampunk-styled game world and collect parts to repair a flying castle. Program the tower's exotic abilities, collect crystals with a robotic claw or aim cannons to shoot down flying robots! Play through four worlds and build 16 games. \nGoblin Quest: In our advanced Adventure, travel through a magical realm to defeat the Goblin King. Take on the role of the Hacker and change the way the world works! Kids build their own code to direct armies and program epic battles. Play through four more game worlds and build 16 more games.\nWith Tynker, kids learn fundamental concepts like events, variables, loops, functions, and principles of computational thinking \u2013 the basic building blocks of every programming language. Once proficient, they can seamlessly transition to Javascript coding within the Tynker learning system.\nWhy Tynker?\nCoding, and the computational thinking that it demands, gives kids the skills they need in the digital age. Whether or not they grow up to be computer programmers, kids will be able to understand the basics of how to build computer programs, which is useful for artists, journalists, business owners, and anyone regularly using computers as part of their job (that is, almost everyone!).\nOur mission is to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn to code, especially girls. Currently only 18% of CS jobs are held by women. We don\u2019t want any child to be left behind as the current generation enters today's digital world.\nWhy This Project?\nWe want to make sure that every child has the opportunity to learn to code. With your backing, we will continue to provide free coding tools and curriculum to thousands of schools and millions of kids worldwide to get introduced to programming in a fun way.\nWith the support we get from you in this round of funding, we will be launching our games in June 2015, and hoping to reach millions more kids!\nFeatures!\nProgram battles, design your own characters and publish apps!\nWe\u2019ll also be updating our apps on iPad and Android with support for connected devices so kids can use the same visual language to seamlessly command drones, the Hue/Lux light systems, and even robots like Ollie and Sphero. Kids will be able to bring their code to life, and control compatible objects -- creating spectacular light shows, flying drones through the air, and teaching their robots to put on a dance show.\nWhen kids can see the effects of their coding take shape in the physical world, they will be even more inspired by what they\u2019ve learned to do.\nRewards ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTynker has built a number of successful coding solutions for kids and our platform is used by more than 20 million worldwide.

With Beck having grown up in Southern California and Oliver in New England, they have worked to refine traditional California surfwear, while adding a blend of east coast design. \nTheir goal wasn\u2019t just to create another clothing brand. Rather, they set out to leave a lasting impact, to be something that is more than just a label.\nBalboa was founded by a generation born into a world that needs fixing. Beck and Oliver\u2019s parents instilled in them an attitude to not take life\u2019s simplest necessities for granted. As they grew up, they learned the value in helping others. Whether it was seeking out homeless in downtown LA or working on organic farms, the two developed an affinity for aiding those in the community that couldn\u2019t afford proper food.\nBringing together their love for clothing and their passion for ending hunger, Balboa was born.\nBalboa\u2019s plan is simple. For every product sold, a set number of meals is donated nationwide to America\u2019s hungry population.\nWe have spent months at the drawing boards, developing what we believe are some of the finest shades on the market. Our wood sunglasses are crafted with bamboo, a renewable resource that grows faster than we can keep up with. It grows three feet on average every day. \nCheck out the features below:\nThese bamboo shades are fitted with quality components including \u201cOptics by Carl Zeiss Vision\u201d CR-39 lenses considered the clearest lenses on the market (VIP models only or if we reach our stretch goal) or polarized CR-39 lenses. They also come equipped with a DWR (Durable water repellent) finish to ensure that they withstand every element you encounter. But we saved the best for last, each pair of bamboo sunglasses purchased directly donates 45 meals to hungry Americans!\nThrough working with industry experts we are also proud to launch 100% biodegradable acetate frames. Sourced from an Italian acetate manufacturer that has been in business for over a century, we are able to share with you acetate developed through an innovative new process that fuses cotton and wood fibers. This allows for superior flexibility while maintaing the frames original form through a range of temperatures.\nOur brand has always been about giving back to those in need, that is why every pair of sunglasses we sell displays a unique frame stamp (located on the base of the left arm) indicating that you have directly donated 45 meals to hungry Americans.\n*To comply with kickstarter's rules and regulations all proceeds from our our campaign cannot be directly donated. They will however be used to support the foundation of our company which will directly donate meals for every product sold.\nOur eyewear is handcrafted start to finish, from the selection of high quality raw materials to putting the final markings on the inside of the frame. We believe in our product and we want you to be sure that you are receiving the highest quality goods available, that is why we hand test each pair to ensure that it passes our rigorous quality standards. Put simply, if we wouldn't wear them, we won't sell them.\nWe set out to outfit the traveler and adventurer in all of us. That is why we have put so much emphasis on producing environmentally sustainable eyewear.\nWe couldn't just stop at eyewear. Thats why we searched long and hard for a perfect supplier of 100% ring-spun t-shirts. Amazingly we found the perfect fit, right here in the USA. This local supplier to California apparel companies has been in business for over ten years now and we were immediately impressed by the quality of the shirts we received. \nCheck out the great features below:\nOur eco-friendly bamboo eyewear comes in five different models for you to choose from:\n Our 100% recycled acetate frames are being shipped in two models:\nTo see more photos from every angle check out our website at www.balboashop.com\nCheck out our spring line of Basic T's for you to choose from:\nWith the Stingray Package or any other package containing Designer T's you can select from our Limited Edition Kickstarter T's below:\nOr for our Designer T Packages, your options are endless as you can choose from any T we produce!\n To see where you should pledge check out our reward table listed below:\nWith the mission to be more than just another label, Balboa reflects this in each and every product.\nThe balboa team did not want to be a company that donates a percentage of revenues to a distant charity; instead we wanted to create a system where the customer knows exactly how they have provided help. We set up our own non-profit foundation, Meals for America, which donates money to Feeding America as well as to a collection of other grassroots solutions. Every product is then stamped with a number, identifying how many meals that customer provided to hungry Americans through these donation channels.\nBy being transparent we hope to change the marketplace culture and enlighten people on their power as a consumer.\n*To comply with kickstarter's rules and regulations all proceeds from our our campaign cannot be directly donated. They will however be used to support the foundation of our company which will directly donate meals for every product sold.\nAs with all new companies a logo plays an integral part in the identity behind a brand. The Balboa Team knew they wanted to capture the simplicity of the world\u2019s beauty yet they needed a symbol that could reflect their humanitarian efforts.\nToday pineapple is considered a symbol of hospitality and generosity, a perfect fit for a company whose mission is to support solutions towards ending hunger in America. Not only does it serve as a worldly symbol, but pineapple is an incredibly nutritious fruit: a symbol of the healthy foods that are desperately needed in communities across the nation.\nWe have worked tirelessly to provide a brand that you would love. One that seeks to enjoy life, while helping others along the way. Our work, money and time have taken us to this very kickstarter.\nWe now need you for this journey to continue. Your generous backing will help provide us with the resources to establish an adequate inventory as well as funding to bring to life our brand, as we continue to expand our product line. We love this world and it\u2019s people, please help us continue to pursue our mission to see everything and give something.\nGrowing up in both California and the East Coast, Beck has gained a passion for outdoor pursuits. He has been an avid ocean swimmer since he was little and has continued to seek out salt water everywhere he travels. A current student at Manhattanville College (NY), Beck has taken his knowledge of operational management and applied it towards the development of what you see today.\nResponsible for organizing the overall operations of the company, Beck has served as a driving force behind the development and sourcing of balboa's products. When Beck is taking a step away from Balboa, you can find him swimming, surfing, fly-fishing, and just enjoying life.\nEmail: Beck@balboashop.com\nAn east coast native Oliver has always loved to travel, especially out West. As a current student at the University of Richmond (VA), Oliver has focused his passion for entrepreneurship and humanitarian causes to help create a brand that generates good for our communities.\nResponsible for managing the marketing front, as well as collaborating on innovation and design,  Oliver is constantly working on the branding and aesthetic aspects of Balboa. When he is not busy sending a note out to one of the Ambassadors, Oliver can be found in the ocean, hiking, or simply enjoying the summer sun.\nEmail: Oliver@balboashop.com\nGrowing up in the Northeast with frequent visits to the mountains out West, Harry has developed a knack for adventure. By studying Cinema with a minor in Digital Art at Elon University, he is able to explore his passions while traveling the world. Harry is currently finishing up his semester in California, where he has immersed himself in the film industry in Los Angeles.\nIn addition to being a videographer, Harry is an avid skier and spends a lot of his time on the mountains in Colorado.

As hard as we worked to this point the last thing we want is our opportunity to go wasted. Nevertheless here are the risks:\n\nMANUFACTURING: No matter how much expertise and experience you have, there is always room for small error. That is why we have partnered with established manufacturers to produce both our acetate and bamboo frames. To minimize delays we have worked with our suppliers of raw materials to ensure that on our call we can begin production. We've also worked hard to pencil out lead times and establish a line of communication between our material suppliers and manufacturing firms.This ensures the smoothest transition of materials possible, but just to be safe we are leaving a little extra time as a cushion.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes the seas get rough and things get a little crazy. Whether its a machine breaking down, a miscommunication between a supplier, or a shipment gets lost in the mail. Those things could slow down the delivery process. For all these reasons, it makes us feel that much better that we have been working for a year to establish lasting communications with our suppliers. This isn't our first rodeo and we will work tirelessly to ensure that you get exactly what you asked for. \n\nIn any process there are always bumps in the road, it is our job to minimize these as much as possible. And you can rest assure we have been on top of the ball since day one.\n\nAny pledge amount makes a difference!

And fact rivals fiction as one challenge after another arises in finding a permanent \u2018home\u2019 for the junk and how to transport the fragile vessel. \nOctogenarian junk-mates CALVIN MEHLERT (former U.S. Vice Consul, Taipei) and PAUL CHOW also join the effort.  From the Taiwan side, the charismatic Ms. LUNG YINGTAI (historian & former Minister of Culture, Taiwan), Professor LAURENCE LWO (National Taiwan Ocean University) and legislator Dr. CHIAU WEN-YAN embrace the mission of bringing the junk \"home\" from USA with such enthusiasm it's infectious. \nDuring 2012, junk-mates LOO-CHI HU (HULOO), PAUL and CALVIN converge (from California and New Zealand, respectively) at the same port in Keelung, Taiwan where the junk first departed in 1955.  With their families from around the globe in tow, they are finally reunited with one another and the junk that impacted their lives in so many ways. Their reunion is bitter-sweet with the deeply felt absence of fellow junk-mates RENO CHEN, MARCO CHUNG and BENNY HSU. \nThe vivacious DIANE SHIPWAY (whose team, including PHIL JOY, oversaw the complex design and implementation of moving the junk) reflects on the formidable process and her great delight in seeing the junk home.   \nNote: film colleagues have likened the monumental efforts of transporting the junk to that of Werner Herzog's vessel in the film Fitzcarraldo!\nReturn of the Free China junk picks up where the prequel award-winning film The Free China Junk (2010) left off. See www.thefreechinajunkfilm.com  Both films showcase junk-mate CALVIN's stunning colour Kodachrome from the actual 1955 trans-Pacific voyage -- and a fabulous film score by JIM KIMO WEST, the lead guitarist of the Grammy award-winning \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (www.jimkimowest.com).  \nReturn of the Free China is a stand-alone film in its own right.  It celebrates the adventurous spirit of the junk-mates -- and the positive power and perseverance of the next generation and international collaborators to save a treasured piece of history for the future. \n'Free China' junk, Keelung (photo: R. Greenberg)\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\nReturn of the Free China Junk has just received early acceptance for the New Zealand International Film Festival 2015, July/August in Auckland, Wellington & Christchurch!  The year 2015 represents the 60th anniversary of the junk's original voyage from Taiwan to San Francisco in 1955. That seems auspicious.\nWe screened the film as a work-in-progress to the Festival. Now we need your help in order to complete the film in time for its upcoming World Premiere.  And that's where this Kickstarter comes in!\nWe appreciate your assistance in any way you can help support the film's completion -- and getting the word out as widely and quickly as possible for a successful campaign.  Many thanks in anticipation!!\nToasting the junk! Oakland (photo: Raj Dhingra)\nHOW IT STARTED\nOn the verge of burn-out after a five-year struggle to complete the prequel The Free China Junk, director/producer ROBIN GREENBERG had no inkling that a sequel film would beckon just around the corner\u2026 But as momentum started to build for saving the junk, and she was urged to document the story, how could she turn away?  \nThe magic of the junk seems to have woven its spell around Robin too!   \nIt's junk-mate LOO-CHI HU (HULOO) who first piqued Robin's interest in the amazing story of the 'Free China' junk many years ago in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Huloo was Robin's long-time T'ai Chi teacher and mentor.  Her biographical film Huloo (2008) about his remarkable life included a chapter about the 1955 voyage. This then naturally evolved into her first full-length feature documentary The Free China Junk (2010). This is why the director of the New Zealand International Film Festival is referring to this sequel film Return of the Free China Junk as the last of the \"trilogy\"!\nWith your help we will complete the film in time for its World Premiere in New Zealand during July, along with future screenings near you!\nABOUT OUR TEAM\nOUR FABULOUS CAST & CREW INCLUDE\u2026\nJunk-mates:  RENO CHEN, PAUL CHOW, MARCO CHUNG, LOO-CHI HU (HULOO) & CALVIN MEHLERT (former U.S. Vice Consul, Taipei)\nDIONE CHEN\nLUNG YINGTAI (historian & former Minister of Culture, Taipei)\nLAURENCE LWO (National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung) \nCHIAU WEN-YAN (Legislator, Executive Yuan, Taiwan)\nDIANE SHIPWAY \nHANS VAN TILBURG (NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaires) \nWith TEH-HAN CHOW, SHIRLEY LIH-LAN HU and TONG-CHING HU\n*******\nCinematography: CHEN WEN-CHI (Taiwan) & JOHN CHRISSTOFFELS (New Zealand)\nSound: CHEN DENG-HUI\nAdditional Camera (USA): CHRISTIAN BRUNO, CLAY WESTERVELT\nEditor:  PETER METCALF, 195 Suites Ltd  \nMusic:  JIM KIMO WEST (www.jimkimowest.com)\nSound Mix: IAN LESLIE, Underground Sound Ltd.

Thanks to additional excellent filming by junk-mate CALVIN MEHLERT and LAURENCE LWO we had the visual bones of the stories from the California side too. \nWithout our grassroots helpers in Wellington, Christchurch and Martinborough during 2014, we wouldn't have been able to take our first steps forward for editing.

It was Huloo who first introduced Robin to the legend of the 'Free China' junk.

That is me, six years ago when I was 17 years old. Do you see that boy beside me? His name was Bryan, he was my best friend. WAS being the keyword, I loved him, but he could only see his own pain. I lost Bryan two months after this photo was taken, and this book explores the ways that suicide and depression affects everyone involved. \nI am raising funds to traditionally publish my first novel, Falling Star. Query letters and good writing just isn't enough in a world where publishing companies rarely take risks on young and emerging new authors with no platform or background. They need solid evidence that your book will sell, which I will have when I raise the funds needed.\nI plan on using the funds raised to promote my novel, and to create a platform and fan base for Falling Star. I will use the funds to hire an artist to create the cover for my book (convert it to eBook format, as well as paperback), hire promotional agencies that will help to circulate the book to a larger audience, and to market the final product.\nThis heartfelt novel is a way for me to bring awareness to depression and suicide in teenagers, as well as giving the main character, Ella, chances and choices that I never had... This fictional novel is based upon true events, events that shaped the person I am today and changed my life. \nFalling Star\nA young adult novel\nFalling Star is about a teenage girl, named Ella. She is from a small town where nothing new ever happens, and things rarely change. Her little world revolves around her best friend, Byron. He is the star of the school, until his path begins to darken. He begins distancing himself from Ella, while she tries to ignore his changing personality. Soon, Ella discovers that Byron has become depressed, but is it too late to save him? Or herself?\nPlease feel free to like my page for Falling Star on Facebook so that I can continue to grow my fan base. Facebook.com/FallingStar2015. \nChapter One SNEAK PEAK\n Sometimes, life can be hard. That seems to be the general consensus anyways. Life is not always picking flowers, carefree worries, and sappy love stories. Life is sometimes hard; it can be tragic; and it can be confusing. But, through all that, isn't it worth it? This crazy thing called life?\nI suppose I should start this off, by telling you that my name is Ella Cane. The majority of my friends call me El, or Ellie. That seems to be the norm nowadays, shortening names that are already rather short. It seems a bit silly to me, but I don't really mind. I suppose I tried to get them to stop, they wouldn't anyway. It just seems to slip from their tongues.  \n Lets see, I am, I guess, what is considered a \"normal\" teenager. I have that shaggy brown hair that looks similar to mud, but my mother is always trying to tell me that \"is as golden as the sun.\" I decided to cut it all off last year. I think it broke her heart a little bit- I did feel quite badly for that. I am 18 years old now though, she should understand that I need to do things for me. It is my senior year of high school, who hasn't done something a bit crazy? But I digress; I also have mud brown eyes (still normally referred to as \"golden\") that matches my hair. I am average height, and average build. I play sports, and I get good grades. I am friends with most everyone, and I do what is expected of me most of the time. I know you must be thinking how average I seem and you are right. In the craziness that is the world today I am pretty average. But, here in this little town where I live, I am an original; a one of a kind.\nEveryone knows my name, my family, my history. This little farm town in nowhere Michigan is the only place that I have ever known, the place I call home. Nothing new happens, and life goes on just fine. I can't wait to get out of this place as soon as I graduate. I am not sure where to yet. But as many things that I love about this town, I can't stay here.  \nHow else should I start this, oh, perhaps the most important thing about my story, is, that it is not about me at all. I mean, I am aware that I am quite an intriguing individual, but no, this story is about my best friend. His name is Byron Rood. He is the boy that my life revolves around. In this little town, he gives me hope, and he makes me believe that anything is possible.  \nByron is the boy that was never meant to be here in the first place, he is like an oddity put here by mistake. In a place full of normality, he radiates eccentricity. Take his looks for example. His hair is the black that shines so bright it seems almost blue. He grows it long, and every girl gazes in his direction as he walks past. His eyes are the darkest brown you've ever seen. Their hint of sparkle like pieces of Smoky Quartz. He is beautiful, almost ethereal.  \nNow, you may thinking, he must be conceited, a beauty like this. But, that is another thing about him- he is humble and kind. He is that person who excels at everything he ever attempts. The kind of person most people can't help but like, as much as they want to hate him. For example, I have been competing with him for valedictorian since we hit freshman year. He seems to have a much easier time achieving A's than I do; a natural intelligence It infuriates me! But how can you hate someone who will stop at the drop of a hat to help you out, no questions asked, just because that same someone kicked your ass on the last Calculus test?  \nYes, this is a story about a boy who was dumped on this earth, full of the life in a way that some of us never find. \"Just another story about a boy?\" you might ask. But this is not just a story about any boy. This tale is of my boy.\nWant to read the rest of chapter one? Check out my blog listed below! Still not sure about it?

I have associate degree in communications and am currently pursuing my bachelor degree in business from Western Michigan University. \nRight now I am living in St. Louis, Missouri, but I love traveling. In the last two years I have lived in Michigan, Alaska, Colorado, and Missouri. I work in National Parks and restaurants in the surrounding areas. I LOVE seeing the world and meeting new people, the different cultures just within the USA is amazing.\nHobbies of mine? I love music, playing guitar and singing is my way to relax after a long day of work and school. I also love to read and write, this will be my first novel, with many more to come! \nThis novel is based upon my Senior year of high school when my friend, Bryan committed suicide, although the book itself gives the characters many more choices than I ever had. Having my best friend commit suicide changed my life, and made me realize that life is very fragile, so we may as well live it to the fullest. \nI hope that this book will bring awareness to teen depression and suicide, because it happens much more often than you would think.\nHave any more questions? Ask away!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI understand rejection happens, time and time again, especially in the publishing industry where the market is always changing.

Sketched out some coupon layout ideas, then put it all together on the computer to finalize the design. Then I printed it, bound it, and BAM! Romantic gift complete! And boyfriend of the year award received! Hahaha :D My girlfriend loved it!! From cuddle sessions, to romantic massages, to stay at home movie nights complete with building a fort to sleep in - she loved it all! \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nSeveral weeks ago I reached out to some local gift shops, book stores and companies about my Love Coupon book. I recently received some emails and calls from them, so I showed them the version I made for my girlfriend, and they loved it! They are considering stocking my product in their stores, but they will need to see physical samples before they can commit to the idea, or place orders. That's where Kickstarter comes in. I can't afford to print these books, and I need to do this ASAP so I can show them some samples. So this project is to raise some funds in order for me to print some samples.\nI also know first hand, that money can be tight at times, so I wanted to share this love coupon book with all you romantics out there. It's just $1, and is a simple DIY project that will add a lot of spice to your love life! Not the hot pepper spice, but the other kind. :D I made some changes and edits to the book to make it even more awesome and romantic as well!

It's time for change! And that's why we decided to create this deck of good deeds. We want kids to learn how to be kind to others while they're young, and carry those lessons with them for life! Will this deck solve every problem there is? No, but it's a damn good start!  We can make a difference. We need to act together, and grow together as a community, or this is all just a waste of time.\n\"My Deck of Good Deeds\" contains 56 cards (53 Good Deed challenge cards and 3 Award cards). The good deed challenge cards range in difficulty, from easy to more challenging (requiring more time to complete, creativity and/or help from a friend or parent).\nReceive award cards for your progress. 3 to earn in the deck.\nNot final box, or card back design.\nDeedtags has been in the making for about 5 years now. We're very happy with the progress we've made so far, but we know we can grow even faster and make an even bigger impact if we create fresh ideas that engage people of all ages. The smartphone app and book of 100 good deeds are fun and accessible for teens and adults. For kids, we feel the deck of good deeds would be a fun way for them to learn about kindness.\nWe're using Kickstarter as our platform, because it allows us to introduce Deedtags to a global audience. Issues like bullying, racism, hate based on sexual orientation and much more, are global in nature. We're all affected by them. By supporting our cause, you're showing that as a community, we care about kindness and won't just accept the horrible things we see happening every day.\nWe've used all the funds we have to pay for the smartphone app, merchandise, promotional material and book of 100 deeds. We're printing these good deed decks through USPCC (The United States Playing Card Company) and their minimum order is 2500 decks. That will drive the cost per unit down, yes, but it's still going to cost quite a few bucks to order even just the minimum! And that's why we need your help!!!\nThank you (Your name here) ________________ in advance!!! :D\nWe've got a variety of spiffy awards for everyone. ALL REWARD PACKAGES COME WITH GOOD KARMA!!! :D\nDetails on the wristbands, pins, shirts and book.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've completed all the artwork and files for the deck of cards already, so if this campaign is successful (and we hope it will be), all we need to do is send the files off to USPCC to print. We will make sure to follow up with them on a regular basis (but not to the point of harassment), to make sure we are on schedule. If there are any problems at all, we will be sure to keep all of you in the loop, because as a backer of this project, you deserve to know everything! Not just the good stuff, but the other things too! Of course, we are hoping for no bad things!\n\nWe made sure to add a bit of wiggle room to all of the reward package delivery dates. Anything can happen, and we wanted to make sure that was taken into consideration. \n\nIf this campaign turns out to be a huge success, bigger than we anticipated, we have friends and family on standby, who are ready to volunteer their time to make sure we meet the delivery dates! You saw some of these \u201cvolunteers\u201d in the video! ;) lol \n\nIn terms of the other items in the reward packages (the books, wristbands, button pins etc.), we have most of these items in stock, ready for delivery. \n\nAs for the commissioned artwork, I never rush my art as it may compromise the quality. So I have made the delivery dates on the artwork rewards a bit later in the year. Just a reminder, for anyone who selects a reward level that includes artwork, the delivery date listed on the Kickstarter page is just for the custom artwork alone. All of the merchandise in that pledge level will be delivered in May 2015.\n\nWe are extremely excited to see what happens with this, and to see what all of you and your children do to make this world a better place!

People in dangerous jobs need protection, and dangerous situations need less aggression. The BulletSafe Bulletproof Baseball Cap offers discreet protection while looking professional and approachable. It's a great way for people to stay safe.\nA Prototype of the BulletSafe Bulletproof Baseball Cap\nThe BulletSafe Bulletproof Baseball Cap is comfortable, lightweight, easy to wear, and offers the same frontal protection area as a ballistic helmet. \nFrom Prototype to Production\nShown (from left): A polymer mock-up of the panel; a paper pattern; and a shooting sample made from a helmet section.  Turning these items into production parts costs lots of money. Making parts strong enough to stop a bullet requires high-temperature/high-pressure tooling. It is expensive. With your help we can overcome this cost and offer this hat for far less than a ballistic helmet.  \nFeatures\nWe start with the finest baseball cap we can find. A Flexfit, Twill, Six-Panel hat in one of three sizes. We modify it to include the BulletSafe ballistic panel. The result is a handsome look with great protection. The hat will come in three sizes: Small, Medium/Large, and XL/2X.   \nSuccessful Test Prototype\nOur test prototypes stopped rounds up to NIJ Level IIA.  We expect to offer protection of NIJ level IIA with our production hat. If so, the hat will stop .40, 9mm and .38 caliber rounds.\nMore Information About Our Project's History:This project began in January of 2014.  The initial spark occurred at a trade show when I was repeatedly asked if we made ballistic helmets.  I thought \"yuck! I don't want to make those, they look ridiculous in a civilian environment.\" But ignoring a number of customers is always a bad idea.  I decided to develop something different.  \nWe built our first prototype in March of 2014.  We molded clay off of a mannequin head and tried it in a baseball cap.  It wasn't perfect, but there was something there.  Further prototypes continued as I worked on the fit and size of the panel through the summer. \nSeptember, 2014 - I hired a patent attorney to do a patent search and was surprised to see that no patents existed on a bulletproof baseball cap. I was clear to invent ours.\nOctober - I began wear-testing mock ballistic panels to see if they would be comfortable enough to wear every day.  They did well.  The panel was light enough and baseball caps have enough space in them that they were unobtrusive.  Here is a picture of me at a live pumpkin carving performance wearing one.  Spiderman approves.\nNovember 2014 - Once we got the shape right, we made a shootable prototype.  That test is shown in this video. The sounds quality is a little rough due to the ventilation system in the range and I stumble on the words a bit, but it worked!  \nBulletSafe Bulletproof Baseball Cap - Prototype Test Video\nPLAY\n\nIn late November I was ready to get tooling estimates for the production tooling.  The best estimate was $19,000.  It was too much.  I thought the project was done.  \nThat evening my wife told me not to give up on the bulletproof hat.   Our sales representative Jennifer (who's voice can be heard in the shooting video) said that she thought customers would buy it.  I guess deep down inside I had believed as well, I had already chosen the cover photo of our 2015 catalog and on it I am wearing one.  \nWe decided that Kickstarter might save the project.  Your pledges to buy could provide some of the capital required to start the project and your votes would demonstrate support.  A successful Kickstarter would also show our existing retailers that people want these hats.  \nWhy Is Our Goal So Low?\nWe decided to set the goal at $3,500.  It is a small amount compared to the tooling cost, but it is a Kickstart for the project.  $3,500 is enough to get us to put the weight of our company behind it. It is the minimum amount we need to promise with 100% certainty that we will deliver your merchandise.    \nProject Delivery Timeline:\nJanuary 2015 - Kickstarter Project Duration \nJanuary 2015 - ANME and SHOT Tradeshows - We will be showing the prototypes and accepting pre-orders\nFebruary 2015 - Tooling ordered, Non-bulletproof caps shipped\nApril 2015 - First prototypes from production-level tools \nMay 2015 - Ballistics testing at Oregon Ballistic Laboratories (OBL)\nJune 2015 - Possible material adjustments based upon May testing\nAugust 2015 - Second round of ballistic testing at OBL\nSeptember 2015 - Production panels produced\nOctober 2015 - Cap production begins, Rewards start shipping\nNovember 2015 - All rewards shipped.  \nReward Infographic\nGiving The BulletSafe Bulletproof Baseball Cap as a Gift?

Have you ever watched an episode of Scooby Doo and wished that, just once, those meddling kids didn\u2019t get in the bad guy\u2019s way?\nDevil\u2019s Bluff is the game that will give you that chance!\nAn online-only isometric action game for up to 10 people for Windows, Mac, and Linux (and hopefully Tablets and Consoles), our goal is to put you inside a new type of survival horror game where every character you encounter is another player - and one of them is a killer.\nAn experience filled with cooperation and competition, you'll be asked to use your twitch-based reflexes, powers of deduction, and voice chat to find a way to outwit the killer (with or without the help of others) and make it out alive.\nDevil's Bluff tells the tale of a group of friends who decide to rent out the world's most haunted Mansion to compete in a scavenger hunt tied to the lore of the old house itself. It's all going great, until someone decides to ruin the fun by promising to kill everyone at the party.\nThe only way to make it out alive? Work together to finish the scavenger hunt before Devil finishes you.\nAnd how will it all play out? Minute-to-minute gameplay will involve a few core concepts we'd like to familiarize you with. Here's your cheat sheet:\nPlaying as the Survivors:\nMost of you poor schleps will be stuck playing one of the remaining Survivors. You'll have to hope for a little teamwork and smart thinking, or your night may end with the rest of these saps getting you killed. The game will feature a wide variety of costumes, but each player will have the exact same skills and attributes, keeping the playing field level, simple, and fast-paced.\nThe Survivor gameplay experience focuses on:\n\nThe Scavenger Hunt\nPlayers will be paired in teams of two to compete in the scavenger hunt, where they\u2019ll be asked to track down 10 items, each identified by unique clues. To keep every game fresh, elements of the scavenger hunt will be randomized each play-through:\nItem Location: The items themselves will have dozens of potential hiding places, including out in the open, inside hidden compartments, deep inside secret passageways, and lost locations inside the Mansions giant hedge maze.\nItem Order: Teams will chase the same items one-by-one, but will be given them in a different order. This not only encourages teams to split up, but also gives added incentive to see other fail, as they may have tracked down clues you\u2019ve yet to uncover, allowing you to loot your way into the lead.\nExploring the Mansion\nThe Mansion itself is full of secrets, many of which require a teammate to fully exploit. Their triggers and locations will move each game, keeping the sense of exploration alive with each new game. Once they have been found, these secrets will become highlighted in the game world and your in-game map, allowing easy access for players who take the time to fully explore the world.\n Here are some examples:\nSecret Passageways: Like a mini Pac-man maze, the Mansion is packed with a network of hidden tunnels that serve as shortcuts to other areas, but the switches used to open doors will always be far enough away that a fellow player will have to let you in. This means players who are being chased will have to act quickly to help each other avoid an untimely demise, and players who aren\u2019t exactly thrilled with their teammates will have opportunities to ditch their buddies.\nPeep Holes: Passageways will also be peppered with peep holes, which can be used to spy on other players. If you can see other players, you\u2019ll also be able to hear them, which means you might catch Devil in the act, see your partner conspiring with another group, or hear key info from other teams about who they think is the killer.\nTrap Doors: Since the switches to these doors are randomized, we thought it would be fun to have them serve a duel purpose: opening trap doors that separate players!These might accidently split you up from a teammate, or be used to get rid of unwanted hangers-on. You can even use them to ditch Devil!\nSliding Staircases: Another element triggered by switches will be sliding staircases, which will case players to fall to the bottom and end up stunned. This will allow players who time it right to slow down Devil and opposing teams at critical moments.\nDeathtraps: Another critical element of the Mansion are \u201cdeathtraps.\u201d Things like broken railways on balconies and staircases, trap doors that lead to pits of spikes, switches that cause poison arrows to shoot out of holes in the wall\u2026you know, the sort of stuff you can use to send Devil (or other Survivors) to an early grave. They will require perfect positioning and solid timing, but will come in very handy if you can pull it off.\nHiding Places: But maybe you\u2019re a love, not a fighter. Or a coward. Whatever. The Mansion will have plenty of dark corners, hidden cubby holes, and more to allow you to give Devil the slip. Provided he\u2019s not already there waiting, of course.\nReal Talk with Real People\nUnlike most games that feature audio chat, Devil\u2019s Bluff features proximity-based audio, which means the closer you are to another player the louder they become. \nYou can use this to your advantage in situations like:\nListen closely to hear others moving about in the Mansion.\nTalk with your partner to share intel.\nEavesdrop and listen in on other team\u2019s conversations.\nTip off other players when you\u2019ve seen the killer in action.\nSlapstick Combat\nOnly Devil can deal melee damage, but you'll be able to whap your fellow survivors for fun or strategic purposes.\nHere's some more details:\nPlayers can be slapped in any direction, and will bounce off solid surfaces, giving you the ability to \u201cpinball\u201d them around.\nThis can be used to knock player\u2019s out of harm\u2019s way, but can also be used to thrust your competition into trouble.\nOnce they\u2019ve been slapped, they\u2019ll be briefly stunned. This will disable their audio and movement capabilities for a brief period, letting you get a word in edgewise (or allowing Devil to move in for the kill).\nRun For Your Lives!\nDevil\u2019s Bluff will feature a Mario Bros.\u00ad-esque walk/run system with a unique sprinting mechanic. Unlike most games that allow you to sprint for a limited period of time, you\u2019ll be able to sprint as long as you like, with one condition: The longer you hold down the run button, the more likely you are to trip in classic horror movie chase scene fashion. This will add a risk-reward element to movement while being pursued, for both the Survivors and Devil, so plan your escape route carefully!\nCapture Devil For the Win\nProvided everyone can work together, it is possible to capture Devil once enough info has been gathered on his or her identity. Here\u2019s the basics of how it will work:\nAny player who has seen Devil\u2019s true identity can attempt to initiate a capture in a button-mashing mini-game similar to an old-school NES Track \u2018N Field tug of war.\nDevil is stronger than the survivors, so they\u2019ll have to gang up on him to pull it off.\nIf you collectively strong-arm Devil into submission and you\u2019re guess is right, you all live to see another day!\nHowever, if players decide not to help, or they get over-powered by Devil, they will take significant damage, which could easily lead to a massive shift in the fight for survival.\nPlaying as Devil\nEach game session, one lucky player gets to play as our mild-mannered maniac, Devil, where they'll get to see how good their killer instincts really are.\nDevil has been planning this murderous romp for some time, leading to some key gameplay advantages vs. the standard Survivor toolkit: \nHidden Identity: Devil will start the game in costume just like the other Survivors, but he or she will be able to rapidly switch between that costume and the alternate Devil outfit, allowing for surprise kills, subterfuge, and more.\nThe Evil Eye: Devil has extensive knowledge of all the traps and tricks the Mansion has to offer. Just like players who have discovered a hidden element, Devil will be able to automatically see every unseen aspect of the Mansion without having to discover it first.\nSkeleton Key: Devil works alone, so in addition to The Evil Eye, they will also have access to a skeleton key, which will allow him or her to open hidden passageways without the aid of others.\nThe Pitchfork: Last but not least, Devil wields the best (and only) weapon in the Mansion, the mighty-mighty pitchfork. It takes a while to lower the boom, so you\u2019ll have to plan your strikes carefully, but when you land them, look out!\nAfter promising to send him an impossibly adorable Puggle picture at least once a day, we finally convinced Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman to help us score an eerily orchestral soundtrack that blends classic chiptune chirps with a Sega CD level of audio juiciness.\nThe soundtrack will be available via Bandcamp as a name your price purchase once we ship, and if you select the right tier, you\u2019ll be able to get your mitts on the music before anyone else.\nPump up your woefully insufficient laptop speakers and jam out to his first taste of audio awesomesauce here:\nAfter slaving away for \u201cThe Man\u201d on aggressively mediocre licensed games and an endless line of soul-sucking sequels, we finally decided to fight the good fight and bring some original IP to the world. With veteran developers who\u2019ve shipped games for the likes of EA, Ubisoft, Sega, 2K, and more, the team is ready to put everything we have into Devil\u2019s Bluff. We\u2019re making this as much for you folks as we are for us, and we\u2019re excited to have you along for the journey.

We\u2019ve got your back, people! Get your face in the game in one of the Mansion\u2019s numerous wacky family portraits and help us class this joint up a little.\nWe\u2019d be lying if we didn\u2019t confess that we lazily sip bourbon by firelight on a near-nightly basis, but if we hit our Kickstarter goal, we\u2019re kicking this bad boy off by throwing down, KBJ style! If you\u2019re a Backer on any of our high-end tiers and can get to Cincinnati, OH, you\u2019re officially invited to come help us put a dent in our bar tab as we ramble on about the game and how awesome you all are for helping us make it a reality.\nFinally, in the event that any of our independently wealthy potential Backers decide to drop the big bucks on the Bluff, we\u2019re pulling out all the stops. We\u2019ll fly you out for a 3-day visit to meet the team on Halloween of next year, show you all the behind-the-scenes stuff we hide on our dev chats with clever camera angles, play a livestreamed match for bragging rights for the whole community to watch, hit up a haunted house, and last but not least, cruise the mean streets of Cincinnati for some life-altering shenanigans. All you have to do is sign a waiver ensuring our lawyers you won\u2019t sue us in the event you, like, lose a limb or something. Pretty standard stuff, really.\nThe Deal with PS4, PS Vita, Xbox One & Wii U\nTime will tell which platforms you Bluffers help bring to life, but everyone who purchase a copy of the game (yes, even you, Champion of Early-Birdness!) get to choose the platform of their choice once the campaign has ended.\nNew Game Modes: Even More Ways to Be a Weasel\nThere's a handful of game modes we've decided are locked into certain Goals (such as Double Trouble Mode, where two Devils can co-operate to eliminate the survivors or compete against each other to determine who oozes more evil), but the rest?\nYou guys will determine which modes make the cut by popular vote, choosing between options like:\nSole Survivor Mode - In this timed mode, all players play the role of Devil but one. Luckily, they have a Mansion Map and a Skeleton Key that instantly opens up all secret passageways. How long can you survive?\nEvery Devil for Themselves - Everyone is a bad guy in this free-for-all  Devil deathmatch mode. We fully anticipate some WWE-style battle royal madness here. Temporary teamwork, weaker Devils running away from fights, and mounting tension as the player pool dwindles will undoubtedly be in the cards. The jury's still out on a folding chair to the face, but we'll try our best.\nMimic Mode - In this sneaky slice of Bluff, Devil will be able to steal the costume from each survivor he or she kills, adding to their arsenal of deception with each death. Easily the amateur voice actor's favorite.\nAnd many more! We'll even bring the best community suggestions into the mix.\nGet Gussied Up with Costume Party Packs\nIf you crashed as many Halloween parties as we did this year, we're pretty sure you saw some sweet get-ups. We did, and we were left with tons of ideas for new Survivor costumes for the final retail version of the game.\nAs such, as we hope to use a portion of certain Stretch Goals to add several 4-Costume Party Packs featuring new threads that you will get to vote into the game via 2-step process.\nFirst up, you'll choose the costume type. Want to see a clown and a lion tamer? Vote them in! Think clowns are evil, terrifying blights on a restful sleep? Vote in a pirate and ninja instead!\nFinally, we'll provide a series of sketches for each costume, and Backers will vote on their favorite version of the costume y'all have chosen and WHAMMY! It's in the game. Take that, EA Sports. Kidding. Please don't sue us.\nThe more Bluffers we can amass in the Kickstarter Mansion, the better this game will be, so we'd really appreciate you spreading the word.\nBut before you head out the door and start harassing random people on the street on our behalf, here's a few ways you can promote the project without abandoning the confines of your oh-so-comfy couches:\nLike Us On Facebook\nFollow Us on Twitter \nVisit Our Website\nOf course, when that's done, you're more than welcome to go solicit strangers wearing that once-worn Halloween costume you just stashed away in the closet. Just don't expect us to pay your bail if things get weird. Printing up t-shirts that say \"Free [Kickstarter Backer Name Here]\" is pretty much our limit.\nLastly, we are a proud member of the Kicking It Forward community: http://kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy now, you\u2019ve read enough of these \u201cRisks and Challenges\u201d thingies to get that making games is tough. Bringing a concept like Devil\u2019s Bluff to life will be no different, as we\u2019re looking to blend old-school gameplay values with never-before-seen mechanics that rely on both competition and cooperation, and finding that balance will be tricky. Luckily, we have a team with over 20 shipped titles under there belts across 11 platforms and our biggest secret weapon: all of you. We\u2019ve spent tons of time refining the core concepts of the game, and plan to work tirelessly to test, tune and perfect the art of backstabbing with our Backers until we\u2019ll find the right balance of strategy, technique and fun that will make Devil\u2019s Bluff a unique, memorable experience unlike any other.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "KBJ Games\n2 created \u00b7 13 backed\nKBJ Games is an independent game development studio started in 2013 by Keyur B.

With Love Your Face, you can be both.\n#2 OUR SPECIAL INGREDIENT \u2013 AN ANCIENT HEALING HERB: \nWhile researching ingredients for our formula, we discovered a forgotten, ancient herb call Plantain (not the banana-like plant, though!), so powerful, Native Americans referred to it as \u201clife medicine.\u201d\nUsed by cultures around the world for centuries, this herb not only works as an anti-inflammatory, it's an all-natural analgesic and antioxidant that has also been found to enhance the effectiveness of SPF in sunscreens.\nLove Your Face is the very FIRST skincare line that uses this herb in an entire line of natural products. Scroll down to the \"Our Special Ingredient\" section to learn more about this amazing plant.\n#3 MINIMALIST:\nLess is more. You don't need bottles of half-used, chemical-based skincare products piling up in your bathroom cabinet \u2013 you need something that you'll use and something that works.\n\nLove Your Face puts an end to counter clutter with a simple five-product line of essential skincare products. Plus, the bold, and beautiful containers are so sleek, you won't want to hide them.\n#4 FEARLESS:\nLove Your Face is a social enterprise with a mission that goes beyond simply creating high-quality, all-natural skincare. Every year, we'll give a percentage of our profits back to the community through our FEARLESS FUND to help other women who want to change their lives and the lives of others through entrepreneurial and community-based projects. \n#5 ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS:\n100% of the ingredients we source are natural, so we think it's extremely important to take care of the planet we all live on. All of our packaging \u2013 from our glass bottles to our packing material \u2013 is eco-friendly, reusable, or fully recyclable.\nBy becoming a backer of this project, you will help us launch this movement, and in exchange, you will receive Love Your Face products (and some great bonuses) at a highly discounted price.\nSample-Size Kits vs. Full-Size Kits\nSample-size kits contain our cleanser, scrub, mask and lotion in 1oz glass jars. Full-size kits contain 4oz glass jars of our mask, scrub, and lotion and 8oz glass bottles of our cleanser and spray.\nFearless Weekend\nIf there's a gap between where you are in life right now and where you want to be, the Fearless Weekend is for you. You'll join dozens of other fearless women for a powerful weekend of fun and growth in the heart of trendy Nashville, TN.\n\nFor two days, from August 29 - 30, 2015, we'll help you find the clarity, confidence and courage to lead the life you've always wanted to live. You'll discover how to boldly unleash your gifts onto the world while you make life-long friendships with other passionate women.\n\n(Sorry guys, this is for women only!)\nSpa & Adventure Day\nThe day after the Fearless Weekend is YOUR day. We're taking up to six women for a full day of adventure and rejuvenation.\n\nWe'll start the day with breakfast at one of Nashville's most popular restaurants. Afterward, we'll take you just outside Nashville for a team building, zip line tour through the beautiful landscape of Tennessee. You'll be served a gourmet, all vegetarian lunch and, in the afternoon, we'll head to the spa for two relaxing treatments. For dinner, we'll take you to another Nashville hot-spot for incredible food and great company.\n\nIt'll be a day you'll never forget, not only because of the experiences you'll have, but because of the life-long friendships that will be created.

Everyday, they're a daily reminder of what it takes to live life fearlessly.\nThrough extensive research and help from horticulturist Ashlyn Morgan, we discovered an ancient herb that's been used for thousands of years to sooth and heal skin.\nYet, this amazing plant has been all but lost to our culture over the last several decades...until now.\nThis ancient healing herb is Plantago Major. It's more commonly known as \u201cPlantain\u201d (although it's different than the banana-like plant with the same name).\nWhen we traced this plant back through history, what we found was incredible...\nLove Your Face is the VERY FIRST skincare company to use plantain for its entire line of products. And we will source our plantain locally from female farmer & horticulturalist, Ashlyn Morgan, who will grow it exclusively for us in a special, apothecary garden on her 50-acre organic farm in East Tennessee (starting in Spring 2015).\nPlantain is great for your skin because it is...\nOur broader mission at Love Your Face is to create a company that helps and empowers other women. Creating a skincare line that allows you feel beautiful and confident about the way you look is one way we do that. Another way is through the FEARLESS FUND.\nThe FEARLESS FUND provides scholarships and training for women who want to open businesses or start community projects that positively affect the community. Once a year, we'll run a contest and award financial support to women who have great ideas and want to turn those ideas into reality. (Note: Kickstarter funds will not go towards FF scholarships.)\nWe believe that women who follow their dreams are unstoppable. And we want to be a part of the ripple effect of positive change that spreads throughout the world when we start taking action to create better lives for ourselves and others.\nWe've made small, test market batches of Love Your Face products, but the funds raised via Kickstarter will help us to fully develop and package Love Your Face, so it's ready for release to the public.\nThe moment this campaign ends, we'll ship Holiday Gift Cards so backers will have them in time to give as gifts to friends and family. We'll finalize our formulation and order the materials needed to start bulk production\u2014ingredients, bottles, packaging, and labels. Manufacturing will start in January 2015 and we'll start taking orders at LYFace.com. Rewards to all backers will be shipped by March 2015.\nBusiness website setup (shopping cart, plugins, etc.) \u2013 3%\nBusiness entity set up (trademarks, insurance, etc.) \u2013 8%\nSourcing organic plantain from TN \u2013 15%\nPurchasing eco-friendly containers and packaging \u2013 36%\nProducing the product line in bulk batches \u2013 14%\nPurchasing essential business supplies (label printer, work tables, etc.) \u2013 11%\nExtras (shipping, t-shirts, marketing, etc.) \u2013 13%\nShipping anywhere inside the USA is free. International backers will be responsible for shipping fees and any applicable tariffs and/or customs fees.\nFive years ago, I got home from work one evening, walked straight into my bathroom and dumped all of my makeup and skincare into the trashcan. I was done with being a victim of the beauty industry.\nEarlier that day, I'd discovered that every single one of my regular beauty products\u2014the lotions, cleansers, shampoos, lip balms, and makeup brands I'd used and trusted for more than a decade\u2014 contained carcinogens.\nHow could a company release something known to cause cancer?\nI researched the topic further and learned the majority of skincare products on the market contain this type of thing \u2013 harsh chemicals and synthetics like parabens, phthalates, tricoloson, sodium laureth sulfate and more. They are skin irritants, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens.\nCHECK OUT WHAT I DISCOVERED...\nBreastCancerFund.org: \u201cIn the U.S., major loopholes in federal law allow the cosmetics industry to put thousands of synthetic chemicals into personal care products, even if those chemicals are linked to cancer, infertility or birth defects.\u201d \nNaturalNews.com: \u201cCommon, brand-name skin care products often contain multiple chemical contaminants known to cause cancer, liver disorders and neurological disorders.\u201d \u2013 \nHuffingtonPost.com: \u201cParabens possess estrogen-mimicking properties that are associated with increased risk of breast cancer. These chemicals are absorbed through the skin and have been identified in biopsy samples from breast tumors. They can be found in makeup, body washes, deodorants, shampoos and facial cleansers.\u201d \u2013 \nEnvironmental Working Group: \"One of every five adults is potentially exposed every day to all of the top seven carcinogenic impurities common to personal care product ingredients.\"  \nLivestrong.com: \u201cMethylparaben is used as a fragrance and as a preservative ingredient in skin care products, according to the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database. It is toxic to non-reproductive organs in the human body and may cause cancer, skin irritation, neurotoxicity and may disrupt endocrine function.\u201d  \nBeing Beautiful Shouldn't Kill You\nThe majority of skincare products on the market should come with an overt Surgeon General's warning on the front like cigarettes.\nBut they don't. And they probably never will.\nSo it's up to each of us to learn the risks involved with using these products and find a better solution for ourselves.\nLove Your Face is that solution.\nAfter throwing away my entire beauty regimen, I made it my mission to find products that would work in harmony with my body and not against it. You shouldn't have to risk your health to look and feel beautiful.\nWhen Laurel Met Kate\nWhen I met Kate years later, I discovered that as an aesthetician, she'd been on the same quest to find natural products for herself and her clients. We immediately bonded over our shared passion.\nWhile Kate and I were having coffee one day, the idea for Love Your Face was born. Instead of continuing to search high and low for natural products that met our high standards, we decided to create our own.\nSo that's exactly what we did. But it didn't stop at a skincare line...\nFrom the moment we came up with the idea for Love Your Face, we wanted our mission to be more than just healthy beauty products. We wanted to start a movement of fearlessness.\nOur goal is to help you push fear aside, feel fully confident about yourself, and follow your dreams. That's why we named the company \u201cLove Your Face\u201d, designed packaging with bold & inspiring statements, and launched the FEARLESS FUND. Every bit of Love Your Face has been designed with the fearless woman in mind.\nLAUREL STAPLES \u2013 COFOUNDER + VISIONARY + CHOCOHOLIC\nLaurel Staples is an engineer-turned-entrepreneur.

In fact, thermal comfort isn't about temperature alone. That is why Ambi Climate takes into a consideration sunlight, temperature, humidity and other elements to maintain a more comfortable, energy efficient interior environment.\nThe device also learns from your own preferences and daily routine, and will tailor your indoor climate around you and your family. \nBy making your aircon usage more efficient, Ambi Climate can easily cut your energy bill by a third.\nKey Features\nWhat People Are Saying\n\u201cWith the room temperature staying more consistent, you're saving both energy and the hassle of finding the remote.\u201d - Richard Lai, Engadget\n\u201cIt's a popular campaign - with 35 days to go, the project is at about 240 percent of its funding goal.\u201d - Steven Sande, TUAW\n\u201cAmbi Climate might be well-positioned to pick up the parts of the market not covered by Nest\u201d - Darrell Etherington, TechCrunch\n\u201cThis tiny iPhone-connected device can help you save money on air conditioning\u201d - Chris Smith, BGR\n\u201c[Ambi Climate] will make any window air conditioner an iPhone-connected device with temperature and other predictive climate control features.\u201d - Jordan Kahn, 9to5Mac\n\"\u30a8\u30a2\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u300cAmbi Climate\u300d\u201d - Gizmodo Japan\n \u3054\u5bb6\u5ead\u306e\u30a8\u30a2\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u624b\u8efd\u306a\u8ce2\u3055\u3092\u3002\u300cAmbi Climate\u300d\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30a8\u30a2\u30b3\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01- \u7de8\u96c6\u90e8, Spotry.me\n               How Ambi Climate Works\n    Ambi Mode: Intelligent & Automatic Climate Control\nAmbi Climate allows for automatic control of your air conditioner through its intelligent algorithms with \"Ambi Mode\". Throughout the day, the Ambi Cloud continuously analyses your home\u2019s climate characteristics, your air conditioner\u2019s performance and local weather conditions in order to come up with the best settings for your own personal comfort.\nAmbi Mode: Ambi Climate Continues To Adjust Your AC Automatically\nWhile your air conditioner does its temperature sensing from within the unit, Ambi Climate uses its own set of sensors to collect data closer to where you are in the room, providing a more relevant reading than your AC.\nWith Ambi Climate's companion app on iOS and Android, you will also be able to take full control of your home's air conditioners wherever you are.\nTailored Around Your Temperature Preferences\nWe know that every person has their own varying thermal comfort preferences. Some of us will always prefer it cooler than others. Using our smartphone companion app you can have Ambi Climate adjust your indoor temperature to either a cooler or warmer setting. \nSimply choose in the companion app whether you are too hot or too cold.\nGiven the temperature choice you have made, our Ambi Cloud system saves a snapshot of your current indoor and outdoor climate conditions. This allows Ambi Climate to better understand what feels comfortable to you under the saved conditions. Ambi Climate will learn from these snapshots so that its prediction algorithms become tailored around your own thermal comfort preferences.\nAmbi Climate is also able to balance the individual temperature preferences of your family.\n               Remote Access To Your AC Wherever You Are\nAmbi Climate allows you to remotely monitor and control your home\u2019s air conditioning.\nWith Ambi Climate app's \"Manual mode\", you can manually switch on/off your AC and adjust other air conditioning settings such as fan speed, temperature and humidity levels. \nAway Mode: Maintain Humidity / Temperature Levels\nIf you are away for longer durations, you can always set Ambi Climate to \u201cAway mode\u201d. Away Mode allows you to maintain certain temperature and humidity levels at home, so that your pet can remain comfortable or you prevent mould growth when you are away on vacation.\nSet to \"Away Mode\" to maintain desired humidity and temperature levels when not at home.\nReduces Wasteful Overcooling & Temperature Fluctuations\nThe ability of air conditioners to maintain a certain temperature can fluctuate depending on their age and conditions. Our own tests have shown that at times your actual room temperature can be as much as 11\u02daF (6\u02daC) off from the desired temperature you have set on your AC\u2019s remote.\nSet & forget. Ambi Climate allows you to maintain a constant climate.\nThis often hurts both your comfort and energy consumption as your air conditioner can easily end up overcooling your home due to these inaccuracies.\nWith Ambi Climate, you no longer need to think about whether 76\u02daF or 77\u02daF (or alternatively 24\u02daC or 25\u02daC) is comfortable to you. Just set it to automatic climate control via Ambi mode, which will make sure that you always enjoy a comfortable indoor climate.\nLocation Aware: Turns Your AC Automatically On/Off\nGeo & Micro Location: Ambi Climate can switch on/off your AC based on your location.\nAmbi Climate's app tracks your geo-location and micro-location allowing us to automatically turn on your AC before you get home, and turn off your AC when nobody is present in a particular room. Ambi Climate's location awareness allows you to arrive at a cool home and at the same time you get to avoid cooling empty rooms.\nData Insights\nData Insights: Monitor your AC usage and energy consumption.\nThe Ambi Climate iPhone and Android app also gives you insight into how certain conditions feel in your home via Humidex, a measure that has been shown to correlate strongly with indoor human comfort. Through this measure, you will start to get a feel for how certain thermal conditions correspond to different levels of energy consumption -- which you can also better understand via our proprietary energy consumption estimator.\n               Ambi Climate Air Conditioner Compatibility\n    Ambi Climate works with all sort of air conditioners from all over the world, including AC models popular in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and of course North America. Our smart home device supports wall-mounted split and mini split air conditioners as well as window and portable standing air conditioners. Even ACs used in offices such as cassette air conditioners are compatible with Ambi Climate. All they require is infrared connectivity.\n* Can't find your remote? Don't worry, we are adding new remotes nearly every day. Just fill out this request form and we can add yours to the database within a couple of days.\nInstallation & Setup\nAmbi Climate is easy to install, requiring no additional expertise or tools. Just plug it in, and position the Ambi Climate device practically anywhere in the same room as your aircon. With 5 powerful infrared transmitters, the signal is almost guaranteed to reach your air conditioner from anywhere within the room. Place Ambi Climate close to you to make sure it\u2019s measuring the same conditions that you experience - on your bedside table, or on the shelf behind your sofa.\nPlace Ambi Climate anywhere you want.\nSetup is also a breeze - all you need to do is to download the free iOS or Android companion app from the Apple App Store or Google Play, and you\u2019ll be up and running within minutes. Just enter your WiFi network details and pair the Ambi Climate device to your AC. Our proprietary algorithm matches your AC to the remote codes in our database, so that you don\u2019t have to \u201cteach\u201d Ambi Climate your codes.\n    API & Integrations\nLooking at building a connected home? Home automation enthusiast? Ambi Climate will offer up an open API and IFTTT (If This Then That) integration.\nThis will open up your Ambi Climate and your AC to a new world of possibilities. Thanks to an open API, you will be able to integrate your Ambi Climate with a range of smart home hubs such as SmartThings, Revolv and Quirky's Wink.\nBy using IFTTT, your Ambi Climate will also be able to connect to all kinds of gadgets and services that can act as triggers for Ambi Climate such as SMS, Twitter, Facebook, Google Drive, Android Wear, Android/iPhone notifications as well as smart home appliances and wearables such as the Philips Hue, Jawbone Up, Fitbit, Belkin Wemo Switch, Nest, the Netatmo Weather Station and many more.\nThe possibilities will be endless. Eventually your air conditioner will be able to connect with just about anything in your house or apartment.\nWhat is the Limited Edition of Beta Units?\nBacking the Limited Edition is your chance to become part of our journey and play an active role in our product development. We believe Kickstarter is a great community, filled with eager early adopters who share our vision of the home of the future.\nLimited Edition beta units that have been recently assembled.\nWe currently have a limited number of functional beta units in production, and have decided to make a small number of these available to the Kickstarter community. These units look just like the one that you see pictured on our Kickstarter campaign page and come with all the features promised.\nWe are making this Limited Edition available to Kickstarter backers in order to obtain usage data and insights from a wider audience. These insights will then be incorporated into the Ambi Climate production unit we plan to ship before Summer 2015. As Ambi Climate uses machine learning analytics, our mobile apps and Ambi Cloud backend are set to benefit from the insights gained from early adopters. With your collective feedback we will also be able to tweak Ambi Climate's hardware to better meet your needs.\nOur Mission\nFounding Team: Timothy Chang, Paul Sykes, Julian Lee\nAt Ambi Labs, we are designing and creating intelligent upgrades for your home that seamlessly fit your lifestyle.\nOur team seeks to reinvent the usability of appliances through add-on upgrades, giving consumers an easy and accessible path to attain the latest in smart functionality.\nOver Two Years Of Development\nWe spent nearly two years gathering insights on user behavior and air conditioner usage performance to fully understand the pain points users have with their ACs. Every single part of Ambi Climate has been thoughtfully designed, from the base of the enclosure to the app's most minute details.\nWe have been heads down developing our proprietary machine learning system, our own infrared database, the Ambi Climate companion app and the device itself. Having developed and deployed several successful prototypes, we can't wait to share the Ambi Climate experience with you.\n               Functional Prototype\nMartin from Ambi Labs briefly demonstrates Ambi Climate's most important functionalities.\nTechnical Specs\nDimensions: 4.10 x 2.05 x 3.46 in (105 x 52 x 88 mm)\nWeight: 5.29 oz (150 g) \nPower: 5V DC, 1.0A via micro USB power cable\nSensors: Temperature, humidity, sunlight, motion and location.\nTransmission: 5 infrared transmitters (for AC connection) | Wi-Fi: 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n-2.4 (for Ambi Cloud & smartphone connection) | Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (for iBeacon/micro-location)\nLEDs: Three front-faced, green status LEDs (for WiFi connectivity, Ambi Motion Sensor, Ambi Cloud Connection)\nWhat's In The Box?\n1x Ambi Climate device \n1x Micro USB Power Cable \n1x USB Power Supply \nTimeline\nOctober 2014 - Launch Kickstarter campaign, refine hardware and mobile app. \nMid November 2014 - Campaign ends. Organize units and merchandise to begin shipping to Early Bird backers. \nEarly December 2014 - Ship Limited Edition beta units, t-shirts and USBs to backers. Collate feedback from beta testers \nJanuary 2014 - Continual upgrades based on feedback from beta testers. Begin ordering long lead time components. \nFebruary 2015 - Finalise Ambi Climate design. Electronic Verification Testing (EVT). \nLate March 2015 - Certification and Design Verification Testing (DVT).

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Ambi Climate system is comprised of three parts: the hardware, the companion apps and the artificial intelligence (\"Ambi Cloud\"). Getting these components to work in harmony for every single smartphone and air conditioner in the world is something we are well on our way toward but not yet completely achieved. \n\nAC Remotes\nIn order to make the Ambi Climate device simple to set up, we have put in countless hours to build up our own database of remote controllers. While our custom in-house solution is designed to identify your AC remote with the push of just 2-3 buttons, there is a possibility that your specific model may need additional infrared codes. If this issue arises, we will do our best to quickly address it for you.\n\nProduction of Hardware\nWe already have a first batch of over a hundred beta units in local production and do not foresee any challenges with meeting our projected lead times but will keep our backers aware of any changes in our production schedule. The experienced garnered from this will allow for a smooth production of the final production units in 2015.\n\nAndroid App\nOur Android app is still in its very early stages and may not be ready off the bat.\n\nArtificial Intelligence / Machine Learning\nThere is the likelihood that the learning aspect of Ambi Climate may not work perfectly in the beginning for everyone until we have collected sufficient (big) data.\n\nTeam\nWe have full faith in our team, each of whom is known for their ability to deliver. We are fully committed to resolve any issues or challenges as we have many times before.

At the age of 13, he was the youngest musician ever to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival.  Four years later, Justin was named a U.S. Presidential Scholar in the Arts, the first drummer or jazz musician on record.\nAs an adult, Justin turned his professional focus to computer technology, fighting internet crime. But his love for being a musician did not weaken, nor did his exceptional talent or relationships with his peers who went on to become stars in the music world. \nAs so many of us do, Justin thought there was plenty of time to work with his colleagues in music and contribute more to his first love. But, unexpectedly, of course, last year, Justin was diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.) That same illness for which everyone is taking the water bucket challenge. His is progressing comparatively quickly, so while he is still physically able, Justin must record, and other musicians couldn't agree more, or be any more enthusiastic to be in the band.\nThat\u2019s where Kickstarter comes in. While being a musician is a modestly paying profession, having a debilitating terminal illness is even less lucrative. But that doesn't make the project any less worthwhile.        \nJustin Page, jazz pianist Kevin Hays, bassist Doug Weiss, and alto sax player Justin Robinson are heading to the studio for a long overdue, but none too soon, collaboration.  \nNot only will this work be Justin\u2019s last hurrah, and an outstanding contribution to jazz, it will be an inspirational album, bringing hope to ALS sufferers and greater awareness of this devastating disease. \nKevin Hays  One of the premier jazz pianists of his generation. Several of his 15 recordings as leader have received critical acclaim by publications such as The New York Times and Musician Magazine (\u2018Best of\u2019 list), as well as a Coup de Coeur from the French Acad\u00e9mie Charles Cros. Additionally, Hays has appeared on over 60 records as a sideman with Chris Potter, Joshua Redman, Nicholas Payton, Al Foster and others. 2011\u2019s Modern Music (Nonesuch Records), a piano duet recording with fellow pianist Brad Mehldau and composer Patrick Zimmerli, garnered widespread critical acclaim. The duo premiered several works at Carnegie Hall, and toured the project throughout the US, Europe, and South America. Kevin\u2019s solo recording, Variations (Pirouet Records), was released in October 2011 to excellent reviews throughout North America and Europe. The recording features three sets of improvised variations on several original themes, along with exquisite variations on a fugue by Robert Schumann. The New Day Trio is Kevin\u2019s latest project with bassist Rob Jost (Bjork, Tony Scherr) and drummer Greg Joseph (Steve Kuhn, Art Garfunkel). The trio performs new compositions by Hays, and a diverse array of material ranging from 20th century composer Henryk Gorecki to Lerner/Lowe and singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Rodriguez. The New Day Trio recorded their first album in the summer of 2014 which features special guests Gregoire Maret (harmonica), and Tony Scherr (guitar). In addition to 9 new originals, the recording includes several vocal performances by Hays including an arresting rendition of the Jimmy Webb classic 'Highwayman'. The record will be released in early 2015. For more info, please visit www.kevinhays.com\nJustin Robinson Alto saxophonist Justin Robinson was born August 14, 1968, in Manhattan. He first picked up a horn at the age of 13, and honed his sound while attending the High School of Music and Arts (LaGuardia High School) in New York. Robinson developed a passion for the alto sax and, from the influences of Charlie Parker and Jackie McLean, crafted his own distinctive sound. Robinson has collaborated with eminent artists such as the Harper Brothers, Cecil Brooks III, Abbey Lincoln, Diana Ross, Little Jimmy Scott, and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, The Dizzy Gillespie All Star Band, and most recently, The Roy Hargrove Big Band in addition to the Roy Hargrove Quintet. Justin Robinson wields a hefty portfolio: joined Harper Brothers at 18, debuted on Verve at 22, a decade's-worth of star sideman gigs. All of that hang-time paid off with his 1998 recording The Challenge on Arabesque Records. Penning six of the compositions, selecting an inspired posse of young ringers (Ron Blake, tenor sax; Stephen Scott, piano; Dwayne Burno, bass; Dion Parsons, drums), Robinson also produced the whole shebang. Robinson also released as a solo artist Justin Time in 1991 with Verve Music Group label. It was produced by Bobby Watson, who also appears on the recording, in additon to Gary Bartz, on alto saxophones, and includes more young ringers of that time: Eddie Henderson - trumpet; Kenny Barron, Stephen Scott - pianos; Peter Washington - bass; Lewis Nash - drums. Justin Robinson lives in New Jersey and is currently touring with trumpeter Roy Hargrove.\nBassist Doug Weiss is a member of several important bands on the international jazz scene. Pianist Kevin Hays trio was formed in 1995 with Weiss at the bass and Bill Stewart at the drums. They have toured the world and made 10 critically acclaimed cds. In 1996 he joined drum legend Al Foster's group. Mr. Foster has played with Sonny, Miles, Herbie, and Joe. His quartet presents his own musical vision of a lifetime in music. They have performed at festivals and clubs in Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia, and the former Soviet Union. Weiss continues to circulate in the New York club scene, with regular appearances, and is engaged in creating a new work by folk legend Pete Seeger, which is being produced by percussionist Jeff Haynes. Their previous effort, \"Tomorrow's Children\", won a Grammy for best children's album in 2010 \"Mr. Foundation, Mr. Swing\" - Al Foster.\nTogether they are a group of (extremely talented) friends who are passionate with creating solutions for ALS awareness and providing a gift for their colleague and companion that will live on forever.

Double posting is the standard in the pin game and we always offer this with our pieces. The Sloping Companion has had great success in producing antique silver style pins.\nDice II\nThe series depicts seven iconic images from the gaming community along with two words that often get used wrong. We have three well known die in the series.  There is a compass, sword, shield, geek and nerd pin. Each pin also has an etched phrase in the back depicting a correlation to the icon on the front.  Production is all ready to go. All we need now is the funding. The decals will also reflect these same images and will be four inch in diameter and will be weather resistant. These are all ready for production. Now all we need is the help of the great gaming community!\nDice III\nOur goal is $1,500.00 to produce all of the pins and stickers. We are also offering some great stretch goals in an attempt to make this design truly pop as an accessory.\nStretch Goal - $4,000.00 - We will convert the design into a bronze set of pins.  \nStretch Goal - $6,000 - We will convert the pin series into a gold set of pins.  \nStretch Goal - 8,000 - We will convert the pin series into a gold set of pins and will encrust it with red ruby rhinestones.  \nOur campaign lasts for 14 days so the quicker we get the word out the better. Please consider our incentives and we hope that you will support our project. The Gamers Series 1.0 - Game on!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne concern might be a delay in production.
