[{"backer": "Legendary Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "From popular internet game master and game designer, Dave Hamrick and cartographer and painter extraordinaire, Justin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studio) comes BroadSword Magazine, a throwback to the old RPG magazines of the '80s and '90s. \nOver 60,000 words of Fifth-Edition compatible EVERY. SINGLE. MONTH. In fact...\nIt's not a \"magazine\"... it's a monthly expansion BOOK!\nIf you never experience the old RPG mags, they were more than just a collection of articles. The old magazines were expansion sets and rules supplements and they were PACKED with content.\nEach issue is like getting a NEW jam-packed full-sized Fifth Edition supplement in the mail.\n Full-length adventures. Never run out of campaign material with playtested, full-length adventures for all levels.\n Sub-classes. Add variety to your game with brand new sub-classes for all class levels.\n Monsters. Need more challenges? Look no further than brand new monsters with full stats and ecological notes.\n Spells, Magic Items, Rules Supplement and more! There's so much content that all of it could exist in a book by itself.\nDigital mockup of what the first issue will look like.\nEach dynamic issue of BroadSword Magazine includes four NEW and ORIGINAL Fifth-Edition compatible adventures, plus new monsters, races, subclasses, magic items, and more every month in both print and digital PDF formats.\nBroadsword operates under the Fifth Edition Open License Agreement, meaning that the game is FULLY compatible with modern Fifth Edition rules of \"the world's most popular roleplaying game.\"\nSo expect to see plenty of ancient dragons while you're exploring lots of dungeons!\nHere is the tentative table of contents for BroadSword magazine #1.\nAdventures \nThe Secret of Forsaken Peak Cross Section\nFeature - The Secret of Forsaken Peak Part 1 (The Goblin Mine) by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. The goblins of Forsaken Peak have been acting up lately. You're tasked by your patron (five different options with five different goals) to investigate what they're up to. This is the first part of The Secret of Forsaken Peak megadelve adventure path, set for a group of 5th-level characters.\nBonus - The Secret of Forsaken Peak Castle of Chaos Detail by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. Need a place for your characters to rest in between delves? The Castle of Chaos is the perfect spot. Well, if you ignore the fact that it's managed by a bunch of insane people, that is.\nThe Battle of Dragard Mine by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. The residents of Dragard Mine discovered something important in the old mountain. Whatever it is, the Beastmen of Kalibar want to get their claws on it.  Dragard Mine is an adventure for a group of 11th-level characters and uses Dave Hamrick's original mass combat rules system.\nComes with a double-sided fold out map of Dragard Mine.\nEvadimus's School for Gifted Spellcasters by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. How do wizards learn their first spells? At wizardry school, of course! One of the most famous of these schools is Evadimus' School for Gifted Spellcasters. This adventure is for 0-level characters that takes wizards-to-be from commoner to 1st-level caster over the course of a school year.\nTrial of Heroes by Dave Hamrick. Every year, the lords of South Castle come together to test adventurers all over the land; not for their sheer might and power, but for their ability to think and work as a team. The Trial of Heroes follows the tradition of RPG magazines of offering up level-agnostic challenges for characters of any level.\nOne-Shot Adventure by Dave Hamrick. A one-shot adventure in the vein of the old \"Side Treks\" articles that'll work as a nice little side quest. Theme and plot too-be-determined, although it will be centered around 2nd-level characters.\nArticles\nHow to Keep Your Players Engaged by Dave Hamrick. You know the situation: you're explaining an awesome landscape or a tense battle and for whatever reason you can't seem to get your players' attention. Either they're looking at their phones, chatting it up, or just off in la-la-land. Dave Hamrick explains how he keeps his characters engaged in his games and shares some tips on how you can get your players engaged, too.\nRules Supplements\n10 New Cantrips by Dave Hamrick. Everyone has that one or two favorite cantrip that they love to use frequently. But in the end, there isn't a whole lot of variety when it comes to cantrip. Dave Hamrick offers up 10 more cantrips for characters to use.\nMass Combat Basics by Dave Hamrick. To accompany the Battle of Draggard Mine adventure, Dave Hamrick's crafted a full set of easy-to-use mass combat rules that capture the feel of Fifth Edition and lets characters be heroes on wider level.\nNew Playable Race: Laicosts (Mousefolk) by Dave Hamrick. A DMDave classic, laicosts are scallywag mouselike humanoids that stay in tight knit communities. The article will expand on their world and introduce the playable mousefolk.\nTraps & Puzzles Featurette by Dave Hamrick. Need some non-combat challenges for your dungeon encounters? The Traps & Puzzles featurette helps you do just that. \n3 New Arcane Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. The first stretch goal hit for the project was opening up three new subclasses. These subclasses are Wizard Teacher Arcane Tradition, Madness Sorcererous Origin, and Warlock Patron of Forbidden Lore.\n2 New Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. Another stretch goal opened up two new subclasses. These are as-of-yet undetermined, but will probably be related to Forsaken Peak.\n3 Mass Combat Feats by Dave Hamrick. The second stretch goal hit opens up new feats for mass combat campaigns. These will coincide with the mass combat rules.\nMonsters by Jack by Jack Hamrick & TBD. My son Jack draws a monster and artists bring it to life.\n7 New Uncommon Magic Items by Dave Hamrick. This was a bonus stretch goal--I'll be creating 7 uncommon magic items for you to put into your campaign.\n10 New Monsters by Dave Hamrick. More monsters! Already, I have a library of hundreds of monsters on DMDave. What's 10 more?\nRandom Wilderness Tables by Dave Hamrick. Need some ideas for wilderness dressing? This chart of 100 random wilderness encounter will help spice up your adventures.\nDouble-Sided Poster by Justin David Russell. The front cover art and the map for Dragard Mine will be featured on this amazing, high-quality double-sided poster.\nAnd more...\nWith each stretch goal, more content will be added to this already-awesome list. Keep an eye out here on the Kickstarter page as well as communications to see what's coming down the pipe for the first issue of BroadSword Magazine. \nThe best part? The first adventure is already penned and ready to go and the other three adventures are in final draft stages. You can read the original draft on DMDave's website.\nThe Goblin Mine, the first part of The Secret of Forsaken Peak.\nThat means that as soon as you sign on to this Kickstarter, you can get a digital copy of the first adventure, The Secret of Forsaken Peak: The Goblin Mine by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. It's the first part of a HUGE megadelve adventure path that will be included in the magazine.\nWe're nuts for the classic RPG 'zines of the '80s and '90s. \nHowever,  it costs quite a bit to create a high-quality magazine, thick with original art and solid, playtested rules, all compatible with 5th edition. \nPrinting a magazine like this takes some serious capital. That's why we're Kickstarting it. We want to make sure we have the funding necessary for print runs tiny to gargantuan.\nAnd we don't want to cheapen it. While the magazine will intentionally have an old-school-vibe to it (black-and-white interior, pen/ink illustrations, etc.) it will still be printed on the highest quality paper available with perfect binding. \n\"So what's up with BroadSword magazine beyond the first issue? And why should I be excited about it (aka, why should I pay for 12-months of issues?)\"\nGreat question! Here's what you should look forward to with the magazine:\n1) Issues #2 - #6 are already mostly planned out. While we've still got a few nitty gritty details to plan on, here is the \"themes\" for the issues following #1:\n Issue #2 - Horror. To coincide with Halloween, BroadSword will have adventures, articles, and supplements geared around horror stories and monsters.\n Issue #3 - Science fiction. New rules for science fiction along with an accompanying adventure.\n Issue #4 - Winter. Winter based adventures, holidays, and more.\n Issue #5 - Downtime+. Downtime is a cool feature of Fifth Edition, but kinda falls apart at higher levels. The adventures and articles in this issue will address this problem.\n Issue #6 - Gear. Looking for cool, new items for your characters or NPCs? This issue will feature cool weapons, magic items, and more and adventures to compliment them.\n2) We're taking submissions for issues #2 and up. As much as I love creating content, to ensure that we can work on a tight schedule, we will be taking submissions from other creators in the community. This includes artists, adventure-crafted, article-writers, and even homebrewers. And we're paying for the content!\n3) DMDave has 500,000+ words worth of content to fall back on. Worst case scenario (somehow, no one on earth submits anything), we still have 7 months worth of content to fall back on with DMDave.com. That's nearly 600 articles and 500,000+ words worth of original Fifth Edition content.\n4) Multiple Printer Sources. We have three different printers ready to go (include, two of which are associated directly with the business) to print issues in advance. There will be no logistical snafus to slow down printing. And even if there are, we'll be sure to communicate.\n5) Total transparency. Subscribers of the magazine will have full transparency of all the forthcoming content. You'll be able to see what's going on and even offer input either on DMDave.com, our social media accounts, the official BroadSword discord channel and more.\n6) Experience & Research. I have been in ecommerce for nearly a decade. In addition to experience serving customers online, I have done plenty of research and worked closely with other publishers to ensure that any issue that could come up is addressed ahead of time.\nWe're 100% invested in this project and want to make sure that it succeeds.  \nNow it wouldn't be a fun Kickstarter if we didn't have a whole mess of Stretch Goals to offer, too, now would it?\nHere is what you can expect to get along with the magazine should we match these goals: \nMore to come!\nWe know that not everyone is a \"grognard\" like JD and I. That's why this book is not only available in Print format, but Digital format (PDF) as well.\nAs we noted above, the adventure is already completed and ready as both a FREE \"blog\" version which you can read now and a \"preview\" version which you'll receive after the Kickstarter ends. However, the finalized PDF for the magazine will have all new art, get a thorough playtesting analysis, and come with a lot more bonus content. \nPlus we'll partner with other companies and use their experience in digital production to make sure that the finished products are 100% perfecto.\nOne of the most exciting things about BroadSword magazine is that it features the outstanding art of world-class old-school artist Justin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studio). JD is a traditional illustrator, using pen/ink and oil paints to make his creations. \nCheck out some of his art below:\nThe cover art to BroadSword #1/The Secret of Forsaken Peak\nDid I mention that there might be some DRAGONS in DUNGEONS? ;)\n\"Sorry, laddie, but yeh won't be a-tossin' THIS dwarf!\"\nA recent image by JDR, a warrior stumbles upon something... scaly.\nWhat's this pigman? That's how JDR draws goblins!\nThis time, we're offering both preview and playtest material for those who want to try the content out before its official launch.\n What's the difference between the two? \nA playtest involves running at least one of the adventures. Playtesters are acknowledged in the magazine's credits, and have a real say in the difficulty, balance, and playability of the final creation. We'll send backers information on how to sign up.\nA preview just means an early look, without providing any formal feedback and without a listing in the credits. No signup or reports required.\nEveryone who pledges at the $10 level or more gets a FREE copy of Broadsword Magazine preview.\nHere is what you can expect from each of the pledge levels.\n Supporter - You just love us and want to show your support. Awwwww, thanks! :)\n Broadsword #1 PDF only - You just want to read it and print the magazine at your leisure. This pledge level is only $10 and includes all the cool DMDave/JDRussell content.\n Broadsword #1 Print and PDF - You want to get the first issue of Broadsword in a print-ready PDF format as well as the printed collector's copy.

This pledge level is only $42 (you save $1 per issue) and includes all stretch goals.\n Broadsword 6-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You're down with Broadsword and want to see the first six issues of this milestone series in both printed and PDF format.

This pledge level is $144 and includes all stretch goals (you save $3 per issue).\nWe're launching Broadsword Magazine with options for advertisers, too!\nJust like the old RPG magazines, we plan on doing some throwback ads both on the rear and interior covers, as well as four pages at the rear of the magazine, and a center insert with smaller ads (kinda like a \"trading post\").\nWhat's a throwback ad?\nBlack-and-white, artwork of questionable integrity, etc. You may even reference your fancy, new fangled world-wide-web webpage on the interwebs. \nEven though these \"website\" things sound like a fad. Obviously.\nWhat do ads cost?\nAd prices are fixed right now, meaning no matter how many people jump on this Kickstarter, we're going to keep the rate the same for the first issue. \nThat means your ad could be seen by thousands of qualified shoppers for an extremely low rate (cheaper than newspaper ads, but with a more targeted marketing).\nFor those who are worried about too many ads, don't worry. These ads are mostly for fun to add to the old school vibe. The kitschier, the better! Plus, we're only giving up 5% of the entire magazine for this ad space.\nHere are the current ad tiers:\n Full-page/full-color advertisement (only 3 available). These advertisements will be printed on the back of the magazine cover and on the interior covers just like in the old school magazines. Starts at $300. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n Full-page/black-and-white advertisement (only 4 available). These advertisements will appear in the back of the magazine on the last 4 pages. Starts at $225. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n 2.5\" by 4.75\" advertisement (Black/White) (only 40 available). These small ads will appear throughout the magazine, again adding to the \"old school vibe\" of Broadsword. Starts at $40. Plus, you get 8,000 impressions on DMDave.com.\n\nPlus, all advertisers get a PDF copy and physical of Broadsword #1!\nEven if you don't have a business, you can use the ad to say thanks! Or give a shoutout to somebody you love, or even propose to JD Russell.\nAd-Ons for Additional Issues\nSome of you have expressed interest in getting both an add and the full subscription plan. Here's how you can do it:\n1) Select the advertising plan that you want to do.\n2) Adjust your pledge amount up by one of the following subscription plans (it already includes the first issue):\n3-month subscription: +$36 (includes shipping, US only)\n6-month subscription: +$87 (includes shipping, US only)\n12-month subscription: +$165 (includes shipping, US only)\n3) Email me at hamrickbrands@gmail.com or contact me via Instagram to confirm your intention.\nFor details on how to do all this, here's a guide for add-ons: How to Do Add-Ons\nSo who are the creative nut jobs behind this incredible project? Here are the folks involved in the creation of Broadsword Magazine: \nJustin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studios), Artist and Creator is also a grognard roleplayer, having played just as long (if not longer). He's the creator of the The Forsaken Peak adventure path's setting, the illustrator of all the maps, interior artwork, and cover illustrations for Broadsword magazine. He's one of the hardest working illustrators in the roleplaying world today.  You can see his artwork above.\nDave Hamrick, Designer and Publisher has been a roleplayer and GM for nearly 28 years. He's also a full time writer and author, business owner, and game designer. He's the guy that maintains DMDave.com and writes most of the material for it (over 500 articles with nearly 1,000,000 words of original Fifth Edition content), including all adventures in the first issue of Broadsword magazine. This isn't his first rodeo, either. He's owned an Amazon business for four years as well as multiple digital media sites and has countless contacts in both the game and product fulfillment industry.\nStill not sold?

Good ideas and monster creation.\" - Facebook fan\n\"Keep up the great work, DMDave, really enjoy all your creations!\" - Patreon fan\nRegarding the launch of BroadSword magazine:\n\"Cool! This sounds awesome and I\u2019m looking forward to checking it out when it goes live. Always looking for 5e adventures done in the vein of old Dungeon Magazine.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"Yes, and yes. Did I say yes? Yes I did.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"I\u2019m super pumped for this can\u2019t wait I\u2019ll definitely be get the year subscription on launch.\" - Kickstarter Follower\nFrom Kickstarter Backers:\n\"I have a 0% chance to be able to write/edit/make something like this happen but for the last year or so I have been hoping that SOMEONE would make a magazine similar to Dungeon. I am just a print kind of guy, PDFs don't do it for me.\" - Kickstarter Backer\n\"Thank you and I'm excited about this. I was a very long-time subscriber to Dragon, Dungeon, and Kobold Quarterly so this is exactly what I've been waiting for!\" - Kickstarter Backer\n20,500 + Followers on Instagam (with a 20%+ engagement rate)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe entire magazine is drafted and ready. We've sourced the costs with manufacturers and they're just waiting for our final art. The only thing missing are the commissions and backer elements as well as any necessary adjustments from playtesting. All of the interior cartography is completed as well as is the cover art and most of the interior art. However, there's still a little work to do in art, adding in any extra details, playtesting, editing, and development, not to mention layouts and final designs.\n\nHowever, Dave Hamrick, the lead designer has been a professional game and product designer and fulfillment specialist for four years. He already owns his own Amazon business and has an extremely popular website with 150,000+ monthly viewers. Plus, he has multiple contacts in the book industry and China and a printer is already lined up with deposits pre-placed. In addition, he's working closely with veterans of Kickstarter projects, with over 5 projects between them. Finally, he writes for a company that specializes in product development and design with over 100 employees. All of these experts are assisting in consultation on the product to ensure success of the Kickstarter itself and its subsequent fulfillment.\n\nFor future issues, submissions will be accepted to ensure regular content and DMDave has nearly 600+ original articles on his site to pull from if need be (including a ton of previously unreleased articles). \n\nPlus, we're giving ourselves 4-5 months before the first issue to create the first six issues' worth of content. Our printers are already prepared for monthly editions and will have proofs/artwork/etc in their hands 2-3 months in advance of printing. Any hiccups in transport, content creation, etc. will be communicated to all subscribers in advance so if there are any problems subscribers will have plenty of advance notice. If the magazine ends for any reason, any outstanding fees will be returned to subscribers in a pro-rated format.\n\nThere are no additional projects on the table. This is it. Nothing to get in the way or screw up logistics.\n\nWe require no external review or approval from other companies to make this magazine happen, and we've been working on it long enough to see it is coming together well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support the Project", "descp": "You get the project news and updates, and your name gets mentioned in our acknowledgements section.

But after several years, my erasable tiles are getting pretty scratched and gummed up from transport and use ... so, it is time to retire them.\nShopping for replacements I've found some thin knock-offs, some really large tiles, and some extremely expensive sets ... but nothing that fit both my needs and my budget.\nThis reminded me of the predicament that led to the initial development of Gaming Paper back in 2009. So I began to wonder if, with everything I've learned over the years, I could make a quality, affordable gaming tile product to fill the niche I'd found in the market? \nHello, I am Gaming Paper Tiles!\nWe interviewed GMs who used erasable tiles to find out what other folks thought was important, and then we started designing. What we've come up with is pretty amazing and I am proud of the design and the functionality.\nThe tiles are 8\"x11\".  Almost the same size as a standard hardcover game book.By matching the size of your books we make it easier for you to transport the tiles in your stack and store them easily on your shelf.\nThe tiles are double sided.  Printed with a grid on both sides or hexes on one side and grid on the other.  (You choose during the survey)\nThe tabs and slots with which the tiles fit together are sized for strength and longevity.\nThe tiles are made extra thick to add strength and reduce the likelihood of damage from bending.\nSame size as your books! Easier to transport and store!\n  Over 3.5 millimeters thick! Made to last!\nIn order to be part of Kickstarter's One Week Project event during the One Hit Wonder Week, we are running this Kickstarter for just a single week and with only one pledge level!

The use of these logos does not imply project endorsement by their respective owners.\nAs requested: Press Kit Here\nAs requested: Pledge Calculator\n We've all been there. You're running your favorite table-top RPG and it's combat time. You roll the dice, hit, then calculate damage. What does the GM say?\n\"You hit for 17 damage.\"\nWhat will he say next time?\n\"You hit for 16 damage.\"\nBooor-ing!\nThe rest of the game is so imaginative, so immersed in the world; let's not let combat be the one thing that breaks the flow. Instead, we propose enhancing your combat narrative with this easy-to-use descriptive card deck.\nIs your player using a blunt weapon? Imagine pulling the Blunt card and simply selecting one of the actions description listed right there on the card. Read it aloud, filling in the specifics as you need. And suddenly, you're breathing life and excitement into your combat (just as you're taking it away from someone in the form of HP).\nThen, if the damage dealt by the player is going to finish the enemy off, there are Death descriptions for that as well, conveniently marked off by a skull-icon. Read off the Death description and give your player a thrilling and vivid description of their combat triumph!\nSince the Action Words are listed separately and bolded, you can easily grab them at a glance for whenever and wherever you need them.\nFor more dramatic scenes, multiple Action Words can easily be stacked together, quickly forming a powerful and exciting narrative.\nAn example of stacking 3 cards from the BLUNT series could sound something like this:\nA \"Savagely\", \"Brutal\", \"Bone Jarring\" blow sends gratifying shock-waves vibrating up your arm!\nNow, that's far more thrilling and vivid than, \"You hit for 17 damage.\"\nThe Combat Description Deck will include 100+ unique cards, with each card containing 6 unique phrases. That's a total of 600+ unique phrases, all ready for you to use to spice up your combat narrative.\nFor further ease-of-use, the cards are divided into three suits, which correspond to the three common attack types of Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing. And then each card is further subdivided into three common fighting styles of Finesse, Power, and Ranged. So, when an attack happens, you simply grab the card from the stack for the attack type that occurred and read off the description for the fighting style that was used. It's as simple and easy-to-use as that.\nWhat's more, each card can be used for nearly every type of situation and nearly every type of enemy, since we're purposefully leaving specific body parts out of our descriptions. We don't say, \"a unforgiving strike to the leg..\" because what if the enemy doesn't have a leg? Rather than giving you a description that wouldn't make sense, we give you the wider picture, and allow you to adapt that wider picture to whatever situation you currently have going on in your story.\nLikewise, we won't use the word \"blood\" but \"fluid\". We won't specify any type of weapon, but simply the damage type. We won't talk about combat being on the ground,thus allowing for air, sea, and magical combat settings. This way, you can use these cards in any and all combat situations you might have occurring.\nDon't worry about sounding lame with these cards. They're designed to make you and your players sound cool in combat. As we say internally, NO CHEESE or CORN with this meal! (i.e. nothing too Cheesy or Corny). Every phrase will use language that truly and realistically enhances your game play.\nWe are offering many Pledge Levels:\nAs Requested: Pledge Summary\n Pledge Levels\n$1 PLEDGE \u2191\n$10 PLEDGE \u2191\n15 PLEDGE \u2191\n$25 PLEDGE \u2191\n$30 PLEDGE \u2191\n$35 PLEDGE \u2191\n$40 PLEDGE \u2191\n$50 PLEDGE \u2191\n$75 PLEDGE \u2191\n$125 PLEDGE \u2191\n$150 PLEDGE \u2191\n$250 PLEDGE \u2191\n$500 PLEDGE \u2191\n$1000 PLEDGE \u2191\nAlternate Pledge Option: If you can't or don't want to use a credit card, you can pledge through our online shop www.CombatDescriptionCards.com.

If we can push beyond our basic goal, there are a number of additional Stretch Goals with which you can further expand your verbal combat repertoire!\n LARGER CARD SIZE: Make the decks easier to read and handle by increasing the card stock to tarot card size.\nVELVET CARRYING POUCH: A handy carrying pouch for transporting your deck of cards.\nunlocked!\nEXPRESSIONS BOOSTER PACK: Have you been stuck for what to say when trying to describe any emotion a character is feeling, particularly in a critical moment? This will help. The Expressions Booster Pack features a dozen more cards packed with emotional and physical clues! Each clue will help describe what a character is going through mentally and how the emotion might be expressing itself physically.\nunlocked!\nDESCRIPTIVE STORYTELLER SCREEN: Get yourself a Storyteller Screen with the combat descriptions printed right on the board! Make it even easier to find just the phrase you're looking for!\nunlocked!\nPLASTIC CARRYING CASE: Keep your deck protecting from the elements with this handy hinged plastic carrying case.\nunlocked!\nENVIRONMENTS BOOSTER PACK: When the adventures encounter a new locale, and you want a vivid sound or smell of that place that will make that location stand out, the \"Environments: Smells and Sounds\" Pack has you covered.\nunlocked!\nPAIN BOOSTER PACK: Combat equals damage. And damage equals fear and suffering. But how to convey that? Instead of just saying, \"You're hurting,\" for the billionth time, draw a Pain Card and one of its phrases to describe exactly what the walking wounded are feeling.\nunlocked!\nCore Deck Expansion! Every backer benefits from this stretch goal as the increased content will be added to the PDF and writer\u2019s grids across the board.\nunlocked!\nCards of Ill Intent: Sometimes a storyteller needs to describe the attacks of the bad folk, or even of player characters who aren't so good themselves. And that is where the Cards of Ill Intent joins in \u2013 a booster pack of cards that are much like the set of regular Combat Description Cards, but these cards have action words to describe all of the cold-hearted and murderous bastards out there.\nunlocked!\nProtective Card Coating & Premium Art Paper ($18,500): A protective coating will be placed over each and every card to help guard them against spills, rough handling, and those who regularly have gooey fingers (you know who you are). Your investment will be much better protected with this card coating! We will also increase the density of the paper used in the cards from 250 to 350 gsm. What does that mean? An improvement to the density will increase the appearance of the printing and make the card stock even more substantial and harder to damage. That's right, this reward is both protective and appealing!\nunlocked!\nThe Labyrinth: These cards will offer unique details to expand the vividness of your descriptions of labyrinthian environments, expounding upon all experiences there, from the mysterious to the mundane. Each of the 12 cards of this booster set contains a sight, a sound, and a smell, and then depicts each of those with two elegant (and sometimes grotesque) examples in action.\nHowever, don't get stuck into thinking that the Labyrinths Booster Pack can only be used with labyrinth environments. The Labyrinths set can easily be adapted for use with most underground structures, caves, and even certain kinds of prisons. Bring your labyrinth environments to life with the CDC Labyrinth description booster pack!\nunlocked!\nBOOSTER PACK: CHARACTER DISTINCTIONS: This booster pack contains a 12-card deck designed to inspire the storyteller into creating memorable and distinguishable characters. Each card details diverse features and characteristics of characters ranging from minor distinctions to major distinctions. With system neutrality (and even gender neutrality) in the forefront of our minds, we envision this pack to be one of the most popular in the set.\nOur final stretch goal is a really expensive one, so unlike the rest of our stretch goals, this one will not be made available for free. Instead, A perpetual license is $10 and can be added as an Add-on.\namazing - Unlocked!\nThe CDC Web App and API Now all of your cards - from the 120 cards of the core deck to the 5 booster packs sets - will be made available to you as a Web App. What's more, the Web App will be phone friendly, so you can freely look up cards on your smart phones and use all the app\u2019s features! You will also be able to plug-in the api for personal use. See kickstarter project update #9 for more information.\nunlocked!\nThe Native CDC App: With a native app, the entire program is installed right onto your drive. So, you will not need to access the internet in order to use this version of the CDC App! All of the CDC cards, from the core deck to the seven booster packs, will be readily accessible via computers or smart phones. You will now have both a native app and a web app version, giving you much more freedom in how you access your CDC App decks!\nSee update #19 for more information\nSee update #20 for more card art!\n About us\nConflict Games is the team of writers and artists who recently brought you the uber-imaginative Conflict PvP: Tactics and Teams Rulebook.

Fortunately, the Combat Description Deck is a fairly straight forward product. Please also keep in mind, the Conflict PvP products are already created and ready to ship. \n\nThe foreseen risks involved include shipping logistics and the unexpected cancellation of contracted artists, writers, editors or product manufacturers. In the case of contract cancellation, the contractor will need to be replaced. Which in turn, could delay the project's completion but won\u2019t prevent its completion. In regards to shipping, logistics could become burdensome. We are unable to control the fact that domestic and out-of-the-US shipping costs seem to be spiraling out of control. However with our target funding goal, we don't foresee this preventing the project from succeeding; although, it may impact delivery dates. \n\nThe one guarantee we can make, is that we will be transparent with issues and communicate them to our backers as quickly as we can. \n\nWe strongly believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the product.

All original stretch goals unlocked!\nUpdate: Pledges of $20 or more will now also receive the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\"Honestly, we wouldn't have been able to tell the stories we wanted to tell in Pathfinder without the Advanced Bestiary.\"\nF. Wesley Schneider\nEditor-in-Chief, Paizo Publishing\n\nIn 2005 Green Ronin Published the Advanced Bestiary for the d20 System. It was a monster book that took the idea of templates and ran with it. The Advanced Bestiary featured over 100 new templates and sample monsters built using them. It was a terrific toolkit and added value to every monster book GMs already owned. For years people have been asking us to do a Pathfinder version of the Advanced Bestiary and with your help, we are going to do it!\n  The rules revisions are already well under way. The question is, what will the book\u2019s final format be? We are starting with the assumption that the book will be a 264-page hardback with a black and white interior like the original, and that we\u2019ll keep the book\u2019s existing art. Really though, we want to give you a full color hardback with all new art! That\u2019s built into the stretch goals of this Kickstarter, so the final format is up to you all!\n\nUpdate: Full color printing and all new art are unlocked! \n\nYou Can\u2019t Eat Accolades! \nThe Advanced Bestiary got great reviews as soon as it was released. This was in the later days of the d20 era, when it was harder to impress people and much harder to have a hit book. The critics loved it and sales were solid. Mission accomplished, right? Well, no, as it turned out. The Advanced Bestiary and two other titles (The Black Company and Egyptian Adventures: Hamunaptra) had the misfortune of coming out when our fulfillment company (Osseum Entertainment) was dying and stealing money from our sales to stay afloat. Those three big, expensive-to-print products all sold pretty well\u2014and we saw not a dime of that money. We were, of course, still on the hook for all the associated bills: writing, editing, printing, art, etc. What should have been a triumph thus turned into a disaster. I remember figuring out at one point that for every dollar we paid the designer, Green Ronin lost three dollars. The \u201cOsseum Debacle,\u201d as we came to call it, nearly killed Green Ronin Publishing. We managed to survive though and slowly paid down all of our associated debts. \nThe fact that the Advanced Bestiary became a cornerstone book for Pathfinder development has thus always been bitter sweet. We were certainly flattered that Paizo used the Advanced Bestiary in so many of its own books and we were glad players and GMs got so much use out of it. You can\u2019t eat accolades though, so for years I had hoped we could bring this book back and actually turn a profit on it. \nEarlier this year we did a highly successful Pathfinder Kickstarter for our Freeport city setting. Last month I hired Owen K.C. Stephens to be our Pathfinder developer for Freeport and more. I believe now that the Stars are Right for the return of the Advanced Bestiary! Let\u2019s make it happen, Pathfinder fans! \nThe Stretch Goals \nAs I mentioned, we want this book to be full color and featuring all new art. We\u2019ve baked that into the stretch goals and we are revealing them all so you can see what we ultimately hope to achieve with this campaign. We are also keeping expansion of the book fairly limited by design because we want to have the finished product out to backers next July. The more we might add, the longer this would take, so we are capping the new material at 32 pages. Note, however, that there were originally five web enhancements to the Advanced Bestiary and we\u2019ll be including all of those in the new book. \nd20Pro Add-on\nd20Pro is a Virtual Table Top (VTT) program that allows pen-and-paper gaming groups to play online and now you can buy d20Pro files for the Advanced Bestiary for only $10. Simply add $10 to your pledge and you'll get the files when they are released. They will be available to the public later for $15, so this is a great deal for d20Pro Users.\nFantasy Grounds Add-on\nYou also have the option of Fantasy Grounds support for the Advanced Bestiary! Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table. If you'd like Fantasy Grounds files with your Advanced Bestiary, just add $10 to your pledge!\nThe Rewards\nHere are the reward levels for the Advanced Bestiary!\n\nHISTORIC BEAST: You get a PDF of the original (3.5 d20 rules) Advanced Bestiary.

You get 2 copies of the Advanced Bestiary mailed to your US-based store. You must be a confirmed brick and mortar retailer to qualify for this tier (and yes, we will check!).  Add $30 for international stores.\nHEROIC BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG, plus Hero Lab files for the whole book. \nFREEPORT BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the new Freeport: The City of Adventure book for Pathfinder (from our previous Kickstarter) in addition to a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.\nBEAST MASTER: You get to work with developer Owen Stephens to create a new sample creature for one of the book's templates. Owen will work with you to create an awesome creature/template combo and to name the resulting monster! You will be credited in the final book, of course. Choices are subject to our approval. You also get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.

Our second Kickstarter, Freeport: The City of Adventure for the Pathfinder RPG, is well under way and should release of May of this year.

The two projects share a developer (Owen Stephens) but have completely separate design teams. We thus believe that risk should be minimal.\n\nGreen Ronin has been in business since 2000 and in that time we've published over 150 books.

Help us upgrade our equipment and relaunch the website by backing our Kickstarter.\nStretch Goals\nThe more we fund, the better we can meet our goal. Once we have funded enough to improve our podcast recording equipment and software, we will start upgrading our webcameras for our live recordings, purchase a camera for seminar recordings at conventions, and turn our offices into proper recording studios.

We\u2019ve added over 200 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\nYou're in luck! We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones - new sculpts and classic favorites from our metal lines! We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWhat's in it for me?\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels. Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow.\nAll we need is your support.\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nWhat?! You're a gamer, right? Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

It can be used on iPad, iPhone and Android devices.  Update: Thanks to achieving stretch goals it will now be available in your web browser on Windows and Mac, and also as an app on Windows 8 and Windows Phone.\n3D Virtual Tabletop is about recreating the physical experience of using miniatures or tokens on a map.\nOther virtual tabletops today look nothing like this simulation. They leave your poor character defined by what the top of their head looks like. What's more exciting? A full-body view where you can see a character's pose as they stand up to fight and stare down their enemies! Don't you want to see the ogre or dragon towering above your party, so that you can more fully experience what they'e going through?\nNow, for the first time ever, you can use a virtual tabletop that looks and feels like the real thing.\nPlay games like Pathfinder, Dungeons & Dragons, Savage Worlds, Rolemaster Classic, Castles & Crusades or Call of Cthulhu. Maps and miniature portraits are easy to add from anywhere, even for use with BattleTech or other tactical combat games.\nWhat makes 3D Virtual Tabletop special?\nFAITHFUL AND IMMERSIVE VISUALS\nThe first thing that puts 3D Virtual Tabletop ahead of the pack is its faithful visual representation of the physical items on the tabletop, be it an RPG map or a board game layout. The virtual miniatures look almost exactly like the real \"pawn\" style minis, a piece of printed card slotted into a plastic base.\nSUPER-INTUITIVE 3D NAVIGATION\nIt's really easy to zoom in and out and manipulate the map to see it from any angle, from top-down to over your character's shoulder. Using the intuitive touchscreen to rotate, pivot and zoom makes navigating a dream.\nNATIVE ON MOBILE\n3D Virtual Tabletop improves on all the existing alternatives as a native mobile app. This allows it to look amazing and incorporate the touchscreen. Because it's running on your tablet or mobile, it doesn't hide you from your friends around the table and takes up much less space - more room for snacks!\nWhat have you done already?\nA basic version of 3D Virtual Tabletop is already available, that works standalone on a single device.\nHere's a brief walkthrough of that version:\nCurrent features include:\nImport your own maps and miniatures from photos on the device.\nSet the size of a miniature when you import it.\nPinch-to-zoom on the map to get an overview or focus close in on the action.\nView the tabletop from any angle, from top-down to over your character's shoulder.\nMinis change to a flat token when viewed from above.\n\nYou can get it on the Apple App Store for iPhone and iPad, Google Play for Android and the Amazon Appstore for Kindle Fire and other Android devices.

You can let other gamers like you know by using the links below.\nI use this product in my own weekly Pathfinder game so I want to see it become more capable too!\nThanks to fanatical support from the community we have lit up many of our stretch goals already.  From the latest survey we have a whole new set of stretch goals, and we're almost at the next one.  Look below the map for a brief summary of each goal.\nOh no! While striding down the Hall of the Sword lighting up the braziers for the stretch goals, we have triggered a magical trap and been teleported into a labyrinth!\nHelp us run through the maze as fast as possible to light the stretch goals so that we can escape and enter back into the Hall of the Sword.\nAfter lighting up all the braziers of the stretch goals to reach the end of the Hall of the Sword, it's time to head down the path to the tavern to celebrate.\nBack at the tavern after our hard won victory. It's time to have a drink and tell tall tales that the minstrels will repeat across the land to let everyone know what we have accomplished.\nStretch Goal Details\nAutomatic Miniature Numbering:  When you add more than one miniature of the same type on the map, it will have a number displayed with it so everyone knows which one you're hitting.\nSilhouette Shape for Miniature Card:  When you use a transparent PNG image or have a white background, instead of the shape of the card being a rounded rectangle, it will be a rough outline of the silhouette of the creature.  Your character really will look like they are standing there. Update: This has been partially implemented since unlocking the goal, as you can see in the video.\nMap and Miniature Searching and Organizing:  Search and sort your maps and miniatures to easily find the one you're after. If you pick the Battalion or Colossus levels, you'll more than 300 minis to look through. With Folders and/or tagging, whether playing different genres, or looking for something specific, you can rapidly select the one you want without interrupting play.\nLoading and Saving of Scenarios / Encounters:  Save how your session ended so you can get started right away next time. Prepare an encounter and load it in an instant to keep the momentum of play going at your table. This also works well if you run multiple games, you can pick up where you left off for each one separately.\nHidden Miniatures: Lay out your dastardly foes on the map, but keep them hidden so the player's don't know their characters are walking into an ambush. Useful for friends or foes that are invisible/hiding/plane shifting or just to increase suspense.\nZoom Map and Grid When Importing: This will make it very easy to get the map set up exactly how you want it, no more fiddling around, or importing the same map 3 times to get it set up the way you want. Super convenient pinch-to-zoom when importing maps, for both the map and the grid squares. Getting everything lined up pixel perfect will be a breeze.\nCondition Markers: Whether your character is poisoned, bloodied, stunned or whatever else may befall them, always be aware of their condition with a status marker on their miniature. Each status marker will have the name of the condition as well as a distinct color to let you quickly assess how much trouble they're in.\nGuest Accounts: You don't have to get your whole gaming group to sign up all at once. Work around that one person in your group that never pays for anything, no matter how many hours they spend playing the game. When you create a game for others to join, you'll get 1 free guest spot so that a person without a subscription can connect to the tabletop on your device. You can also pay for extra guest accounts that anyone else can use to connect to your virtual tabletop, and when you join someone else's game, these extra guest accounts that you paid for will add to the guest account \"pool\" which anyone else can use to join that game. A chance for your friends to try it out to find out for themselves how awesome 3D Virtual Tabletop really is.  \nWeb Browser Based: Enjoy the wonderful view of 3D Virtual Tabletop on your Windows PC or Mac through your web browser. Like the online demo which is currently available, it will use the Unity Web Player plugin so you get to experience all the graphical goodness. Both mouse and touch input will be supported so you'll be equally at home on a desktop or lounging around with a touchscreen laptop or tablet.\nGoblin Camp Map: From the amazing artists at Lord Zsezse Works, a highly detailed map of a goblin camp hidden away in the forest. Pledge at the Battalion Plus level or higher and get this added to your collection inside the app. See the update about this map for more information and a close-up look at some of the features in the map.\nAchtung! Cthulhu: Fresh off their massively successful 2,000% funded Kickstarter, Modiphius Entertainment are offering a selection of their terrifying Cthulhu Mythos creatures and dramatic maps to committed backers. Even if you don\u2019t want to lead a team of heroic investigators behind enemy lines, you can still use the creatures in a game of any genre where you need horrific monsters, and you\u2019ll have 3 more mysterious locations to explore, a Nazi underground outpost, a Nazi base and an Elder Thing Outpost! Back at the Battalion Plus level or above to make these available to you in the app. They will also be supplying a wider range of map and minis in the in-app marketplace.\nLine of Sight and 3D Terrain: After walls and doors have been quickly laid down, you will only be able to see the parts of the map that your character can see. As you move your mini around, the new parts of the map that your character can see will become visible automatically. This will also include an optional a fog of war or permissions based movement to prevent players from sweeping their miniatures across the map to reveal the whole thing. The 3D Terrain will start out with 1 default set, primarily for marking visibility. You'll be able to hide it and have it still block sight, if it doesn't match your setting. Other environments and genres will be added over time.\nHex Grid: Set up the hex grid for a map when importing it, including pinch-to-zoom for both the grid and map to get them aligned in seconds. You'll also have the option to snap to the hex grid during play and a grid overlay which you can turn on and off that will work with a map of any color.\nRangefinding: (Expanded descriptions for these labyrinth stretch goals coming soon)\nGroup Movement\nRuler When Dragging Miniatures Without Grid\nEdit Imported Maps & Miniatures\nCount Squares/Hexes When Moving\nMiniature Naming\nUndo Miniature Movement\nGlowing Miniatures in Different Colors\nElevations for Flying Miniatures\nTrack if a Miniature Has Been Moved\nSnap Miniature Orientation to Grid\nClear All Miniatures\nDice Rolling: Beautiful 3D dice roll in front of your eyes before settling on the number that determines your fate.  With this initial dice goal you will have the 6 standard dice sizes that you would normally get in a set: 20, 12, 10, 8, 6 & 4 and the ability to roll multiple dice of each type.  For those playing around a real table with the visceral experience of physical dice, this feature will be unobtrusive enough or concealable to keep the virtual tabletop viewing area clean and clear.\nMap Creation with Map Tiles: Rather than using entire maps, you can import or purchase map tiles and lay down them down next to each other on the tabletop to create your own map.  They'll conveniently snap to the grid so that they line up perfectly and you'll be able to rotate them, also snapping to the grid orientation, to create the twists and turns that you need for your scenario.\nGoogle+ Hangout Integration: Have 3D Virtual Tabletop work seamlessly in a Google+ Hangout with the convenient text, audio and voice chat that it offers. This is not just useful for the web browser version because when you\u2019re on a smartphone or a tablet you can run a Google+ Hangout in the background and still have audio chat while you\u2019re playing with 3D Virtual Tabletop. You can also do text chat if you switch back to the Hangouts app, and even start up the video chat again if you need it, this time while 3D Virtual Tabletop is running in the background. This means you can still get good use out of Google+ Hangouts if everyone is on a different device, some on a laptop or desktop and others on a phone or tablet.\nArea Effect for Spells etc: Overlay a shape on the map to indicate the area of effect of a spell, trap or similar.  Several shapes will be included by default such as square, rectangle, cone and sphere.  The shapes will also have alternate versions that are aligned to and formatted with square and hex grids in mind so that you know exactly which square or hex is effected.  You'll also be able to color them appropriately to identify effects that have a long duration and will be on the map for a while. \nCustom Dice: Adds the d2 (coin) and ability to create dice with your own text or images on each face.  Great for FATE.\nSpecial Backer Offer: This backer bonus for reaching the end of the Hall of the Sword has two components, the Altar and the Sword.\nThe Altar. A place to play, five maps made available for you in 3D Virtual Tabletop from two of the most well known third party publishers for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\nFrog God Games is supplying one of the maps from Rappan Athuk, the classic mega-dungeon which they updated for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords and Wizardry rules.  It's a good old-fashioned, First Edition dungeon crawl that this map lets you get your feet wet with.  One of their core promises is that \"Our maps will be outstanding\" and you can see what they mean with The Mouth of Doom.  The map is the property of Frog God Games, all rights reserved.\nLegendary Games is providing all four of the maps from their Cold Mountain Adventure Path Plug-In, which is ideally suited for the Kingmaker Adventure Path.  Inside the app you'll find a river ford map for the Ansit Ford encounter, a forest trail for the Bloody Victim encounter, a small village map for representing Gloym and a waterfall map for the Falls of Istria.  You can find out more about how these locations are used by buying their PDF.\nAll you need to do to add these maps to your collection in 3D Virtual Tabletop is to back at the Battalion Plus level or higher. \nThe Sword.  Companions to take with you, as thanks for making this Kickstarter so successful, the price of the Immortal Guest add-on is now reduced from $99 to $50 each, so that you'll always have someone there to watch your back.\nInitiative / Turn Tracking:  Cycle through and show your current place in a small list of the visible miniatures on the table, highlighting and focusing on each one when it's their turn.  Drag miniatures along this list to set their new position in the order.  You can leave this feature turned off and it will remain hidden if you don't need it.\nStat Tracking for Hit Points etc:  Count up or down, with the value displayed publicly or kept private.  Set up multiple color coded trackers of any numeric values to show the vital information for your game at a glance.  It'll only show the trackers that you set up so you won't even see them if you don't want to use them.  When counting down you'll be able to show a visual indicator for % remaining.\nRound / Turn Counter with Timing Reminder for Effects: Is the lamp oil still burning? How many rounds has your summoned creature got left? Answer all these questions and more with a counter that increments every round. You'll also be able to link the counter with areas of effect on the map and conditions on miniatures, giving each one a duration that will trigger a reminder to dismiss it. Know exactly when and what you're dealing with.\nLong Miniatures: Miniature bases that are longer than they are wide for things like motorcycles and horses. The miniature image will be used for left/right rather than front/back.\nColored Bases: For quick identification of different factions, change the color of the ground they stand on.\nMiniature Notes: Free-form text notes for each miniature that you can use to keep track of anything, no matter what the game type, game system or house rules you choose. They can be either private or visible to all players.\nMap Annotations: Add text, arrows and other markers to the map to let the whole table know what's going on and exactly where its happening.\nThree Full PDF Adventures & Maps from Adventure-A-Week: Back at the Battalion Plus level or higher and get the maps inside 3D Virtual Tabletop and the full PDFs for the adventures shown below.\nSharing of Handouts\nWindows 8 and Windows Phone Version + 10 Miniatures: Includes Windows RT.  Even if you don't use Windows, there's something in this stretch goal for you, 10 extra fantasy miniatures from the One Monk Miniatures line by Mayhem in Paper.  All you need to do to make these available for you in the app is to pledge at the Battalion Plus level or higher.  Below is a picture of what their real-world counterparts look like.\n3D Props Like Tables & Chests\nImport Maps & Miniatures from PDFs\nFull 3D Miniatures\nSet Miniature Background / Border Color\nDifferent Image for Miniature Back Face\nMini-Tiles for Terrain Features Like Pit Traps etc\nLock in Top-Down View\nCard Decks\nEvery Single Stretch Goal Has Been Unlocked\nWill it be available on Windows, Mac, Linux or online in a web browser?\nBeing built on Unity means that 3D Virtual Tabletop can be brought to these other platforms, and more. There is, however, a significant amount of native integration work required for each new platform, to enable things like importing your own maps and minis so easily. The initial goal is for iPad, iPhone and Android.  Update: Thanks to achieving stretch goals it will now be available in your web browser on Windows and Mac, and also as an app on Windows 8 and Windows Phone.\nIf you want it to be available on another platform, spread the word about this campaign to as many people as you can, so that we raise enough money to exceed the initial goal and can start talking about stretch goals. Drum up enough support for the platform of your choice and it may end up as a stretch goal!\nWhy does this need funding?\n3D Virtual Tabletop has been created using the free version of the Unity development platform. New features such as sharing the tabletop with other devices have been implemented using a trial version of Unity PRO. This lets me test the app but I cannot release it yet. Publishing the app to make it available to you requires a full license of Unity Pro, with the iOS Pro and Android Pro add-ons.\nI need to raise $5,000 minimum to have enough to buy the full licenses and release the latest version of 3D Virtual Tabletop, so that you can use it in your games.\nFunds raised over this amount will contribute to additional developments to the product. If it all goes well, we'll release more features as higher amounts are reached.\nWhat Will It Cost in the Future?\nTo make it as easy as possible for you to use, with a smooth network experience, everything is run through a central server. The cost of this adds up so we need to charge something... but I'm trying to price it as low as I can so that it is accessible to as many gamers as possible. It will cost a mere $0.99/month for network connectivity.\nCharging a monthly fee, even though it is so tiny, ensures that the service will be around for a long time, while being continually improved.  You'll reap the rewards of making 3D Virtual Tabletop happen, for years to come.\nThe Team\nThanks to the great people who're helping make this possible:\nBruce Braun, our US project manager\nMy weekly gaming group, for letting me experiment on them: Chris, Daniel, Domonique, Emma, \"H\", Jordan, Kingsley & Matty\nThe BizDojo, for the campaign edits and advice\nThe DM who got me back into D&D after a long hiatus, Bevan\nDramaScape for supplying the maps within 3D Virtual Tabletop\nLord Zsezse Works for supplying the great maps for this page\nOther friends, family, testers, and understanding early users... you know who you are!\n\nReward Level Clarifications\nIf the reward level gives you a subscription but doesn't mention iOS, Android or Web Browser, like the Veteran and Immortal levels, then your subscription applies to any and all versions of the app after they are released.  If you have both immediate/early access and a subscription, the subscription starts from the public release date so all of the time you get from immediate/early access is extra time.\nFor the map illustrated by Alyssa Faden, you can browse her work here and here to determine a style that you would like the map rendered in.\nThe delivery date for the Immortal +5, Immortal +10 and Immortal Colossus +5, Immortal Colossus +10 rewards should be Nov 2013 since it grants 4-week early access.\nAdd Ons\nEarly Access: If your reward level does not include immediate or early access to the app, you can add 4-week early access to the Android or Web Browser version by adding $21 to your pledge.\nImmediate Access: If your reward level does not include immediate or early access to the app, you can add immediate access to the Android or Web Browser version by adding $51 to your pledge.\nGuest Accounts: You can add on as many 12-month guest account subscriptions as you want for $9 each.  You can also extend guest accounts for as long as you want for $9/year.\nImmortal Guest Accounts: A guest account that is valid forever, was $99 each, but now reduced to $50 each with the achievement of the Special Backer Offer stretch goal.  These will only be available during the Kickstarter.\nMiniatures: The miniatures from the Battalion level are also available at higher reward levels, all you have to do is add $8 to your pledge above what is required for that reward. The value of the reward level must be higher than Battalion. This is an astounding amount of minis for such a low price.\nTravelling Bard: If you've pledged at $99 or higher, for $30 you can make your character famous like in the Bard reward level! Have him or her made into a virtual miniature with a portrait digitally inked and flat colored by Tim Jenkins of Battle! Studio. Your character will be included in the default set with the app, so they can participate in adventures with gaming groups all around the world! You'll also be able to manifest your character in the real world with an image file suitable for printing out to assemble into a paper mini.\nCastle Ravenstein: Get all 6 levels of the massive Castle Ravenstein added to your map collection in 3D Virtual Tabletop for $39. You\u2019ll also get the digital download so you can print it out or use it in any other digital platform.  Alternatively if you back this project and also back Castle Ravenstein at the basic pledge level, you will get the castle in 3D Virtual Tabletop too.\nCastle Ravenstein + Darkraven Fantasy Soundscapes: Get the Castle Ravenstein add on plus more than 15 hours of background audio in 64 tracks from Darkraven Fantasy Soundscapes for a total of $99. These sounds won\u2019t be integrated into the app, but they cover more than half a dozen different environments, from towns and ships to your typical dungeon and wilderness areas.  Alternatively if you back this project and also back Castle Ravenstein at the $99 level, you will get the castle in 3D Virtual Tabletop too.\nMap Tiles: A huge collection of over 600 map tiles from Lord Zsezse Works covering different genres and a wide variety of environments for only $50. This is a deep discount off the normal price that cannot be offered again.  They will be available for you to use in 3D Virtual Tabletop for creating maps.  The terrain types include paved paths of various sorts, river, beach, sea, rough paths, a bandit camp, contemporary gardens, magical gardens, sealed roads, swamp, cave, underground bunker, volcano, lava, mountains, desert, dead land, crypt, winter forest, World War I and II trenches and astral plane. For more detail you can check out Lord Zsezse Works' Ground Sets, all of them are included.  You will also get the PDFs, in addition to them being ready inside the app.  This add-on is available to all, no matter the reward level.\nRoadmap\nYour feedback and comments have added a few more things to the roadmap for 3D Virtual Tabletop. They are presented in no particular order.\nChat\nImport and export of map and miniature placements\nSet miniature rotation with buttons\nDynamic lighting\nDisplay of character sheet\nLock tokens in lie flat mode\nChange the background of the tabletop from plain black to an image you import, such as a starfield\nStacking counters\nLink one map to another at the entrance/exit", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no major risks associated with this project. A simpler version of this app has been released that you can play with right now. Additional technical risk has also been eliminated by testing many of the new features using trial software.\n\nOne issue that does remain is the ability to get the app to perform well on the huge number of Android devices available, since there are too many for me to test on. Use of the Unity engine reduces this risk as it designed to run on a wide range of hardware, however, the experience will be smoothest on higher-end devices.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #100", "update_userinfo": "Starting Work on Cut-Out Standup Miniatures in 3D Virtual Tabletop", "update_content": "Here\u2019s a little preview of what I\u2019m working on right now, using cut-outs for the standup miniatures in 3D Virtual Tabletop.
