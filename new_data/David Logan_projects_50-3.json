[{"backer": "David Logan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "play [white label] on steam!\nTWITTER | DISCORD | TRY OUT ARCADE MIX\n\nBRAND NEW STRETCH GOALS TIME!\noh boy\nFOR $200,000 (TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS), WE'RE ADDING REMIXES AND ACOUSTIC VERSIONS. \nAll of which will be playable! We've already started experimenting with a few of these; and they're turning out VERY good; we featured a lil bit of Empty Diary's acoustic mix way back in our 2020 trailer, and already have some stuff on the way for Mirror and Forever Now. You can expect way more of it in the final game with this goal met.\nFOR $300,000 (THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS), WE'RE ADDING ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. \nWhile we want to just go, hey, mic drop, no explanation needed, here is some explanation: \nyou will be able to queue in online lobbies and try and get a better score than your friend or enemy, at the same time as them\nyou can use custom beatmap tracks, provided that you and your friend or enemy also has said beatmap tracks\nall of the community features will be linked into it\nit might be post-launch, but it will be added\nNETCODE IS HARD. We already said that. But if we hit this goal, we can absolutely promise this much. We want to do more, but without a lot more funding and a lot of beta-testing, I am legally unable to tell you any other multiplayer features the game may or may not have. Also hey, let's say it again:\nnetcode is hard\nAnyway, what's up? Feeling okay?\nYOU, THE PERSON READING THIS: Hold on wait HOW DID YOU GET FUNDED IN A DAY?\nD-CELL GAMES, EXCEPT PERSONIFIED AS A SINGLE ENTITY: We have no idea! People like this thing! Go figure.\nYOU:  I'm figuring! Also, what's with...the format? \n D: It's just a conceit. I'm meant to represent us, the people who made this dang thing. You represent, well, you, but you're not you, because you're not actually having these thoughts. I mean, it'd be cool if you did. Did you? That would freak me out a bit, if that was me. ANYWAY HERE'S THE GAME:\nunbeatable is a videogame\nY: This tells me nothing. \nD: It tells you tons of things! Look, right there. It says \"unbeatable is a video game\" in casual lowercase. You can see it right there! Levels! Story! Other!\nY: Why\u2019d you make it look like a Dreamcast game? \nD: I already regret doing the interview gimmick. You know what, forget it. Let's start from the top! Again!\nY: Wait, hold on, what are-\nIt's a narratively-hyperfocused dense exploration game where two-button rhythm combat powers more or less everything.\nEXPLORE AND HELP PEOPLE(?)\nOne half is this: you explore the game world, meeting terrible people and building a setlist for your upcoming concerts. Helping strangers, practicing with bandmates, sleeping in all day - it's your funeral, you'll only have so many days before each big event!\n\"street-style taiko\" is what someone has called this, and we're stealing it\nThe other half is this: arcade-flawless rhythm gameplay powered by an entirely original soundtrack. It's simple but frenetic - sure, there's only two buttons, but there's a lot of visual variety to the setpiece-styled battles. Want to groove exclusively to the rhythm gameplay? We'll have an ARCADE MODE available for you to play from the start!\nThe setup: In the world of UNBEATABLE, music has been outlawed For Reasons You'll Find Out.\nThe twist: A small girl has decided to bring it back. \nThe punchline: Beat (that's you, you are her) finds herself tangled up in her plans...and in the crosshairs of both the police and a mysterious new enemy...\nBut enough talk. Want to give the game a shot? We're releasing UNBEATABLE [white label], our episodic side-story demo, on Steam now! SIDE A Track 1, which lets you play 12 songs and learn more about the vibrant world of UNBEATABLE!\nBeat used to try to sing. Now she *sings*. Hopefully she'll be able to figure all of this out before things get worse.\nQuaver's the young, smart, and the tenacious backbone of the band. Even at her lowest moments, you can't tell her to just give up. You couldn't pick a better guitarist for this band!\nThere's more to Treble than his lazy, sleepy attitude - as the keyboardist of the band, Treble's always reliable, even when he would rather be taking a nap.\nIn contrast to her twin brother, Clef is LOUD. Like, loud.\nUNBEATABLE aims to look like a long lost bootleg 90s VHS recording of the newest anime on the block.\nOur touchpoints for this project are numerous, probably way too many to count!  - but also admittedly reductive of what we're setting out to do. We want UNBEATABLE to stand as its own look in terms of art direction and give it a melancholic flair. We're doing more than just taking the classic anime look as our own!\nMusic is an important part of the game, although we're sure that's pretty obvious. You can listen to a preview of the game's soundtrack above. The music is written to accompany important narrative beats and motifs of the game's story, and there's also going to a bevy of B-SIDES (by RJ Lake) and story-exclusive tracks present in the final release.\nI mean, or you could just...listen to it\nPLAY\n\nSo you might be thinking, \"oh god, I have to play a rhythm game? hard pass. i'd rather read the Iliad.\"  And we get it.  The Iliad rules.  But look: if you just wanted to play the game's story mode and vibe to the beat without being frustrated by the beat (or would like to/need to tweak settings to make the game more comfortable to play...or even just wanted to see if a difficulty is right for you?) We'll be implementing several accessibility options for the game, one of which will be the game's \"Assist Mode\".\nThe demo includes one feature from this mode called \"AUTOPLAY\", where Beat will automatically attack even if you provide mis-inputs (although if you do make a timed hit, it will take your accuracy into account). Let us know what you think on the feature, but do note that we will be looking into implementing (across the whole game):\nModifiers that disable health and adjust regen.\nOptions for color-blind users\nVarious options to configure dialogue visibility\nFull controller / keyboard custom bindings\nScreen-Shake Toggle (will be added eventually in [white label]\nIn addition, we currently have the following available in the [white label] demo:\nToggles for both the VHS Filter and Post-Processing\nController Presets\nConfigurable Scrolling Speed for incoming enemy attacks\nConfigurable Game Offset (with an in-game wizard!)\nAdjustable Game Speed ( 0.5x / 2x)\nNo-Fail Mode\nSo, I'm interested...but...who are you?\nI'm glad you asked! Say hi to us:\n\nUNBEATABLE IS A VIDEO GAME WHICH IS BEING... \nANDREW TSAI (@PixelHavokk) loves anime, and will be tried in court over it. He came up with the initial concept for UNBEATABLE fairly soon after making a game where you have to type to stay alive, and then told Jeff about it, and then they told other people, and hey, now you know. He does the art direction, most of the animation, works on some of the code, has a \"story by\" credit, and handles combat design and polish. Lots of hats! More hats than a person usually has space for on their head. He's the reason most of the characters have music names. \nRJ LAKE (@spellbang) has been sort of accidentally-ing his way through the games industry for almost a decade now, bouncing between asset creation, design, biz dev, and Other. Used to work on Homestuck* (listen to volume ten!) and does stuff with Strange Scaffold (dog airport!). Does Not Code, And Is Sorry. He's handling music direction, additional music, narrative design, dialogue, some setpiece design, all the storyboarding Andrew doesn't do, and is in charge of most of the marketing (the trailer was his fault). He's to blame for all the jokes. \n\nTJ Maddux (@respinmusic)is D-CELL's resident composer and musician. His musical journey started by playing drums for rock bands that regularly pushed sound pressure levels far past safe listening limits, but he eventually waned on the aggressive use of volume in order to  study the sorcery that is jazz composition. He's responsible for the live recording that drives UNBEATABLE.\nJack of all cables, mastering of songs; Vasily Nikolaev (@VastonikMusic) makes it his goal to immerse yourself in worlds that sound real, but feel stylish. Music composer and SFX artist, he handles mixing of all the songs in the game and is responsible for most of the synth work and wilder production tricks you'll hear, as well as a huge chunk of the sound design.\nTogether, TJ and Vas work as peak divide and provide the vast majority of the soundtrack for UNBEATABLE.\nMireille Arseneault (@ProgramGamer) is known for being the TIGsource forums admin and is the main programmer on UNBEATABLE. Mireille's role on UNBEATABLE is to implement the game's various systems. These allow the rest of the team to create dialogue, quests, and beatmaps!  They live in Canada, where bagged milk is.\nJeffrey Chiao (@comet_melting) is UNBEATABLE\u2019s producer and beatmap designer and helps out RJ with biz dev stuff! They keep the team in check (by dousing the fiery equivalent of game production havoc) and build  the amazing beatmaps that accompany Peak Divide\u2019s soundtrack. Outside of UNBEATABLE, they also work on several other games as the director of  SKY HOUR WORKS.\nRachel Lake (@rachelklake) is an illustrator and UNBEATABLE's lead vocalist (and the voice actor for Beat). She helps out with PR, community management, and additional art, and supports the team by derailing meetings with Minecraft memes.\nIN ADDITION, we've got:\nMoxie Riles (they/them) helping out D-CELL GAMES with UNBEATABLE as a cleanup artist (and cheerleader).\nand Yumna Taqiyyah (@Taqibunn) is helping out with additional animation! You can see her work on the band up there!\nWe began development of UNBEATABLE in early 2018, going through a long pre-production phase lasting up until mid-2020; we took a long time locking down core gameplay and the game's final narrative. Since then, we've been working part-time on the full production of the game. It's come a long way since people have first gotten to play the game at MAGFest 2019!\nRight now, we're developing the game's vertical slice (which covers the game's second chapter) - and with that almost completed (it's...close), we're looking to head straight to work on developing the rest of the story mode. We expect this is going to be at the minimum a two year effort, based on how long things have taken so far.\nworse than text\nIT'S TIME FOR PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF:\nWe are now switching over to Jeff! That's me. Lemme take you a quick rundown of the financials of this KS and the project. The charts really explain themselves, but let's break it down to everyone's favorite - the pie charts.\nPIE CHART #1 - Our Kickstarter Breakdownnnnnnnnnnn\nAs for what our development breakdown looks like, here you go!\nPIE CHARTS 2 - What all of our development costs are going into!\nUp to this point, we've been running entirely with little to no funds making the game - so having a jumpstart of any kind would help guarantee the game the resources it needs to become a reality! It's no secret that the project will need a lot more than this - funding UNBEATABLE's base goal will help us develop the game's vertical slice and be able to pursue more funding, but the actual development costs for the final project are on estimate to be roughly ten-times our budget floor (games are expensive, guys).\nWithout funding, we still anticipate continue production on the game, but we won't be able to meet our 2023 release window. That's...just how...these things...go\n\n*please don't hold that against us\n\nWanna upgrade the demo(s) with new content? Help us out with some exciting achievement goals!\n\nEvery Kickstarter apparently needs to say \u201cevery Kickstarter needs this\u201d when they add a thing that every Kickstarter has, and since every Kickstarter does this, we\u2019re doing this, and we\u2019re telling you about it. WE GOT ACHIEVEMENT GOALS! Help us build our community (please make us look cool) and we'll upgrade our demo(s) with new songs and surprises! \n\nYou'll get 1 point for each tier passed, and 10 points will unlock a brand new B-SIDE that will come to ARCADE MIX and [white label] - the mysterious FOREVER WHEN!\nMore goals will be added throughout the Kickstarter campaign - letting you unlock even more special rewards!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've already elaborated in \"PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF\" that the Kickstarter's base goal will not be enough to bring the game's production to completion by end of 2023. If the Kickstarter is funded, we intend on delivering this game no matter what - but the final amount we get will really play a part in how long we can keep going before its ready to search for partners to help bring the game to completion.\n\nRegarding PHYSICAL MERCH: We have experience producing everything but artbooks, so for the most part, we are confident in delivering and shipping physical goods across the world. We will update on production deliveries, delays, and more throughout the campaign.

A recent spike in spirits crossing over from another dimension breaks the chill atmosphere of their night shift. With her trusty FamiliarZ by her side, she sets off into the city to find out what\u2019s happened. With the popular band, 5SOME, scheduled to kick off their big comeback tour in Demashq, Samar needs to work quickly before the city is overrun with stans and spirits alike....not to mention, they've got a pizza party to plan, and romance to pursue!\nSpirit Swap takes place in Demashq, a coastal city inspired by the Levantine cities of our own world, Damascus and Beirut.\nThe game follows Samar as they make their way from their home right outside the city, by the nearby forest, into the sprawling coastal city of Demashq where they meet their friends.\none of Samar's possible paths through Demashq\nIt reflects the Levant\u2019s general topography, nature, architecture and climate (middle eastern Mediterranean) as well as cultural references, vibrancy, and visual cues.\nA setting seldom explored in games outside the lens of orientalism, and almost never by people from that part of the world themselves.\nSpirit Swap\u2019s in-world magic draws on two main things: plants and community. Plants and nature are the source of all magic and humans when banded together act as amplifiers and users. The world is one parallel to ours where plant magic was democratized around the turn of the millenia instead of wireless communication. Magic and tech have become deeply intertwined.\nIn a world where magic is at everyone\u2019s fingertips, everyone needs a helping hand. For witches and demons alike, Familiars serve that purpose.\nIn the past, summoning a Familiar was a lengthy process.  Charting the constellations, preparing the ritual, and massive energy drain directly following the manifestation of an individual\u2019s soul became less popular in modern times.  Yet, the need for a Familiar\u2019s assistance and companionship did not.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFamiliarZ were created to solve the problem; tech-assisted miniature devices that allow anyone to manifest a Familiar without the expense of magical energy required to sustain it.  With casings ranging from fashionable keychains to portable cassette players, witches and demons choose personalized ways to interact with their Familiar without having to reveal to the public any aspect of their inner selves.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFor press interested in covering our Kickstarter, here are some screenshots and promo material to get you started!\nOur soundtrack and sound design are created by Meltycanon and eyelovebrandon. The audio team is led by Rejon Taylor-Foster.\nFor Spirit Swap, the soundtrack was inspired by the music our team is currently drawn to: lofi hip-hop.

(Animated gif)\nDiscover a colorful sandbox open-world where you can farm wondrous plants, craft tools and shelter, harness the elements, and shape the land around you.\n\nPlay your own way - be clever, be creative or even be mischievous. Befriend strange beasts, dodge dangerous surprises, gather resources, and explore unique biomes to uncover the Secret of the TerraBeast.\nAstor gifts a Mighty Beast their favorite treat.\nYou play as an Astor, a special OddFauna, whose biological imperative is to seek out TerraSeeds. You will have to form a symbiotic bond with your living world, your TerraBeast to discover the TerraSeed's location. Will you seek out the TerraSeed? That is up to you. \nThe world is filled with OddFauna for you to meet.  Chat with them and get to know them. Give them their favorite treats to show you care. Earn their trust and you will receive items, recipes, or maybe even a new party member. Befriending a beast boosts your abilities and making a true friend will grant you a wearable pin which unlocks a new ability.\nMany Beasts are friendly... if you know how to interact with them. Entice them with a special treat, help them to build a shelter, or even ask them to join you on an adventure!\nBeware the beasts that come out at night! And watch out for the ones that may hide in bushes.\n\n\nTiny and gentle, the Sproutling help tend to the Terrabeast and are vital to a thriving ecosystem.\nTransform your TerraBeast into your own adventure paradise. Your Terraform ability allows you to sculpt the ground like clay. Shape the landscape to fit your adventuring needs; create rivers and lakes to play in, raise mountains to gain a better view or create fields to farm your favorite treats. \nSculpt the Landscape like Clay!\nGo even further and alter the temperature, soil quality, and water level of biomes. Create a frozen desert, flooded forest, or arid grasslands.\n\nYour choices have an impact on the other OddFauna. Ovoks love forests, Logurs need lots of water, and Trico's love it hot! Create a new habitat and new OddFauna will migrate and create a cozy home for themselves. \nYour growing ability allows you to craft astounding plants.  You have control over how they are shaped which grants you the freedom to use them for shelter, food, infrastructure, or just their beauty. \nEach crop has a season in which it can be grown. You will need a crop strategy to ensure that you have enough food and resources for the whole year. Being prepared for the start of the growing season will give you a head start on exploring!\n\nCreate your own unique flora by combining different seeds. Cross-pollinate to yield more fruit, improve quality, or to change the color of your plants.\nHandfuls of berries, huge delicious fruit, yummy earth roots, and many more!\nGather and grow resources and craft them into handy items for your adventures.  Craft tools, sandbox toys, shelters, and accessories to adorn yourself.\nBuilding a shelter not only replenishes your energy, but it also protects you from the creatures that lurk in the dark.\nEverything in the world abides by the rules of nature. You can interact with everything you see in the world. Burn with fire or replenish with water, it is your choice. Experiment with different combinations of elements to make new discoveries.\nBurn with fire & freeze with ice\nEvery action you take has an impact on the world. It is up to you to decide how to treat your world. You may choose to go on a fire-wielding rampage and burn down entire biomes. If you want to remedy your actions, you'll have to get your paws dirty and plant a new forest.\n\nAllowing your TerraBeast to become unhealthy will present some tough challenges. Blight will begin to appear, spread, and destroy everything it touches. As weather events intensify, you\u2019ll face lightning super storms, raging wildfires, and choking sandstorms, just to name a few!\nA healthy TerraBeast will grow larger each season. This unlocks new areas for you to explore. New OddFauna, biomes, and crops will become available as the world grows larger. The outer rings of a fully mature TerraBeast have been known to be home to Legendary Beasts.\nAstor, Trico & Mo are off to explore a newly grown forest.\nYour home, a giant majestic TerraBeast\nYour world is a massive living beast, called a TerraBeast. They have a very long lifespan. It's rumored they can live for millennia. Their backs are covered with a thick coat of organic material. It's a fertile land, an ideal place for life to take root. It's common for TerraBeast's organic carapace to form blight and attract unhealthy creatures. They rely upon Astors to help keep them healthy. It is unknown how TerraBeasts spawn-- it's believed that Astors may play a role.\n\nThe world of the Terrabeast is procedurally generated and will be different each time you begin a new adventure. As the world grows, your actions help to shape it. If you maintain a healthy TerraBeast, the new biomes that grow will be fertile and healthy. Do you want to create more forests? Plant lots of trees and new biomes will be forests too.\n\nThe world is divided into different biome types, Grasslands, Forest, Mountains, Desert, and many more! Each Biome attracts different OddFauna and has specific needs to remain healthy. \nOddFauna thrive in their favorite biomes.\n\n\nGame Development Plan\nThe game is currently in Pre-Alpha and being developed for PC and will be released on Steam as an Early Access Game. (Wishlist Today!) Early Access will allow us to get it into player hands, get their feedback and have the time to use that feedback to shape the game. We are looking to our community of players to help us make the game as awesome as it can be. \n\nWe are making Alpha & Beta Access available as reward tiers. If you want to get your paws on the game as early as possible back at those levels! Alpha and Beta members have access to special discord servers that we will be reaching out to for feedback. Alpha and Beta backers will be able to vote on certain game decisions and help steer the development of the game.\n\nIf the Kickstarter gets funded, it will allow us to port the game to the Nintendo Switch! We will be able to buy Switch dev kits and ensure the game will perform amazingly on the console. I am incredibly excited at the prospect of developing for my favorite console. It will be a lot of work, but with your support, we will make it happen. OddFauna promises to be amazing on Switch! The Switch version of the game is available as an add-on item and with an estimated delivery date of Q1 2023.\nWe are a husband and wife team. Emma is the Creative mastermind behind OddFauna. She has been creating the cast of characters for years now. A few years ago we started talking more and more about how great a video game would be in her world. Last year, Cliff quit his AAA game development job to make it a reality! We finally are able to expand this awesome universe, and it is such a privilege to get to partner together on this creative journey.\nOur little family\nEverything in the game is hand-sculpted by Emma. This gives the world a very unique style. They are then hand-painted by Emma and handed off to Cliff. Cliff Photoscans them cleans up the models. The animation style and the hand-crafted nature of the models gives the world a stop-motion type of feel, which we love.\nCheck out our updates for more on our process!!!\nHow a character gets created.\nWe've been developing OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast full-time now for a year, self-funding the project entirely with our life savings. For 2 people we have come a long way in a short amount of time. We are approximately 50% of the way through development. While we've made a lot of progress, there is still a lot of work to do. In order to continue to work and retain creative control, we need to ask for your help. We\u2019re also hoping to build a community of passionate backers who want to be involved with the process of development. With your help, we believe we can build the best version of OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast that we possibly can!\n\n\"OddFauna is such a unique and beautifully handcrafted game, made by an indie developer who actively engages with their audience!\" - Tiny Tay (Discord)\nThe vast majority of our budget goes directly into making the gameplay amazing, the visuals beautiful, and the sound gorgeous. We will expand to get assistance with the music and audio and be able to hire help for community management, QA, and marketing.\n\nOddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast is a true passion project of ours, and we've made a lot of financial sacrifices to get this far. We'll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter isn't funded, but the game will be bigger and better if we meet our fundraising goals!\n\nExclusive TerraBeast Hard Enamel Pin\nA limited edition colorway exclusive to the Kickstarter.

Physical figurines you owned contained technology that would allow them to interact with video games, and after Skylander's: Spyro's Aventure and Disney Infinity showed that the model was lucrative and viable, Nintendo joined the fray themselves with their amiibo range.\nDebuting in 2014, the amiibo line has since seen more than 200 figurines released, with a wide ranging degree of functionality in titles on Nintendo platforms. Predominantly focused on core, Nintendo IP, the amiibo figurines do also contain characters from other franchises too. Although not as aggressive with the frequency as a few years ago, there are still new additions every year, and some of the older ones have become much more difficult to find as they have become discontinued.\nWith so many characters available - sometimes different versions of the same character in different ranges too - it would probably be helpful if there was some sort of handbook to have to, erm, hand.\nIntroducing The Unofficial amiibo Handbook. amiibo not included, obviously.\nPresenting The Unofficial amiibo Handbook\nThat's where this little handbook comes in. With 208 amiibo currently obtainable via commericial means, it's a little compendium showcasing every single one of the little plastic (well, more resin really... some are wool!) recreations of some of the finest video game characters that have ever existed. Whether you intend to collect every single one, select ones or certain franchises, The Unofficial amiibo Handbook will have you covered, with excerpts for each character packed with information and fun facts. There's even approximate pricing should you wish to purchase them today.\nAh, fluffy wooly Yoshi! Or rather, 'Green Yarn Yoshi\" as it is correctly known. No, you won't get free amiibo. Sorry.\nWho is it written by?\nPublished under the Ninty Media branding, The Unofficial amiibo Handbook is completely written by Paul Murphy as his debut book. Paul has long been a huge Nintendo fan, and as well as creating Ninty Fresh Magazine and Switch Player Magazine, also happens to own every single amiibo. Well, the ones available via retail. Nobody really counts the exclusive golden ones that Capcom gave away in competitions. It has always been Paul's dream to write a book and it's quite fitting that something that started out of curiosity with a few Breath of the Wild characters culminated in something tangible after four years of collecting. The handbook is being designed by long-time Ninty Media Art Editor, Jhonatan Carneiro and is vibrant and colourful throughout. It's a proper book, we've applied for an ISBN number and everything and this will be the first print edition. Surely you want a first edition of someone's first book?\nExample spread from the handbook and the cover. Pages are styled in a similar manner to the amiibo packaging.\nWho is it for?\nUltimately, anyone who is a Nintendo fan, especially those with an interest in amiibo. Whether you have a passing interest in the range or have seriously entertained grabbing any, it's essential. And will go a long way to making someone's dream come true! If you've enjoyed Paul's writing or magazine projects, you will definitely enjoy this! Please help a silly Nintendo aficiondo's lifelong ambition come to fruition. It's packed with loads of fun facts as well. Did you know that there are 13 Link amiibo? 13? That's the most represented character! Did you know that Sonic didn't actually debut in Sonic the Hedgehog? Did you know that more than 30 amiibo have swords? There's 200+ more fascinating bits of insight as well as an overview on toys-to-life.\nNintendo recolouring amiibo really helped here! This images shows the different options available.\nWhat reward options are available?\nHandbook: Standard Edition\nThe standard option is for a print copy of the handbook, which will have more than 200 pages. It's perfectly pocket sized at A6 dimensions but will have a huge amount squeezed into that. It's currently projected to reach 40,000 words!\nHandbook: Sponsor Edition (Including Early Bird)\nIf you wanted to support Paul's dream a little more and keep better track of your amiibo collecting needs, we have a level which will see your name added to the book as a sponsor to thank you, as well as an A2 sized checklist poster. This level also includes a digital download for the handbook. There are 500 of these in total, half of which are discounted \"Early Bird\" options which expire after a week!\nHandbook: Super Mario 128 Edition\nThere's also a tier where Paul will personally dedicate your copy and number it; there will only be 128 signed copies, and all numbered accordingly in line with your backer number. These levels also come with a \"Certified amiibo Fan\" enamel badge, and backers of Ninty Fresh Magazine will be familiar with these!\nYou can also add extra posters badges or additional (discounted) copies of the handbook. Artwork subject to change.\nWhat about add-ons?\nThis campaign has also allowed us to utilise add-ons. If you want additional copies of the magazine, or want to add badges and/or posters then you should be able to add more if you so desire. These will all be shipped to you in addition to what comes with your pledge.\nAny Stretch Targets?\nAs we managed to hit our funding target in just a couple of hours, we have been asked about stretch goals and others things we can add to the project. Whilst the handbook and shipping models are more or less locked in (it was expected to be a certain weight) we do have a little wiggle room. As such we have slight amount of tolerance to add extras, and the first of these will be a little guide to the Pok\u00e9mon Rumble U figures. A prescursor to amiibo, this range of Pok\u00e9mon characters worked exclusively with Pok\u00e9mon Rumble U. Obviously it wasn't long lived, but I thought it would be an interesting addition to the handbook! Rather than a monetary stretch target, I've set this as a backer-related one. Once we hit 1000 backers, this additional section will go into the handbook.\nExample spread displaying different amiibo from other series. Paul has also tried to be funny and informative.\nWhen will The Unofficial amiibo Handbook launch?\nWe have marked August as the launch for the handbook, but we do hope to have it packed and released long before the end of that month. Progress and updates will be communicated throughout the campaign. With 208 entries to write, Paul is currently writing between 4 and 8 per day and design is proceeding concurrently. Around 25% of the handbook has already been written. We will communicate regularly throughout to keep you up to date.\nWhat about other books?\nLet's get this one nailed on first! Paul does have other ideas and can see a possibility that this could become a range of \"Little Nintendo Handbooks\" but we need to get the first one funded first and we need your help to get this over the line.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving published and released over almost 100 independent print magazines, Ninty Media are well-versed at producing print-based content. The current global climate continues, but we don't anticipate any obstacles to producing this handbook.\n\nPaul Murphy has now become a full-time games writer and is focusing on this handbook, writing 4-8 entries per day. At the time of this Kickstarter going live, approximately 25% of the book has been written already. That August release date is conservative, we do expect this handbook to launch before then.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe Unofficial amiibo Handbook has been designed to mimic and evoke the packaging styling of The Amiibo figurines themselves.

Grab your friends and explore what's left of the surface. Fight some machines. Blow 'em up for parts. Put the parts back together to make cool toys. Or sell 'em. You do you, Diver.\nFeatures\nCo-op as an additive experience: As long-time board and card game fans, we built this game to play with each other. That doesn't mean you can't go it solo - the party's four characters can be controlled by one to four players.\nAn ever-changing wasteland: No two game sessions will ever be quite the same. You're exploring - and fighting against - a location deck, and what goes into that deck, well, who knows?\nBring-your-own-game: In Adventure Mode, you craft the location deck. Stuff it full of monsters, or just put in a bunch of loot. Easy, hard, brutal - build the experience you want to play and then grab a few friends to share it with.\n Have a listen as you read to set the mood. \nHumanity has been chased off the surface by possessed machines. We live in giant city ships, far outside the robots' influence, while they strip our home of its resources. The only people insane enough to save our asses by going down there and fighting to bring materials back are the Divers.\nFor the entire duration of our Kickstarter campaign, our servers will be live for you to play Wastenauts online with friends new and old. It's a great opportunity to play what we've made so far!\nThere are three ways to get into the alpha - choose what's best for you:\n Sign up to Playtest directly on Steam - we're processing these requests daily, so bear with us on some delays\n Ping us on Discord - join the Discord and we'll message you a Steam key ASAP\n Download the latest on Game Jolt - for our non-Steamers, a downloadable build is available on Game Jolt\n Request a key on Rainmaker - if you're a content creator on Twitch, Facebook, or Youtube, we've partnered with Rainmaker.gg to distribute keys so you can play the game for your channel\nRight now, the alpha includes over 100 cards, five playable characters, and two zones - plenty of content to get a great feel for the game. Please note that alpha access will be restricted to backers after the campaign closes. \nThe best way to learn how to play is to dig into the free alpha (which has a tutorial!), but who doesn't love a rulebook?\nAt the start of the game, a timed skylight is launched, and will alert a passing cityship to come pick you up after a set number of days. You'll only have that limited time to get as many resources as you can!\nEach day of Wastenauts is broken into two phases: exploration and camp. During the exploration phase, players take turns drawing cards from a shared zone deck and responding to what they've drawn. Loot and resources get added to your hand, events require some choices to be made, and of course monsters need to be fought. Use abilities from your hand to boost your damage, and then roll dice to deal damage to the bots and scavs you find in the deck.\nRoll dice to fight monsters in combat, and increase your dice pool with gear, abilities, and more!\nAfter every team draws their cards, play turns to the camp phase. Think of camp as \u201creturning to town\u201d in your favorite dungeon crawler - here you'll be able to craft new gear, trade items with your party members, and strategize for the next exploration phase. Certain abilities will allow you to make the most of your camp phase, including scouting the deck, healing injuries, and more.\nUse the camp phase to plan for the next day, including scouting and rearranging the deck!\nWhen your days are up, the skylight goes off and it's time to beat back whatever bosses have been attracted by it. Use all the tools you've got in an all-out fight, because if you lose here, you'll be heading skyside empty-handed.\nAfter a set number of days, a boss will appear - beat it to fight your way back home!\nAfter each session, use your loot to purchase new cards for the next trip - abilities, blueprints, and even monsters to add to the deck and make it harder. The harder your next dive, the better the rewards!\nUse salvage to upgrade buildings on the ship, including the store where you can buy new cards!\nEquip ability cards before diving, and use them to survive until the boss!\nAbility cards are the core of every Diver's arsenal. Each ability has a unique effect suited to its owner, from combat-oriented effects to deck manipulation and more. Most ability cards stay with you the entire game, and you'll come to rely on them heavily as you work your way through the deck. Before playing a game you'll choose from your library of ability cards which few you'd like to bring. Some work better with others from other characters, and some are better suited to specific locations, so check with your teammates to figure out the perfect loadout!\nCraft gear as you make your way through the deck out of a library of blueprints!\nQuick wit and gumption aren't going to cut it on the surface - you're going to need the right equipment. Well, you're going to need some equipment. You'll unlock a library of gear blueprint cards to take into every dive with you, some of which are general purpose and some of which can only be crafted by a single character. Be warned though, once crafted these things are pieces of junk. While you'll keep the blueprints forever, you'll need to craft them every time you reach the surface. They won't last the trip back home.\nFrom unruly scavengers to possessed robots, each deck is jam-packed with monsters. And you can pack it further. Unlock harder and stronger monster cards and add them to the deck in Adventure Mode for more rewards. You'll grab what loot you can from downing scavengers, but KO'ing bots will add them to your hand. Bots can be disassembled for all kinds of good stuff at camp, including parts to craft your gear blueprints. Or, keep dead bots in your hand and use them to power certain ability and gear cards.\nYou've jumped off the side of a floating cityship for a reason, not just for the fun of it. You're here to try to gather some resources and bring them back and keep civilization afloat. Salvage cards can be used after each session to increase the rank of buildings on your ship, allowing you to unlock more cards, upgrade the ones you have, and more. But salvage cards can also be used to craft gear blueprints. How badly do you really need to craft that microphone, Lena?\nMost people fled the surface when the robots attacked, but that doesn't mean the surface is empty. Event cards throughout the deck represent random encounters on your dive, from freak Flitstorms to groups of fleeing refugees. Many of these cards require the party to make strategic choices about how to resolve them.\nThere are dozens of other card types in Wastenauts already. Finding Bits as you adventure will improve your attack card for that session. NPC cards will unlock new systems and quests. Found Gear can grant you a temporary additional ability card. Rare Resources can be used by the Clergy to permanently upgrade your cards. Augment cards can directly improve a character's speed, power, health and more.  And we have plans to add so many more!\n\nWant to learn more? The official community wiki has enough info for the most intense buildcrafters.\nKickstarter gives us a great way to work directly with fans of the game and continue to build a community around Wastenauts. It's a fantastic tool for communication with all y'all, and allows us to make exclusive items for the game that we otherwise wouldn't be able to.\nIf you've played the alpha, you've undoubtedly seen our favorite \"TEMP ART\". Your contributions will not only help expedite the art for these cards, it will also go towards the addition of visual effects, development, and more.\nOur goal is to get you the Discord Role and Dice Skin as soon as possible after you back the game. That way you can play the alpha while showing off your backer status!\nLet the hunks of junk on the surface know you've got each other's backs with this animated portrait frame. At launch both you and your friend will unlock the heart-shaped frame to assign to your characters. These portrait frames power up whenever you play with your refer-a-friend buddy.\nHere's what you do:\nBack the Kickstarter\nTell a friend to back the Kickstarter\nOn the survey we send in May, tell us your friend's email \nThanks so much for stopping by our page!

We hope that the campaign-long alpha, which you can play right now, shows you the work we've put into the game and confirms our commitment to see it through.\n\nAt this juncture we do not anticipate we will be further impacted by Covid-19, as our team has managed to successfully transition to a workflow during this period. \n\nOur greatest risk to this project comes from a lack of visibility. Although we will always support a single-player mode for the game, Wastenauts is best with other friends and when the servers are full of new Divers.

Please, enjoy, and share it if you like it - WE ARE IN THE HOME STRETCH NOW!\nMore is more in Vokabulantis and these stretch goals will get us all a lot more of it!   \nVokabulantis is a love-driven co-op platformer adventure. The game is inspired by games like Inside, Unravel and Little Nightmares, yet it's made by hand. \nJoin Kurt and Karla in their struggle to restore peace to Vokabulantis - and to express their feelings for each other after their words have been taken away. \nStop motion gameplay animation of Karla by Frej Bengtsson\nCONCEPT ART: The enormous and beautiful Verbe Carbs bring life and movement to everything in Vokabulantis. They are a vital part of the world or rather have been before. They are now cut off. The Word F\u00fchrer\u2019s waist has them cornered and out of influence.\n \"I got 4 kids and I want them to play Vokabulantis. They should get scared, laugh, cry, concentrate and be entertained out of their minds. They don't always need sugar coated pop to feel entertained. It's important to me, they get great alternatives. They last!\"  \nGame designer - Esben Kj\u00e6r Ravn\nGAMEPLAY - Karla lends Kurt a hand\nYou enter Vokabulantis just as Kurt and Karla are about to say, what they feel for one another.\nActually they've just found themselves stuck in that moment unable to get a word out, and then suddenly they are thrown into Vokabulantis.\nHere the kids have to embark on an epic quest to save the world of language. If they fail, they will be stuck in that moment forever.\nThey may never get to say, what they want to say to each other.\nThe intro scene from the Vokabulantis manuscript\nThe game can be played as a single player or as co-op. It is targeted for all major platforms, but thus far we can guarantee you a Steam release. \nFull story play-through of 6-8 hours of gameplay and an additional 2-4 hours if you hunt for all the hidden quirks and achievements of Vokabulantis.\nThe game design of Vokabulantis is guided by a novel dogma we call Emotional Mechanics.\nEverything in the game is designed to make you feel, what the characters feel. You are not being told what they feel, but you feel, what they feel, because of the game design. \nUnder that dogma rhythm based levels with a pumping beat spark irresistible joy as the protagonists just survived a life threatening mission. \nYour sudden ability to float kindles the feeling of relief having found each other again, when you thought all hope was lost.\nSo happy you could fly? We are prototyping levels, that make you feel like anything is possible. The level designs are really there for you, they want you to succeed. It's gonna feel like bubbly joy!\nSome places the world opens itself up as you journey through it effortlessly, and you feel so confident, that you start to believe everything turns out the way you want it.\nYou can experience much darker emotions, where each character is trapped alone in illogical split screens mirroring the insanity of your inability to connect with someone.\nFeeling alone? One of the Emotional Mechanics we are currently prototyping is a splitscreen mechanic, where you are isolated with each character, but you can try to manipulate the split screens to see, if you may find away through the insanity.\nYou also get to tap into the bond forming between the kids and their literal distance will start influencing the level.\nBe aware of being close and giving space is key to any succesful relationship - In Vokabulantis, that becomes an actual gameplay mechanic, where the distance between the players is part of the level design.\nThese emotional mechanics and many more are currently in development and we love to get to a place, where we can start showing them off to you for real! \nWithin the emotional mechanic dogma, you'll also experience relatable and recognizable classical platforming throughout the game - Kurt raises the rope Karla hangs on to by activating a word power zone\n \"When I build puppets I put so much time and love into them, and it's hard to let them go when handing them over to the animators. But here I'm able to \"animate\" them myself in a sense, when I play. It feels like I breath life into my puppets. And I simply love that.\" \nAction based gameplay - Karla rocking some classic platforming skills\n\nPut the sketches for the music of Vokabulantis in your ears and enjoy the art concepts below. That should give you a sense of how it feels to visit Vokabulanits.\nCLICK IMAGE TO SEE IN FULL SIZE - Map of Vokabulantis\nCONCEPT ART: In Vokabulantis the most precious material is Word Crystal. Although the vast word-crystal mines are beautiful and bountiful, they are now scarce, since they became controlled by the Word F\u00fchrer.\nCONCEPT ART: The refinery of Word Crystal uses vast amounts of Wordpower. It corrupts and poluts Vokabulantis. But the Word F\u00fchrer is only interested in complete control and adherence to the rules.\n \"I've built my own studio, I didn't take any formal education, so everything has always been possible to me in a sense. But this is really taking it to a new level. My field of art is literally evolving through this project. Never have stop motion been this dynamic and interactive. To be able to bring this to stop motion makes me proud.\" \nStop Motion and game director - Johan Oettinger\n\nCONCEPT ART: Old mining machinery and trash are everywhere in the underworld of Vokabulantis, where the corrupted Wordpower has twisted the minds of the creatures living there, and forced them into a hidden existence and uncanny presence.\nCONCEPT ART: Deep in old tunnels and caves of the mines Numeralia hides. She is the powerful Witch of Numbers - a fiery old femmes fatales or treacherously innocent child of all ages, but Kurt and Karla need her help.\nCONCEPT ART: To save the Verbe Carbs Kurt and Karla must travel across vokabulantis. When they finally reach the lake of the Verbe-Carbs things are not what they seem.\nCONCEPT ART: The forest of thought called Pando was once a beautiful flourishing network of interaction. But the wild pollution of Vokabulantis has frozen Pando and left it in darkness.\nCONCEPT ART: The City of Noun is a storage facility bigger than any city in our world. Here everything that has a name has a container in the container towers. The Kustodian of the city is an eccentric old robot with a few loose fuses.\nCONCEPT ART: The Custodian sends Kurt and Karla to the giant Rose Gardens. They must return Grandma Marble\u2019s head there. It turns out she is more powerful and demanding than the Custodian had let them know - an ancient force like the Word F\u00fchrer.\nCONCEPT ART: Kurt and Karla desperately need help from the swamp of the Article Heads. The kids have lost themselves, or rather their self, crossing the giant mirror palace. The Article Heads hold the power to change the unspecific to something specific and vice versa.\nYou get seamlessly in and out of cutscenes. This approach draws you close to the characters and their story as the hand crafted experience brings real life to the game.\nAn in game shift between gameplay and cutscene\nCutscene of Kurt comforting Karla after fall and the Custodian with his mind on other things\n\nHere's is how we make stop motion and handcrafted sets end up as dynamic gameplay.  \nIn the studio we shoot each frame in the stop motion animation several times with different lightings. See why below...\nWith the extended process, when doing the stop motion photography described above, we are able to light our characters dynamically in Unity, making them blend seamlessly in the environments of the game.\nThis is photogrammetry in action. Photogrammetry is the technique we use to 3D scan handcrafted models.\nThrough these technical solutions all our real life handcrafted objects and animations are brought to life digitally.\nStop motion animation of Kurt crawling up a 3D concrete block. He passes through light and shadow.\nCutscene that has been assembled and lit digitally from handcrafted set elements and animations.\nThis is a video of the handcrafted and scanned and ready for the game 3D versions:\nPLAY\n\nWe ensure the handcrafting is well thought out and tested before it's created by following these steps:\nIda Asferg Jakobsen and Bent Ejaas working on Karla\nHere's a small video of an array of props, characters and set elements, that have akreadt been handcrafted for Vokabulantis:   \nPLAY\n\nKarla and Kurt have found their way to the part of City Of Noun, that no longer functions as a giant storage facility and now unemployed Worders are building small settlements on the abandoned structures and farming their mushrooms there - The scene is setup and lit in 3D in the game engine Unity. Everything is 3D except the two kids and Yarn Broccoli in the background, that are all photos simulating 3D.\nVokabulantis is made by a team of the most talented and experienced people from game development and stop motion animation. \nThey work within the game development studio Kong Orange and the stop motion animation studio Wired Fly - the production company duo, that undertakes the development of Vokabulantis. \nWe work with top shelf stop motion talent, who are veterans of Aardman, Laika and Lego stop motion productions.\nThe game development team has launched several titles between them, most notably Felix The Reaper in the fall of 2019.\nIda (Handcrafting and Puppet Workshop Lead) - Mikkel (Concept Artist) - Mart\u00edn (Concept Artist) - Morten (Concept Founder & Story world poet and author) -  Johan (Concept founder & Stop Motion Studio Wired Fly Owner/Head) - Esben (Game Studio Kong Orange Owner/Head) - Hannah (Masterful puppet builder) - Julia (Feature Stop Motion Animator, Teacher and Author) - Frej (Feature Stop Motion Animator, Filmmaker) - Danail (Feature Stop Motion Animator) - Daniel B (Programmer) - Casper C (Computer Graphics Artist) - Casper K (Computer Graphics Artist) - Nicolas (Audio and Music) - Christophe (Feature Stop Motion Animator) - Kristoffer (Programmer) - Daniel H (Programmer) - Nils (Level Design Lead) - Esben D (Programmer) - Boris (Co-Author) - Johnny (Level Design) - Sofie (Puppet Builder) - Stellan (Prop and Model Maker) - Katrine (Prop, storyboarder and model maker) - Andy (Feature Stop Motion Animator) - John (CG Artist) - Marie Cattiaut  (Animator) - Camille Scudier (Prop and Puppet maker) Margaux Humblet (Prop Maker)\nKurt and Karla gets brief by the Custodian who is fairly insensitive to the fact, that they lost their mouths\nTwo stop motion animated characters we will ad if we reach the relevant stretch goal - Numeralia and Yarn Broccoli\nThe Custodian and a Dust Bug waiting to be part of the Vokabulantis experience\nIf you have stretch goals to suggest, let us know, and we'll look into adding them. \nBang!

We consider it a strength, that we have already proven, we are able to attract these, which will also be crucial to secure future collaborating partners. We find it overly optimistic to hope to stay fully independent with such a big project as Vokabulantis. We do believe however, that a good Kickstarter campaign result, will help us maintain as much independency as possible in the end.\n\nYES, WE'LL NEED EVEN MORE PARTNERS IN THE END\nUnless this Kickstarter campaign blows through all expectations and we come out way stronger than expected, we do need future partners on top of it. We consider a succesful kickstarter the final boost we need to bring on one or two partners, be it publishers or other parties, that will enable us to finalize the game. Those parties, will be much more comfortable joining the project, when they've seen a powerful Kickstarter performance of Vokabulantis beforehand. \n\nYES, WE ARE IN A FAIRLY EARLY STATE OF DEVELOPMENT\nEven though we have worked on this game for quite a while and we have nailed some critical tech art pipeline developments, we do need more time.

Your deity will deign to share a glimpse of its might to his cult, in exchange for blind devotion. Explore the world around your cult and find ways to please your god, convert the locals into followers and master the art of drawing with blood to use powerful rituals. As devotion grows towards your unholy divinity, you get stronger alongside the cult until you finally have the power to summon your god and cause the end of the world.\nIf being the sole herald of the apocalypse frightens you, fret not for Worship will feature fully fledged online and local multiplayer! You will be able to start a cult of up to 4 players!\nWorship is scheduled for release in 2022 on PC and Consoles.\nPreparing rituals is the bread and butter for devoted cultists. Harness the occult powers granted by your deity through bloody ceremonies and sacrifices. By spilling blood while moving, you can draw symbols on the ground and then activate them to invoke your god\u2019s divine powers.\nRituals are Worship's take on casting spells and it also enables various ways to have fun with the drawing mechanic such as solving puzzles and more! Rituals are designed with cooperative play in mind, because nothing is more fun than painting with your friend's blood!\nHow it Works\n First, you use your ceremonial dagger to start dripping blood on the ground. \n Secondly, while bleeding, you leave a blood trail on the ground as your character moves. Draw with your blood this way.\n Finally, you can activate a ritual while near or inside a drawn symbol to activate your god's magic.\nThe effect of a spell depends on the symbol drawn. Ritual activations will tolerate inaccuracies, but if the drawing isn't close enough to the target symbol or if too much excess blood clutter the ground, the ritual will fail to activate. When this happens, blood recall can be used to \"fix\" parts of the symbol or to erase it completely and start over the drawing.\nBasic rituals\nBasic rituals are the ones every cultist has access to from the start, regardless of the god they worship. These rituals are essential for basic tasks and utility. They include the follower conversion ritual, the building ritual, and a combat ritual.\nAdvanced rituals\nOther more powerful and diverse rituals can by learned by gaining devotion levels, exploring the world and defeating enemies. The effects of these rituals are designed to be fun to use and emergent. Turn your followers into deadly horrors, transform your spilled blood into black flames, infuse enemies with madness and more!\nAs a cultist, you are serving an old god and leading a cult, but followers are what gives you the means to spread your cult\u2019s influence. Follower management is a core game mechanic in Worship and a powerful tool for your cult. You hold influence over all converted followers and can command them with simple orders. The easiest way to understand their purpose and the ways they will be used in Worship is by making a comparison with one of our inspirations; Pikmin! Followers can be likened to the adorable creatures from the beloved Nintendo franchise. Calling them to follow you, making them interact with various buildings and objects, bringing them into battle and using these hollow husks mercilessly are among the things you can do with these faithful bastards.\nConverting the godless into followers\nInstead of relying on traditional resource gathering like most survival or strategy games, in Worship you need to submit the godless to your deity's will, turning them into followers. As a key component for a game about cultists, we wanted the act of converting followers to be more engaging than pressing a button. For this reason, the potential recruits you will encounter while exploring won't always be the same. Each type of godless will have their quirks and behavior that will require different strategies to submit them to the conversion ritual. \nTo spread devotion towards your god, you will need to explore the world, converting followers and finding ways to make your cult stronger. Get your followers and rituals ready and prepare to stumble upon enemies to fight, but also into unexpected and fun encounters. Expect hand-crafted puzzles, unique landmarks, secrets and flavorful events involving the world\u2019s factions. There is plenty of reasons to discover the world around your altar and every time you start a new cult will be different with partially procedurally generated environments combined with hand crafted elements.\nPuzzles\nThe puzzles you will find while exploring will take many shapes and forms. Use logic combined with a skillful use of game mechanics such as commanding followers and drawing with blood to overcome deadly sets of traps and complex contraptions from extinct civilizations. Claim rewards such as devotion gains, new followers, blessings, and for the more complex ones, new rituals.\nLandmarks and secrets\nIf you are the kind of player that enjoys exploring and charting your surroundings in games, looking for surprising finds, your curiosity will be satiated by the discovery of mysterious landmarks. A quantity of these areas are tied to opposing factions and can influence how they interact with your cult. Some might even be pieces of a larger puzzle needed to achieve the ultimate objective of summoning your god. Lastly, some will hold deep secrets that await your discovery. Experiment on these landmarks with the tools at your disposition and reveal their true purpose. Get rewarded with new means to shape the course of the game and grasp knowledge that will impact your subsequent attempts at leading a cult. \nRandom events and encounters\nFinally, it goes without saying that being a cultist leading a bunch of fanatics will bring some conflicts your way. You will need to be prepared to fight mobs of angry peasants, hungry beasts, church inquisitors, and, as the barriers between the mortal realm and the world of the old gods grow thinner: unspeakable horrors. Aside from battles, our design philosophy was to make the world feel more alive with the inclusion of random events with the various factions. These events encountered while roaming the world are built to be fun and impactful for your cult while contributing to the worldbuilding. \nCombat in Worship plays out by combining follower management with rituals while under pressure. This results in a challenge based on strategy and execution in real time that rewards team play, good follower management and fast thinking. Telegraphed attacks and warnings for bigger area of effects makes it a test of skills to survive combat while keeping most of your followers alive. Combat has many purposes in Worship; it can serve as a landmark challenge, a way to spice up exploration or to threaten your cult\u2019s base and more.\nOne the of deadliest horror you'll have to fight against: the Scarlet Behemoth\nBuildings\nBuilding monuments and structures for the cult around your altar is an important part of the gameplay loop and progression in Worship. Each basic building provides utilities like increased max followers count, faster blood regeneration and more. Advanced buildings made with special resources gives upgrades to the cult such as new rituals, buffs to followers or cultists and other impactful effects. If the buildings are destroyed, your cult loses access to the utility or bonus they provided. On the upside, you'll have dozens of obedient fanatics to repair them for you!\nDevotion\nYour god\u2019s influence over the mortal realm is measured by devotion. The more you increase devotion towards your god, the more they can manifest and share their power. Prove your faith and earn enough devotion to level up the cult, giving you access to a blessing of your choice. The blessings available depends on the god worshiped, ranging from catalysts to cult passive bonuses and even ways to alter the game world.\nYou earn devotion by executing various acts of faith. Converting followers, solving puzzles and bringing relics to the altar are various ways to increase devotion. Each god also has their own goals and rewards with more devotion specific actions that relate to those objectives.\n Player progression\nYour devotion and triumphs in the world of Worship will be duly rewarded. To this end, the game will feature a set of objectives that reward you with cosmetics to c ustomize your cultist, skins for your followers and blood effects. You might even unlock new gods to worship. These objectives may carry across your playthroughs as some are tied to long term goals. In other cases, a couple of objectives will have you go out of your way to accomplish a specific feat. Look forward to these challenges if you needed more reasons to dive back into blind fanaticism! \nUnlockable skins for the disciples of the old gods Hubryus and An-Ansgaidh\nNow that you have delved into the occult mechanics and systems Worship has to offer, you might wonder how it all plays out. Fret not, the old gods have not forsaken thee for they have left us with an illustrated diagram that gives some insight on how your Worship experience should unfold.\nAfter choosing the old god your cult worships, you will find yourself at the main altar of your eldritch overlord, alongside any fellow cultist in your party. From there:\nExplore the world, searching for followers to convert and ways to increase devotion towards your god.\nStumble upon enemies, encounter the world factions, and face many potential threats to your cult and your mortal life.\nYour god won\u2019t be satisfied with you only surviving. Go out of your way to make your cult grow by expanding your base around the altar and amassing a mob of faithful fanatics. Doing so will allow you to learn new rituals and make both cultists and followers stronger.\nYou'll do all of this while keeping your ultimate goal in mind: finding a way to summon your god into the mortal realm, ending the world as you know it\nIn addition to being multiplayer with up to 4 players, Worship is also designed with spectators and streamers in mind. At Chasing Rats Games, we believe in the importance of streaming in the current landscape of the videogame industry. We are dedicated to creating games that are awesome to play but also fun to watch. To this end, Worship will feature a fully fledged and customizable streamer mode that will enable various interactions between streamers and their viewers. \nHere are a few examples of what we have in mind: followers named after subscribers watching, monuments reacting to chat chanting the inscription written on them, viewers voting for the faction that will appear in the next event, puzzles where the chat controls objects or traps akin to \u201cTwitch Plays\u201d and more! We also want to implement a system that would allow donations to have a gameplay impact, which we think would benefit both streamers and fans while making a great spectacle.\nWorship takes place in a time in which humanity is struggling to step forward, trying to leave the harshness of a dark age behind. Shackled in a time of poverty and ignorance by the church and others who fear change, most do not have the luxury to think further than day to day survival. Small villages and isolated communities are dispersed on more hospitable lands, with a few cities starting to appear. Most have forgotten how things were before, with only several scattered ruins and fewer living beings bearing testaments of times past. Creeping fog rises in dark corners of the lands, while gods from another world await an opportunity to extend their influence unto the mortal realm. Mystery, horror, fantasy and a smidge of humor meet to create the grim medieval world of Worship.\nThe old gods, immortal entities beyond comprehension of the human mind, dwell on another plane of existence that intersects with the mortal realm. Long ago, humanity worshiped these gods, which nearly brought them to extinction. Since then, most traces of this dark past were destroyed by the church. To even know the existence of these pagan gods is considered heresy in the eyes of the inquisition. As for the gods themselves, they don\u2019t process the world, emotions and desires the same way humans do. Because of their tremendous power and warped minds, their involvement with the mortal realm always led to gruesome outcomes for its inhabitants, despite them not being inherently evil.\nWhile they all reign on the same mysterious plane, the old gods are vastly distinct beings. They all have their own identities, intentions and strengths. As such, here are a few whose altars and shrines of yore still remain in the mortal realm:\nGameplay impact\nWorshipping the sower of insanity is to embrace the transformation of all things, to plunge the world into madness. The acts of devotion he will reward most include corrupting the godless into followers but also changing initial world tendencies. Be on your toes when you pledge allegiance to Hubryus because you might encounter more unspeakable horrors than usual. As his devotion in the mortal realm increases, his power will manifest itself, warping inhabitants and beasts alike into nightmares. When it comes advanced rituals, there will be a focus on transformation and alterations rituals. Warp your followers into horrific thralls and change the course of battles with mind shattering metamorphosis.\nGameplay impact\nCults devoted to the Apostle of Deliverance have adopted his twisted vision. His followers have their sights on the extinction of sentient life, and as such they are fearsome warriors. Acts of faith for An-Ansgaidh are of the murdery kind. Killing will reward more devotion, but so will sacrificing followers and \u201csetting free\u201d the godless instead of converting them. Being faithful to this old god also means that death is sacred and liberated souls are to be left untouched. No necromancy ritual will be available and resurrecting allied cultists is to be punished. An-Ansgaidh is the deity with the vastest choice of offensive rituals, which will make your cult a force to be reckoned with.\nGameplay impact\nWhen you Worship Salithys, you willingly become the most important pawn in her intricate plan. As a reward, you get to lead the only cult that knows and embraces the true nature of the manipulative old god. Using followers as your own puppets will reward more devotion when they complete meaningful tasks for you. Obeying the whispers of Salithys will also offer more rewards than other deities. Worshipping the Deceit Weaver also makes the church less of a menace and even sometimes allies when she deems it necessary. This has the effect of making the coven particularly heinous and dangerous for your cult. While she prefers resorting to deceit and cunning, Salithys has plenty of powerful rituals to offer her faithful. Mind control, powerful healing, and even resurrecting the dead are among her rituals of choice. Injury and death are no reason to escape her rule.\nGameplay Impact\nThe cultists connoisseurs that worship Glub seek to prepare his arrival by amassing the biggest mob of followers the world has ever seen. His faithful are blessed with potent summoning rituals and bountiful blessings. Smother your foes under swarms of toads, buff your many followers and summon gargantuan blobfishes to help you in battle. As his title suggests, Glub will reward with more devotion each new follower birthed from your cult and will also increase the rate at which they are spawned from the appropriate buildings. Incidentally, you will find fewer potential followers while exploring since most of the godless will avoid your rapidly expanding dank empire.\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign, piece together with the community a new old god that will appear in the game! Make your voice heard by joining our community Discord server to vote for your favorite entries or enter the contest with your own. All the information about the event is in the #kickstarter-god-polls channel.\nThe world of Worship is home to several factions that make it feel truly alive and dynamic throughout your games. Some factions are organized groups while others are clusters of a similar kind. You will encounter all of them in due time while exploring the world and growing your cult. Sometimes, they will simply be enemies, while other times, you\u2019ll be able to interact with them through game mechanics. Know that your gameplay actions and decisions towards factions will influence the game world and how these groups see and interact with your cult.\nAs you might have noticed, Worship's art direction is one that is rarely seen in today's ocean of video games. We wanted to make sure our take on the whole cultist genre would stand out from the competition. We decided to go with simple black and white tones mixed with specks of color for the sake of clarity. The main splash of pigment is a bright and striking red, brought to the game by the gallons of blood spilled in the name of the cult.\nThis black and white look was widely inspired by games such as Hidden Folks and KIDS. As for the characters, we aimed for a simple and friendly design with a slightly unsettling touch. A prime example of this would be the little followers that accompany you everywhere you go. Short, simple minded, happy folks with a penchant for destruction and stabbing things.\nParticular attention to music and sound design is a defining characteristic of our company's productions with the amazing L\u00e9andre Monette at the helm of the audio department. Music and audio aren\u2019t an afterthought for us, as we try to use sound design in innovative ways to elevate the gameplay experience. We will once again use Wwise engine to bring to life Worship's soundscape in the way it deserves.\n\nThe critically acclaimed Struggling OST was the musical embodiment of the philosophy behind the game and we seek to do the same with Worship. L\u00e9andre is at work to produce the ultimate cultist game soundtrack with influences and instruments from all over the world. Dive right away into some amazing pieces he composed for the game.\n1. Eldritch Cataclysm: Humanity fell into madness as the towering Eldritch God gazed upon them, passing through the portal.\n2. Clad in Gold and Lies: The church leaves no sinner unpunished and its inquisition tolerates no witches unburnt.\n3. Forbidden Legends: Some myths are better left forgotten and old gods left asleep.\nNew Track Revealed:\n 4. Innocent Blood: Behind the face of an angel lies a deadly mix of absolute devotion and lack of survival instinct.\nAs we did for Struggling, which was translated in 11 languages, we will make sure to work with reputable localization teams to translate the game in as many languages as possible. It is important to us that the game be accessible and localization surely has a big role in that aspect. We can\u2019t currently confirm which languages will make the cut aside from english, but we will definitely monitor the community\u2019s thoughts and requests to make our selection. \nWith Worship, our intention is to release the game on PC and consoles. We only need to determine which consoles will be the smartest choices at the time of Worship's release in 2022 considering how the market is evolving. It is important to us that we satisfy our backers in this regard so don't hesitate to make your voice heard here on Kickstarter or on our Discord server. We will monitor closely what the community wants and keep you updated on the matter as the production moves forward.\nWe are Chasing Rats Games, the passionate team behind Worship and the abomination of a game Struggling. With our industry veterans and our new blood alike, we aim to bring to life games that break the mold and that are as fun as refreshing. The team is super excited to be working on a game as wild as Worship and we want to put in the time and resources needed to fulfill our vision of the game, improved by the community feedback we'll get along the way.\nEach member of the team is driven by a passion for our craft and the will to deliver kickass games that strive to bring something different to the industry. We are now ready to push things further and put all hands on deck for the production of Worship.\nThis is where we humble brag and try to reassure you that the team is talented by showing some awards we won with our previous game, Struggling. We do what we do because we love to create games and we seek to deliver experiences that will resonate with gamers across the globe.\nWhy Kickstarter\nWe want to involve the community as early as we can to help us shape Worship the way players want it to be, and Kickstarter is the best way to do so. We strongly believe that transparency is key to your involvement so we will be upfront with the community. This Kickstarter campaign isn't meant to fully fund the production of Worship, but will be essential to start building a community, to see if players are as excited about the game as we are and also to help the financial viability of the project. More often than not, Kickstarter funds fall short of the kind of production value we aim for with Worship. Rest assured that the amount asked does not reflect the intended quality for the final product. We are assuming part of the risk ourselves and have already secured most of the funding for fulfilling our vision of the game. Kickstarter will enable us to unleash the full potential of Worship and make it the game our players want.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTransparency is one of our top priorities, so it's important that our backers are aware of the challenges and potential risks of the project. Kickstarters do not always result in positive outcomes, especially in an industry as complex as ours. We want to reassure you that we have the resources and experience to deliver Worship as promised. However, the success of the Kickstarter campaign will confirm the community\u2019s excitement for the game, allowing us to put all of our focus on Worship. \n\nWe also want you to know that if you jump in early and back the campaign, some things and design aspects of the game might change during the iteration process. This doesn\u2019t mean that the core vision of the game will change, but that some elements of the final product may differ from what we presented in the early stages of development if we realize that the game would benefit from some design adjustments.\n\nThat being said, Worship isn\u2019t our first rodeo, as we previously shipped a game, including a console port on Switch. We were thrilled with how players received our wacky coop adventure game Struggling, with a 95% of positive user reviews on Steam. We are confident in our ability to deliver the project you are backing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Curious Wanderer", "descp": "Any support is appreciated!

Truly tapped the gauge with an idle digit, like its caress might inspire the needle to swing higher.\nThe problem was time. Time, and distance. Your pilot spun in their chair, thumbing down the system map. Three planets within reach, each promising jobs, supplies and opportunities. But there was no time. Or was there?\nLike an answer to their question, a notification: New Message Received. You knew who had sent it, knew what it said. You saw your pilot crack a grin and angle their face to the nearest camera.\n\u201cChoice is yours, chief. Where to next?\u201d\nWe\u2019re Crispy Creative, a diverse indie studio of veteran game devs and industry newcomers alike!\nBetween us we\u2019ve worked at some of the most exciting studios in gaming, from Obsidian to Telltale Games, and on titles including The Outer Worlds, Batman: The Enemy Within, the upcoming Kena: Bridge of Spirits, and more!\nNow we\u2019re ready to strike out on our own and bring our brand new universe to the world.\nWe\u2019ve been working on our new project for a while now, and are super proud to be launching the Kickstarter for our game A Long Journey to an Uncertain End.\nBelow you\u2019ll get an overview of the game itself, a feel for the characters and world and some insight into what we\u2019re hoping to achieve on this project. If you like what you see, we hope you\u2019ll join us on our journey to make our ideas a reality!\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End is a narrative-focused space opera that\u2019ll have you flying around the universe, assembling an unruly crew from an eclectic cast of characters, and taking any job you can to keep one step ahead of your abusive Ex. The twist: you\u2019re not just piloting a ship\u2026you are the ship.\nEvery planet, moon and space station is a valuable source of jobs and precious rewards. Assign crew tasks based on their skills, and help their decisions along the way. If everything pays off you\u2019ll have what you need to escape, and if not...well, you can call in those favors you\u2019ve been saving.\nFly across a unique galaxy, from the dust-bitten badlands of the Rim, to the techno-industrial megacities of the Core\u2026and Beyond.\nRecruit an eclectic crew from a diverse cast of characters with their own stories and varied skill sets.\nExplore planets, moons and space stations as you put distance between you and your abusive ex. Match your crew to jobs and decide their actions along the way. If all else fails, you can always rely on a favor or two.\nManage your resources to keep your crew happy. Boosting between worlds can take its toll, as can failing at jobs. A happy crew is a productive crew\u2026 most of the time.\nEvery crew member has a skill they excel in. And every job has a recommended skill! Line up the right crew with the right job (or don't) to see what the outcomes might be.\nEven if you don't have the perfect skill, having skills that are adjacent, or even opposite can still yield interesting results. And sometimes the most interesting outcomes aren't the most obvious.\nGet to know your crew and they'll reveal hidden talents and expertise that might help you in a pinch. You'll also need to pay attention to the situation and the local giving you the job. They may not always be who they appear...\nMake the right choices though and you can earn some favors to use elsewhere. Get into a pinch on the massive urban world of Matu? That shady trader from Spacer's Folly still owes you one! That grateful wildebug rancher's family ties may stretch further than you think. Best keep an eye out as there are hidden helpers throughout the galaxy...\nIt's not all planet-hopping and job-doing though! Crew need supplies and you need fuel and repairs to stay in tip top shape. Your Ex is always in pursuit so keep an eye on how many days till they catch up!\n\nThe Cast\nThe Ex\n(CW: abusive relationship)\nDue to the immense cognitive fortitude and variety of knowledge required, only a fraction of a fraction of the universe's population could even dream of becoming A.I. Therapist. Unfortunately for you, one of them is currently on your trail - your Ex. Relentless and unwilling to stop until you're back in their care, your ex will expend every resource at their disposal to ensure your return.\nC.O.R.G.I.\nIf you're the captain, then C.O.R.G.I. is your first mate - your Comprehensive Operational Responsive Graphical Interface. While not really a dog in the old-fashioned sense of the word, C.O.R.G.I. does have all the characteristics of zeir organic counterparts: loyal, trusting, and always with your best interest in mind - the rest of the crew being a close second.\nAylah Tress \nThroughout her travels across the 'verse, Aylah has arguably lost more than she ever gained. Luckily, neither age nor travel has dulled her wit, compassion, and disdain of authority. She still believes in the unity of machines and humanity, and keeps the crew and the ship together - either with a sturdy wrench, a stern talking to, or in some instances, both.\nDenholm (Denny) Welker\nAfter life handed him a sack of lemons, Denny came to the conclusion that the best way to survive was his way - one of subterfuge and guile. Turns out he was pretty good at it too, spending his formative years developing his skills without getting bogged down with concepts like \"personal property\" or \"petty theft\". Lemonade will only get you so far.\nMatias Vidala\nAfter an accident during his short-lived career as drag persona \u201cGloria Borealis\u201d (involving a pyrotechnic \u201ccomet tail\u201d, several audience members, and third degree burns), the flamboyant Matias may or may not be on the run and/or doing a revival tour. Although sugary-sweet most of the time, Matias can be quick to sour...\nTruly Dashum\nTruly is one of their system's youngest pilots, and an ace at that. Quietly intense with a subtle flirty streak, Truly is a romantic at heart, collecting small items from their travels to decorate their outfit with.\nZera (Zeke) Hakkimirez\nWith her extra set of bionic arms, Zera, or Zeke as she prefers, is a cyclone of prepping, measuring, and cooking in the galley. Her upbeat demeanor and genuine compassion for others inspires her to speak  truest language of love: food.\n Set thousands of years in the future, in a universe where space flight is mundane, A Long Journey to an Uncertain End takes place in the aftermath of explosive expansion and technological marvel.\nWhen Artificial Intelligence blossomed into sentience, the ensuing symbiosis of humankind and machines allowed for galaxies to be charted and planets terraformed - but sentience came at a cost. It led to A.I. becoming aware of their own existence and purpose, and after horrifying conflicts between creators and creations, an era of prohibition. Machines were expected to return to subservience - a school of thought made manifest by the study and practice of A.I. Therapy.\nEarth is but a distant memory to most - \"home\" no longer refers to a single planet, but a shared universe. It's a time of unity and diversity, with humans from all corners of all galaxies coming together for peace and progress. You, however, as well as your rebellion and escape, still feel the chilling shadow of mistrust sowed centuries ago.\nTumbleweeds bounce over a burnished plateau, the ground here a crust that shimmers in the heat. All is silent...until it isn\u2019t.\nThe new sound begins as a feeling in the gut. Louder it comes, dust rising in a tsunami as the sunlight retreats behind the descending shadow. With a scream, landing gear extends from the incoming vessel and slowly, gently, kisses the ground.\nTouchdown.\nA ramp extends and deposits three figures onto the plain. One looks about, head swivelling like a predator on the hunt.\n\u201cGreat...another skuzzhole.\u201d\n\nA Long Journey wears its inspirations on its sleeve: proudly. Our mission was to meld the vast imagination of French illustrator Moebius to the vibrant sci-fi operas of TV series Firefly and the works of author Becky Chambers.\nWe wanted to create a universe full of the familiar and the unexpected, to put new twists on old formulas and create something truly unique. Whether you're exploring the backwater worlds of the Rim or the megacities of the Core, we\u2019ve done our best to create worlds that are engaging, exciting and new.\n  The Crispy Crew\n Up to this point we\u2019ve been completely self-funded; working on the game when we can to promote a healthy environment for the whole team. We've gotten to the point where we're ready to work on the game full-time!\nWith your help we can devote all our energies to quickly finishing development and shipping the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development is inherently risky.

We've already prototyped and implemented all of the core gameplay features, as well as worked through our production pipelines.\n\nThe biggest risk to the timeline is expanding our scope based on user feedback or polishing features more than anticipated.

You play as both the reader of the book and its main character, Luka.  Explore the world to find word charms.  Use your charms to change the course of fate! \nAs you explore Beacon Pines, you'll find charms with words etched into them\nNormal isn\u2019t what it used to be.  Glowing trees, shady corporations, running for your life, and never knowing who to trust. Welcome to Beacon Pines!\nBeacon Pines has some dark secrets\nThe tale of Beacon Pines is not complete and there are words missing at important moments. Fill in a missing word, and be pulled directly into the book to play out the events that unfold based on your decisions.\nPlay as both the reader of the book and its main character Luka\nIf you don\u2019t like how it goes, you can always go back and change your decisions. In fact, reshaping events is an important part of the game.  \nThe Chronicle lets you quickly go back and change dicisions you've made\nEvery character in Beacon Pines has their own unique personality, backstory, and motivations. Depending on the decisions you make, you may meet entirely different characters, find new charms, and discover more details about what the heck is happening in Beacon Pines.\nSmooth moves, Luka\n\n Features \nExplore an illustrated mountain town to collect word charms\nUse those words to alter the story\nUse those words to make friends\nUse those words to weave the fabric of fate itself\nOpen the magical book at any time to go back and change your decisions\nBeautifully illustrated art by Ilse Harting\nOriginal soundtrack by award winning musician Matt Meyer\n\nLuka\nLuka is just trying to survive the last summer of his childhood. Help him make new friends, uncover long-buried secrets, chuck some stuff, and mostly try to take things day-by-day. \nRolo\nRolo is Luka\u2019s best friend, Rolo is always there to get him out of any scrapes along the way. (Never mind the fact that Rolo is generally the one who gets Luka into trouble in the first place.) \nBeck \nBeing the new kid in town is exactly the kind of cliche that Beck hates. She and her parents just moved to Beacon Pines from the \u201cbig city\u201d.  She doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, but maybe she\u2019ll soften up to Luka and Rolo. \n And Many More!\n\nBeacon Pines is a simple mountain town caught between the past and the future. Some cling to the past while others try to cover it up. Change is bubbling, the sort of change that can dredge up old secrets.\nIt\u2019s been hard times for Beacon Pines ever since the old Valentine\u2019s Fertilizer plant shut down, after the accident. Most folks seem content with forgetting that it ever happened. But for Luka, it's personal.\nPeople mostly keep to themselves, which is a shame really, because if they talked to each other they might realize that strange things are happening in Beacon Pines. Earthquakes, strange lights in the night, folks going missing, creatures lurking in the shadows, glowing puddles, and strange men in hazmat suits who seem very interested in it all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're a bit scattered around the globe, but who isn't these days? Our scrappy team of 3 has been working together for a few years now, and are excited to share Beacon Pines with the world!\nThere must be something in the water in the Netherlands that produced great artists! Ilse has managed to create not only all of the wonderful characters - but the entire town of Beacon Pines - based only on quick brainstorming sessions with the team. Working as a remote group isn't exactly easy, but few things are more enjoyable than waking up, looking in dropbox, and finding more amazing art for Beacon Pines. \nEver since a young age when a family friend gave Matt a dusty guitar from their attic, he's been writing music. He started programming his own games as a direct route to becoming a video game composer. What better way to get your music in a game... than to make your own game? After winning an IGF award for his music in the game Ephemerid, Matt decided to continue making his own games, featuring his own music. \nOur resident word-nerd. After joining the team to help with game design, it became clear that Brent would play an important role in developing the story of Beacon Pines. He brings with him inspiration from the pulp mystery novels he read as a kid, as well as the inexhaustible drive to discover the perfect bad joke.\n\n\n\nThe groundwork for the game is already in place.  We've got the core mechanics hammered out, a custom scripting engine that we use to write all of the story and events, lots of art and music, and the first two chapters of gameplay complete.\nCustom scripting engine makes it super easy to add dialog, animations, sounds, etc!\nSo, we've made it past a lot of the big roadblocks already.  The main thing left to do is finish the content for the game. Still, that's a big thing. Let's break it down into chunks, as that will also show where the funding will go if this Kickstarter succeeds:\nUp to this point, the game has been completely self-funded. We've used earnings from previous games and side jobs to get us this far. Any funding we receive from this Kickstarter (after fees, taxes, and rewards are fulfilled) will go directly into development of the game. If we're lucky, we might even raise enough bring on a community manager which will free us up to focus even more on making the game as good as it can be!\nObligatory behind the scenes 2d/3d representation ;-)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe mechanics and systems of the game are pretty much feature-complete. And a fair chunk of the story and scripting is already written. However, there is still a lot of story to be told.\n\nThe biggest challenge going forward will be good-old-fashioned content creation. We have a complex and twisting story to tell about Beacon Pines, and lots of characters still to introduce. The majority of our time going forward will be dedicated to creating the remaining music, art, writing, and animations to complete the tale of Beacon Pines.\n\nNintendo Switch: We have access to Nintendo Switch dev kits and will begin developing for switch as soon as the Kickstarter succeeds (fingers crossed!). That being said, we are fully aware that releasing on consoles involves lots of additional certification and testing. If at any point we think we'll need help hitting the deadline for Switch, we will reach out to a reputable third party to help out with the process (we've spoken with a few already).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nFor the acrylic charms and standees, we've chosen an eco-friendly manufacturer who only uses 100% recycled and recyclable acrylics that are completely VOC and HFC free. The sticker sheets are made from responsibly sourced papers from managed woodlands and are 100% PVC free and 100% recyclable. We're looking for similarly environmentally-friendly manufacturers for the remaining physical rewards.\nSustainable Distribution\nSimilar to the manufacturing of charms, standees, and sticker sheets, the producer packages these items in bubble wrap made from 100% recycled, 100% biodegradable paper and seals those packages with 100% recyclable, brown paper tape.

Discover what other methods can be used to increase fruit yields even further!\nMushrooms can be found in the wild or grown with the right equipment\nCraft various drones to help you with farm work, fishing, and general support. Each drone can be enhanced with up to 3 Drone Parts, giving them extra functionality. Support Drones are unique in that they can be equipped and will follow you around.\nA Water Drone automatically waters your crops\nChoose drone parts to modify drones to suit your needs\nA support drone can be equipped to provide extra inventory slots and additional firepower for the Dungeons.\nSomething I have not spent much time on yet are the farm animals. I plan to have around 5-8 different species that can be bred and will produce valuable goods. Some species may not be familiar to ones on Earth.\n\nOne species that has already been decided on is the the Alpaca. I could not resist working on this first. You'll be able to harvest super soft wool from them.\nFarm Alpacas for their soft, soft wool\nA behind-the-scenes look at animating these little fellas.\nWhat are Pixies?\nPixies are tiny little helpers that can be caught. They can then be placed on various things for different effects. You can sustainably harvest stone from rocks and wood from trees without destroying them using Blue Pixies. Green Pixies will help increase the growth rates of any plant or speed up processing times for the machines you craft! Discover what rare Red Pixies can do - if you ever catch one.\nPixies can harvest resources like wood and stone without destroying the tree or rock\n\nHow to catch Pixies\nPixies can be caught by placing edible offerings inside Pixie Shrines. Check back the following day to see if you find a pixie inside it. The quality of the offering and location of the pixie shrine will determine the chances of attracting a Pixie and also type pixie caught. Shrines can be crafted, however, the town center has a Golden Shrine that, once restored, can be used to attract rarer Pixies.\nDiscover what else pixies can do when you discover them\nRestore structures around town and put them to good use\nDiscover Cards along the way and eat them to gain their powers.\nCharacter progression is handled by earning cards either by completing quests or through special events. More often than not, you will be presented with 3 to choose from so you can decide what direction you want to take that best suits your playstyle. Will you choose cards that help you maximize profits from your farm, or strengthen your skills in combat so you can dive deeper into the dungeons?\nCard choices direct character progression\nAfter choosing a card, you'll need to eat it. How else are you going to gain it's powers?\nTastes like cardboard\nExplore the peaceful town and meet its inhabitants. Attend festivals, celebrate special events, find hidden areas and help restore things back to their former glory.\nOne of many areas in town to explore\nPenguin Post\nAll mail in Everafter Falls is delivered through Penguin Post. Pip and Pepper are the penguins that run this service and use carrier Pigeons to do the delivery. Every now and again, you may find a pigeon who has forgotten how to fly. Bring it to the post office where Pip and Pepper (the penguins who run the joint) will give it a job delivering mail.\nMail being delivered by pigeons who have forgotten how to fly\nGradually Changing Seasons\nFor a more immersive experience, trees change at different rates when the season changes. This small touch not only increase diversity in the environment, but provides a visual cue for when a season is ending and a new one starting.\nTrees will change at different rates to indicate the coming of a new season\nPersonalize your experience and create the character you want to play with many options to choose from.\nCharacter Creation\nMake your home yours\nThere are many types of decorations to find and collect to make your home unique. Below are some examples from each category.\nCustomize your home with a huge variety of items\nFine tuned decorations, place anything for display on shelves and tables.\nNot only can you decorate your house with various furniture including floor furniture, rugs and wall items (clocks, windows), you can also choose what to display on all shelves and tables. In addition to this, most furniture can have its color changed using a potion dye crafted from some unique fruit species.\nFishing and The Town Aquarium\nEverafter Falls is a host to many kinds of fish, some you will be unfamiliar with. The Town Aquarium has recently undergone repairs and needs your help to repopulate it. Receive special rewards for collecting as many types as you can.\nFishing is a lucrative business here in Everafter Falls\nThe town aquarium can showcase every type of fish you've caught\nA large number of marine species to discover for those who love to collect!\nCombat in this genre has been the area most lacking and I hope to change that trend. Everafter Falls features a dungeon with many levels and lots of enemies to encounter.\nThe game will have a moderate level of progressing difficulty and will be somewhat challenging if players want to focus solely on traversing the dungeons. For those who prefer a more casual approach, if enough time is spent doing other activities and progressing in other areas of the game, players will acquire items and abilities that can make fighting enemies a breeze.\nTaking down enemies is a breeze with help from your Pet and a Support Drone.\nPreview of some monsters you'll encounter in the dungeons\nItem Drops with random stat generation\nDiscover unique and powerful items that can help you on your adventure. Items can boost combat stats, or increase farm productivity. They can provide bonuses to your card levels, drones, and pet skills. Enjoy the thrill of finding ultra rare and unique items.\nEquipable Items with random stat generation\nOn this adventure, you'll meet a lot of fun and strange characters along the way. Complete fun and wacky quests to uncover their stories and earn items that will help you on your journey. \nMany characters are waiting to share their stories with you.\nEverafter Falls will not have a bachelor/bachelorette system (you are the only human here). Such a system would be difficult to reason for as the intricate relationships between the characters and player is tightly bound to the story. Have fun learning about the characters and their lives and perhaps they may share intimate moments with you if you've earned enough of their trust.\nComplete important quests for great rewards.\nYou\u2019ll be able to make some neat stuff that will help you make other neat stuff! There will be a huge number of items to discover, craft, produce, and refine. Below is a small preview of crafting and equipment processing.\nCraft and create machines to help you process items into other valuable and useful goods.\nA relaxing, fun, and memorable soundtrack\nEverafter Falls will have an Original Soundtrack composed by Tim Carlos. He has already produced some outstanding tracks for the game, please have a listen below. All pledges above the \"Post Pigeon\" tier will receive the Original Soundtrack digitally.\n If you enjoy what you hear, you can find more about Tim through his website  TimCarlos.com or follow him on Twitter  @tflatminor \n\n **Please note that I have mistakenly put \"Digital Copy of the Game\" and then \"Digital Copy of the game at a discounted price\" under Pledge Rewards for the \"Kickstarter Pricing\" tier. Please note only 1 copy of the game is given at this price. \nReference chart for pledge tiers and rewards\nBelow is a preview of the exclusive in-game posters, these can only be redeemed by backers with a provided code and cannot be obtained otherwise.

The item will be sent to you via a delivery pigeon!\nPreview of Excusive in-game Poster Rewards\nThe game will be released for PC/Mac/Linux first via Steam in March 2022, with the Nintendo Switch version following several months later. I would love to release on all platforms/consoles, however, as a solo developer, I need to ensure I don't spread myself too thinly to keep the project manageable. The possibility of Playstation and Xbox releases will likely be considered after the game has been released on the Nintendo Switch.\nBackers can choose to receive their digital copy of the game on for any available platform but please be aware of the different planned release dates. These are fairly conservative dates but are still estimates and may change.\nAlpha testing is planned to start mid 2021, and the Beta testing towards the end of 2021.\nThe Digital Art Book will include exclusive WIP images, character designs and some fantastic artwork commissioned by various artists.\nCommissioned artwork by Daniel Bogni\nCommissioned artwork by Jamsino\nI was raised in Australia, but was born in Cambodia. My family and I were lucky enough to have immigrated to Australia during the Khmer Rouge era. I am very fortunate to have had the education I had in Australia, without it, I wouldn't be in the position I am now.\nI moved back to Cambodia at the age of 32 hoping for a new direction in life. Thanks to the lower cost of living, moving back here has afforded me the opportunity to work almost full time on this game for nearly 3 years now.\nThese last 3 years have been spent juggling game development, freelance design work, and being a father to my now 2 year old son.\nI chose to do this Kickstarter so I can focus on doing what I love, which is working on this game. Additionally, It would help me with funding for the Original  Soundtrack. I am also hoping to create a community of fans that can provide feedback and help shape the game into the best it can be.\nAll the core systems have been completed and are in a playable state, with a decent amount of content complete. Much more content is planned, and a lot more time needs to be spent on the combat/dungeons. \nI set out from the very start to create a game I would enjoy, in a genre that has rekindled my love for gaming. I have poured a lot of love and energy into making it what it is today. A successful campaign will take a load off my shoulders and provide enough funding to last the rest of development.\nI am extremely grateful for anyone backing this project, with your support, I hope to develop a game that will provide you many hours of wholesome fun. Thank you so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving poured everything in into this project for nearly 3 years now, I am fully aware of the difficulties and challenges faced with developing and shipping a game alone.\n\nAfter going public with the game a couple of months ago, I've been overwhelmed with the positive response and show of support. I aim to do my best to release a game that will not disappoint.\n\nI originally aimed for a release date at the end of 2021, however, have since pushed it back to mid 2022 to be a little more conservative with timing and to better meet expectations for the launch date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 24 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Pricing", "descp": "- Get the game on release date at a discounted rate here on Kickstarter (Full price US$19.99 / AU$29)\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Copy of the game at a Discount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["764 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 35 or more", "title": "Small Sprout", "descp": "Show extra support for the project by getting the game bundled with the Digital Art Book and an exclusive in-game poster, and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Thank You\" in Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["368 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 65 or more", "title": "Post Penguin", "descp": "Get the game on release, bundled with the digital soundtrack, digital art book, and an exclusive in-game poster and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Big Thank You\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["97 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 105 or more", "title": "Beta Bee", "descp": "Get Beta Access to the game, along with the game on release date, digital soundtrack, digital artbook, exclusive in game poster and your name in the credits as a Beta Tester.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nBeta Access\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Beta Bee\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nName in Credits as \"Beta Tester\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 210 or more", "title": "Alpha Alpaca", "descp": "Be one of the first to play the game by becoming an Alpha Tester.

Thank YOU for all your feedback!\nRomancelvania is a visually stunning action RPG coming to Switch/PS4/PS5/Steam/XboxSeriesX/XboxSeriesS that features in-depth weapon and magic based combat, exploration based platforming, and a cast of gorgeous monsters that you won\u2019t be able to resist.\nMost foes don't stand a chance against Drac's arsenal of powers, including Impale.\nIncrease your powers by feeding on human \"Production Assistants\" who throw themselves at Drac, the star of the show.\nComing to Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, XBoxSeriesX/S and Steam\n Introducing the Thirsty Metroidvania - Romance your way across Transylvania, encounter absurd monsters, craft weapons, learn magic, and more.\n Build your castle - Grow the party mansion as you convince more cast members to move in, and decide where monsters live to get stat and skill bonuses. \n Enjoy the Showmance - Take the cast members on outlandish dates, massage your sweetheart to unlock more conversation options, and spend time getting to know these supernatural hotties.\nFight or flirt with the Van Helsings?\nYou play as the legendary playboy vampire himself, Drac, as he battles and romances his way across Transylvania. After being reluctantly recruited by the Grim Reaper to star in a \u201creality dating show,\u201d he's on a mission to find the world's most eligible monsters, get them to move into his party mansion, and restore his former glory by killing everything in his path along the way.\nThings are about to get...spicy.\n ANNOUNCING: Limited Run physical copies!\nLike top-shelf physical copies? The mighty Gods at Limited Run have you covered!\nIt wouldn't be a reality show without DRAMAAAAAA! And our diverse cast brings the goods. Inspired by everything from mythology, classic Universal monsters, to...Jersey Shore? Here are some of the wild monsters Drac will need to wine and dine.\nOh, you think that's all? Oh no, no, no. We have lots more over-the-top reality show monsters in store for you. Stay tuned as we reveal more characters!\n\nUpdate! Introducing...Frank(enstein)\nEnemy turned cast member (and potential love interest!). Be careful though...he's a monster before he's had his coffee.\nWhat's a reality show without trouble? Clawdia, the show's werecheetah is a vortex of disorder. Like most cats.\nWhen the Grim Reaper notices his best client, Drac, has lost his bloodlust for the afterlife, he sets Drac up with a reality TV show to try to get his groove back. Drac must now traverse the perilous countryside of Transylvania on a hunt for the world\u2019s most eligible monsters. Once he has wooed them, they\u2019ll move back into his party mansion, where their rowdy exploits will be documented by the camera crew. Will Drac find \u201cLove at first Bite\u201d, or will he discover \u201cLove Sucks\u201d?\n\u201cTerrorizing the townsfolk just wasn\u2019t fun anymore. Then Grim suggested putting the \u2018lust\u2019 back in bloodlust and I thought, you know what, he\u2019s right.\u201d\nIt should go without saying that Drac and Grim's relationship is...complicated. They're long-time (eons) bffs, but they also are, how shall we say, business associates. Drac brings Grim a lot of \"business.\" And when Grim notices Drac is not producing the same numbers he used to, well, it was time for drastic measures.\nThe thirst is strong with this one.\nGrim offers to rebuild Drac's castle. When Drac appeases the mad creator with over-the-top combat and scintillating romance, Grim adds more rooms! As cast members move in, Drac can furnish their rooms to keep them happy and receive benefits, based on where the characters are slotted. You may feel a special connection to Ilessa, but really enjoy peppering enemies with Rat Darts, a Trick that Eden teaches you. You'll have to weigh growing your relationship vs your powers. Decisions, decisions!\nGothic castle or party mansion? Why not both? Choose carefully where you slot cast members.\nRomancelvania includes a number of diverse lands to explore. From a desert made entirely of desserts like churro cacti, to the All Seeing Swamp where you can\u2019t escape from the watchful eyes of Grim and his lackeys. \nWe\u2019re taking the combat and exploration of Metroidvanias and pairing them with the most appealing aspects of dating games. This allows us to merge the excitement of action platformers with meaningful narrative, taking both genres to new heights! Also, our \"hub world\" of the mansion allows players to choose their playstyle - if you prefer more dating, spend more time in the mansion and have every conversation possible! If you'd rather get back to the action, use the hubworld sparingly and just grab quests and essentials there. We want to give the player choices in how they interact with Romancelvania's world!\nLet's dig into some of the specifics.\nDrac's signature weapon, The Impaler, in action! Here, Drac fights a pair of \"Screaming Jellyfish\" on a giant set Grim built. Grim goes to ridiculous lengths to bring a bit of flair to the combat and platforming.\nWhip it good!\nDrac\u2019s signature weapon is \u201cThe Impaler,\u201d a devastating long spear. He's grown quite accustomed to it over the centuries...to the point where Grim needs to offer a way to \"mate\" Drac's precious Impaler with other weapons Drac finds on his adventure. \nDrac simply needs to place the Impaler alongside the newly found weapon in the Weapon Motel, toss in a few crystals and voila...out pops in a new weapon born of the Impaler bloodline. Each new combination of weapon and crystal yields an exciting new tool!\nRomancelvania\u2019s upgrade system is a bit like the Horadric Cube in Diablo 2, or cooking in Breath of the Wild.\nDrop in a weapon, toss in some crystals and \u201cmate\u201d your weapons.\nMate your weapons to take your combat to new heights!\nBy adding crystals into the slots in The Weapon Motel, players can imbue a new weapon with different traits, elemental effects, and other surprises.\nGrim is after ratings. And there's no better way to win over the crowd than a flashy coup de gr\u00e2ce. You better bring your fighting game skills though - these attacks are performed by a special combination of key presses. \n\nTricks are items that assist in combat by allowing for different attack patterns. They are meant to add spice and supplement weapon combat.\nSo long Big Chungus!\nBut with all this slaying, Drac's gotta find time to unwind...and get to know the cast so he can find the love of his afterlife! Romancelvania has a number of ways you can get close.\nWhisk your castmates on extravagant dates around the world, or select the one who's stolen your cold, lifeless heart and profess your love on a special custom outing. \nWe have a saying on the team \"naughty not dirty.\" This is about building relationships. Even though we also \"slay and lay\" the game is much more about building tension and not about graphic nudity.\nYou are my wish.\nWe have numerous opportunities for conversation with each cast member, and you can get to discover what makes them tick. \nSparks fly when Drac discovers his ex is one of the contestants.\nRomancelvania thinks the key to your heart can be picked like a lock, so introducing: the Massage minigame. Is a character tense? Are they holding back? Offer a massage! If they accept, you can unlock new conversation and date options!\nBecome the master of unknotting!\n\n\nGigantic, over-the-top bosses are an integral part of Metroidvanias. They fit naturally in the reality TV show setting as obstacles Grim puts in front of Drac to help get higher ratings and excitement from the audience.\nHere are a few of our boss fights:\nLulu Cthulhu\n\nGiant Spaghetti Monster\nWhat evil lurks at Grim's new favorite restaurant, the Meatball Garden?\nMiddle-aged Mutant Ninja Cerberus\nTime to pull out the Rat Darts\nThe show has many production assistants. There are human sycophant \"bloodbags\" who volunteer their time (and well-being) for the good of the show. And perhaps most importantly of all, Battaboom - Drac's own personal assistant!  He will help you out in combat with a variety of ways, including serving as a pack mule and delivering Drac blood when he needs it most!\n Edit: Female Drac is no longer a stretch goal - but a reality! :) \nMore to unlock as we go!\nWe've got some REWARDS, fam!

While our team has made games before (BioShock, BioShock Infinite, Saints Row, Perception, etc), we haven't made one during a worldwide pandemic. \n\nBut we have worked remotely. We made Perception from our basement. Time and again, we've been faced with unusual circumstances, and we've made better games for it. We believe Romancelvania will be one of these games to overcome the trying times and make something that will bring people joy.\n\nThis motivation, above all others, is what drives us.\n\nIn terms of timing: we are targeting late 2021. However, we are putting in March 2022 because we realize that development is unpredictable. It all depends on our funding amount - the more stretch goals we hit, the better. Ultimately, it is far more important to deliver a game that meets the expectations of our fans than to hit a date. We have already built a significant portion of the game, but we do have a lot of work to do. We have also spent years building up an incredible network of hugely talented individuals and companies who are chomping at the bit to help out more on the project. In short, every bit of additional funding goes toward adding more to the game. We have huge plans for Romancelvania and hope to build a world we can continue to expand upon in the future. \n \nWe have carefully budgeted and planned this project and we pride ourselves on being brutally honest with ourselves. We will be working extremely hard to meet your expectations and we will keep you informed along the way.

It\u2019s also our dream game and would be more than pleased to deliver it to you! We, as monster taming genre fans, want to make something unique and never seen before. Take a look at Anitons early gameplay footage:\nAnitons is an open world monster-collecting RPG where you start your adventure in the wilderness, fight wild Anitons, and collect your own unique Anitons. Every Aniton you obtain can help you fight and farm. Expand your base to fit all monsters in your collection - decorate walls and place bamboo sticks to make Pangeros feel at home. Happy and well-fed Aniton will fight better and help you gather resources. Catch every known Aniton, battle other players, build the biggest farm or just get lost in a world full of life!\nFeatures:\nExplore a vast open-world where you can find wild Anitons and useful resources. At first, getting by in the wilderness will not be an easy task, but as you collect and evolve more powerful Anitons, you will find a way to be invincible.\nControl your Anitons in real-time combat and use the various skills you've taught them. During a fight, it is not only the strategy that plays a role but also agility and accuracy.  Fighting with wild Anitons won\u2019t always be a fair fight, prepare to face dozens of enemies at once!\n\nEvolve various Anitons, acquire new moves, or breed a completely new one. To do this you will need DNA points. You can obtain these by either farming this specific type of Aniton, or by fighting them in the wild. Forge your own path!\nInvite multiple friends and play together. You can team up to fight Aniton Hordes on Raids, or build a new base with your friends. Use PvP duels to fight other players and test new tactics. Offline mode will of course still be an option for those who want to play solo.  Note: this feature is linked to the \u201cMultiplayer\u201d stretch goal.\nFound your own base using resources you obtain from the wild. There, you can keep all of your Anitons and make them feel at home. You can not only place buildings but also customize the environment around you! Create a cozy place for you and your Anitons to rest after a tough fight.\n\nFarm various monsters and resources that you will find useful throughout your journey. Each type of Aniton prefers a different kind of food. Well-fed Aniton will use his unique ability that will aid you in this aspect! Electric types can charge machines that will automate your work, fire types can heat your house, and water types can help grow your crops.\nCustomize your character to perfectly fit your playstyle and Aniton squad. Unlock new outfits as you progress by completing various challenges. You can also build your mansion, paint walls, and hang pictures of your friends and favorite Anitons!\nSince the beginning of the development, we\u2019ve been transparent with our goals and development process and we\u2019ll keep on doing this until the full release. We organized a couple of contests where fans could create their own Anitons or name existing ones. If you want to shape the final look of the Anitons, join our discord here:  >>>CLICK<<<\nSTORY\nThe world of Anitons is divided into smaller areas that are habited by different kinds of monsters. On the volcanic grounds, you can find various fire type Anitons, and if you are looking for crystal types, you should visit the underground, monster-infested caves. As the player, you can freely explore this open-world continent and return to your base at any time.\n\nThere are 9 different types of Anitons. Each type has its own unique playstyle and skillset. You can choose Nature for its ability to heal or stick with Rock for its defensive skills. If on the other hand, you\u2019re going to fight a whole bunch of enemies at once, Fire, with its area effect skills might just be perfect for you. If you\u2019re playing with a friend, choose a combination that will increase your damage output like Water and Electric. The dual-typed Anitons only multiply already almost endless possibilities. Find your playstyle!\nYou start out by visiting your Uncle that lives overseas, in search of a job. You decide to help him finish his project of a lifetime - gather information about every existing Aniton. Little you know how this goal will change your life. Not only you have to build your own base, but also collect every Aniton out there. Even with the help of your friends... This might take a while.\nEnough about the task, which one of these little fellas would you choose?\nAnitons are the creatures living in the wild or with humans. You can create your own Anitons that will happily help you with fighting, or farming. All of your monster friends have to live somewhere, a cozy farm is perfect for them. Every Aniton loves to play, and have his favorite food that the owner must provide. With time your monsters will get experienced and will evolve into more powerful forms. During your adventure, you will meet and collect tons of them.\nWhile going into the wild you can take up to 6 Anitons with you. They will help you travel, gather resources, and fight. If any of your monsters faint during the battle, you will have to take care of him after returning to your farm. Each Anioton can learn skills as they evolve, and the last stage can master up to 3 different abilities. While fighting the player takes control of the monster, to win he will have to use both accuracy and a tactic.\nThe Stegra line is the most popular three-stage evolution. You can evolve your Aniton to more powerful forms and with each evolution, it can learn new skills. Since this specific line is a mix of Rock and Nature type, while choosing a new ability for your monster you can either pick supportive Nature abilities or go with defensive Rock skills.\nThe Tadapas line is composed of toxic type Anitons. In the first stage Tadapas has an additional water typing that the next stage evolution is missing. This means that your Tadapas can have a water ability, but since first form ability is known from the beginning, you'll have to create a Tapadas with the exact skill that you are looking for. Using more DNA you can boost your chances to get better Anitons in creation process.\nThe Ottim line is different from most of the other Aniton lines. After getting enough experience to evolve, you can choose its new stage. Since Ottim's passive ability is to find random crystals, the evolution you choose will additionally influence its skill. Fishtter is a more defense-oriented evolution that will find blue crystals for you, whilst Sharker is a more offensive form that will find mostly red crystals.\n\nTo gather funding for the Anitons project we've prepared unique rewards for you to choose from. Hope you will find something just perfect for you. All gathered funds will be used for the development of the game.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the development of our previous game, we decided that we want to become independent in terms of the production of our next title. This will provide a way to make Anitons with our community and by this, make Anitons a game of your dreams too. Success in Kickstarter will help us stay indie and provide a way to keep on developing this game. At this point in time, we cannot say if we\u2019ll be able to develop Anitons if we won\u2019t hit our initial $75k stretch goal, but with fans as you, this shouldn\u2019t be our concern.\nWe\u2019ve been working for almost one year to create a sharp vision of Anitons that you can see today, and we reach a point when we have to start full production. If you become a backer and trust us, this game will become yours and we\u2019ll be excited to develop it for you. Your feedback along the way will ensure that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. Let\u2019s set out on this adventure together!\nMeet the team behind Anitons! Our core team has been working together for the past 3 years on our previous game, Lumberhill, and since the beginning, in January we welcomed a couple of new team members. All of us are thrilled to work on this game, and right now we can\u2019t wait to start full production. If Kickstarter will be successful, we have a plan to extend our team with talented artists to bring your game to an even higher level.\nBelow you can find our sketch of the Anitons project roadmap. The plan below includes working on all of the stretch goals we've prepared, so the final release date won't surprise us if we do hit those later stretch goals.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign, but it\u2019s not our first project. We\u2019ve been working in a team for over three years now. Even considering Anitons is our biggest production to date, we\u2019re prepared in terms of the technology and skills required to finish this project. At this point in time, we have been developing Anitons for almost a year.\n\nWe have used all of our experience in planning development and the budget for Anitons. Quality and deadlines are the most fundamental aspects of our work since our team is working in Agile. Quality is not only graphic that can be measured, but also gameplay and player experience. Having this in mind, we\u2019re prepared to sacrifice minor graphical content if this can help shape Anitons into a game you will enjoy for many hours.\n\nSince the beginning of the development, we\u2019ve been transparent with our goals and development process and we\u2019ll keep on doing this until the full release. As a backer, you've helped us a lot already, but there\u2019ll be many more occasions where you can shape the final look of the Anitons. At this point in time we cannot say if we\u2019ll be able to develop Anitons if we won\u2019t hit our initial $75k stretch goal, but with fans as you this shouldn\u2019t be our concern.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nIn our project we don't use papper and plastic.

Note that this will NOT affect us providing customs-friendly shipping to our backers.\nPlease note that shipping is also notoriously unreliable in some regions such as Russia and Brazil.

The game aims to deliver many features that will help it differ from your typical horror game, with things such as:\n\n Beautiful hand-drawn 8-bit pixel art\n   Explore a changing Mansion and journey between the mortal and demon realms\n   A fantastic 1980s synthwave soundtrack written just for Sunshine Manor\n   Power-ups and Costumes to help you in your quest\n   Cross paths with a host of unique characters\n   With a bit of comedy in there as well!\n  First and foremost, Ada isn\u2019t your typical 1980s horror movie damsel in distress. Although she might be trapped inside the Sunshine Manor, Ada is more than capable at stopping the unfolding nightmare and ending the Shadow Man\u2019s reign of terror over the ghostly inhabitants of the old Aitken House.\nAda doesn\u2019t have just her wits to protect her though. Her latent psychic powers are triggered as she enters the Mansion, allowing her to vanquish demons, ward off the Shadow Man and solve devious puzzles that would trap any normal human.\nHowever, with every reward there is also a great risk at hand. The range of your psychic abilities is a bit short, so you have to get close to vanquish these evil rascals and force the Shadow Man back into his lair. Miss, and you\u2019re in a world of trouble\u2026\nThe old Aitken House has sat abandoned for the past four years. The local children have told stories of the gruesome murders that happened there all those years ago. Ada and her two friends pluck up the courage to knock on the door\u2026 the rest is for you to discover!\nWhilst this is a game set entirely within a single location, the mansion itself changes over time, with new areas unlocking during your quest to stop the Shadow Man. You\u2019ll find items, keys, costumes, hidden rooms and more, all within the beautiful hand-drawn rooms and corridors you\u2019ll explore.\nNot content with just the mortal realm? Well, you will also be able to make your way through the Demon Realm and its roster of baddies. Some are out for blood, while others are \u2013 somehow - a little bit more relaxed. To give you an idea of what to expect, here\u2019s a rundown of some of these creatures.\nBack in 2015 when we were hard at work on building up Camp Sunshine, we wanted to include a whole host of costumes and power-ups within the game that players could unlock as they progressed. However, as the game\u2019s development continued, we realized doing that would take away from the type of game we were trying to create\u2026 One built on the premise that you were constantly hunted down, unable to fight.\nWith Sunshine Manor, and the introduction of Ada\u2019s rather awesome psychic powers, it\u2019s the perfect time to give you a whole host of weird and wonderful looks and new powers you can unlock as the story unfolds.\nWant to wield the power of purple plasma? Then the Plasmancer costume is going to be perfect for you! Just make sure you keep them safely stored away when you\u2019re not using them since, if you\u2019re not careful, they could be lost forever!\nWe're happy to announce that we'll be partnering with Premium Edition Games to give backers the chance to pledge for a Premium Edition physical Nintendo Switch cartridge that will include not only Sunshine Manor but also Camp Sunshine too! \nThis version will include a Kickstater Exclusive Cover, a Kickstarter Exclusive Slipcover, a Full Color Manual, and a Kickstater Exclusive Trading Car\nBut wait... there's more! On top of this, Premium Edition Games will also be working on a Kickstarter Exclusive Sunshine Edition that will include everything from the Premium Edition described above, alongside the soundtrack for Sunshine Manor on an Old-School Cassette Tape, a pair of gnarly Sunshine Manor Sweatbands, a full color printed guide, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Premium Edition Trading Card will be signed by Fossil Games! Oh, and it will all be housed inside of a VHS Clamshell Box, for that old-school 1980s look and feel!\nIn 2016 we released what we thought would be a small game called Camp Sunshine, which went on to be featured by prominent YouTubers across the world. In Camp Sunshine you played as Jez, an unarmed teenager, who was being stalked by a deranged mascot in a bear costume brandishing a rather larger knife. \nWe\u2019re delighted to let everyone know that backing this Kickstarter project not only gets you a copy of Sunshine Manor, but also a copy of Camp Sunshine! \nDepending on which tier you back, you could get the games on Steam, or get digital console copies of each one! \nOn top of this, you can also pledge for the physical Nintendo Switch copy of the Sunshine Anthology, which features Sunshine Manor and Camp Sunshine on a Nintendo Switch cartridge! How awesome is that!?\nPLAY\n\nWith a game based heavily on our love of 1980s horror movies, we had to create a score in the vein of John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream and Angelo Badalamenti. Want to take a listen to some of the tracks?\n\n\n\nSince Premium Edition will not be shipping backers their physical Premium Edition Nintendo Switch copy - or their Sunshine Edition! - until 2021 (once Sunshine Manor's development has been completed and the game has a digital release date), shipping costs will be charged to backers next year. \nShipping will be charged after this Kickstarter finishes and this will be based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a \"one size fits all\" mentality to shipping. \n\nWe are working directly with Premium Edition Games and will be using their fulfilment centers and partners to ensure that your order ships quickly and the DDP is included so that you can get your physical rewards without any extra hassles!\nLimited Edition Cover by Graham Humphreys!\nGraham Humphreys is a British illustrator and visual artist best known for producing classic movie posters. During the 1980s, Graham worked alongside Palace Pictures producing posters and more for movies including Basket Case, The Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street too!\nAs you might have already guessed, Sunshine Manor (and Camp Sunshine!) are huge homages to 1980s horror movies, which made Graham a big name on our dream wishlist to have as the designer for our game's cover art, so we really couldn\u2019t be happier!\nBefore we forget, we're here to report that there's certainly a dog in Sunshine Manor. As you can see below, you can interact with said dog, and that means that, yes, you can pet the dog in Sunshine Manor! \nSo ... meet Gnarlie!\nGnarlie is also pretty intelligent (if we do say so ourselves) as he knows to keep out of the way of things that might be important in the Manor!\nWe are Paul and Josh, two old farts based in the UK and the US who began creating games over our shared love of retro gaming, pixel art with outlines, and 1980s horror movies. Back in 2016 we released the cult hit Camp Sunshine and we were thrilled when it gathered a hugely positive reaction on Steam!\nBoth of us make these games as a side project as we just love creating retro styled games dripping in horror. The success of this Kickstarter project would allow us to take a year off from our jobs to concentrate on developing Sunshine Manor full-time!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have the development experience needed to make Sunshine Manor thanks to our work on Camp Sunshine.\n\nWith your support, we'll be able to dedicate our time in full to completing Camp Sunshine for a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, XBO, and PC release in 2021.\n\nIf, for some reason, the game's development is delayed, we'll be sure to let you, our backers, know right away. Rest assured that any potential delay will only exist if we believe that an extra bit of time polishing the game is needed so that you can have the best digital - and physical - game we can give you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Come and Play", "descp": "Windows Steam copies of Camp Sunshine and Sunshine Manor + Come and Play In-Game Credit for Sunshine Manor + Special Discord Channel Role\nINCLUDES:\nWindows Steam Copy of Camp Sunshine\nWindows Steam Copy of Sunshine Manor\nCome and Play In-Game Credit\nSpecial Discord Channel Role", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2021"}], "stat": ["37 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "Wanna Play a Game", "descp": "All of the above (Except for Crazy Early Bird and Early Bird tiers) + Digital Console Copy of Camp Sunshine (Nintendo Switch, PS4 or XBO) + Digital Console Copy of Sunshine Manor (Nintendo Switch, PS4 or XBO) + Digital Deluxe Edition (Digital Soundtracks for Camp Sunshine and Sunshine Manor + PDF Guide from Premium Edition) + Wanna Play a Game In-Game Credit for Sunshine Manor\nINCLUDES:\nWindows Steam Copy of Camp Sunshine\nWindows Steam Copy of Sunshine Manor\nDigital Console Copy of Camp Sunshine (Switch, PS4 or XBO)\nDigital Console Copy of Sunshine Manor (Switch, PS4 or XBO)\nDigital Soundtrack for Camp Sunshine\nDigital Soundtrack for Sunshine Manor\nPDF Guide from Premium Edition\nWanna Play a Game In-Game Credit\nSpecial Discord Channel Role", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2021"}], "stat": ["45 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a345 or more", "title": "It\u2019s Alive!

After 10 years in the industry, David and Ellie started this studio in 2015 and released Timing Hero and Super Pixel Racers. We are experienced and skilled, we put the fun and productivity first. We make our best games to give inspiration to players :)\n\nChrono Sword is a very epic game, and we have many literary, artistic, musical, and technical challenges for this work. Our goal is to complete Chrono Sword as the best game and deliver it to gamers. This requires the attention, feedback, and support of many people, and of course financial stability. We're doing a lot inside the studio, but in order to bring the game into a higher quality, we need many help like translation, cut-scene animations, voice-over, and sound effects. We hope to meet many fans who can support and give feedback, supporters who can help our development, and relationships that we haven't thought of through Kickstarter.\n\n\n\n- Once you choose a physical pledge, it will be based on \"Avatar tier\" not \"Aenor tier\".\n- Once you choose a pledge with physical OST, you will get CD and plus LP.\nSince Kickstarter does not allow to edit the pledges after live, you may find different description between this page and the pledge list. You will get better one among them in that case. Sorry for giving you confusing.\n\n(These are just sample to help you.

With their help we can make sure that the studio will be sustainable and launch the project at it's absolute peak. On top of this with their second service \"gameround.co\" we'll be able to directly test and get feedback from thousands of gamers ensuring that we are developing the project to the right factor. This significantly minimizes all risks with our company, giving us an edge over other game development companies. \n\nWe believe that games can inspire and touch gamers, developers and others. To this end, we are making our best games, including many literary, artistic, musical and technical challenges. These challenges require new solutions, a lot of trial and error. A lot of time has been spent on improving game engines and development environments for this, not developing content. In addition, countless synopsis improvements were needed for a high-quality game experience.\n\nFor this reason, we couldn't release new contents and news, and communication with fans has decreased. Today, these R&Ds are almost over, and synopsis and scripts are completed, we are moving on to production.\n\nAnother risk is how long it will take to bring the experience of new content to the level we want, but we believe that we can solve it through a lot of development experience, and communication with you guys.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Follower", "descp": "You are not sure yet that you want Chrono Sword, but still rooting for us.

Both of our previous games were successfully developed and released with the help of Kickstarter backers like you, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to tell you about our new project: The Wandering Village!\n\nThe Wandering Village is a city building simulation game. In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a group of people seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call \u2018Onbu\u2019.\nBecome their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you.\nKey Features\nBuild a village on the back of a giant creature\nFarm various crops\nSend out foraging missions to gather rare resources\nSurvive a variety of different biomes and events\nBuild a relationship with a giant and influence its actions\nEcology/Biology inspired gameplay\nUnique blend of 3D and hand-drawn, hand-animated 2D graphics    \n\nAt its core, The Wandering Village is a city building and resource management game with rogue-like and survival elements. Farm various crops to keep your villagers fed, send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and scout the environment while constantly expanding the settlement. Of course, living on the back of a living, breathing beast comes with its own challenges, such as helping to maintain the creature\u2019s health and building trust. This might even lead to the beast paying attention to your requests as it wanders through a variety of different biomes, each with its own perks and challenges, always trying to outrun the threat of the toxic spores.\nIn-game Screenshot\nThe ultimate goal, for both the humans and the creature, is to find a place where they can settle down and live in peace again. And if they don\u2019t find this place, maybe they can figure out a way to fight back the plants and create it themselves.\n\nCore Mechanics\nSurvival - Escape from the toxic spores and keep your villagers and the creature alive against ever-changing threats.\nSymbiosis - Live both from and in harmony with the giant creature and form a relationship with it as you trek together through the post-apocalyptic world.\nBuilding - Build an infrastructure where your people can live together, work together and survive together.\nFarming - Plant, cultivate and harvest various crops to keep your villagers and the creature fed and healthy, or grow new kinds of resources.\nForaging - Send scouting parties to explore the different biomes surrounding you, discover rare resources and bring them back to your village, opening up new possibilities.\nHelp us grow our community and get noticed on Steam by wishlisting the game and following us on social media. We now reached 20'000 wishlists! An additional skin for Onbu, the giant creature, will be unlocked for everyone.\nAfter we came up with the concept for the game, we first started thinking about the general look and feel of the game\u2019s world and how it would affect gameplay. We quickly settled on a blend of painted 2D backgrounds and static assets and hand-animated 2D characters in a 3D world, since it combined the strengths of our team members, was easy to navigate in-game and just looked really charming in our opinion.\nInitial world sketch.\n\nThe creature, \u2018Onbu\u2019, was probably the most important part of the process as it is both the map where the game takes place and a character in itself. We started with concepts that were pretty close to existing animals, but moved away from this approach over time as we wanted something that you could more sensibly build a village on. Thus, the designs slowly but surely evolved into our very own earthen fantasy creature, the \u2018Onbu\u2019.\nConcept art of Onbu.\nProcess sketches of Onbu.\n\nOnbu wanders through a post-apocalyptic world, which was the next part of our art-design process. We wanted this world to be a stark contrast to Onbu to emphasize that it is toxic, wild and uninhabitable. Onbu on the other hand should feel like an island, an oasis, the only thing that makes survival possible for the humans building the settlement on its back.\nConcept art of the world.\nVarious sketches of the world.\n\nSpeaking of the humans, the first step in designing them was figuring out their scale, not only to make sense gameplay-wise, but also to be visible enough at any zoom level. As for the design itself, our goal was to make them look friendly, maybe even cute, but also to have them reflect that the world they live in is a dangerous one, which is why we gave them protective clothing.\nVillagers as they appear in-game.\nProcess sketches.\n\nNext were the buildings, which had to look functional while conveying both the original culture of the villagers and their adaptations to living in their new environment. They are constructed from simple materials, and since Onbu\u2019s back is so high up and winds are strong, many of them are powered by wind energy. Colorful flags can often be seen attached to them as they are used to communicate with other villagers.\nConcept art of farming buildings.\nProcess sketches of various buildings.\n\nVarious other species besides humans have survived the apocalypse. Most of these creatures are a mix between something familiar, like mammals, and something that seems alien, like giant insects. With this approach, we hope to achieve a result somewhere in the middle, ideally something that is weird, but kinda cute.\nFirst sketches of other creatures.\nInspiration\nOur main inspirations for the game were the evocative drawings of french artist Moebius and the works of Studio Ghibli, specifically Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke.\n\nThe World\nMysterious plants are spreading all over the world, turning the ground toxic and infertile and the air unbreathable. No one knows what caused this, but the source has to be somewhere out there, waiting to be discovered.\nThe Human Settlers\nIncreasingly polluted air and failing harvests caused by the spores have driven the humans from their village. Many have died from hunger and exposure until they crossed paths with the giant creature. The remaining few managed to climb onto its back and start a new settlement.\nIn order to sustain themselves, adapt to their environment and grow stronger and smarter, they\u2019ll need to harvest materials from the creatures\u2019 body and its surroundings, while also making sure that the creature itself survives and keeps on walking, away from the spores and, hopefully, towards a safer place.\nThe village on the back of the giant creature.\n\nThe Gigantic Creature, \u201cOnbu\u201d\nOnbu is the name given to the creature by the villagers.\n   Before the toxic spores started spreading, it was sleeping for hundreds of years, buried in the ground, looking like a mere hill. But when the soil around it became toxic, it awoke from its long slumber and started to walk, trying to find a safe spot where it can go to rest again.\n   But it is neither used nor adapted to travelling long distances, having gotten its nutrients from the ground for such a long time.\n\n   At first, it doesn\u2019t even notice the small creatures crawling around on its back.

One would instantly notice the odd helmet Ed adorned. When Edward was a child, he had a rare degenerative lung disease. His Mother being the brilliant scientist she was created a headpiece and sleeping pod that help regulate the pressure in Ed's body. Ever since then, Edward has worn the helmet and slept in the pod, understanding that if he spends too much time apart from them, the separation will end in his demise.\n\nWhat is Space Station 52?\n      Space Station 52 was once a hot spot and a prominent tourist destination. The on-station lake stalked with some of the universe's most delicious seafood helped supply the local 5-Star restaurants. The Grand Millenium Hotel housed some of histories biggest stars and politicians. It's was a place to relax and enjoy some of the most luxurious things in life. Now it's little less than a chapter in the history books. Malnourished and crumbling, with many residents having moved on, the Space Station is nearing its finish.\n\nFeatured & Planned Locations:\nForbidden Island\nAbandoned Lighthouse\nAlien Fisherman's Wharf\nLake filled with strange creatures\nDerelict Museum\nOpulent Hotel\nSeedy Tavern\nForgotten Alleys\nSci-fi Corridors\nand even Space itself.\nStory Intro:\n     As Ed arrives at the Space Station, what he finds is a decaying beauty. He begins to interact with those odd few left on the station and discovers a melancholy and strangeness that seems to of tainted nearly everyone there.  No time is wasted putting him to task though, barely even having time to gather his things for his new living quarters, his sent on his way.\n     While investigating a malfunctioning moisture recycler, Edward starts to have visions of things that simply can't be. Brushing it off as some version of jetlag, he presses on. As to the mystery of the broken recycler, his first clue is a pool of blood, his second, the mangled remains of the engineer he was sent to replace, logged in the machine. Perhaps overwhelmed by the sight of the body, Ed stumbles back, his mind rambling with visions. An encroaching blackness overcomes him, grasping for sanity, Ed falls to the ground.    \n\n                    Darkness.\n\n                   A pinhole of light interrupts the void.\n\n                   The brilliant light grows.\n\n                   Brighter.\n\n                   Brighter.\n\n                         Rudely welcomed by the fluorescent bulbs of the doctor's office, Edward is jolted awake.

Will you cast aside your ethics for a quick buck, or will you take the high road and find a way to scrape by honestly? \nPlatforms\nWe need your help to bring Dirty Land to Windows, OSX, and Linux.\nAfterwards, we'd love to bring you this game to Nintendo Switch, to mobile devices, and to consoles like XBox and PlayStation; and we will if we can meet our funding goal, so let us know if you you'd like to see stretch goals for your favorite platform!\nSomething New Every Day \nInteresting events await outside of the strip mall\nWelcome to your new job. At the start of every day, you begin out front of this unassuming, drab strip mall, where Pure Sky Properties is tucked away. Every day brings new characters to meet, new events to experience, and new stories to be told. What will it be tomorrow?\nChoose a Lead, Go on a Sit, and Close 'em!\nTwo leads per day, choose wisely!\nThese are the new leads. You'll probably close one of your leads today, but can you close two leads a day? You're gonna need some caffeine for that. But you know what salesmen say about coffee... you better prove your worth if you want that cup of joe!\nEvery day you'll have chances to make a sale. Learn what they like, study their habits, memorize what you can about them, and get them to sign on the line which is dotted!\nThe Birth of a Salesman\nThe Story of Willy Loman... err... Frank Marsh\nYou are Frank Marsh. You've made a mistake that has ruined your family. You can't change your past, but you can change your future! \nWill you take the high road and stick to your principles, or take the low road and chase the easy money? Whichever path you take, you'll discover multiple endings based on the choices you've made and whether you succeed or fail in those choices.\nOn top of those choices, you'll need to balance your family life with your work life. Will you be a model father and go home and play with your kids? Or will you go out on another sit and close that elusive buyer? Go too far down one path and there will be consequences... your choice will change Frank's story - at work and at home.\nMake Friends First, Sales Second\nAn office is a place where dreams come true. A place to meet lively new people. A sociopathic manager. An elusive owner. An opportunistic coworker out to steal your money. A flamboyant salesman with no concept of failure. A seductive hairdresser. An intrepid drycleaner. A neglected wife. A pair of dumb mob thugs. A ripped-off customer. A brutal detective. A homeless derelict with clues to a mystery. A rival firm across the street. And many more... \nOffice manager Chet, possibly the most insane boss you'll ever have\nThis quirky drycleaner has some clues for you...\nGrab a haircut and hear some gossip!\nEarl will lend you money when you need it, but at a price...\nDon't neglect your family!\nBe Closing, Always\nThe money is out there. All you gotta do is reach out and grab it! How many leads can you pitch and sell? Can you bag the top leads? Will you take advantage of easy prey, or tackle deals with honor?\nJust a sampling of leads you'll try and close\nPlay the Sleuth\nDo I have your attention? Good. Because it's not just sales numbers that you need to keep your eye on.  You need to keep your wits about you, because in an office full of backstabbers, anything can and will happen. Including the surreal!\nWhat a nice gesture from your boss!\nWho killed Frank Junior?\nClearly you've been framed. But by who?\nSolve Murder Mysteries\nIn a desperate world you'll meet desperate people. Dangerous people. People who will do anything to make rent. To not get fired. To make that promotion. To secure those juicy leads. From unsavory characters to hilarious charmers, they all have secret motives to uncover... you'll need to gather clues and piece together the truth to gain the upper hand in this double-crossing world! \nSuspects include: everyone\nNothing is as it seems in the dangerous world of real estate\nEveryone is a suspect! Especially you! \nAnd this murder won't be the only one...\nRewards\nBeyond the game itself, we're offering additional reward tiers:\nCoffee Mug\nShow everyone you're a closer with a signature Pure Sky Properties coffee mug.   \nLimited Edition Coffee Mug. We want one too!\nBecome a Lead\nHave your name in the game as one of the leads that Frank may encounter during his sales journey. So let me ask you this question: can you sell yourself?\nAll the salesmen are waiting for this new lead!\nNote: we won't allow offensive names or story-breaking content in the game.\nLeading Role\nImmortalize yourself in the game by having your own portrait drawn in loving pixel glory! Not only will you be able to sell yourself in the game (you can send us personality traits to make you tougher to sell), you'll get a digital version to printout too! Ideal for either drivers licenses, passports, or to sit proudly framed on your office desk (your choice).  \nOnce you get your Pixel Portrait it will motivate you to keep your workstation very clean\nNote: all reward images are mockups and may differ from the final version.\nCredits and Acclaim\n\"The atmosphere is great... reinforcing the desperate, melancholy feel of the game. The grimy locations, ugly characters, and downbeat, jazzy soundtrack are reminiscent of a very particular kind of '90s movie, which is an aesthetic I've never seen captured by a videogame before. As for the game itself, my demo wasn't deep enough to say for sure, but I think the developer might be onto something special here. I hope it hits its funding target.\" - Andy Kelly, PC Gamer\n\nWorried if we can do this or not? Here is a sampling of past reviews for Patchman vs Red. Circles, a videogame we made with the help of Kickstarter: \nYes we can!\nBut... why? \nWhy a videogame about real estate sales? Why not a fantasy game about dragons, elves, killing monsters, or World War 2? Well, those games already exist. This doesn't!  So we felt obliged to make it. We want a game chock full of surprise easter eggs from all the classic pop culture sales movies and shows. We want to capture the experience of working in a ridiculous sales office, without the commitment of actually having the job! Get a taste of what it's like, but more importantly, do and say the things you couldn't get away with in real life, like trash-talking your manager and fellow employees.\nDevelopment\nWe're using Godot Engine along with other development tools to build Dirty Land.\nDeveloping the Office Interior\nCoding in GDScript, a Python-like language\nDeveloping Text Cards for our Trailer\nAn animated sprite in the Exterior Mall scene\nWe believe in Open Source, so we're using tools like Godot, Yarn, GIMP, Krita, Ubuntu, Audacity, regexxer, and more. We've also given back to the Godot community in the form of code, in repositories on github, including godot-yarn-importer and godot-calm-button, with more to come. \nWe've been working on Dirty Land for two years in our free time.  Now we need to take it to the next level by finishing and launching so you can live the life of a salesman!\nPeople\nDavid Kerr - Coder, designer, writer, platform support, and more!  A jack-of-all-trades and master-of... how does that saying go?  Well, don't worry about it, because Dave never quits and never stops, gives it his all, and works so hard your back hurts!\nIgor Motuz - Pixel-Artist whose color choices and drawing abilities combined with his dedication and persistence have turned our game from a pile of programmer art into a retro heaven!  We're lucky to have him along for the ride for this episode.  www.igormotuz.com\nBENI.MARU - Musical maestro who crafted the jazzy instrumental for our trailer.

In 2017, we successfully launched No Heroes Here across multiple platforms and we were selected as one of the winners of the PAX10 independent game showcase. Currently, we are working on our third title known as Dandy Ace!\nComing from a variety of backgrounds, the people on our team have in common both their love for video games as well as having strong commitment to designing and developing games that are more than a product, they are games that contribute to the medium, games that make us proud.\nExperienced in designing content for many different genres, many of our teammates are graduates from the famous Vancouver Film School, including one of our founders, with skills we can put to the test in our projects in order to deliver the best of their know-how and talent.\nWe've learned a lot from the development and launch of No Heroes Here and Monica e a Guarda dos Coelhos and it has helped in the development of our third title, Dandy Ace.\nAs with every project, setbacks may occur and we will work hard to prevent and avoid delays or minimize them as much as possible. We don't expect delays with the production of the rewards and physical goods. So far, we are on track and very proud of the goals accomplished!\nWe want to add some extras to the game, and we can only do that with this Kickstarter and its stretch goals. We are 200% committed to the project and have enjoyed the development process as much as we hope you enjoy the game once it is in your hands. We've been working on Dandy Ace by ourselves up until now, fully devoting our time and effort into this project. While a majority of core game concepts we had envisioned for the project have come to fruition, there are still many things we would like to do prior to the full release of the game. This is where we need your help. Crowdfunding provides us with several opportunities to directly reach new players and engage our community, not only through funding but through feedback and ideas as well. We'll be inviting backers to test development builds and communicate with our team leading up to launch.\nThere are two primary things we hope to accomplish with our Kickstarter campaign. First, we would like to avoid possible Early Access and continue to improve and add features within Dandy Ace to confidently launch the title fully across each platform once it is ready. The second goal of the Kickstarter is to bring more awareness to the game and reach new potential players. We've grown an amazing supportive community of players around Dandy Ace's development so far and hope to continue to do so on a larger scale. A Kickstarter campaign also allows for our community and backers to become more involved in the development process leading up to launch while also supporting our efforts directly.\n Dandy Ace is an over the top roguelike experience that follows a fabulous magician seeking to combine and use his magical cards while fighting and looting his way to defeat the Green-Eyed Illusionist, Lele, who has imprisoned him in a cursed mirror.\nPlay as Dandy Ace, the amazing hero, and survive the challenges of the extravagant, lavish and ever changing palace created to defeat him filled with bizarre creatures and outrageous bosses. Find all of the magical cards, gather shards and gold, and get help from his assistants and unconventional allies.\n Dandy Ace will be coming to PC, Playstation, Xbox, and Switch. The initial launch will be for PC with the consoles to follow in the months after.\nStory\nLele, also known as the Green-Eyed Illusionist, always dreamed of becoming the world's greatest magician. However, he was never able to be taken seriously due to his lack of skill and his tacky appearance. At his lowest point, Lele witnessed the rise of a brilliant prodigy magician named Dandy Ace. The conflict between admiration and envy soon became an obsession, as he decided to try to get rid of the talented young magician. Lele exchanged his soul in order to use the spell of the Cursed Mirror to trap Ace inside of it forever.\nInside the Cursed Mirror, Lele became the king. He created a bizarre palace, filled with trials and creatures, with the goal of humiliating Ace. Due to Lele's desire to watch the young magician fail repeatedly, every time Ace is defeated, he is forced back to the beginning. In order to escape and break the curse, Dandy Ace has to use all of his magic cards and incredible performances to defeat the different enemies found within the Cursed Mirror and take down Lele.\nDandy Ace vs Boss Axolangelo, the Master Painter\nTry, die and try again until you beat the Green-Eyed Illusionist with the replayability and adrenaline of a rogue-like but with permanent upgrades that make you stronger as you continue to reach new levels and progress further with each run!\n2D isometric fast-paced action with lots of challenging but fair combat engagements. Battle your way through bizarre creatures and outrageous bosses while building up your own arsenal of magic.\n The Magical Cards \nDandy Ace\u2019s core mechanic revolves around the Magical Cards which act as skills in the game. Players are able to create countless combinations of skills, upgrades, and play styles by combining the different cards they come across on each run.\nEvery Magical Card has a default skill associated with it. These skills can be upgraded further by combining another Magical Card with it. Players can find stronger versions of cards as they progress through the levels and experiment with the different skills. Players are not guaranteed the same cards each run so it will be important to learn them all!\nThe cards fall into 3 main categories: Blue, Pink, and Yellow\nMovement skill cards are divided between two types: Dashes and Blinks.\nThese cards are often divided into Melee and Ranged Skills.\nThese cards have the widest variety of mechanics, from giant barriers & personal shields to giant slow fields!\nDandy Ace\nThe game's protagonist is none other than one of the greatest magicians alive, the dashing Dandy Ace. Ace is a rising star full of confidence and extremely charismatic. Even in defeat, Ace's confidence remains unshaken in his quest to defeat Lele, the Green-Eyed Illusionist, and escape from the cursed mirror.\n Lele, the Green-Eyed Illusionist \nLele is the main antagonist of Dandy Ace. A magician himself, Lele both admires and hates Ace. As his obsession with Ace grew and his own popularity dropped, Lele sold his soul and trapped Ace inside of the Cursed Mirror.\nEnemies\nThe enemies found within the Cursed Mirror are bizarre creations from Lele's imagination with the only purpose of denying Ace's escape. Ace will also run into some of Lele's prestigious palace guests and unique bosses as he progresses through the various stages providing players with more challenging encounters. Here you can find a few of them!\n Bunny Butler & Bunny Jester \nThe Bunny Butler & Bunny Jester are the most common and basic enemies Dandy Ace will encounter. The Bunny Butler is a melee based enemy looking to charge at Ace whereas the Bunny Jester attacks from range.\nCuckoo Nightmare\n The Cuckoo Nightmare is a tankier enemy Ace must face fairly early on with a wide range of attacks for both up close encounters and at range.\nTurrets & Totems\nStationary enemies that fire projectiles towards Dandy Ace. There are several different types of Turrets that Ace will encounter including Homing Turrets, Poison Turrets, and Multi-Shot Turrets.\nSimilar to Turrets, Totems are static enemies. These enemies do not attack Ace though, they provide Auras around them buffing other enemy creatures and creating more unique combat scenarios. These were created by Lele as bizarre furniture items decorating the Cursed Mirror realm.\nOozes\nThese slime-like creatures split off into multiple smaller versions of themselves during combat forcing Ace to deal with multiple Oozes at once when visiting the Garden.\nLady Fan & Lady Hook\nThese are Lele\u2019s palace guests and some of the strongest enemies encountered in the Cursed Mirror. Lady Fan is the first humanoid enemy Ace comes across and she isn't to be underestimated. Lady Hook is a more challenging version of this enemy and another humanoid that is able to use her hook projectile to pull Ace.\nBosses\nBesides Lele, there are several different complex bosses Ace will need to defeat to escape the Cursed Mirror. Each boss has unique mechanics that will test Dandy Ace and prepare him for the fight against Lele, The Green-Eyed Illusionist!\nAxolangelo, The Master of Arts\nThe Art Gallery is where Axolangelo resides alongside all of his paintings. The name Axolangelo was due to an internal pun/joke within the development team that came from combining the animal axolotl and the famous painter Michelangelo. This is one of the first major challenges and bosses Ace will encounter in the Palace. Players can attempt to take him on in our free demo available now on the Dandy Ace Steam page!\nAllies\nDandy Ace was not the only one to be trapped in the Cursed Mirror by Lele. Ace will need the help of his stage assistants and some of the other characters he meets along the way to escape.\nJolly Jolly & Jenny Jenny\nAce\u2019s twin stage assistants will be there to help Ace investigate the power of the shards in the Cursed Mirror realm as well as take care of the many magical cards and trinkets Ace collects.\nNnif\nNnif is a bunny that used to work for Lele but decided to end his services and pursue a rogue life as a smuggler. Nnif is always looking to sell you the latest exclusive power-ups at his Tent in exchange for shards.\nThe Art of Dandy Ace\n We want to give you a game as spectacular as Dandy Ace himself!This is just a sample of our work, with character designs, concepts, illustrations, and background pictures that you will see in the final product.\nDandy Ace concept art\nGatekeeper Boss early exploration\nLele in-game version concept art\nEnvironment General props concept art\nEnvironment Garden props concept art\nDandy Ace Key Illustration\n\n Rewards\nDandy Ace (digital)\nYou\u2019ll receive a digital copy of Dandy Ace for your Steam Account!\nBeta Access\nGet Beta access to the game in Steam!

Dandy Ace is a larger project for us and while we are confident that we will be able to launch the game across all platforms next year, there are many features that we'd like to get in for launch that are still incomplete or haven't had development started on them. There are also existing features that need improvement such as the tutorials and overall Narrative experience.\n\nWe hope to get as much of it done as possible for the launch or shortly after launch.

Capture the hearts of weapons to level them up in this \u201cshack-and-slash\u201d dungeon crawling adventure. Forge relationships and save Love itself!\nWe've decided $200k USD is our final stretch goal. Although we'll continue using your money to improve the game's polish and quality, we don't feel comfortable promising any further features or additional content. So... thank you for making our dream come true! Now it's our turn to repay the favor.\n Boyfriend Dungeon is an action-RPG dungeon crawler in which the weapons you use transform into beautiful people -- take them on dates to level them up and become more powerful together.\nDate up to nine weapons, from dancing swords to heart-piercing daggers\nGenerated action-combat dunj and challenges! Stay sharp!\nVarious combat styles. For example, hit hard and dodge quickly with the dagger, or take on crowds with Lasersaber\nInclusive, tasteful approach to gender and sexuality, including male, female, and non-binary romance\nLet's get to the point: take your weapon-babes on romantic outings, such as to the club or the beach\nThe couple that slays together, stays together.\n This campaign not only supports us making our dream game, but also offers you once-in-a-lifetime merchandise, including weapon-dating-based mugs, body pillowcases, pins, and other extremely practical objects.\nAwards: Boyfriend Dungeon has already won two awards at BitSummit, and has been selected for showcases, including the PAX West Indie Megabooth and the Damage Camp Arcade 2018.  \nPlatforms: Boyfriend Dungeon is developed by us, Kitfox Games, and we already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC, Mac, and Linux! Check out our Steam coming soon page and after you back us, feel free to add us to your wishlist\u2026\nWe will also offer DRM-free versions of PC, Mac, and Linux via the Humble Store.\nWhat about consoles? Or other stores? We\u2019re not ready to talk about consoles yet, sorry! This campaign is specifically to support us being able to make the best possible desktop version and merchandise.\nKitfox Games is an award-winning game studio. Boyfriend Dungeon is the fourth title we're bringing to Steam. For more information about our past games, scroll down to the section below entitled The Team.\nAs of the start of this campaign, we've now revealed all 5 of the weapons you can date (Talwar, Dagger, Epee, Lasersaber, and Glaive).\nThis campaign, in addition to helping us finish the game, will fund a 6th weapon... the cat, Brass Knuckles!\nWe don\u2019t want to give away too many spoilers, so we won\u2019t tell you everything about the weapons, but we\u2019ve prepared these dating profiles so you can get an idea of who you might prefer! If you're more interested in their combat abilities and play-styles, scroll down to see their individual tactics.\nAlternately, you can take our Wielder Test to see which one we would recommend for you.\nThe talwar is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian Subcontinent. (Wikipedia)\nSunder says: \"Hey, gorgeous. I didn't expect to meet someone like you in the dunj... I hope I can keep you safe. I've been around a while but don't believe everything you hear -- some people are jealous, or don't know how to forgive. But you're the open-minded type, right?\"\nDaggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations... (Wikipedia)\nValeria says: \"Oh, hey, you're cute! So.. what's your deal? You can tell me. If you want to, I mean. What? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just an old friend, looking out for me. Let's talk about you instead. Maybe you should come by my studio sometime and I'll paint you..\"\nThe entire body is the valid target area. A successful \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time. (Wikipedia)\nIsaac says: \"Goodness. Let's get down to facts, shall we? I may be new to the dunj, but I know plenty about fencing. Hold onto me tightly, but not too tight. Deep breaths. Parry, then thrust. Practice makes perfect.\"\nWhen a Lasersaber powers up, he can be dangerous, but most of the time, he prefers to recharge his batteries.\nSeven says: \"Hey. I want to keep our.. friendship.. secret for now, if that's okay with you. My agent and fans are a little high-maintenance and I just want to relax. Maybe we can watch TV together sometime?\"\nThis class of polearms [is rated] above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. (Wikipedia)\nSawyer says: \"UHH! I'm late for class, but.. hi! Um. Since you seem to have your life together, maybe you can show me how to cook? Would that be okay? I wouldn't want to waste your time. Let me know, but no worries if you're too busy.\"\nAnd this Kickstarter, if it succeeds, will help fund a sixth weapon, Brass Knuckles! \nBrass knuckles are designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force... (Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier.

Includes: T-Shirt, Messenger Bag, Stickers, Soundtrack CD, Mug, Pin, USB Rose game copy, Collector's Edition Box Set, and a Body Pillowcase of your choosing\nThe music, sound effects and audio design overall will be managed by Omar Dabbous, audio designer of GNOG by KO_OP.  \nThe soundtrack of Boyfriend Dungeon is an hour of all-original summery weapon-pop from the master composer Marskye (also of GNOG), often featuring the vocals of Madeleine McQueen.    \nTheir collaboration has already produced a few amazing tracks, including the main theme song you hear in the trailer, \u201cWithout a Weapon\u201d (Soundcloud link):   \n  And, presented here for the first time, a preview of the new soon-to-be-hit single, Spellbound:\n If you back the project now, you\u2019re sure to get notified when we post more songs and track previews in the future, during and after the campaign.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Background Illustration: Jessica Mao is creating most of the game\u2019s background illustrations! They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

The Spatial MRX is a mobile accessory that converts your phone or tablet into a holographic, augmented gaming machine with a built-in camera that integrates physical piece play. \nThe MRX comes with an exclusive suite of AR (Augmented Reality) games made by 10 different studios. Multiplayer games use physical pieces to project interactive holograms without using AR/VR headsets. Traditional tabletop gaming meets digital, holographic action with a joypad in one hand and play pieces in the other.  \nPlay Face-to-Face and Hands-On\nWhy play holographic AR Games?... We love board games like Settlers of Catan but we also can't get enough of video games like Hearthstone and Clash Royale. The first one brings the authentic joy of tabletop piece play while the digital side is exciting because of it's mechanics and graphics. Spatial's holographic AR merges the best of classic, tabletop piece play with a projected, digital experience you share face-to-face with friends and family.\nHolographic AR Games for Spatial MRX\nSpatial, multiplayer games are designed around fun mechanics that leverage both piece play and a joypad. All the games are exclusive to the platform and allow you to play hands-on in this unique form of augmented reality.\n It\u2019s time to duel! Mythico mixes the deck building of physical cards with the excitement of holographic projection. Inspired by Yu-gi-oh\u2122 and Magic the Gathering\u2122, you can inject heroes, attack and track stats and levels automatically. It\u2019s 2018 and it\u2019s about time we had holographic collectible card games! Gather around the table for Mythico and battle it out with your monsters you bring to life. \nHoloCraft allows you to play tabletop RPGs as you normally would but now with a projected user interface. Create a world as big as your table and each player has their own perspective of the shared holographic, play space. Dungeon building is as easy as dragging any one of 20K prefab components with your hands. When it\u2019s time to play, each adventurer injects customizable characters they can tie to physical play pieces.  \nA squad-based multiplayer, real-time strategy game that turns your table into a kingdom under siege. Strategize how to build and level your army to become king of the land.\nProtect the payload as it makes its way through a mutant bug infested battlefield. An engineer and his hammer must win the day in a mix of hi-tech tower defense and hero battler. \nA physics based party game with a magnet that is one part crane and one part catapult. Stack and migrate unstable towers of garbage to the finish line before your opponent blows it up with a toilet bowl.\nIt's like American Gladiators gone AR where one player builds the map and runs a cannon, while the other players have one minute to bolt through the course and make it to the finish line alive. Run, jump, roll, and summon special tools to survive.\nUnlimited Games, Forever\nLock In Every Game We Ever Make - Play any of the available games by downloading them from their respective App Store and enabling them with an Activation Code. As a thanks to our backers we are offering an Unlimited Activation Code Reward so you never have to spend another dollar on content if you chose. \nThe Spatial AR Gaming Alliance will be delivering great gaming experiences that we think show off the best of what the platform can do. Backers can have everything ever made for the MRX platform at no extra cost ever (with the Unlimited Access Code reward).\nPipeline of Games from the Spatial AR Gaming Alliance \n10 studios are developing games for the platform with more added every month. More titles and dates will be announced soon.\nMagic Window Projection\nHolographic Glass - Holographic projection removes the digital screen so you can play hands-on.\nThe Magic Window is your portal into a shared, holographic play space. Projected characters are tied to play pieces, cards and tokens. Move the MRX around the table and your perspective changes in real time. Add additional MRXs and each person will see another side of the same battle field.\nIntegrated Camera \nReal-time Play Piece Tracking  - Integrates physical pieces with the projected AR world, merging the best of digital gaming and tabletop play.\nThe MRX rig comes with an integrated camera that tracks play pieces to present a realistic, interactive model of characters and objects in real-time.\nClassic Integrated Joypad\nHolograms You Control - A familiar built-in joypad adds run-n-gun style control of holograms spawned from play pieces.\nRun, gun and battle across your table controlling holograms in real-time.\nPowered by Your Mobile Device\nEverything Else is Built-In - The MRX and your mobile device are all that you need for a great, mixed reality game night.  \nSimply download a Spatial game on your smartphone or tablet. Dock it in the MRX and enjoy projected AR fun with family and friends.\nInitial Supported Devices (More Tested Soon):\niPhone 6 or newer\niPad 2 or newer\nAndroid Phones at Android Version 4.4 or newer. Example: Samsung Galaxy s6 or newer\nAndroid Tablets at Android Version 4.4 or newer. Example: Samsung Tab S2 or newer\n* Devices don't need specific AR capabilities as the MRX has the built-in camera.\nCompact & Collapsible \nPack it Up - The MRX is a mobile accessory easy enough to take with you. \nWhen it\u2019s time to wrap it up you can collapse the MRX and put it on the shelf. Weighing in at 2 lbs, it\u2019s a little bit bigger than a tablet with 4 inches of depth.\nWhat You'll Need / How It Works\nWhat You'll Need\n- WIFI network (with Internet to download the game otherwise games run without Internet connection).\n- Power Outlet. Each MRX needs to be plugged in.\n- A supported mobile device (See Initial Supported Devices above).\nGetting Started (Only Needed the First Time You Use It)\n- Unfold: Lift the Magic Window and it snaps into the place\n- Plug It In: Power plug comes out of the back\n- Download a Spatial Game: Go to Google Play or the AppStore\n- Pair the Game with the MRX: The game has a feature to discover the MRX as an access point. The app then configures the MRX to have it's own WIFI connection (similar setup to Alexa)\n- Dock Your Mobile Device: Place your mobile device in the MRX cradle and your ready to rock.\nSteps Each Time You Play\n- Unfold\n- Dock Your Mobile Device\nMultiplayer\n- Each game has a lobby where you match up to other players over WIFI. The gaming engine uses real-time replication and makes it so each person has their own perspective of the same digital world.\nInnovative Multiplayer Interaction \nThe More The Merrier - Each player has his/her own perspective on the same holographic scene.\nNo need to wait for a turn, join up to 6 players at once (locally or online). Simply add additional MRXs and let them in on the action.\nPhysical Game Pieces \nClassic & Digital Play Collide -  The disks, tokens and cards from tabletop play spawn digital characters and offer unique hands-on interaction.\nThe playing of physical pieces in games is a classic method of tabletop gameplay. Now you can enjoy this tactile and obvious form of play in a digital gaming environment without staring directly at a screen.\nNo Headsets Required\nFree from Headsets and Glasses - Enjoy exciting and interactive mixed reality play without the expensive equipment like AR/VR headsets.\nThe MRX Rig doesn\u2019t require any wearables and works with a projected model with it's Magic Window design.\nPartners\n Avnet \nHardware Studio Connection is a partnership between Avnet and Dragon Innovation to prepare Kickstarter creators (working on hardware products) with guidance, feedback, and services to help build more accurate cost projections, and a realistic manufacturing timeline.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been playing games on the Spatial MRX for 9 months now, and we are really happy with where the platform is currently at. Most of the effort of late has been zooming in on our games and making sure it's the type of content that is engaging and leverages the platform. The physical platform risk is equal to any Internet of Things type device. Believe it or not the electronics are pretty straight forward although it is custom because we wanted to reach as accessible a price as is possible. We are partnered with Avnet and their Hardware Studio program and they\u2019ve been instrumental in coordinating our specific quotes for the electronics. We are choosing between several competing offers for the full assembly of the products. We will be able to dial in the specific units once the campaign is done. Some people may think we are doing a loss-lead (selling at a loss) type play and that is not true. The product has standard retail margins despite some of the tech that is inside and this is true even of our first production run (based on our unit estimates). In some senses the inside of the MRX has the architecture of a displayless, IoT camera device where almost all the data is sent over WIFI to the mobile app. It is safe to say we have considered cost in every step and decision we made. The other form of risk is based on the games. The SDK we have built makes building a game on Spatial a really straight forward experience. Developers are essentially doing the same thing they normally do but on a ground plane that is the table and with a 3rd party game camera. Our founders have created successful software/hardware companies 4 times over prior to this project (all our own inventions) and we are very familiar with the challenges ahead.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Join In The Conversation", "descp": "Let's take face-to-face hands-on gaming to the next level!

Our protagonist, formerly a veteran police detective but now retired following years of frustration and disillusionment, spends his days intoxicated while accepting random jobs as a private investigator to make ends meet. He exists within the neon sea of an immense city, its blinding artificial lights unable to hide the shadow of greed and lust that threatens to engulf it at any moment.\nThis drunken cycle is broken when our hero becomes entangled in a missing person's case, one which holds the key to tracking down a monstrous killer who long ago escaped justice. Unlock your memories, decode the truth, and resist drowning in the wave of conspiracy that grips the city!\nStunningly detailed retro-styled pixel-art coupled with modern atmospheric lighting and visual effects bring this unique cyberpunk world to life, while evocative music and sound design build suspense and mystery every step of the way.\n As an adventure game built on mystery and intrigue, the player will encounter various puzzles interspersed throughout the story. These have been designed to test observation and reasoning skills, while also being logical and fun. The puzzles appear organically and help to flesh out the world while also keeping gameplay fresh and interesting.\nThe story itself has been written and designed to ensure that players care about the characters and the world they exist in. Through this cinematic storytelling comes the motivation to move forward and the constant desire to reach the next twist or plot point.\nSimilar to other side-scrollers, players can use a control pad or mouse & keyboard to determine movement, dialogue, and interaction between characters in each scene.\nGameplay  \nOur protagonist is a very talented detective. He uses powers of observation, reasoning, and deduction to solve puzzles and reveal the mysteries of cases one after another by exploring the scene, analyzing objects, and interrogating witnesses.\nIn addition, at various points in the game you can take control of his special \u201cassistant\u201d - William the black cat. William can travel deeper into areas our detective can\u2019t reach, often proving decisive in identifying and retrieving key evidence!\nMaster Detective  \nThe player needs to search for hidden clues and physical evidence from the perspective of a detective, obtain secrets from the mouths of key individuals, make inferences, and draw conclusions about who is the criminal, their motives and techniques.\nInvestigation\nItem\nMaze Explorer  \nMany scenes within the game are constructed like a maze, requiring the player to make use of everything around them to escape and move on to the next section.\nThe goal is to create interesting and logical side-scrolling labyrinths.\nBelow is an early design example (we don\u2019t want to spoil sections of the finished game!)\n There will also be some independent puzzles in the game interspersed with each stage, so in this way the puzzles can be more diverse.\nThe game is now more than 50% complete. Several test versions already exist and have been trialed by a small sample group of players for feedback.\nThe overall framework and flow of the game stages has been finalized.\nThe main game systems have been completed.  \nThe artistic style of the game has been fine-tuned, and the main scene assets have also been completed.  \nThe second offline test has been completed.\nWe have already exhibited our game at PAX East and have received coverage from Rock Paper Shotgun, and VentureBeat. Thanks to the support of players like you, the main systems and the design of the mechanics are finished.

I kinda blew them off saying I didn't have any ideas for something like that and I was far too busy with The End is Nigh and Bum-Bo to start thinking about it (but the seed had been planted).\nFast forward 9 or 10 months.\nI was sick with the flu, stuck on the living room couch, bored out of my mind when the basic structure for a Binding Of Isaac card game started taking over my brain. Within 5 days I had roughly 200 cards, drew them up and started testing things with Danielle. \nEven at this phase the game was fun, every play session felt totally new, dynamic and interesting.\nWithin a month U had a fully fleshed out a prototype using sleeved cards with sticker paper, I scribbled down and reverse engineered the mechanics for as many iconic monsters, items, characters and random happenings from the digital game as I could.  \nIt was really fun to take a well known item or monster from the game and think up ways to convey stuff like, How could I show that the carrion queen takes damage when you hit her butt? Or how could I represent the rng aspects of cursed floors or troll bombs only using a deck of cards? \nOnce we finished the first 4 player game session, I knew this was something super unique that really embodied everything people love about The Binding of Isaac. \nPeople joined forces to take down giant bosses, bartered their way to more items and stabbed each other in the back once someone started inching closer to having 4 souls. \nI called up Studio71 and told them I was ready.\nThe prototype has gone through many different major revisions over the months and i\u2019m sure things will change as the Kickstarter unfolds but it\u2019s in a place where I\u2019m extremely happy with how well it plays and everyone I've tested with always wants another round so that's a good sign.\n                                                                                                                                                The basics:\n2-4 players take turns playing loot cards and using items to kill monsters that yield more items, loot, and sometimes souls. The first player to end their turn with 4 souls is the winner. Cooperation, barter, and betrayal is encouraged.\nStarting the game:\nShuffle the monster, loot, and treasure decks and place them on the table.\nTake the top 2 cards from the monster deck and place them face up on the table. These are the current active monsters.\nTake the top 2 cards from the treasure deck and place them face up on the table. These are the current store items.\nEach player starts the game with 3 loot cards and 3\u00a2.\nCain always goes first, if Cain is not one of the characters drawn, then the saddest player goes first.\nPlayer turn:\n1) Charge all activated items (Turn all used items upright) \n2) Draw 1 loot card\n3) Main phase\nDuring their main phase the active player may do any or all of these things in any order: \n1. Play 1 loot card, this can be in response to any action.\n2. Purchase 1 store item or purchase the unknown top card of the treasure deck. (All store items cost 10\u00a2, including the top card of the deck)\n3. Attack a monster. (The player can choose to attack any active monster or attack the unknown top card of the monster deck)\n4. Activate their player card to play an additional loot card. (Player cards can also be saved and activated on other player\u2019s turns in response to any action)\n4) Ending phase \n1. Check to see if any player has 4+ souls. if they do, they win and the game ends. \n2. Heal damage done to all players and monsters. \n3. Pass the turn to the player to your left.\nLoot cards:\nKeep loot cards in your hand without revealing them to other players. You may play one loot card during each of your turn.\nTrinkets: These rare loot cards play like treasure items and have passive effects. Place these cards face up on the table next to your item cards, they count as items when in play.\nBasic loot: Basic loot comes in the form of coins, bombs, hearts, pills and the like and are used to gain resources or help in combat.\nTarot cards: Tarot cards are more advanced loot cards that can drastically change the course of the game.\nSpecial loot: These are secret! shhhhhhhh...\nThe Monster deck is the meat and potatoes of the game. It\u2019s filled with basic monsters, bosses, treasures, curses and other surprises.\nBasic monster: Monsters that are easier to kill and yield loot, coins, and on rare occasion, treasure.\nBosses: Harder monsters with bigger rewards that all yield souls when killed (Souls are how you win, remember?)\nChests/Bonus cards: Rare cards that yield rewards with little effort and change the game... but they may also kill you\u2026\nCurses: Rare cards that, when revealed, curse the player in the lead. Curse cards are placed to the left of your character card. Curses are discarded when the cursed player dies.\nTreasure cards:\nActive items: These items can be activated at any time to use their abilities and are noted with a turning arrow symbol. You show an item is activated by turning it sideways. (These items can be activated in response to any action) Once an item has been activated, it can't be activated again until it\u2019s charged at the start of that player's turn.\nPaid items: These items activate when you pay a specific cost (ie, discard a card, pay 2\u00a2 or take 2 damage). Paid items can be used in response to any action and can be used as many times as they can be paid for.\nPassive items: These items give players special abilities that usually change the rules of the game or modify existing effects. These abilities don't require activation.\nCombat:\nEach player may attack the monster deck once during their turn. If the player chooses to attack, they may choose to attack an active monster card (face up monster card next to the deck) or the top card of the monster deck. If they attack the top of the deck, reveal that monster card to all players and place it over one of the active monster cards face up.\nWhen a player attacks a monster card, they roll their d6. If the number is greater than or equal to that creature\u2019s DICE number, then they deal damage equal to their damage number to that creature. (That is, unless someone uses an ability to modify or reroll the result!) If the attacking player rolls lower than the creature\u2019s dice number, that player takes damage equal to that monster\u2019s damage number. The attacking player continues to roll their d6 until that creature takes lethal damage(damage greater than or equal to that creature\u2019s hit points) or that creature deals lethal damage to the player.\nIf a monster is killed, the active player gains any rewards for killing it and the card is placed on the top of the monster discard pile face up. If an active monster is killed and there are no cards underneath it, reveal the top card of the monster deck and place it face up in the active monster card zone, replacing the killed monster.\nIf a monster deals lethal damage to a player, that player is killed. (see Death:) That player pays a penalty and ends their turn.\nAll damage done to players and monsters is healed at the end of any player\u2019s turn.\nIf a non-monster card is revealed when a player attacks the top card of the library or is revealed after killing an active monster, the active player reads that card to all players and follows the directions on the card. You can no longer attack the monster deck this turn.\nDeath:\nWhen a player takes lethal damage or is killed for any reason, that player suffers a death penalty.\nIf that player has any items beyond their starting item, they choose and destroy one of them, placing it in that cards discard pile.\nIn addition to an item, that player also discards a card, loses 1\u00a2 and deactivates all their items and player card.\nAfter paying the death penalty, if the player was killed during their turn, their turn ends.\nAdvanced play aka the bonus souls: Once players have a better understanding of the games mechanics, you are encouraged to add the bonus souls, the Soul of Greed and the Soul of Gluttony, to your games.\nThese bonus cards aren\u2019t added to any deck but instead exist face up on the table next to the game decks in view of all players.\nIf any player completes their turn with 25\u00a2 or more, they acquire the Soul of Greed. If any player completes their turn with 10 or more loot cards in their hand, they acquire the Soul of Gluttony.\nOnce acquired, these souls can\u2019t be gained again for the rest of that game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn developing the game we have been obsessive with the details throughout designing, prototyping, and planning for production so we can get the game to all of you ASAP.

My name is Rune, and I need your help to create the ultimate Trump-bashing game for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows & Apple Tv! \nIn this game you will be taken on a journey across Trump Land. A world filled with politicians, cyborgs, mutants, hippies and other nasty creatures. You will try your best to escape while getting chased by the grabby hands of Donald and his accomplices!\nI made a working demo for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows & Apple Tv. It is a dream for me to be able to make it into a full featured game, with lots of levels, characters, gameplay improvements and unlockable achievements.  \nThe fully funded complete version of the game will feature 15 levels, 10 playable characters, an army of enemies and PS4, Xbox and Nintendo Switch versions aswell as animated cutscenes! \nYou will be breaking out imprisoned people by the mexican border, smashing up Steve Bannon Brain Bots, flying the pink skies on a \u201cunicorn\u201d in \u201cThe Dream of Donald\u201d and fighting atomic mutants in \u201cThe Horrors of Trump Tower\u201d. \nIn \"The Dream of Donald\" you will play the unicorn fantasy of Donald and Kim Jung as they are flying the skies of Trump Land. Unfortunately they can't find a Unicorn, so they have to dress up a horse with wings and rockets to make it fly. You will dodge evil hippies and other disorderly creatures that tries to tear down your dream.\nIn \"The Horrors of Trump Tower\", you will get to experience the horrible consequenses of a US nuclear crisis. This will be one of the final levels, where as the ones that lead up to this one will tell the story of how it all went this badly. \nThese 5 screenshots are from the working demo for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows & Apple TV. The full funded version of the game will have gameplay improvements and further features. \n         You can have everything from early access, influensing the game development to your own playable character or a place in the \"sponsered by\" spot appearing when people open the game. \n BECOME A PRISONER!\n Send me a picture of you or your aunt and I will make it into one of the prisoners in the game.  \nThe character will be a helper of removing some of the obstacles and smashing Trump on the way. Your character will have a special weapon or ability to help the player along the way. This character will appear in multiple levels. \n\nBECOME AN ENEMY OF THE DONALD!\nSend me a picture of you or your little sister and I will turn it into one of the rocket fuelled enemies of the Donald in the \u201cDream of Donald\u201d level. The character will be one of the obstacles in the Donalds pink tinted unicorn fantasy, trying to shoot him down from the skies. \nBECOME A PLAYABLE CHARACTER!\nSend me a picture of you or your favourite person in the world and tell me what kind of weapon you would prefer and you will have the exclusive spot as a playable character in this game. You will be the one running from the grabby hands of Trump and you will have the possibility to wreak havoc amongst him and his accomplices. \n\nBILLBOARD SPOT!\nShow your or your companys resistance to the Trump regime. You will get a billboard spot in the background of one of the levels. It can be a commercial for your company or organisation, or it can be a love declaration for your Trump hating friend. You decide the content of the billboard.\nOFFICIAL SPONSOR!\nYour companys/organisations logo will appear when you open the game, and a Donald Trump Voice Actor will say \u201cSponsored by your organisations name\u201d.

While there have certainly been excellent titles exploring the synergy of these two elements before, we at Single \"A\" Productions have always wanted just a little more, and that is why we've decided to bring Fatal Flash to life - to take the idea to its fullest limits and endeavor to create an unique and exciting experience for all.\nJust a year ago, Fatal Flash was nothing more than an idea; with the irreplaceable help of so many talented creators and friends from around the world, we've transformed that idea into a near-alpha stage game, with many major systems already in place and ready for additional assets and polish. We are running this Kickstarter now, in the hopes of receiving enough funding to take the game into Early Access, as well as reach out to our community for valuable advice, direction, and feedback.\nPlayable Demo\nWe are happy to present a demo build of Fatal Flash we've been working on for you to experience first hand.

The most powerful nation, Akrea, have long set their eyes on foreign territory and resources, and would have invaded long ago if not for the alliance known as the Union Against Belligerent Interests (UABI), which unites many sovereign states together in agreement to collectively fight Akrea, should they ever break the peace.\nThe Starless Nights\nThis stalemate which had long obstructed the break out of war collapsed when one day, a catastrophic meteor shower, now known as The Starless Nights, rained destruction upon Ziakhvalle. Millions of lives came to an abrupt end, while the entire continent was engulfed in complete darkness. Nearly a year later, when light finally returned to the land, a mysterious, sky-blue element was discovered within the meteorites in copious amounts.\nAkrim Researchers study Azurium for the first time\nThe element would come to be known as Azurium. Preliminary experimentation revealed its incredible re-combinatory potential, and it wasn\u2019t long before Akrea was able to weaponize the element, and arm soldiers in mass with the ability to instantly teleport great distances. Without a moment wasted, Akrea began their full scale invasion, eliminating many factions before they were able to muster any meaningful resistance. With options waning, the UABI had no choice but to research Azurium themselves, developing their own technologies in an attempt to combat the impending Akrean legions.\nThe Council Convenes\nAs tensions between Akrea and the UABI continued to escalate, reports began to spread about sightings of \u201cshadowy beings\u201d surfacing all across Ziakhvalle. The exact origin and purpose of these creatures are the subject of much speculation, but what is undeniable is their overwhelming numbers, unholy strength, and seemingly insatiable desire for death and destruction.\nWith unending chaos and carnage all but inevitable, only those able to grasp the mysteries of Azurium will have a chance to emerge from the darkness to come.\nThe Archetypes:\nIn Fatal Flash, you do not control heroes or legends. Instead, each Archetype is simply a template - a canvas with broadly defined strokes waiting for players to fill in the rest. From changing an Archetype's appearance and name, to replacing their skills and in extreme cases entirely changing play-styles, players will be granted full reign over the creation of their own unique Archetype, with whom they can go on to create their own legends and achievements.\nHere is the current roster:\n...and many more to come!\nEach Archetype starts with 6 skills by default, and will always have access to 4 universal skills - basic attack, block, movement, and ultimate (though there exists noticeable nuances from Archetype to Archetype). The remaining two skills embody a unique mechanic specific to that Archetype, and help set it apart from the others.\nAkrean Piercer Skills\nAll skills function on a cooldown system, with the exception of the ultimate, which is charged over time, as well as through dealing damage.\nAkrean Piercer Ultimate\nPlayers choose an archetype and are placed into teams of up to 3 players, whereupon they must work together to complete the various objectives (ranging from delivering a payload to classic deathmatch) provided by the chosen game mode.\nConcepts of different Archetypes\nIn addition to fending off opposing Archetypes and completing objectives, players will discover several environmental elements that can both help and hinder their efforts.\nHealing Stations (Large & Small)\nFor example, Healing Stations generate essential health recovery which can easily turn the tide of a battle.\nFlame Traps\nFlame Traps can be activated to grant your opponents (or allies) a swift, brutal death, or be used tactically to deny valuable space.\nCrawling tentacles of doom (Force Field)\nLast but not least, when a round timer depletes, the game enters Sudden Death, and a damaging force field begins moving in, shrinking the play space and forcing player confrontation.\nGame Modes\nWith base funding, we can focus on perfecting the two core modes of the game. The first is Classic Elimination (FFA and Team), in which the primary aim is to claim as many lives as possible in a given time frame.\nYou just got ELIMINATED!\nThe second is the objective-based Core Collection mode, in which two teams must gather and deliver precious Azurium Cores to their base, whist preventing opponents from doing the same. When carried, Cores will drastically reduce mobility and skill-usage, but simultaneously increase Archetype lethality.\nCore Collection Concept\nThere will be minimum of 2 distinct maps released for each mode, and with more support from the community, we would look into the creation of further interesting modes:\nMore Objective-Based Modes (Payload, Capture Points)\nPvE Boss Raid with players banding together to take down terrifying, AI controlled bosses\nTeleport Racing where players utilize their skills to either disrupt or get ahead of opponents, and be the first to reach the end!\nWork in Progress In-Game Map\nVisual Customization\nThe primary visual customization comes in the form of Archetype skins; each skin will be separated into three distinct body parts. For example, the S.H.I.E.L.D is split into Arm - Head & Torso - Legs. Each part is interchangeable, so you can combine and graft different parts from different skins however you like! Skins are purely cosmetic in nature, with no impact on core gameplay.\n  Combine parts freely to create unique looks\n Further options, depending on the progression of various Stretch & Community Goals, are also available.\n\nTaunts and Emotes:\n\nPlayer Badges and Titles:\n  Announcer Packs:\n  Trait Customization\nWe understand that a large appeal of the \"Class-Based\" genre comes  from player attachment towards one or more characters. As such, each Archetype is designed with a unique style in mind, to help separate them from the others and appeal to different players. As examples, the Nightmare utilizes knockbacks and roots to crowd control and bully opponents, the Astralmancer relies on map-spanning range to eliminate opposition from afar, and the Akrean Piercer is reflexes personified - relying solely on speed and precision to gain value.\nLoadout Menu Navigation\nHowever, we also realize that there are simply too many players out there, and that it is not realistic to try and satisfy everyone with singular Archetype designs alone. That is why we have created the Traits System, a card-based modification platform that allows you to do anything from simply tweaking the stats of an Archetype, to changing the way a skill functions (or just flat out replacing it). With a maximum of three slots per loadout, and tens of hundreds of Traits at your disposal, you are given free reign to experiment and to create your own unique Archetypes and strategies.\nTake for example, The Akrean Sky-Splitter's \"Split Arrow\" skill, which by default fires one large projectile that can split into 5 smaller projectiles.\nThe regular \"Split Arrow\" fires 5 projectiles\n\"That's not enough arrows for me\" - you might think.  Well, add the \"Blot Out The Sun\" Trait, and you now have 10 split arrows on contact.\nWith 'Blot Out The Sun', it fires 10 Projectiles\nStill not enough arrows? Throw on the \"Fully Loaded\" Trait to have two simultaneous charges of Split Arrow, for 20 total split arrows.\n\"Fully Loaded\" now grants an effective 20 projectiles to your skill\nBut you're actually more of a healer main? Fine, use the \"Scatter Heal\" Trait, and now watch these 20 mini-arrows heal allies instead!\n\"Scatter Heal\" Lets you heal allies instead!\n  From the beginning of development, we have always envisioned Fatal Flash as a Free To Play title. We believe that a multiplayer game lives and dies by it\u2019s player base, so for this reason, as well as the fact that Fatal Flash is our first large project, we wanted to provide an environment where all players can give the game a try, without being turned away by a price tag.\nHowever, with Free To Play inevitably comes the issue of monetization, and we understand there will be worries of randomization and loot drops given our focus on customization and player choice. However, we want to assure you we have no plans to utilize a random rewards system, and will commit to a pay-upfront model, similar to that of Awesomenauts or Warframe. What this means is, all purchasable items, be it Traits or Cosmetic, will be directly unlocked through a one-time purchase.\nAdditionally, all Traits will be unlockable simply through playing the game and earning Azurite Shards - the only currency present in Fatal Flash. Most Cosmetic items can also be unlocked through Shards, with the exception of newly released items (which will be purchase-only for a limited period before becoming unlockable), and a few legendary cosmetic items (to maintain exclusivity for those who do choose to support the longevity of the game).\nEven though we have a plan in place, and believe it is the right direction for the game, we realize that when it comes down to it, not everything may go as smoothly as we hope. As such, we are expecting, and very eager to work with our community throughout the full development cycle of the game - to ensure that the final game is one that will make you feel rewarded for your progress, but also one that can thrive and grow off its community.\nPixel Art\n  Happy S.H.I.E.L.D family (Skins)\n  The Assassin (in-game)\n  The Akrean Piercer (in-game)\n  The Nightmare (in-game)\nConcept Art\nFrom Sketch To Polished Concept\n  S.H.I.E.L.D Concept\n  Astralmancer Concept\n  Sky-Splitter Concept\nMusic\n    As mentioned, our team strongly believes that no game can be truly great without an awesome community behind it, and as such we are really excited to bring you Fatal Flash so early in it's development cycle. We really look forward to all your invaluable feedback and suggestions, and will do our utmost to implement all the best ideas into the product, so that it can become not only a game by us, but also one by all of you.\nIn order to support the community and help it grow, we hope to set up discussion forums for suggestions, as well as identify super backers early on, to invite them to playtest alpha-builds, as well as chat with the us and help shape the direction of the game. Once things start to kick off, we also want to set up weekly polls and even occasional design/art contests to give everyone a chance to contribute.\nREWARDS\n  Create your dream team by purchasing additional copies of Fatal Flash for your friends at the \"Warriors of Ziakhvalle\" level.

Once a vast paradise, the land is now a broken and barren hellscape. Ash rains from the sky and the smell of death is inescapable. An unholy army pours fourth from the Abyss, loosed by mankind's constant sin and rebellion against the heavens. Angels watch on as the purge continues. Some come to witness the destruction first-hand... while others have come searching for heroes and to bring us hope.\nLighthaven stands as the last refuge and sanctuary for mankind. The city was founded by the three Archangels known as the Triune.  From their council chambers they lead, mentor, and inspire the last of us.  The Triune also bears watch on the gate to the Abyss, stopping the flow of demons into our world. Only heroes who have passed many trials and ascended are permitted to pass beyond the gate.\nThe Abyss stands as both gateway and throne to Astaroth.  From here, the demonic invasion pours forth into this world.  With the entirety of the planet ravaged, Astaroth has his sights set on Lighthaven.\nLighthaven is the only obstacle standing in the way of our annihilation and extinction. It is the place where this conflict began years ago, and this is the place it shall end.\n  Dominus Concept\n  Lighthaven is a Tactical Action Role Playing Game with Roguelike elements inserted for end-game progression and replayability. It features responsive movement and a 3rd-person-overhead camera. The controls use W-A-S-D + \"Mouse Look\" for movement with 8 abilities. Your 6 main abilities are your combat attacks. They change based on weapon type, and become enhanced with a higher tier weapon. Your other 2 abilities are for utility skills based on your class, which can become enhanced with modifiers from gear.\nPre-Alpha Actionbar\nThe main concept for Lighthaven is to bring back the atmospheric horror that early ARPGs brought to the table and take elements from other genres to create synergy with the gameplay. To do this, the development of Lighthaven is focusing two simple things:\nCombat is being kept simple to force the focus on the atmosphere, uncertainty, and horror of the scene. The feeling of being mortal and that death is an almost certainty is meant to be kept present with each step.\nA player will once again rely on their light radius for visual safety and comfort. This places the center of attention on the life.... and death, of the character.\nThe focus of Lighthaven's gameplay is going to be on its atmosphere and positional tactics in combat. There will be little slaying of zombie-like monster hordes and you will encounter small groups of stronger, more intelligent, and purposeful enemies.\nCombat will be very basic and is based on an extremely simple builder/spender resource relationship. Abilities will be target-able, but also have basic hit boxes for aim-based action combat. Controls will be WASD with Forward/StrafeL/StrafeR/Backpedal using animation blend trees. and combat will be ability based using 8+ hotkeys.   The simple layout will allow players to also use a controller.\nLighthaven is written in C# on the Unity Engine. Saving is serialized with XML data-basing. The animation system and UI are both in the process of being overhauled to utilize new systems within Unity.\nLighthaven is intended to be launched as a single-player story-driven action rpg. The plans are to add multiplayer, and more classes... but these will be dependent on funding and time.\n1st iteration of combat and UI\n  New combat animations for Alpha with new UI elements\n  Original games in the Action RPG genre were heavily influenced by Roguelikes and so is Lighthaven. Outside of the main story-arc, the main focus and development of Lighthaven will be placed on the end-game dungeon, the Abyss. The Abyss will feature randomized level progression.  The randomization is where Lighthaven will get some of it's Roguelike similarities, the other will be in partial perma-death. Lighthaven will feature points/camps throughout the world where you may export a small percentage of your stats once you have raised them by a certain threshold since your last save.\nLighthaven's progression system will be unique in that it will be level-less. This is because of the game's Roguelike nature. The idea is to be able to come back after a death on a new character with a portion of the power you had before your character dying. Because the final dungeon is designed to scale linearly, you will need all the help you can get to master the final levels and encounters.  The Abyss is planned to consist of 10 massive descending levels at the game's launch.\nRaise your primary stats to unlock tiers of traits.\nTraits will be locked once chosen upon, each new life.\nTo unlock traits on a fresh character you will need to have raised your stats past a certain threshold. At this point meditation at a shrine will save (serialize) a fraction of your primary stats.\nA new character will have access to any traits they meet the stat requirement to unlock the trait's parent tier.\nThe 2 primary stats are Strength and Vitality. The higher your strength, the higher some offensive bonuses become and you will be granted access to higher tiers of offensive talents. The higher your vitality, the same is true for defensive stats and talents.\nAll loot is lost upon death.\nHowever, killing a boss will not only have a chance of dropping a Legendary quality item, but will always drop a Demon Essence.\nDemon Essence can be used to either bind a Legendary to your character to be summoned again later or to summon a legendary you have already bound.\nOnce bound, a Legendary can be summoned infinitely. 1 Demon Essence will be required per bind or summon.\nExplore.  Gain stats. Unlock traits. Bind Legendary artifacts, weapons, and armor.  Hope to see the end...\nPre-Alpha Weaponry\n  Pre-Alpha inventory panel\n    Lighthaven's game world will consist of connected zones with dungeons located in areas beyond the gates of Lighthaven.\nExplorable Zones of Dominus\nThe city of Lighthaven which lies to the West of the Abyss.\nExplorable zones to the North, South, and East of the Abyss.\nThe Gate to the Abyss.\nThe Abyss... a dungeon that scales is scope and difficulty the further you delve.\nThe city of Lighthaven will act as a hub for the player to interact with NPC's, arm themselves with gear, and prepare for the adventures beyond the gates.\nThe 3 surrounding zones will serve to give the player places to explore the world and the lore of Dominus.  The quests and lore will lead the player to the gates of the Abyss should they survive.  What lies beyond, only the strong will discover.\n  Concept of the City of Lighthaven\n  NPC Lodging within the City of Lighthaven\n  Name in Credits:  Anyone who contributes to the support of Lighthaven's development will have their names displayed in the game's credits, regardless of the amount.\nGame Key:  Lighthaven will be distributed digitally over the Steam network.

Players must win clans, either through an interactive bidding process that functions like a silent auction or through using their cards as actions, to take other players clans. Arkon's depth and replay-ability are tied to having cards that can be played in many ways and its use of interpersonal interactions (bidding, bluffing etc.).\n# of players: 2-4\nAverage game duration: 15-30 minutes\nArkon hinges around a few central dynamics. First, cards can be played in multiple ways. Players will constantly be challenged to make tradeoffs as they choose whether to use a card for some sort of advantage, keep it as a counter or use the card for its influence value to win a bid and move the player closer to winning the game. \nNext, Arkon employs a resource system based around silent auction bidding. Because all cards double as influence and winning bids is a key component of your victory condition, Arkon reduces the \"dead card in hand\" phenomenon.\n   \u2022 Unique Resource System: In Arkon, to acquire clans to win the game, you need to bid for them with influence. What this creates is a dynamic where players on all turns are looking at what they want to bid for and what they are willing to give up in terms of actions.\n\u2022 Pacing: After talking with our play testers, one of the most unique elements they highlighted was pacing. Most strategy card games are linear. You gather more resources, develop your engine and that creates momentum towards the victory. Arkon manages to have non-linear gameplay, while still making the win condition skill based through the multi-use cards. \n\u2022 Portable: With 52 cards and only one central deck, Arkon fits inside of a tuck box and can be played anywhere! \n \u2022 Stunning Art: Although there is a lot of visually beautiful games out there, we think Arkon delivers an incredibly high level of art for a small-box game, and we are really proud of that. We have top end artists and designers that have worked on games from Magic the Gathering to Game of Thrones TCG. \n\u2022 Replay Value:  One of the core focuses while building and testing Arkon was replayability. We play tested the game extensively, with over 200 external blind tests taking place at local gaming stores and meet-ups across California. If you look at reviews on BoardGameGeek from those who have played, we were blown away by the positive feedback! \n In Arkon players assume the role of a mysterious outsider who claims to be a fabled mystic from long ago. You enter the world of the Wildlands during a time of great unrest, where war and mistrust have sown deep divisions across the continent. As you wield your influence to amass support, you must choose\u2026.will you use that power to bring unity amongst the clans of the Wildlands... or will you seek domination....?\nRead more on the lore...\n                                             This tier is going to come with some pretty epic loot. First off, each backer will receive a custom etched wooden box with a deeply detailed engraving of the Wildlands world map on the lid. In addition, we will laser etch your name and backer # (or whatever phrase you prefer) on the inside.\nBelow are some shots from our early prototypes! These will continue to be refined as we play with modifications to the fine details to make this as crisp as possible in the final. THESE ARE NOT FINAL.\nOn top of that we will include a unique, brand new card in a speciality golden card border. This gold bordered card will ONLY be found at this tier (and is a Kickstarter Exclusive). The art will be done by Joshua Cairos, the artist responsible for many of our stunning compositions and a quickly rising star in the art world.\n You can find the full rules here: http://arkongame.com/how-to-play/\nOur FAQ on the game rules can be found here: http://arkongame.com/faq/\nB&W Print and Play: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12dGduaW0y529re0TVFKnhVeF4F-LOtK1/view \nThis product will be fulfilled from the EU and US and is EU friendly.\nUSA .......... $4 (For Standard Game and Double Up Tiers.

This kickstarter represents the culmination of 2 years of work on my gaming companies first product. Through ups and downs, managing of a 9 person team, and thousands of hours, we produced a tabletop game that I think is both beautiful and strategically deep. I was blessed to have the opportunity to work with my family and on something I believe in and for that I am immeasurably grateful.\nThis section is called, \u201cOur Story\u201d but really, I would love to tell you all about what I learned, why it matters and how that has shaped what we built.\nFirst, when you are working tirelessly on a project that is your baby, your interminable obsession, understand and respect that your team is not always going to be as obsessed as you. This is okay. These are people that are helping turn your vision into reality, and without them I would of never had the beautiful art, videography, cartography and graphic design that is in the game today.\nChoose something you care about. For me, gaming represents an amazing way to share a communal experience with people. In a game it doesn\u2019t matter your age, your religion, your race, your politics, your gender, your orientation or your income. It\u2019s about getting together over something common to all of us: a desire to have fun.\nSurround yourself with good people. This is easily the most important thing. Entrepreneurship is just flat out hard.\nListen to your playtesters. We playtested this game all across California and for well over a year. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it was harsh (especially at the beginning). Each time we recorded specific feedback on sheets and looked for trends and thus things we could improve. The best feeling in the world was going to our last dozen playtests and realizing that all our iterations and balancing had paid off with a game that was more interactive and more strategic.\nLearn that things will go wrong. Packages will get lost. The manufacturing will mis-cut prototypes. Your artists will ask for more money because you tell them to re-do something. Note that #1 this is inevitable and #2 when it comes to your team, take accountability. Your artist didn\u2019t screw up, you screwed up by not giving a detailed and nuanced enough description of what you wanted. Learn and grow from it.\nAll of these lessons went into shaping what Arkon is. I know you all have a lot of choices when it comes to games. I deeply appreciate you taking the time to look at Arkon, and I hope you will consider our game as an edition to your collection.\n If you are an retailer, with a verifiable brick and mortar presence, please contact us at admin@arkongame.com for bulk pricing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter and as such, there is always the possibility of delays.

From there, you'll win races, customize your bike, and earn fans, but at the same time, you'll have to work jobs, eat dinner, and pay rent. \nNothing's free, but everything has it's price.\nHunt bounties, deliver drugs, throw races - do anything you can to earn cash. \nExplore a pixel-art solar system inspired by Cowboy Bebop, Akira and Redline.\n\nCustomize your beloved bike with Guns, Amplifiers and tasteless bumper stickers.\n\nDine on a range of interplanetary cuisine with sweet buffs to help you win.\n\nMaster deep combat and racing mechanics and define your own style.\n\nRace, shoot, and get better!

It's your ticket off Earth and the key to a better life. You'll start small, hustling on the underground circuit, but always with an eye on the Solar Championship Cup.\nSide jobs - Sometimes, racing just won't be enough. Sometimes, you'll have to lie, cheat, and steal. Sometimes you'll have a pound of horse in the trunk when you get searched at the boarder. When that happens, you'll have to decide what kind of man you are.\nExplore the City - The hub cities of Mullahoe, New Olympia and Europa Uno are all havens for someone like you.

You might have to get your hands dirty, call in favors, or even throw a race or two, but I'm sure it'll all be worth it.\nCustomization - Need dat speed? How about bullets so big they fill half the screen with fiery death? Oh, I see, you're more into stripping back your bike to lessen your drag!

I'm Oscar, the creator of Desert Child. I like long walks on the beach and sharing banana milkshakes. \nFor the last year, I've been working on Desert Child alongside studying my Masters of Architecture. I've done all the graphics, programming, and the music. I've never felt more married to a game before; commited to every aspect being perfect.\nDesert Child was inspired by my favourite anime, Cowboy Bebop, Akira and Redline. I've never really seen a game that tries to capture the unique elements of these three. The world of Cowboy Bebop, the insane depiction of speed from Redline, and the... teen cool of Akira.\n\nThere's a tonne of games that influenced Desert Child, but I guess if I had to make a short list, I would say: Flashback, Driver, Vanquish, Luftrausers, FFVIII and Nier: Automata. (This list was really hard to make that short)\n\nOther things that really inspire me are the architecture of Shin Takamatsu, Italian futurism and 36 Chambers.\nSo making games is actually kinda pricey! Who knew? When I spent my meager savings showing Desert Child at Indiecade @ E3, I honestly wasn't expecting it to get the reception it did. The reaction from the community made me realise this game is something that needs to be developed into a larger experience.\n\nDesert Child needs time and talent to become the game I know it can be, and the support of the community will help it grow into something special. The initial funding goal will help to afford tools, music, licensing, and production costs. Further stretch goals will let us create the truly perfect, awesome, ideal, crunchy version of the game.\nIndiecade @ E3\n    Wallpaper Pack\nThis is a pack of 3 desktop wallpapers exclusive to kickstarter backers. 1920x1080 and made with love.\nName in credits\nYour full name (or whatever you call yourself) will appear in the game's credits. I do reserve the right to decline anything I find offensive or inappropriate, but I'm pretty filthy, so it's unlikely. \nDesertChild.exe (The Game)\nThe standard game will be sent out on release day. Planned platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. You will get both a DRM-free version and a Steam key. Everyone backing at $10 or more will get this.\n  Kickstarter Hoverbike Decal\nA Kickstarter-exclusive alternative hoverbike to play throught the story with. Let the world know you liked the game before it was cool.\nBeta Access\nYou will be invited to play and break the private beta of Desert Child. This will be in February 2018. The beta will remain playable until release of the full game.\nSoundtrack (Digital)\nThe game's soundtrack will be sent out around the time of the game's release.\nInstruction Booklet + Boxart (Digital)\nA digital version of the game's instruction manual. Features character bios, stories, secrets and hidden strategies. Also includes boxart that can be printed and assembled, or just admired on a wall.\nPrototypes + My developer notebooks\nYou will get copies of every early prototype that went into Desert Child, even the insanely hard version where your boost was a limited resource. You also get PDF copies of all my notebooks and sketches, where you can see all the different ideas that made it into the game, and all the brain farts that didn't.\nGet to name a Racer\nYou get to have your name/gamer tag/dog's name used as a name for one of the randomly generated opponents in the game. Your name/gamer tag/dog's name will show up at the start of any race that opponent is in, and may even show up in the Championship Ladder towards the end of the game.\nQuick disclaimer: Don't be too rude or I'll have to say 'sorry, I'm not doing that.' \nPersonalised Hoverbike Decal\nI will design a unique, personalised hoverbike decal for your use in the game. You'll get a special access key to activate it, which you can either keep to yourself, or share with the world. You will become a minor celebrity, and people will like you more.\nPhysical Instruction Booklet + Boxart\nA physical copy of the game's instruction manual. Features character bios, stories, secrets and hidden strategies. Also includes boxart that can be placed in a vacuum-sealed case and resold on ebay in 50 years to pay your mortgage.\nDesert Child Stickers\nRad stickers with art and characters from the game. These aren't just logos and things, these are stickers that you would actually have in the Desert Child universe. You're a fan of Pablo's Beer? There's a Pablo's sticker. Boom.\nHoverbike License + Arrest Warrant (Physical)\nYour very own, personalised Hoverbike License and Arrest Warrant. They'll both have your name and picture on them (either a photograph, or I can draw your portrait). You can even request what you're wanted for, or I can come up with some insane crime you were responsible for.\nPostcard from your great Aunt Thelma (Physical)\nA postcard with some cool, limited art on it. It will also have a nice, personalised message from your Great Aunt Thelma, who lives on a Rock Wallaby Ranch on Ganymede and has terrible hemorrhoids. Alternately, I could leave the postcard blank so you can use it yourself. Also, I might put on lipstick and kiss the card.\n Junior Co-Vice President Wingman of Design Execution & Logistics\nYou and I will Skype 3 times over the course of development and I'll run ideas by you, play you some new music, and let you in on story secrets. I'll take onboard your thoughts, explain my design process, and hopefully we can make the game even better. You'll be my wingman! Also, you'll be credited in the game's credits as \"Junior Co-Vice President Wingman of Design Execution & Logistics\" somewhere near the top.\nPersonal game jam with me\nIf you've ever wanted to make a game, this is the reward tier for you. A game jam is when people come together for 48 hours and make a game from scratch. I have TONNES of experience doing game jams, so if it sounds scary, don't worry, I've got your back. YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE EXPERIENCE MAKING GAMES TO DO A GAME JAM!\n\nSo, what kind of game do you want to make? Game jams are pretty short, but intensely creative. We won't be able to make the next Skyrim or GTA V in 48 hours, but we can definitely make a start. Some games that were originally game jams are SUPERHOT, Goat Simulator, Titan Souls, Gods Will Be Watching, Surgeon Simulator, Super Time Force Ultra, and Snake Pass.\n\nThese all had additional development, but their core idea and mechanics were created during a game jam. If you want to see some cool examples of game jam games, check these out: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/results Once we finish the game jam, the finished game is entirely yours to do whatever you want with. You might decide to polish it up and release it, or maybe you just want to put it up on Gamejolt or itch.io for people to play for free. It's up to you.\n\nQuick disclaimer: I'm not uptight. I like being offensive as much as the next person. However, if the game you want to make is racist, sexist, homophobic, or vilifies any person or group, I'll have to say 'sorry, I'm not making that.' Game jams are meant to be fun! Not negative :)\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of October 2017, the game has been in development for 16 months, with no major obstacles to it's release.

Funds will go to the necessary development tools and time needed.\nChallenge Mode [REACHED!]\nWe'll have some extra resources to put towards a unique challenge mode! Put your Flynn skills to the test in the arena with survival and boss rush trials!\nAnimated Intro\nWe'll be able to work with our pals over at Studio Yotta to create an animated intro for Flynn: Son of Crimson! It'll be pretty and juicy and whoa!\nRozia Story DLC\nAn alternate character in a DLC story played alongside Flynn's journey! We already have this story planned out, these funds would help it become a reality! All backers receiving the game will get the DLC at no charge.\n  Flynn: Son of Crimson is a 2D action adventure platformer with metroidvania elements. Set in a wondrous world with a looming darkness beginning to awaken yet again.\nWhat can you expect?\nExplore a wondrous world filled with discovery, taking place in unique regions designed with non-linear exploration.\nSwap between multiple weapons with quick and satisfying combat.\nDive in to a land with ancient mysteries and rich story.\nTravel across the lands, discovering new ways to roam and opening new paths using the power of crimson.\nDip in and out of an alternate dimension to make unique alterations to the real world.\nView a realm full of life, carefully formed with hand-crafted pixel art.\nTrade trinkets for new combat techniques and runes with an old war veteran.\nCall on your companion Dex in times of need, a mystical and loyal creature.\nTest your strength in the feared Rustwood coliseum among other challenging feats.\nTake on the role of Flynn, a young man orphaned as a child who sets out to chase the shadows of his beginnings whilst awakening the ancient power of Crimson within him. \nDiscover relics of ancient Rosantica, effigies and monuments to the goddess Sorrell that reveal hints at Flynn\u2019s beginnings and unlock new powers. Reveal secret pathways, trade with villagers, battle fierce monsters, hang out with dogs.\n    What about the Switch?\nWe've received a lot of requests for the Switch, we hear you! We'd love to launch on as many platforms as possible, but there is a problem. Flynn is being created in Gamemaker Studio 2, which is a great engine, but it currently does not support porting to the Switch. If we were to go for it now, Flynn would have to be recreated in an entirely new engine, which as you can imagine is a lot of work. Just know that Yoyo games is working hard on trying to make a Switch port possible! We can set up a later stretch goal for a Switch port, but until then we'll have to hope for the port to become available during Flynn's development! We'll keep everyone updated as Yoyo games and Nintendo work it out.\n  From the very first stages of development, we began designing Flynn: Son of Crimson with fast paced, satisfying combat. We\u2019re strong believers that \u2018game feel\u2019 should be priority in any video game so we've been injecting as much juice as we can to make sure every hit packs a punch and feels extra tasty.\nTrade gems and trinkets acquired throughout the game to learn new techniques for Flynn\u2019s arsenal, and you\u2019ll soon find that you can figure out your own favourite combination of attacks (Smash, bash, tickle, tickle, bosh!). Designed with quick and easy weapon swapping in mind, you\u2019re never more than a button press away from your desired weapon so you better dispatch your foes with flair, else you\u2019re not the cool hero everyone thought! \nThe Crimson Blade, a staple in Flynn's arsenal (and the default starting weapon, but that doesn\u2019t sound as appealing!) is the first weapon of Crimson energy gifted to Flynn by the Goddess Sorrell in a great time of need. Unlocking and mastering the uppercut will provide some serious hang time to any foe that is on the receiving end. Or why not slice through many baddies with the piercing dash? Piece of cake.\nThe Crimson Axe demands precise timing and enemy prediction, trading the quick cuts of the crimson blade for a weighty windup, this axe packs a punch sure to leave your enemies as a smear on the floor. Use the axe to crush your enemy's shields, and smash brittle walls to access new areas with brute force. It\u2019s a wonder how the young one can lift this, but as we wrote this we realized it is made of energy, whoops.\nThe Crimson Claws, a swift and energetic set of weapons used to stagger enemies with high attack speed and air superiority, if that\u2019s your sort of thing. Unleash your inner wildcat with unique wall climbing (go home, Knuckles) and a spiral drill attack (you too, Taz) to tear into enemies and dig through soft ground, these high mobility weapons will have you on your toes and keep your hands warm.\nWhat would our youthful hero be without a ranged weapon? That's right, a hero without a ranged weapon. So here's a bow, not any old bow, but a Super Awesome Crimson Bow\u2122 (nice). Acquired early on in the game, this will help you hurt/take out weaker foes from a distance. Use the bow to trigger traps and puzzles, and even augment with elemental arrows such as ice, electricity, and explosive (explosions are an element, right?). Once you've unlocked them, it's your choice which to roll out with, depending on your play style, whoa!\nSet in the world of Rosantica after the Great Conflict, a war that carried on for decades between parallel worlds, one of humanity, one of gods. The worlds once kept in peace by the Crimson Goddess Sorrell and Lord Zealock, now torn between each other.\nThe Great Conflict between overlapping worlds, caused by Sorrell\u2019s forbidden love of a mortal knight, Allistair. Falling for humanity's innocence and good nature, Sorrell leaves her world for another, sending Zealock into madness with her involvement with the \"frail humanity\".\nDecades of war have gone by between worlds, as things begin to look grim for the people of Rosantica. Realizing she can do no more to protect them from Zealock's growing rage, Sorrell initiates an ultimate sacrifice with her and her love, giving their lives to banish what has now become The Scourge. Locking Lord Zealock and his followers away to the malicious world they have created.\nBut don\u2019t live in the past, the world around you is brimming with exploration and discovery. Track down a mysterious stranger that appears to be following you as the barrier between worlds begins to crack, and investigate her ties to The Scourge and Zealock.\n  Roam the fantastic world both on foot and with your loyal companion Dex, a last gift from Sorrell and a guardian of Rosantica, helping both man and beast alike take back their homes. Will you follow Flynn on his journey through this war torn land?\n  Venture into the heart of evil itself, and tackle the horrors of The Scourge head-on. A once pristine land of gods, now an infested land filled with hatred. Track clues about your past and the Crimson power that grows within you leading to this nest of evil, and uncover what really lies at the heart.\nFlynn must hurry, with every passing day The Scourge\u2019s hold on Rosantica grows, slowly plunging the world into madness and decay with its noxious corruption. You must seek to end Zealock\u2019s reign of disease and lunacy before it\u2019s too late. \nTraveling between dimensions, Flynn controls the ability to tear open portals to The Scourge with the power of Crimson. Finding alternate paths and searching for trapped Rosanticans taken away from their homes. But be wary, The Scourge has many eyes in search of Flynn.\n    Journey through the vast island of Rosantica in search for answers to stop the land from falling victim to the corruption. The world is pieced together to transition seamlessly as you travel across the 5 unique regions.\nExplore the frigid Mistral Peak \u2013 a frozen over mountain once brimming with enterprise and discovery of its rich natural resources and fossils, now fallen victim to The Scourge\u2019s wretched influence in the form of a supernaturally dangerous blizzard. Discover what infernal power has summoned up this ferocious storm and help put a stop to it.\nWade through the once secluded and dazzling waters of The Hollow's Isles. A group of seaside caverns and alcoves that were once the pinnacle of natural beauty and serenity that have been ravaged by the relentless winds brought on by the blizzards of Mistral Peak above. Track your quest into the damp caves to battle off the mutated crustaceans that have forced out the indigenous Neptyn to flee their ancestral homes.\nLose yourself in the sprawling gardens of Rustwood. Home to the legendary proving grounds of the warrior tribe, the Mazir, and their Fighting Coliseum. The Mazir are a beetle-like people that are honor bound to prove themselves capable warriors by duking it out in this immense arena. Be warned, however, for The Scourge has seeped even into this land of once sacred trials. The swamps of Rustwood grow darker as each day goes by, causing hazardous poison storms to awaken.\nYour quest for knowledge will eventually lead you to the home of all scholarly pursuits, the famed Shivering Spire. What used to be the beacon of knowledge and symbol of Rosantica\u2019s prosperity, is now home to a portal of the netherworld, with its devout healers and once benevolent sorcerers now becoming vessels for The Scourge\u2019s evil magic to pour into the world of Rosantica. Flynn will be bombarded with acolytes that are now driven mad by their enhanced dark powers, as well as assaulted by powerful warlocks that once dared to challenge gods themselves.\nIn between journeys, Flynn will return to Sanctia. A stronghold where his most valued allies reside, banding together to help Flynn fight off the corruption. Here Flynn will barter rare Crimson Shards found throughout the world for new techniques and upgrades, as well as complete quests for the villagers.\nFlynn: Son of Crimson features crisp, hand-crafted pixel art that's designed to compliment its frenetic gameplay. Readability and strong visual tells are key components in our artistic process, as we realize how important it is for a game to be crystal-clear in its visual feedback to the player.  \nEach chunky pixel is deliberately and thoughtfully placed to create a memorable world for players to explore. Mischievous goblins, big-bellied fish men, blood-thirsty wolves, and more are brought to life with expressive animations brimming with personality.\nFrom concept art, to character sprites, and final polished animations - we aim to deliver a product we're truly proud of, and one that communicates to our players how much we truly care for the timeless and endearing craft of pixel-art!\n    From our composer, Jacob Lincke: Starting with a clean slate is always exciting and inspiring. \u201cFlynn: Son of Crimson\u201d needs satisfying music to accompany its already magical looking art style. I started looking at things I thought the game reminded me of; other games, movies and even places in the real world. I want the soundtrack to have its own unique voice, instantly connecting it to the game.\nI have a deep love for traditional folk music from all over the world which made me think of all sorts of fun instruments and what they could bring to the table. Flutes and keyed fiddles are combined with medieval lutes and finally mixed together with a grand orchestra making you feel less alone. All of this and a touch of retro synths to go along with the cute art style results in a collaboration between Scandinavian folk music and the Far East.\nI imagined Flynn wandering enchanting forests such as those found in Ghibli movies and traversing cold mountains of my homeland Sweden. I want the music to help Flynn telling his story, setting the atmosphere and be beautiful at the same time.\n    Always felt like you needed something Crimsony for your wall? Me too. Put this pretty 18\" by 24\" poster all over it and have your friends say, \"whoa\"! A beautiful illustration by Jaya Ply (@Nikingply).\nGet warm with this high quality t-shirt designed by miski! Printed on a 50/50 blend shirt for maximum comfort. We may or may not kiss each one before they ship. T-shirt sizing and possible color options will be provided after the campaign.\nDig your eyes intothe Official Flynn: Son of Crimson art book containing used and unused concept art, pixel art, level design sketches, fan art, a deeper look into the lore, and more! Size of the book to be decided later in development, based on our content. \nBecome one with the game with your spooky skeleton in the ground, and your likeness drawn in to your own gravestone to be placed in the Rustwood Graveyard. In other words, your face on a rock. \nDesign an NPC to fit in to the game! We'll contact you to work on your NPC's design, personality, dialogue (nothing naughty!), back story, and favorite things.\nGet your own custom room! You choose its location, style, what it's full of, maybe a bit of lore, maybe a bit of graffiti, maybe your face everywhere, I don't know. Put your own flair in to it!\nCombine every design tier before to create a sidequest! Include your secret room and your NPC in this quest to make Flynn fetch a bucket of water, or to do 50 pushups, whatever your heart desires!\nA story being told right from our hearts and fingers, Flynn is a young baby boy that has been on our minds over the last two years. As we write this, we are roughly one full year into development on Flynn: Son of Crimson from when we began putting this design all on paper.\nactual paper!\nSo far being funded completely by our own money, we feel we're now in a good place to introduce Flynn to Kickstarter. In order to continue to fulfill our dreams in making Flynn a real boy, we need your support! We're very confident in the head start we have on the basics in design and development, with a lot of the core features already built and working. A large portion will be going to the art, allowing us to give our artists more consistent hours and maybe even hire extra help. Additionally, the sound is very important to us, so that will be a big investment as well.\nIs this your first game? \nFirst bigger scale game, yes. We have 2 other games we released in the wild on mobile though, which can be found here:  \nSamurai Blitz\nRaccoon Rascals\nWe also have a couple projects we have worked on in the past that didn\u2019t quite make the cut (we all have them), but we see them as more of a learning process and who knows, we may come back to them in 50 years time.\nSpecial Thanks\nAndrew Filip - Web design/development, help with the trailer.\nJohan Aronson - Being part of Flynn's original birth long ago, and the title screen.\nmiski - Being the greatest for designing the t-shirt last minute with us.\n           This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges for a project like this.

In this cutesy dystopian world everyone is born with a hat that hosts their soul, and can only die if their hat gets crushed. Your hat can be used as a weapon BUT BE CAREFUL because its also your weakness. Jump around, whip your hat at your friends, crush theirs, and become the King of the Hat!\nGenre: Couch Multiplayer / Platformer / Fighting\nNumber of players: 2 - 4 players\nPlatforms: Steam (PC & Mac)\nEarly Access Release: 2017 \nKing of the Hat is a local-multiplayer game, where instead of jumping on people's heads you have to jump on their hats. The thing is, you can throw your hat!\nYou can throw your hat to ...\nAvoid enemies who are about to jump on your head\nKnock another player away and knock his hat towards you\nLeave it as bait for your opponent\nDistract your opponents while you go and crush their hat\nBlock an incoming hat throw\nAll these options lead to lots of different styles of matches!\nOnce upon a time in a far away land, there was a beautiful castle in a place called Hatlandia. Here, you were born with a sacred Hat, and if it ever got killed, the wearer would die. In Hatlandia, the Hatfolk lived peacefully. Occasionally a donkey would step on someones hat, twisting them out of existence forever. For the most part though, it was a pretty idyllic life \u2026\nHowever, Hatlandia was located right next to an even older city called Business Corp. And when the Fatcats over in Business Corp. heard about these Hatlandian festivities, they decided to check them out.\nThey showed up stinking of milk and catnip, and had such a time at the Hat Parade that they came back and killed the King. They captured the kingdom, bulldozed the Hatlandian Hills, and paved some parking lots.\nThe whole thing was actually in really bad taste, in this narrators humble opinion.\nNow, they\u2019ve built an arena and broadcast a show called King of the Hat, where the remaining Hatlandians have to fight each other for the entertainment of a live studio audience.\nWe're in the process of writing the OST, and designing the sound effects. We've picked a jazz big-band mood for the level music, and we're thinking about punchy-sounding-hit effects for hat collisions.

Identity, relationship, and backstory cards help feed players' imagination as they argue against one another and try to convince the estate keeper that they\u2019re the most worthy of the prize. \nThe estate keeper sets the stage by establishing who has died, how they passed away, and what they left behind. Using a starting hand of one identity card, one relationship card, and two backstory cards, all the other players build the base for their character, which they must maintain and develop over the course of four comically legal-themed rounds of play.\n The four rounds are:  \nOpening Statements - wherein players introduce their characters, using all four of their cards, and state their claim to the fortune for the consideration of the estate keeper. \nInterrogation Round - wherein the estate keeper asks each player an individual question (at least loosely) based on what\u2019s been said thus far. Players all must incorporate a new backstory card into their response. \nRecess Round - wherein players break for lunch and get to informally ask one other player - estate keeper included! - an individual question. No new backstory cards are drawn. \nFinal Statements - wherein players draw one last backstory card and make their last effort to convince the estate keeper that they should get the fortune.\nAt any point during the game, the estate keeper can reward another player an objection card, which can be played at any time to intervene or interrupt another players\u2019 speaking turn by saying \u201cObjection!\u201d and reading the sentence written on the card. That statement immediately becomes true about the person it\u2019s played on and they must incorporate it into their story.\nFor the full rules, visit our website or watch our How to Play video!\nWant to see it in action? Check out this play-through video we shot with our friends:\n\"Someone Has Died is a beautifully clean tabletop game that uses whimsical art and hilariously weird elements to promote creative storytelling and fun character building.\" - IndieHangover\nOver the course of developing and playtesting Someone Has Died, we\u2019ve had the same experience over and over again: people who have never improvised before or who usually shy away from character roleplay are able to jump into the game in a way that surprises even them! Our strange, specific cards and the confined scenario of an arbitration seems to give modest players enough guidelines to weave together a story and unleash their imagination. As they say, \u201crestriction breeds creativity!\u201d\n\"Wildly fun! Get ready to unleash your imagination!\" - BoardGamingFTW\nWe\u2019ve combined the accessibility and quirk of a social, party game with the emphasis on story and character exploration that we love in games such as Fiasco, Fate, and Dungeons and Dragons. Without the long-term commitment, increasingly sided-dies, or rigid rulebook, Someone Has Died welcomes newcomers while also embracing the depth and intensity of expert roleplayers.\n\"Someone Has Died lured me into actually thinking I would be able to play a role I make up as I go along in a game.\" - Heather Arbiter, real person\nIn addition, we\u2019ve melded the roles of game master and judge into the character of the estate keeper. The estate keeper, who remains consistent over four rounds of play, leads the others through the arbitration process. They also get to reward players for good storytelling by handing out objection cards that allow players to modify each other\u2019s stories, giving the estate keeper a more engaged and active role as opposed to the rapid-fire experience of other comparable party games.\nSomeone Has Died was originally born as a college assignment to create a social game. While brainstorming, we got stuck on games like Werewolf and Mafia, where people are constantly dying. One of us suggested that we should start with the dead guy and the setting of a will arbitration shortly followed. The juxtaposition of this cold and arduous legal process being presented as a comedic party game really made us laugh, especially as we began to develop increasingly bizarre cards, such as \u201cRobot with Feelings\u201d and \u201cTwo Rabbits Who You Thought Were Both Boys But Definitely Weren\u2019t.\u201d Our classroom presentation was met with smiles and riotous laughter, so we jumped on the chance to bring our little \u201cengine for fun\u201d (as our professor called it) into the real world. The goal quickly became creating an experience that forgoes objective win conditions and instead rewards improvisation, creativity, and leaning into one\u2019s character.    \nIn May 2016, Adi graduated and began bringing the game to NYU Game Center and Playcrafting exhibitions for playtesting, taking rigorous notes and bringing them back to Ellie for tweaking over Skype sessions. Come December, Adi invited Liz to join the team to have more hands and brains helping out in the city. Almost a year after its inception, in March 2017, Someone Has Died was invited to make its convention debut at PAX East with Indie Megabooth alongside a host of incredible independent board and video games.\nAfter several rounds of testing, iterating, and tweaking, we\u2019ve ended up with a game that we're proud of and that we're dying (hah) to bring into the world. We\u2019ve gotten really encouraging feedback and, as the creators, get such a kick out of seeing the limitless combinations of cards and the new perspectives players from all over the world bring to the game.  \nFrom left to right: Adi Slepack (Co-Creator & Lead Designer), Liz Roche (Game Dev Assistant), Ellie Black (Co-creator, Game Designer, and Concept Artist), and amazing volunteer Lucy at PAXEast!\nGather Round Games is made up of Adi Slepack, Ellie Black, and Liz Roche, all of whom are alumni of Wesleyan University. Adi and Ellie met in Wesleyan\u2019s first-ever video game course, \u201cVideo Games and/as The Moving Image\" and then accidentally became legitimate game designers. Liz and Adi have been friends and occasionally roommates since their freshman year of college. They spend too much time together and are practically one being. All of us have contributed to the game design of Someone Has Died. Ellie is our concept artist, having done most of the sketches for the artwork featured in the game. Adi then takes her etchings and renders them digitally in Photoshop. \nWe\u2019re looking for funding to manufacture a first printing of Someone Has Died, which will allow us not only to fulfill the demand of the Kickstarter, but also to have copies to take to conventions, sell through local retailers, and send to press for review. \nHere is the cost distribution for our base build\nSome Special Thanks...\nThis game and this campaign would not exist without the help of many friends and mentors. To Gil Hova, Pat Brennan, and Anya Combs, thank you for the countless emails, pep talks, and very much solicited advice.\nTo our professor, Jason Haas who lead us over the threshold to becoming game designers and encouraged us to continue working on our \"engine for fun\" even once the assignment had ended.\nTo our friends who have been playtesting since last summer, thank you for your feedback and your support as we've allowed Someone Has Died to consume our lives. Special shout out to Hayley Setear, Jack Spira, Sarah McCully, Pat Brennan, Ari David, Sandra Berdick, Hannah Rimm, Deanna Ibrahim, and Lilly Holman for playing with us so often that most of you appear in our promotional and how to play videos. Also to Pat Baer and Ryan Houlihan, both of whom we met at playtesting events and have become great friends and champions of Someone Has Died ever since.\nFinally, to Keren Slepack, Justin Wooster, and Arleigh Wasserman for wearing really stupid costumes in our campaign video.

Thank you so much everyone for your support! We still have stretch goals we're hoping to reach, so let's keep it up!\nWelcome to Robottery 101, a card game about building giant robots at space college to dazzle your anime professors at the annual Robot Science Fair!   \nThis game has been a passion project for us for almost a year now, starting when we all met in college. We've playtested the game with more than a hundred people, traveled to hobby stores to demo it, and spent countless midnights together tweaking the design and art. We love this game, and we\u2019d love to share it with you.\nMichelle, our lead, has dreamed of being a game director for a long time, so she's incredibly excited (and a teensy bit nervous) at the prospect of Kickstarting this game she's poured so much time, effort, and unwavering excitement into.\nSo, we're very excited to present to you our finished product!\n    Features:\nYou really build a robot! Tactile construction with unique cards allows for customization and lets you give your robot some personality. \n30 unique limb cards allow for endless combinations of colors and pieces on your robot!\n15 unique professors create a game filled with colorful, exciting art! With over 50 combinations of professor cards (plus even MORE if 3 people back $150!)\nIn-game economy and diplomacy creates a unique social dynamic!\nAs college students ourselves, we know the stress of deadlines - but when you\u2019re surrounded with friends, bits, bolts, and screwdrivers (and when those deadlines involve building giant, shiny robots), something magical happens, and you get to experience the joy of building something you're proud of.\nWhen designing Robottery 101, we aimed to promote collaboration in a competitive game through the joy of creativity and progress. Seeing your hard work evolve over the course of a semester is deeply rewarding!\nFantastic for both kids and adults, Robottery 101 emphasizes the values of building and bonding, bringing players together in an experience that\u2019ll leave a smile on your face while you admire your colorful robot creations. So get your toolbox ready, spin up your power drill, and get ready for an upbeat robot science fair where you can appreciate robots for robots\u2019 sake!\n Want to watch a full playthrough? Check out our video here!\nReviews:\n  Click the image to see the review!\n  It's the year 4000.... The sounds of whirring drills, buzzing saws, and massive metal footsteps fill the student workshop. That can mean only one thing: it's time for the Giant Robot Science Fair!\nIn this high-energy set-collection card game, collect robot pieces from across the galaxy, collaborate with your peers, and scheme against your rivals to create the coolest robot you can for the University of Robottery's annual science fair!\nFor a full PDF of the Robottery 101 rules, click here!\nFour players are engineering students at the University of Robottery who build giant robots for the annual Robot Science Fair. Whichever student builds the most impressive robot wins the game. Each turn you will travel to planets across the galaxy to collect parts you want for your robot, represented by Limb cards. \nLimb cards have two qualities - color and body part. They connect together to form complete robot limbs. You attach robot parts to your core in an anatomically correct way - example, you need an upper arm already on your robot to place a lower arm on as well. If you cannot attach a part to your robot, it goes in your inventory. There are also head cards that add additional point values to your robot.\nLimb cards connect to make a full arm!\nProfessors will want to see certain combinations of limb cards for the professor to favor your robot. Each professor has a certain number of gears indicating how many points they are worth. \nEvery two turns, your class convenes for a Study Session, during which you can trade any parts you have collected with the other three players. During this time, you may attempt to steal parts from other robots through a sabotage. To attempt this, role an eight sided die to see if your professors catch you cheating - sabotage gets increasingly harder as the semester progresses and due date approaches. If you succeed, you replace a part on their robot with the same kind of part from your robot or inventory. \nThe game ends after eight turns, and the professors judge whatever robot you have built over the semester.\n    If you'd like an additional copy of Robottery 101, add $22 to your pledge and we'll include it in your rewards!! Message us for how many copies you intended to receive with your pledge.\nOur stretch goals are meant to improve the print quality of the game for all backers as well as provide some digital rewards to everyone who has supported the project.\nReach the first two goals to unlock the third!\n  We consider your support of us and our game a quid pro quo arrangement, so we have tried to make every dollar you pledge as cost effective as possible! 91% of every contribution goes toward direct game costs.\nHere is exactly where the money goes:  \nWe set our Kickstarter goal at $3000 so we could print and ship at least 101 copies of Robottery 101. We\u2019ve partnered with The Game Crafter to manufacture the game and manage reward fulfillment to help us accomplish this. Above all, we want the game in as many hands as possible, and any dollar over goes directly to producing more and better quality copies!\nWe're really excited that we get to ship our game to customers around the world! Since our manufacturer is based out of Wisconsin, shipping costs will be different for backers outside of the United States than those inside.\nRobottery 101 started as Michelle\u2019s personal project \u201cSpace Junk,\u201d a cooperative puzzle board game where two aliens use space junk and salvaged blueprints to construct a giant mech. When Will played the game, he was filled with childlike excitement at how cool it felt to build a robot. Michelle and Will partnered up to make a game that aims to produce that same excitement, and they asked Rachel to add her skills of photography and web design. Since then, generating wonder, excitement, and joy is at the forefront of our design. More than anything, the three of us are hoping to make great games that inspire people\u2019s passion and excitement.   \nAs a team, we\u2019ve spent many weekends wearing professor lab coats and getting pumped to Gurren Lagann music to give us strength during crunchtime. After countless late nights in our college\u2019s game design building with bowls of ramen and passion in our hearts, we are very happy with our results. We hope you feel the same joy building these robots as we do!\nThank you to everyone who made this development possible - our professors, our friends, and our gracious playtesters. It takes a village to make a board game, and we couldn't have done it without you!\nAnd most importantly, thank you for checking out our game! It's been a crazy development process, and we are really proud of the end result. We're really excited for you all to play Robottery 101, and we hope you guys are as excited to build giant robots as we are to see what you build! \nClick the banner to go to our website!\n  Got any questions?

So be prepared to improve your sword skills and become a master.\nChakra/Jutsu: Chakra is the energy of life, created from all livings things. Several forms of Chakra exist that affects the nature of the individual. By harnessing this energy special, powerful techniques can derived, known as Jutsus.

However, after months of development and careful planning the project has rapidly evolved, featuring an incredibly extended world, an exciting story, and expanded gameplay features.\nFurthermore, this project makes use of high definition 2D art which is one of the most expensive forms of art. To produce a high quality visual result like that requires a lot of work, patience and time. Our general scope for the future is to establish Artcle Studio as a full game company, which means that we will have to deal with different forms of costs, like operational, licensing, and living costs.\nTaking the above points under consideration, this game will require the help of the community in order to be able to reach its final form within a proper deadline.

Tatakae! Ouendan, Elite Beat Agents and Gitaroo Man.\n  Our grand hip hop saga takes place in an alternate history, circa 16th Century Japan. All is not well. The world is becoming a hostile place as people object to the growing diversification of their homelands. Citizens and neighbours are becoming increasingly suspicious of, and isolated from, one another.  \nA toxic atmosphere of protectionism is taking hold.\nAt the height of this culture of fear, an Earth-shattering calamity befalls the world. As the universe trembles from the aftershocks and the survivors try to rebuild what's left of their lives, one rabbit embarks on a journey for truth, justice and liberty - and steps forward to do battle with the land's most powerful overlords.\nMeet the hero of our story: Toto-Maru\nThe hero in question is Toto-Maru, a simple farm boy who's able to harness the special power of force through rap. (Wait, where have we heard this before...?) Only by embracing the strength of music and by using the magic of rhythm and rhyme to counter corruption and small-mindedness can our reluctant hero and his trusty sidekick, Otama-Maru, finally heal the destructive rifts, bring about global unification and restore peace! \nThis handsome fella is Toto-Maru's sidekick: Otama-Maru\n  With a combined 54 years of development shared between studios NanaOn-Sha and iNiS J, we\u2019ve had plenty of time to master the art of rhythm-action. And it\u2019s all been building to this: Project Rap Rabbit\u2019s unique rapping gameplay represents the culmination of our experience across the genre\u2019s biggest and best hits, and a true evolution of rhythm-action mechanics. \nThe key to battle rap is the ability to defeat your opponent with lyrical jabs and rhyming uppercuts, which is why Project Rap Rabbit ensures YOU are in control of the raps. Songs aren't just a series of linear lines to tap through, but full dialogue trees of variable verses filled with creative put-downs, bragging and clever rhymes.\nProject Rap Rabbit's visuals are shaped by Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan and Elite Beat Agents lead artist Atsushi Saito\nHere at both NanaOn-Sha and iNiS J, we have a long-held belief that rhythm-action should be about so much more than simply attaining perfection and mastering button presses to reach an S Rank climax. We want to encourage experimentation, not punish deviations from a critical path. To that end, we have designed a flexible and dynamic bonus system to reward self-expression.\nRap battles pit Toto-Maru up against leaders of rival factions. Both Toto-Maru and his opponent possess Swag Gauges, and the victor of a rap battle is determined by these bars.\nHow does a rhythm-action game featuring branching songs work exactly? Well, each song in Project Rap Rabbit is made up of multiple Call and Response gameplay segments, which can all be broken down into three simple steps.\n1) Listen\nWhen your opponent is attacking you, you shouldn't just stand there and take it! Important phrases in your foe's lyrics will be highlighted in the Word Pick Up phase: Now's your chance to pick out certain keywords you want to try and focus on when it's time to strike back.\n2) Respond\nHow do you want to respond to your opponent's insults? It's up to you! Project Rap Rabbit features an emotion wheel inspired by the likes of Mass Effect and Fallout 4. Do you want to hit back with a boast, with a joke, by dismissing the attack or by coercing your opponent?  \nSelect the emotion you wish to unleash to preview the upcoming rhythm and your foe's reaction: There's no wrong choice, but different emotions will inflict different levels of damage to your adversary's Swag Gauge.\n3) Rap\nNow it's time to unleash those lines! Depending on your chosen emotion you'll spit different lyrics and unique rhythms. Press the specified face buttons at the correct time to enunciate every word perfectly, boosting your own Swag Gauge in the process.\nIf your Swag Gauge hits zero it's the end of the battle and your failure will go down in legend. Keeping your bar topped up is the key to successfully besting each level, while depleting your foe's meter will increase your overall level score. \nRunning low on Swag?\nDon't panic! The status of your opponent, determined by the level of his or her Swag Gauge, can help you out. Every foe reacts to each emotion differently, and while it's possible to beat each song using every single permutation of lyrics, picking the more powerful emotional response to any given state will result in better boosts to your own Swag Gauge during the Rap section.\n  Beyond the music itself, rhythm-action games are also about happiness, experience and love. These are the foundations on which we built our earliest titles. We want to bring strong narratives and a tangible sense of adventure back to rhythm-action gaming, and to deliver a title with unrivaled feeling and soul.\nHowever, we also know that many fast-fingered gamers love to be challenged, which is why we've designed gameplay systems far deeper than those of any other rhythm-action title in our history.\nThough the basic objective of every stage is to emerge from the rap battle victorious, competitive leaderboards challenge you to discover the most creative paths through each branching song and deliver the best rap you possibly can. Perfect beat-matching will net you good scores, of course, but that's just the start if you want to mount a serious assault on your friends' performances... \nTo ensure that all gamers with all kinds of setups can enjoy Project Rap Rabbit to its fullest, there will be a calibration mode\nBonuses\nSimple bonuses involve zeroing in on the most powerful keywords during the Listen phase and successfully hitting those syllables (denoted with special symbols on the lyrics bar, as shown above for 'To Rhyme') with full force during the Rap segments. But bonuses come in all shapes, sizes and complexities.\nSome involve rapid selections during the Respond phase to get a jump-start on your lines, while others demand high-level players successfully and seamlessly knit together lyrics from different responses by tweaking the emotion during the Rap phase itself - an expert feat that isn't for the faint-hearted!\nToto-Maru's status\nMirroring his opponent's behaviour, Toto-Maru's own status is dictated by his Swag Gauge. When the Swag Gauge drops below 50% health Toto-Maru falls into the Back Against The Wall state, during which certain lyrics will deal even more damage to his opponent's Swag.  \nWith large damage multipliers at their fingertips, along with some additional Back Against The Wall bonuses up for grabs depending on the length of time spent in that state, truly brave rappers will be able to carefully shape their responses to spend entire battles on the cusp of failure in order to deal huge levels of damage and gain the most points.\nFor Project Rap Rabbit, we wanted to draw on the culture and traditional artwork of Japan while infusing it with some of the biggest influences which have touched our lives. The result? A mesmerizing collision of Japanese history, rap and hip hop culture. \nThese two things couldn't be geographically further apart in origin, but together they demonstrate that bringing together diverse cultures from two different times can not only work, but create something remarkable. The result is a truly memorable and singularly stylish experience that everyone can enjoy.\nThe famous 16th century Japanese picture scroll 'Scrolls of Frolicking Animals', Uesugi Bon's Rakuchu Rakugai Zu, the works of Akira Yamaguchi and Ikeda Manabu, and films such as Spirited Away, Tekkonkinkreet and Kung Fu Panda were all major influences in our early concepts.\n20 years after masterminding the music behind PlayStation classic PaRappa The Rapper, Masaya Matsuura will also be serving as the music director for Project Rap Rabbit in addition to creative lead duties. As one of the core composers for the rap battles, Matsuura-san is looking to create a synthesis of Japanese and Western styles that's elevated above and beyond anything you've heard before.  \nWhile some of our past titles have focused on rap and hip hop, we haven't yet tackled the back-and-forth dueling of rap battles. One of our major drawing points in our early days of development has been Epic Rap Battles Of History - the blend of beat, crazy encounters and comedy put-downs is a great example of the different musical encounters you'll be playing in Project Rap Rabbit.\nProject Rap Rabbit's battles are epic clashes filled with action and humour\n  How did two of the biggest names in the business come to form the ultimate rhythm-action dream team? Masaya Matsuura and Keiichi Yano have known each other for almost 20 years, and formed a friendship based around their shared love of story-based music and rhythm game creation - an area many game developers have never experienced.\nThis is the first time long-term friends Matsuura-san and Yano-san have collaborated on a project\nAt various game events over the years, Matsuura-san and Yano-san have come together to discuss what shape the next generation of music games would form. More recently, they began exploring the concept of a 'rhythm-action 2.0' project, capable of pushing the genre into areas never before conceived. Rather than revisiting an existing series and either re-appropriating known and loved game systems or breaking them to retrofit more progressive gameplay ideas, a new IP felt like the natural opportunity to explore innovative input mechanics while simultaneously celebrating and paying homage to the past.\n      Deeper into the campaign we'll be asking our community to tell us what Stretch Goals are most important to them. All future Stretch Goals will be ordered according to community surveys.\nUntil then, be sure to comment or reach out to us via the social media links below to tell us what you want to see next from Project Rap Rabbit, whether it's an Xbox One version, more levels, multiplayer modes or extra difficulty settings.\nPlease help us grow our community!

As a result, it would be foolish of us to claim that there is zero potential for delays to the launch window.\n\nHowever, we have gone to great lengths in our planning and early work to minimize this risk. Between the shared experience of developers NanaOn-Sha and iNiS J, and publisher PQube\u2019s platform holder relationships and merchandise production know-how, we\u2019re confident that all the pieces are in place to ship Project Rap Rabbit, along with all physical backer rewards, by August 2018. \n\nHaving seen other projects suffer lengthy delays or fall short of certain goals during development, we\u2019ve worked tremendously hard to ensure that Project Rap Rabbit doesn\u2019t disappoint.

You will fight and slay creatures, each one bigger and more fearsome than the last.\nChain encounters at the right pace and you will unlock the Martyr\u2019s Excommunication mode, becoming almost unstoppable.\nEpic boss battles await you in your journey through the lands of Orthodoxia. If you manage to survive its inhabitants, your skills will be challenged by the enormous and fierce creatures that rule this damned universe.\n  Explore a huge land, a universe that feels as open as it is oppressive, delivered through a non-sequential level design that puts you in control of where to go next.\nWe are putting great focus on achieving a very satisfying combat mechanics with very responsive control, smooth animations and lots of blood and gore.\nHandmade pixel art, with large sprites and super smooth animations, created pixel by pixel, frame by frame.\nEvocative narrative: Blasphemous\u2019 levels are not just platforms; they tell a story to those who are interested, but don't get in the way if you just want the action.\nFind your personal combat style by equipping rosary beads, or carrying around relics that boost your abilities.\n  Inventory and player progression\n      We\u2019re proud to announce that we have teamed up with a very experienced development partner to be able to release the game simultaneously on all these platforms!\nSet in the savage land of Orthodoxia, a place where religion is of the utmost importance in the eyes of the populace, superstition runs amok, and churches outnumber people two to one. You will find yourself in this hellish territory in the wake of the Age of Corruption.\n...The High Pontiff was entirely transformed into a great, withered and barren tree and burned for ninety days and ninety nights...\n...Riddled with frustration at their insufficient devotion, The High Pontiff heaved his golden throne with and turned the entire throne back. Years passed and all of a sudden it appeared something was beginning to change in the state of the High Pontiff. Dried out, dying branches began to emerge from the ends of his fingers and slowly started growing out from all over his pallid, immobile body. The High Pontiff was transformed into a great, withered and barren tree and began to burn for ninety days and ninety nights...\n...A huge mountain of ash stood in its place, topped by the infamous turned throne, unoccupied and unguarded...\n...Once the tree had been entirely consumed by the flames, a huge mountain of ash stood in its place, topped by the infamous turned throne, unoccupied and unguarded. The remaining church leadership scrambled upwards to reach the top and assume the throne. But the mountain begin to shift beneath their feet and before long the mountain of ash had swallowed up each and every soul who had been present in the Cathedral. From the ashes rose those poor unfortunate souls who had been swallowed up, transformed into horrible, deformed and bloodthirsty beasts, wildly aggressive and violent in nature, but with their faith intact...  \n  In Blasphemous, you will play as The Penitent One, a rogue nomad tackling the evil of this world alone with only its trusty sword by their side.\nThe Penitent One is the last survivor of a congregation called The Silent Sorrow. The whole group was punished to be thrown to the great Abyss of the Eternal Grief.\nHere you will see some of the horrific and inhuman enemies our pixel artists came up with over the last few months.

If you play Blasphemous, chances are that you may want to visit the city of Seville (Spain) in the future, to see the locations, traditions and culture that inspired the game.\nSkyline of the city of Seville (Spain)\n  We are lucky to have Carlos Viola\u2019s mastery on board. He's the award-winning composer of 'The Last Door', and other remarkable indie titles like 'Pharaonic' (by Milkstone), 'Six sides of the world' and 'Rotor'scope'.\nThis time around, he will be directing the work on both the Original Soundtrack and the audio design.\nListen to the first theme of the soundtrack:\nIf you don\u2019t know the works of Carlos Viola, we recommend you start by checking out his amazing work for \u2018The Last Door\u2019, available on Spotify.\n  We\u2019re a tiny development studio that focuses on creating meaningful playable experiences. We proudly specialize in delivering great games, despite operating with scarce resources. Maybe, you've heard about our previous work, a playable homage to classic horror writers (Lovecraft, Poe, & Machen):\n'The Last Door' is an award winning point and click horror adventure. It\u2019s a series of 8 playable episodes, developed using crowdfunding between 2013 and 2016. Initially, they were launched for browsers, but now you can enjoy them in their Collector\u2019s Editions for PC, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.\nOur previous title, \u2018The Last Door\u2019, was developed together with its community, with frequent discussion, beta builds, and incorporating community feedback in every possible way. For \u2018Blasphemous\u2019 we want to take this concept even further.\nWe offer our backers several levels of involvement with the project\u2019s development:\nThe Penitent (20 $) an up: We love transparency! Any pledge that includes the game will give you access to frequent development updates.\nThe Follower (25 $) and up: This pledge will grant access to a private development forum, where you will be frequently asked for feedback, participate in polls and help us with decision-making, plus access to the game's beta.\nThe Disciple (40 $), The Immortal (200 $) and up: you\u2019ll get access to our private channels on Slack/Discord, where all the design discussions will take place, one-on-one conversation with the development team, enjoy monthly (unfinished) builds and all future prototypes of the game.\n      The work on Blasphemous started in November 2016. The first stages involved the creation of the first bunch of concept art, to explore the artistic themes we wanted the game to feature. We\u2019ve been working non-stop since then, and indeed completed some key milestones along the way.\nWe are now preparing to switch from pre-production to production, and that\u2019s when we need you on board!\nWe\u2019re currently prototyping the second layer of gameplay, involving narrative and exploration mechanics. We're in the process of measuring the production scope and testing every required production pipeline. After that, we will confidently enter the production stage!\nFrom there, we have laid out a roadmap of frequent milestones (please note these dates are subject to change, although we are confident in our production dates):\nJune. 2017 - Aesthetics prototype (If the campaign succeeds, available for all backers, for Win/Mac/Linux!)\nSep. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Narrative prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nNov. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Player\u2019s progression prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ2, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Alpha (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ3, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Beta (The Follower pledge or above required).\nQ1, 2019 - All Platforms Global launch.\n                      So far, this project has been completely fueled by our own money. Bringing the game to Kickstarter now will enable us to get the extra funds we need to fully realize our artistic goals while retaining full creative control. For us, and particularly for Blasphemous, this is critical because of the potentially controversial topics we are featuring in the game.\nAt the same time, it creates a community around the game we can rely on to make the game truly awesome! While creating our previous game \u2018The Last Door\u2019, we experimented with opening the development process to the community. It was not only the most amazing experience, but it also helped the game become really extraordinary, reaching quality standards that we never hoped to achieve on our own, thanks to the collective intelligence.\nLet's make another game together!\nEngage the developers in our DISCORD server\nFollow us on Twitter:\n@BlasphemousGame\nFollow us on Fadebook:\nFacebook.com/BlasphemousGame\nOfficial website\nPresskit()\n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you are about to embark on any project there will always be a certain amount of trepidation.

However, we are experienced developers, having successfully steered a three-year development project right before this one, so we feel confident we will know how to manage the unexpected.\n\nSome of the areas of expertise required for this project are beyond our skill set, particularly the ones related to porting the game to consoles, and the ones related to marketing. We will seek strategic partners to go where we cannot go on our own. \n\nFinally it\u2019s worth mentioning that due to the controversial and mature nature of some of the themes and visuals, we may have to prepare ourselves to fight a couple of battles against censorship, political correctness or etiquette here and there, but we\u2019re confident that if we have the support of you backers, we will be able to manage it in a way that it is satisfactory to most parties.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Thankful", "descp": "Not sure if you'd want the game, but you still want to give a hand to the developers, be kept in the loop and receive the backer-exclusive campaign updates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "The Penitent - EARLY BIRD", "descp": "Be among the first backers to receive a 33% discount on The Penitent reward tier!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["499 backers", "Limited (1 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "The Penitent", "descp": "Get 'Blasphemous' the game when it's done!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["2,146 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Follower", "descp": "Get the soundtrack, access to the Beta and have a significant impact in the game's final form by participating in development discussions and polls.

Treat your ears below...\n             Spend your days adventuring, farming the land while raising your family, or even running your own tavern, apothecary, blacksmiths or goods store. \nEvery person and domestic animal you meet remembers what you do, or fail to do.  \nYou can step off The Path into the darker areas of Quill and encounter faery tale monsters and enticing mysteries. \nThe seasons will pass and living things will grow old and die. Faces from the past are replaced by the fresh young faces of new life.  \nAnd when you die of old age yourself, you will pass your family tree's Kynseed on to your children so that they may continue your bloodline and shape their own legacy. \nChoose male or female and get to know the inhabitants of the land and be involved in friendships, romance, marriage and putting your family to work on the cheap.\nKynseed is a 2D sandbox adventure from veterans of Lionhead Studios\u2019 Fable series. Drawing from years of experience crafting the iconic Fable titles, we aim to deliver an all-new quirky RPG filled to the brim with mystery, exploration, awful puns, and sandbox possibilities.    \nWhile invoking the spirit of past Fable games, Kynseed is infused with our own ideas and a mix of British folklore, ancient legend, and rustic traditions. We hope to capture these inspirations in an atmospheric world with whimsy, humour, and eccentricity, and not a single orc or high elf in sight.  \nYou have grown up in your parent's idyllic farm in The Vale, a peaceful valley in the faery tale land of Quill. In time, you meet the mysterious Mr Fairweather, who offers you a mystical acorn called the Kynseed. Once planted, it will grow a magical family tree. \nBut such a gift does not come without a price.  \nWill your name be carved on the walls of history or scrawled on the walls of the pub outhouse?\n   An Aging World\nThe land is affected by your choices and deeds. Seasons come and go and affect the world both visually and in gameplay.\nLiving Things Have Memory and Grow Old\nIndividuals and animals grow old and eventually die. Families remember your good deeds or wrongdoings for generations.\nUnique Life Mechanic\nPay the mysterious Mr Fairweather for powerful upgrades and revivals, at the cost of years from your life! Will you miss out on your child's development to buy that music box that makes dragons dance? Will your business suffer because you bought a pet cat that turns people to stone?\nReal-time Combat\nWander from The Path and indulge in meaty combat against various nasty faery tale creatures that guard the materials and loot you need to become the greatest in the land.\nMeaningful Relationship System\nBuild friendship into romance and produce heirs to continue your legacy. Do favours for others and not only gain friendship but also juicy information and gifts.\n    Event Calendar\nA calendar keeps you up to date of festivals and events. Learn where and when the best ingredients grow. Attend various competitions, annual fayres, and don\u2019t you dare be late for a date!\nMonsters and Creatures\nThey're more than just sword fodder. Each creature has a sim and their own traits that you can take advantage of. Remember, even dragons need to go to the bathroom now and then. (That wasn\u2019t a pile of gold that Smaug sat on!)\nRun Your Business\nOwn a tavern and craft beers with bizarre effects.  Be a blacksmith and forge weapons and tools to order. Manage your apothecary and mix cures for a variety of bizarre poxes and curses.\nA Land Where Superstitions Are True\nHeed the advice of the Old Fishwife and the locals to find out everything from where the rarest items can be found to where and when the best places to conceive are! We're not just a little stitious. We're super stitious.\nOlde Traditions\nEvery village has their own customs and quirks. Visit the annual cheese bowling rite and encounter Wiki Men, Fred Barleycorn and wear the Trousers of Fertility, as passed down through generations. (I really hope they wash them...)\nRecipes\nHunger dictates combat prowess so a proper breakfast before some monster slaying goes a long way. Discover and use proper recipes though, and you can take your fighting to the next level, or even use the Traits in food to distract, weaken or even scare away enemies!\nItem Traits\nAll items and materials, have unique traits. From medicinal to hallucinogenic, shrinking to fattening...Want to feed laxatives to herds of sheep and lead them through town? The creative possibilities for fun are endless.\nBe Friends with Animals\nDomestic animals and critters have opinions of you based on your actions. If they like you enough they may just let you ride them!\nLovely Music\nNo mythical world would be complete without music to go with it. The title music has been made by Russell Shaw but also helping us out with some beautiful world music is Matthijs den Daas. Here's a couple of tracks you can expect to hear in our prototype. We'll be adding much more music as development continues.\n Kynseed Soundtrack - Dreamy Day:\n Kynseed Soundtrack - Willowdown:\n Kynseed Soundtrack - Butterflies:\n Kynseed Soundtrack - Cabaret du Fae:\n   \u00a37\nDIGITAL COPY OF THE GAME\nWe'll be releasing Kynseed for early access in late 2017. When we do, everyone who backed us at this level will get a copy of the game on early access as well as the full game when released.\n \u00a310\nYOUR NAME IN THE CREDITS + DIGITAL ART PACK\nBack us at this level and we'll put your name in the credits for all to view in wonderment. This tier level also gets you access to a pack of digital art which includes a myriad of wallpapers in a myriad of resolutions, extremely hi-res posters, as well as animated GIF's for all your internet needs.\n \u00a315\nDIGITAL SOUNDTRACK\nKynseed is a world as musical as it is beautiful. At this level you'll get a full uncompressed digital copy of the soundtrack.\n \u00a320\nDIGITAL QUILL LORE & ART BOOK\nThe land of Quill is rich with history and legends. We're taking world building very seriously with Kynseed and we'll be packing as much of that world into the Lore Bible as we can. In it you can expect details on creatures, the history of each region, character origins, and even insights into the mysterious Fae Realm and its inhabitants - including the enigmatic Mr Fairweather. Also included in the Lore Bible is the Art Book which will contain high resolution versions of many of the images made and used during Kynseed's development, including beautiful concept art created by the legendary Mike McCarthy.\n \u00a325\nDEV FORUM & DEV STREAMS\nThe entire community will be involved with offering feedback and direction during Kynseed's development. However, if you fancy seeing a game's development even when it's unpolished and has warts and rough eges then you'll want this reward. With it, you'll get access to one of our developer forums where you'll see us discuss very rough draft areas of the game and we'll turn to you for thoughts and feedback on things that aren't quite polished enough for public consumption. Additionally, you'll get access to monthly developer streams where you can watch a live feed of one of our desktops as we work on the game (and we'll be hanging out in the stream chat as well). Ever wanted to see a Bob Ross style stream of somebody using the ACTUAL tools to make an ACTUAL video game region? Then this reward is for you.\n \u00a350\nACCESS TO THE COMBO-SPRITE EDITOR\nDid you know that almost every tree in Kynseed is hand crafted and unique? That's because we made a really cool developer tool called the ComboSprite Editor. With it we can take various game sprites and combine them together to make really interesting creations. At this backer level, we'll actually give you access to download and use the same ComboSprite Editor that we ourselves are using to make the game. It's an incredibly satisfying tool to use and it's surprisingly relaxing to just chill out and create fun things. And who knows, if someone makes something that we particularly like we might even put it into the game!\nPLAY\n\n \u00a380\nA WANDERING FAE NPC NAMED AFTER YOU\nIn the land of Quill, there will be NPC's from the mystical Fae realm who wander the land. Back at this level and one of those NPC's will actually bear your name (or any other name you'd like to come up with).\n \u00a3150\nPERSONALISED GRAVESTONE EPITAPH\nAs some Fable fans may remember, there were numerous gravestones scattered around Albion. Many times these gravestons had epitaphs written on them as easter eggs about various members of the development team. But as it happens, the Kynseed team is rather small so we need your help in filling the land of Quill with...well, graves. Back at this level and we'll get you to write a small bio about yourself which we'll then use to come up with a personalised epitaph on a specific gravestone in the land of Quill that you can find and go to if you ever want to pay respects to yourself.\n \u00a3250\nA STATUE MADE IN YOUR IMAGE\nSend us a picture of yourself (or even of your significant other!) and we'll make a statue based on that image. The statue will then be placed in the grand Hall of Eternity, a place of esteemed honour in the land of Quill. And, to be clear, this is for an ingame statue as we don't really fancy contracting sculptors for a life sized bust of yourself (though back as at \u00a35,000 and maybe we'll talk).\n \u00a3500\nCREATE A LEGENDARY WEAPON WITH US\nMost games have Legendary Weapons and, although Kynseed does too, there's so many more types of Legendary items than just that. This, our highest of tiers, is to work one on one with the development team to conceptualize, design, sketch, and even name a Legendary Item that every player will be able to use in the game.\n   While many campaigns have 'stretch goals' we thought it best to instead have 'stretch funding' and let the community help decide which areas of the game additional money will be spent on. We'd love to look into other platforms long-term, but for now here are some more immediate areas we'll be focusing extra funds on. We'd love to hear all your suggestions as well!\nAny Stretch Funding Received Will Go Towards:\nCHARACTER ARTIST\nWe've heard your feedback on this and are looking to focus our efforts on the look of the player's character, NPC's, and animations. Stretch funding will allow us to get an additional artist earlier to help work on their look and animation early. The land of Quill is full of inhabitants with rich personality and it's important that all their personality shines through in the game's art.\nSIM CODER\nKynseed's sim systems represent a huge undertaking for us and, while we're up to the task, we also understand that we'll be able to create better work faster if we hire a dedicated sim coder whose sole job is to perfect the underlying systems of the game. This includes such areas as:\nDaily routines for NPC's\nGeneration based life cycles of people and pets\nRelationship systems for friends and romantic interests\nAdditional interactivity between people and creatures\nImproved pathfinding for all people and creatures\nAmong many other things\nUSER INTERFACE\nAdditional funds would let us get an extra hand to make an interface that's not only intuitive but amazing to look at. This will also free up our primary artist to focus solely on creating art for the world itself.\n     Kynseed is a 2D Sandbox RPG that lets you live your life before passing down your skills and possessions to your children and continuing the adventure as them. The world remembers your deeds and actions. Friends and loved ones age and pass away. Even beloved pets grow old and their offspring continue their own bloodline.\nAs you build your empire, both homely and business, you'll develop your renown and reputation and will eventually gain the attention of the mysterious Jack of All Trades! You can choose to take on jobs, open your own business, take on tasks and quests, mess with the sandbox, raise a family and go off The Path into the dangerous places for combat and loot finding. The materials you find can be used to help further your business and equipment while increasing your reputation.\n  The land of Quill is where you live. It is a place full of idyllic valleys and meadows, peaceful villages and rosy cheeked folk. A place ruled by no king or government. It is also a place surrounded by faery tale forests that host mysterious towers, dark caves, and silent ruins. From the dreamy meadows of Summerdown to the hidden depths of Ghostlight Cavern. From the bizarre structures of Copperpot Village to the festering waters of The Shingles.\nConnecting the human places of the world is The Path. The denizens of the forests never leave their homes...but if you wander from The Path expect trouble! All manner of monstrosities of folklore and Fae folk from Jabberwocks to Brownies, Men O' the Wood to Hobgoblins, Wyrms to Banshees - these and many more lurk in the darkness.\nEach village has its own customs and traditions, locality specific traits, and even tastes for food. Using this information is key if you want to forge relationships and create a winning business. Local delicacies go a long way to making simple folk happy.\nQuill is also a place where superstitions and proverbs are all actually true! A stitch in time really does save nine and the Stork delivers all the babies!\n  The first chapter of the game takes place in The Vale where you live with your dad and sister on the family farm. During this idyllic lazy summer you will be given tasks by your father which earn you Brass, the currency of the land. You have a rota with all your jobs laid out but if you don't do them you can earn Brass in other ways: finding it, earning it, and even winning it. You can fish, hunt, catch insects in jars, pick fruit and berries, make an assortment of lovely jams, ride pigs, find dig spots with your dog, throw stuff around, take on jobs in the village and so on.\nYou have a best friend in your woodland den called Twig. Twig is a wild child living in the forest who has been cursed and is half hare! Twig is the best friend that a hero could ask for: he's loyal, mischievous, and encourages freedom. Your adventures with Twig inadvertently lead you to a secret grotto where you hear the jangling of charms and out of the darkness strolls...Mr Fairweather.\n     Mr Fairweather is a Fae gentleman who lives alone in the faery realm of Eldrytch. He is charming and eccentric, but also sinister and unnerving. Mr Fairweather sees your potential and offers you the Kynseed. This magical acorn, once planted at your own family home, will let you realise your potential...but at a cost.\nIn return, Mr Fairweather asks that you give him 5 years of your life for the Kynseed. Then, on your 60th birthday, your life will end and you will go with him to Eldrytch. At or before he comes to collect you on your 60th birthday you will be able to uproot the Kynseed to pass it on to any of your children.\nIf you die any time before then, Mr Fairweather will revive you at the cost of 1 year of your life...\n  Mr Fairweather carries with him his Box of Delights and will offer you arcane trinkets, charms, tools and even weapons in return for a life cost. At the end of every year, as the last day of winter ends, Mr Fairweather will appear and take his life tax. You then start the new year older. So what kind of stuff does he sell, I hear you squeak excitedly?\nHow about a magic sack for capturing animals?\nA hat that makes the wearer forget everything?\nLantern lenses that let you see spirits?\nA hoe that does the farming for you?\nA golem bodyguard?\nA man eating pot plant?\nChangeling cream?\nThese items let you mess with the world, erase your mistakes, or help ease your tasks. They can let you access parts of Quill you couldn't reach before, help with relationships, or just aid your fighting prowess. Will your thirst for advancement and fun cost you quality time seeing your family and businesses grow?\n  When you get your own home and plant the Kynseed, your contract begins. The tree stands behind your house and grows and morphs depending on your situation, from representing kids as apples, to your ancestral line as roots.\nAt any time you can choose to cut down the tree and 'end your life'. Mr Fairweather will then ask which child you want to pass the Kynseed to. Your children will take some of your traits and have the skills they learned growing up, plus access to all your stuff.\nYou then 'become' that child and continue the bloodline. If you have no children, it's game over...so plan accordingly!\n  Your character can work in any shop or set up their own business. The available shops to choose from are Blacksmith, Inn, Goods Store, and Apothecary. But you can also be a Bard, Farmer, or just an Adventurer and sell your loot and materials.\nEach job is a little game in itself and doing jobs levels up your skill which unlocks more job related skills that will help your business. You can also hire NPC's to run your store, but check their quality! You can even put your kids to work, heartless fiend!\nCapture wild animals and you can even sell those, creating your own pet shop. Just how much is that doggy in the window? The one with the dragony tail?\nMix ingredients in the Apothecary and try to help the demanding NPC's with their everyday bizarre ailments...but watch out for side effects such as Blueface, Extreme Flatulence, and Bee Hair!\nYour shops gain Reputation separate from your own Renown and competitors may take advantage of any slip ups. By venturing off The Path you can find better items and materials to sell or use in your shops thus creating better items and attracting a higher quality of clientele.\n  The people of Quill (aka, NPC's) have their own day/night cycle, routines, and jobs. They have an opinion of you ranging from adoration to total hostility. Individuals have their own family trees, traits (some specific to the locality), and opinions of each other. They will react to your actions, fame, and remember your rights and wrongs against their clan.\nWrong them enough and they will launch Vendetta, and that's good for nobody.\nNPC's will ask for 'Favours'. Complete these tasks to unlock rewards. The NPC will pay the Favour back by revealing important info, divulging secrets or giving you items and so on.\n  NPC\u2019s, domestic animals, monsters, and even materials have Traits. Traits are usually hidden and can be exposed by gifting, reading, and talking to others. A small sampling of some Traits you can discover:\nAllergies\nNose for Treasure\nShrinking\nHard Worker\nInsomnia\nNarcolepsy\nFlatulence\nLuck\n  Your life is run by a Calendar, accessible at any time, which keeps track of annual festivals, events, and even romantic trysts!\nYou can add items to the Calendar too. For example, you may discover a flower that blooms only one day per year and may want a reminder of that.\nThe calendar also let's you check weather forecasts (when you gain the knowledge) and also track your Favours, due baby dates and deliveries!\n  When things get hairy (quite literally when you meet a Hag who hasn\u2019t shaved recently), you can rely on a good sliver of pointy metal, a bow 'n' arrow, and some nice items to get you through the bad places. You assign a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and one item allowing you to switch between all three.\nAs you gain experience in combat, you unlock new moves and skill. Your weapon also levels up and has its own reputation. In time, your weapon may become legendary. Or you could just steal that legendary weapon Old Firesnorter uses to pick bits of cow out of his teeth with.\nThe player can also increase their agility and defense skills eventually becoming like a lithe leopard leaping long lengths laughing leisurely.\nWe want the combat to be meaty and satisfying - not grindy and filled with loooooong health bars. And for those who want a challenge, you can visit the more dangerous places such as Hardwood, EvilWood and Nightmare Hallow.\n  Quill\u2019s forests and caves are home to faery tale creatures and ethereal denizens. A place where ancient spirits cast their ancient gazes and Old Gods are revered and worshiped in dark corners. Though sometimes also in well-lit areas that comply to F.A.E. Commission Elf & Safety Standards.\nEach creature has its own traits and its own sim. Monsters are no longer mindless aggressors. Well, some are, but they are mindless aggressors with their own needs, likes, fears, allergies, and urges.\nBy examining them, or learning about them, a wily player can take advantage. After all, Dragon poop makes incredible fertiliser...\n  The land of Quill is steeped in folklore where the hamlets and insular villages scattered around it all have their own customs and traditions.\nHow about the annual Apple Bob in PoppyHill? Bob hates it though. Or take part in the Harvest Underpant Frenzy in Tunt. Throw candies at Daddy Long Legs and Mrs Long Legs as they stride through Candlewych on All Marrows Eve.\nTaking part in these rituals and festivities can actually grant boons and bonuses making participating in these traditions very important. Additionally, using old proverbs and heeding the Old Fishwife can give the player an advantage. Use these proverbs to find hidden places, world secrets, rare ingredients, or even learn combat advantages. For example...\nMilk a cow past midnight's hour, turns the cream very sour.\nPlant your seed on Summer's morn, more likely that a boy be born. Do it on a Winter's night, more likely that you\u2019ll make Snow White.\nSee a pin and pick it up, all the day you'll have good luck. See a pin and let it be, bad luck will jump outta a tree.\nWe feel this feature and setting makes Kynseed very unique, charming and interesting. There will be so much for players to discover, so many combinations triggering boons and curses and so much knowledge to share with other players.\n  We are a team of three little pigs building a brick house to keep the wolf from the door. Two of those pigs are ex-Lionhead Studios developers and the other helped run the Fable community for many years. With over 30 years of collective experience developing the Fable series and its community, we hope to infuse our games with the same charm, eccentricity, and humour that permeated Lionhead\u2019s games.\n Neal Whitehead\nCo-Founder and Technical Director\nTwitter\nNeal has worked as a scripter, coder, and tools creator for nearly every Fable over the course of 12 years as well as a gameplay scripter on Black & White 2. He was Lionhead\u2019s 2nd best table tennis player, perhaps best shmup player, and boasts a stupidly high score on Threes. He is also a Streetfighter expert and fanboy, although he can\u2019t cope with button mashers and for a polite and quiet guy he sure swears like a sailor.\n Charlton Edwards\nCo-Founder and Design Director\nTwitter\nCharlie was at Lionhead longer than anyone and that\u2019s why the place smelled a bit. He cut his teeth as a tester on Black and White then Fable and ended up designing and building the Albion of both Fable 2 and Fable 3. Charlie lived for Lionhead - quite literally as he once lived there secretly for 9 days. For some reason, he is really good at the Mario Golf series despite being dreadful at real life golf...although real golf doesn't require you stopping an arrow on a power bar and trying to avoid giant mushrooms with faces.\n Matt Allen\nProduction Manager\nTwitter | Facebook | Instagram \nA rock star both on and offline, Matt helped out with the Fable community for over a decade and gained the respect of all those utter nutters. He's now part of our lovely team and when he isn't busy partying in Los Angeles he's busy editing videos, creating graphics, contributing to design, keeping us organised and on schedule, and not sleeping as much as he probably should.\n Additional Support By:\nRussell Shaw for the title screen music. Legend!\nMatthew Weekes for our utterly lovely pixel art (with animation assistance from Georgio Ser).\nMatthijs den Daas for the amazing music.\nDeborah Saez for our current UI. Cool stuff!\nIan Faichnie for the superb Kynseed and PixelCount logos.\nMighty Mike McCarthy for all the stunning concept art!\nAnd extra thanks to David Oxford and Lozz Logan for other fantastic art contributions.\n     As part of this campaign, you lovely people are able to download and play our prototype. We just wanted to quickly mention a few things about it:\nThe prototype is not a demo (not even close to one!) and is more to just get a handle on controls set over a week on your family farm during an idyllic summer. We have tossed in a load of collectibles and activities without any story, pacing and many key features missing.\nThe aim is just to deliver a little taster of the kind of thing to expect at the basic level. We hope it is still pretty fun and engaging for you.\nIf nothing else, just close your eyes and relax while listening to the dreamy music...\n  Kynseed is the passion project of a tiny but experienced team who spent aeons working on Lionhead Studios' games. We wanted to create a game that continued the spirit of the studio we loved for so many years. It is very important to us that we involve the community of players into the creative process from the very beginning of this journey. We want to create a little studio that is always open with its community and one which doesn't shroud itself in secrecy. It's also a chance for us to reconnect with the Fable and Lionhead community. Kynseed is a way for us to carry on the soul of Fable in our own humble way.\nThank you to all our old Fable fans and all our new Kynseed fans. We can't wait to go on this journey with you all.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe funds that we get through Kickstarter will be used to get our very small development team through at least half a year without having to eat each other. By then our hope is that we'll have expanded our game engine from our early prototype to a proper alpha build that we'll then release on Early Access on Steam (pending approval), itch.io, and possibly others. We understand that Steam's Early Access has sometimes been used to support games that weren't really operating within the spirit of what Early Access should be. With Kynseed, it's crucial that we get the community as involved with our creative process as possible. To that end, we're approaching Early Access trying to be honest and upfront about our intentions. When we launch on Early Access, you'll be able to get the current state of Kynseed at a discount. When the game reaches proper beta status we'll increase that price a little. Finally, when the game is finished and ready for release, we'll exit Early Access and put the game at the final price (still very reasonable). If you support Kynseed at our lowest level, this gets you a copy of Kynseed when we launch for Early Access later this year.\n\nCurrently we already have workable development tools, our own game engine which we've made from scratch, some very basic gameplay systems, a bit of music, some early art assets, and many other things. The more funding we get the more talent we can hire and we'll be able to producer better work faster. Our ideal aim would be to have the game ready late in 2018 with frequent updates along the way once Early Access is available, though this will be dependent on team size and funding.\n\nAs with all games, development is a tricky thing so timetables are never truly solid and features may change as we go. Playing the game and getting feedback to gameplay and ideas is paramount to shaping the adventure. We would very much love for you all to come along for the ride (but one at a time please\u2026it\u2019s a small pig).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""},

Each turn one player grabs both a Perk and a Quirk card. This combination of cards represents a potential lover that player could spend the rest of their life with. Everyone then puts either a Date or Deny voting card face down, to represent what choice they think their friend will make. Individually each player flips their voting card and explains why they believe this is the perfect, or worst match for their friend. In the end, the player whose turn it is reveals how they voted, and why. Everyone that guessed correctly gains a point. \n  This is a conversation building card game. You'll be shocked by how your friends answer. How could someone be okay with dating someone wanted by the cartel, but have a problem with dating an erotic baker? Why would someone deny a person who's house has a whole floor that's a ball pit, but date a lover with the Midas touch? Billionaire Banshee is a game that's meant to reveal our true selves to friends and strangers, to bring us closer, make us laugh, and strike away the fear of our hidden wants. It's also a lot of fun, but don't take my word for it!\n     Now that you know people loved the first game, what does the expansion include?\n      Design/Art: Steven \"Razlo\" Bailey\nCreator and artist for the original Billionaire Banshee, but a lot has been learned since then, so this expansion should look even better than the original and play just as fun.\nPublishing/Manufacturing: Breaking Games/Ad Magic\nWhen I printed the first Billionaire Banshee, I used Ad Magic. They had just started a publishing arm and I loved working with them, so Billionaire Banshee joined their publishing program shortly after the Kickstarter rewards went out. Since they know my wants and this game even better than the first spin around, this expansion should be easy for them.\n  Programmer on NES Conversion: PSC\nPSC, aka 'Z80artist', is a member of the retro development community who programs for the 8bit GameBoy COLOR and original Nintendo NES classic. His upcoming fan port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 for the GameBoy and GameBoy COLOR has attracted a lot of excitement for pushing the hardware to new heights. Check out his YouTube for more of his work.\n        THAT'S RIGHT! We're making a limited run of physical, real, authentic REGION FREE NES game cartridges of Billionaire Banshee.. This isn't some USB drive inside a cart with pictures you put on your computer. This isn't some fake collectible. This is a real NES version of Billionaire Banshee on a cartridge that you can play on a real NES!\nThe NES game is a greatest hits of sorts, it includes some of the best cards from the main game, the Australia pack, the Sexy pack and the expansion. The game uses 1 controller with turn based pass and play, so unlike many NES multiplayer games, far more than 2 people can play at once.\nFeatures:\n2-8 player single controller pass and play\nChange length of play session by time, or by round\nTurn off trait categories you don't want for a party (Sexy, Reality, Fantasy)\nScore kept by game, so you no longer have to stay sober enough to do it yourself\nCute as hell cartridge that looks great even just being displayed\nAmazing quality voice samples (a true rarity on the NES)\nExtra single player mini-game\nComes sealed in box with instruction manual\nThere aren't many good tabletop or party games on NES, even fewer adult orientated games, and even fewer of those that are good.

We\u2019ve reached both our goals for this campaign. It\u2019s truly amazing!\nThe funds are important, but the great start to our community for \u00abMy Child Game\u00bb is invaluable. This campaign has given us so many new friends and ambassadors, both as backers and followers on Facebook, Twitter and our newsletter. We\u2019re looking forward to sending out the rewards we are making for you!\nThis is just the beginning of our journey - we aim to launch the game this autumn and have an exiting period in front of us. So to all of you who are visiting this page after the campaign is over, please follow our project on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/MyChildLebensborn/), Twitter (twitter.com/MyChildGame) or sign up for our newsletters (www.mychildlebensborn.com).\nWith all our hearts, thank you!\nElin & Catharina\n       PLAY\n\n \nYou play as the ward of a seven year old child. You are a single parent, struggling with a tight budget while taking care of your child. Together, you live through a linear story beginning with the child starting school. \n But your kid\u2019s first meeting with the local community is troubled. You are challenged to explain and help the child as the problems deepen, while also uncovering their background and the cause of the difficult situation. The playthrough will be around 4 - 5 hours and you can choose if your kid is a boy or a girl.\n  Meet Klaus/Karin, a kind and creative child living in a small town in Norway in 1951. Learning to know that they are different from the other children \u2013 a deep feeling of shame grows within them. \nFortunately, they have a kind and loving adoptive parent - you.\nAfter years of occupation, your local town is recovering from the emotional and physical scars left after a long war. \nBut there are some scars that do not heal. \n   Within this town is your home and your child\u2019s sanctuary. \nYour home will be the main interaction point with the child, as you care for, nurture and work through the problems Klaus/Karin faces.\n Other nurture games, like \"Tamagotchi\", have traditionally presented the player with a one dimensional pet to care for. \nIn our game you build a relationship with a child that has a complex character and individual personality. What you say and how you care for the child feeds into a mood system, directly affecting the child's emotional state.\nThis is reflected in facial expressions, body language and also in the way the child responds to you. So - instead of a pet, you interact with a complex and interesting character that we think will give you an immersive and engaging game experience. \nWe use an intimate format, relying on the mobile screen with touch based controls, to create a stronger emotional experience.\n  Balance meagre resources and emotional needs\nTime is the main currency in the game. You are free to choose how this time is spent, either by working to earn money (letting you buy and do more, but leaving the child alone), or to spend with the child (supporting the child's development, but having less for food or rent).\n  Influence the child\u2019s personality, emotions and views                                                   How you interact with the child will affect their emotions and wellbeing. It respond differently to you based on the choices you make, and ultimately their view on the world will change. \n\n\nMake tough choices                                                                                                              The story will be experienced differently from one player to the next and will take you through an increasingly emotionally challenging experience. \n   We are inspired by the true stories of Children Born of War, with enemy soldiers as fathers. Children of the enemy are born in all conflicts. We tell the dramatic story of the \"Lebensborn\" children in Norway, which is one of many such groups.\n We are working with surviving Lebensborn-children, now in their seventies, to ensure that the events that we are presenting are representative for the difficulties they faced growing up.\n  My Child Lebensborn features scores from experienced and renowned film composers, who have worked on subtle scores for emotional content. \nKetil Vestrum Einarsen and Lars Fr\u00f8islie are making music that color and follow the child's emotional state, using acoustic instruments that fit the historical context. \nFor sound design we are working with Dan Wakefield, who recently got acclaim for his work on \"Through the Woods\".   \n  In order to create a believable and complex character with individuality and personal traits, we have worked with writer Sofia Lersol Lund. She has brought her experience with character development for film and TV-series to the project. \nWriter Ozan Dr\u00f8sdal from Perfectly Paranormal is bringing his experience in effective dialogue for games.\nWe also wish to thank author Nicolai Frobenius, game author Ragnar T\u00f6rnqvist (Dreamfall) and experienced game designer Richard Lermarchand (Uncharted) for their excellent advice and support.  \n    We have some wonderful pledge rewards for you that we hope you find interesting. Your help and support will really make a difference. Supporters, such as yourself, who\u2019ll follow and share our project are so important to the success and visibility of the game. \nEven a one dollar pledge matters and shows us that we have people willing to support our cause.\n        Delivery dates\nWe will work to fullfill delivery of the tiers as swiftly as we can, and mail out digital rewards as they are produced. The physical part of a tier will be posted in one shipment as soon as all the items  belonging to the tier are completed.\nInternational shipment *)\nWe have included international shipment by post in the prize of the perks, but the supporter will be responsible for any tax or customs in their local countries. We will ship the tiers marked as marketing material and with the metal value of the hearts. \n  My Child: Lebensborn will be launched as a premium game for mobile platforms. Release estimated autum 2017. \nWe have funded most of the development of the game, however we need your help to ensure the game gets the full attention it deserves. \nWe lack funds for refining and marketing, and both are really important elements to be able to give the game the love it needs. And most importantly - to be able to get the game out to people.\nYour support will be used in the following way:\n  (This is an estimate, based on a theoretical number of supporters and mix of tiers)\n  This project is a collaboration between two companies, Teknopilot and Sarepta Studio.\nIndie game developers Sarepta studio, with their team of 10 employees and CEO Catharina Due B\u00f8hler, are the creators of award-winning PC and console game \"Shadow Puppeteer\".\n\nTeknopilot is a production company working with innovative, digital storytelling, headed by producer Elin Fest\u00f8y.\nElin and Catharina met at a seminar in 2013, whilst Elin was working on the Lebensborn material. She wanted to explore the possibility of making a game that lets you experience the story instead of \"telling\" it in a traditional format. To use the game format to build empathy through immersion, interaction and emotional engagement. \nThe two companies have since been hard at work developing this concept into reality. \n  Please follow our project - we are posting updates on many platforms. Follow them all to get the full picture :-)  \nFacebook   \nTwitter   \nSnapchat   \nYouTube - Gamedev blogs   \nInstagram   \nE-mail updates   \nwww.mychildlebensborn.com\n\nOn behalf of all on our team, we would like to thank you for the interest you have shown in this project. The development of the game, as well as the opportunity to tell the unknown story of the\" Lebensborn\" children, has been a dream of ours. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for sharing our dream and supporting us.\n  Kind Regards\nFrom Elin and Catharina\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we have secured some funding for our game, we know that we will be able to finish it. However our current funds for polishing and testing are extremely limited, and we fear that we won't be able to do the game justice when it comes to the end product. The marketing funding - and ambassadors - from this campaign will mean a lot to the future of the project. \n\nThe risk for the backers of this campaign are very limited. The game will be finished, and the physical and digital perks that we offer will be financed by the funds from the rewards. \n\nWe aim to release the game for Android and iOS, and will need to get accepted into Google Play or Apple Store. There is a risk that there will be a struggle in getting accepted because of the heavy topic. However we see that games with similar topics, like \"This War of Mine\" or \"Revolution 1979\", have been approved. In the unlikely case that we should struggle with any of these platforms, we will be able to distribute the game directly to Android users and iPhone only users will be reimbursed for the cost of the game.\n\nAs the campaign is in the currency of Norwegian Kroner (NOK), there is a slight risk of currency variations during the next month. However, the Norwegian currency is very stable towards e.g. US Dollars and Euros, so any effect should be minimal (the variations are typically max 5% during a year).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge NOK 8 or more", "title": "Warm Heart", "descp": "Approximately $1 USD\nThank you so much for helping us and supporting our project!\nINCLUDES:\nOur heartfelt thanks for your support\nSign-up for e-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}], "stat": ["18 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NOK 85 or more", "title": "Game Fan", "descp": "Approximately $10 USD\nYou will get the game, 3 digital wallpapers, our digital button design \"Hatred stops with me\", and all from the Warm Heart tier.\nINCLUDES:\nOur heartfelt thanks for your support\nSign-up for e-mail updates\nOne digital copy of our game\nDigital button\n3 digital wallpapers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["167 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge NOK 212 or more", "title": "Friendly Bundle", "descp": "Approximately $25 USD\nYou will get two games and the digital version of our book about the making of the game (with art style and background stories).

Can an icon of this nature have an adventure and discover solutions to obstacles outside of it\u2019s boxed-in environment? Enter the world of The Pedestrian and find out!\nThe Pedestrian is a 2.5D side-scrolling puzzle platformer that takes puzzle platforming literally. The player moves from sign to sign, rearranging and reconnecting signs in order to solve puzzles. These solved puzzles connect and occupy space in the 3D surroundings. This allows the player the ability to explore and maneuver smoothly through the terrain.\n  Plan, build, adjust, succeed! The task is simple: get from point A to point B. But as the saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey.\u201d Connect signs to create a path to the next leg of your journey. Not only are puzzle mechanics tied to the world, but also to the narrative. Use your imagination and puzzle-solving skills to avoid and overcome obstacles in the signs.\n  The world of The Pedestrian is a lively place. It's home to such sights as: traffic cluttered streets, steaming pipes, music filled elevators, suspiciously abandoned subways, a dark stormy city skyline and more. The environments are meant to be entertaining, as well as a core part of the gameplay.\n  No more walls of text! All puzzle mechanics are taught using symbols and animation, while story elements are portrayed during gameplay. The real-world public sign system was created to give information without the use of text, eliminating the barrier of language. Thus, The Pedestrian uses simplistic sign-style symbols in order to convey needed information for gameplay.\n  The Pedestrian uses no words, so music is a critical component in telling the story. A well crafted, cohesive score speaks louder than words.\nClassic jazz is The Pedestrian's base genre, with inspiration from John Williams, Danny Elfman, and Jerry Goldsmith, to evoke the feeling of a bright and bustling world.\nBelow are a few conceptual-stage musical sketches and instrumental ideas.\n  Skookum Arts is a three-man team based in north central Ohio.\nWe are Daniel and Jed Lackey and Joel Hornsby. We grew up as neighbors in a small village. As kids, we were all homeschooled and shared similar interests, such as; the usual childhood biking, swimming, sports and lots of video games at each other\u2019s homes. In addition to these normal activities, we enjoyed exploring abandoned buildings in the nearby countryside, creating fun science-type projects...like potato cannons and a forge to melt down and remold aluminum. Our combined passion to discover, design and construct, developed into a desire to start a business in order to create the type of products we enjoy and share them with the world.\nIn 2014, we decided to focus on game development and began production of The Pedestrian.\nOriginal Concept Art\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges in any creative pursuit is to find a unique and compelling concept that not only draws peoples attention, but also leaves them wanting more. We believe The Pedestrian has already cleared this hurdle and we are now nearing the home stretch in production. \n\nThe Pedestrian has been a self-funded endeavor until now. We each had full time jobs when our business began and a few freelance projects also helped with start-up. Our families have been very supportive and contributed financially in order for us to terminate employment and target all our energy on The Pedestrian. We have been able to manage financially, but the well is running dry.\n\nSo our dilemma is to either ship the game \"as is\" or consider other means to finance it's continued development. We could take additional freelance work and possibly have part time jobs, but we would have less time to devote to the game, and thus further delay the launch. Kickstarter is a way for us to fund the project of The Pedestrian, so we can give it the laser beam focus and polish we desire.\n\nOur demo shows the level of commitment and care we are putting into the game, along with the fun art style and unique set of puzzle-platformer mechanics. We're striving to elevate the game to a truly cinematic, singular experience and we need your help to do it!\n\nThat being said, we want to be completely transparent about the possible risks involved. We have done research, worked really hard and received a lot of positive feedback, but we are aware that no one is guaranteed success. It could take longer than expected to release, because we absolutely refuse to offer a product with quality less than the excellence we believe can be achieved.\n\nWe are 100% committed to this game and unless some unforeseen tragedy occurs...like the internet becomes nonexistent or we all die...we will complete and release The Pedestrian as soon as possible. We have already received the \"Greenlight\" from Steam and have everything set in place to release when the product is finished.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "Thanks so much for your support!

Put your skills and reflexes to the test through furious melee combat and epic boss fights against uniquely designed enemies. All monster spawns are dynamic, constantly keeping you on your toes.\nDie.\nDesigned as a challenging adventure for seasoned gamers, frequent deaths are part of the Sundered experience. But taking our inspiration from our favorite rogue-like games, death in Sundered is only the beginning.\nUpgrade.\nWhen you die, you respawn in the Hub, where you level up and customize your character. Equip and upgrade a host of unique Perks, stats and special Abilities hidden throughout the world.\nAll the skills!\n  We announced the game with our marketing partner, Sony, at the end of September 2016:\nThe trailer received wide-spread praise and showed that there was definite interest for the game!\n  Sundered simply wouldn\u2019t be a Thunder Lotus game if we didn\u2019t have larger-than-life boss fights. There are six massive boss fights in the game, each providing epic confrontations that truly test your mastery of the game.\nWakey, wakey!\n  Sundered\u2019s tag line, \"Resist or Embrace\" is key to the experience. The Metroid-style abilities you find in the Shrines can be corrupted, but at a cost.\nSmash attack > Corrupted smash attack!\nAfter defeating a boss, you receive an Elder Shard. You can choose to bring this special relic to a Skill Shrine on the world to corrupt a specific Ability. A Corrupted Ability is a much more powerful version of the same gameplay mechanic, but it comes at a cost to your humanity.  \nThe tragedy of Eshe's gradual, voluntary corruption is eloquently illustrated in our second trailer, Embrace:\nThere are seven major abilities in the game, each corruptible into a more powerful eldritch version:  \nShield \nDouble Jump \nGun \nDash \nSmash \nHook Shot \nWall Run \nUltimately, corrupting your abilities has important gameplay repercussions and even changes the game's ending, as how corrupted you are defines which boss you'll face.\nSundered tells the story of the mysterious Terror, a cataclysmic event that causes the undoing of society and plunges the world into madness. You play Eshe, a scavenger who becomes trapped in a strange sandstorm which drags her into a mysterious cavern. You have stumbled upon the source of power that led to the world\u2019s destruction centuries ago. \nA derelict shrine hides massive power.\nThe backstory tells the tale of how this strange power attracted the Valkyries, an armed group of scientific revolutionaries, and the Eschaton, mad cultists following the teachings of an obscure god, to this place. As she picks up the pieces, the player uncovers the conflict that sundered the world. \nThe choice is yours...\n  We want the monsters in Sundered to be unpredictable, for you to feel like madness is just around the corner. To achieve this, all the monster spawns are dynamic.\nSlashing through a horde.\nLike in Left 4 Dead, the monsters spawn based on a number of factors (time, difficulty level, current region). This creates hordes of eldritch horrors that lurk within the shadows, waiting for the player to fall into their trap.\nRun, Eshe, Run!\n  When we announced Sundered, many players argued that a Metroidvania could not be procedural. We respectfully disagree. Though the overall structure of the world is set in stone, sub-sections (the green and grey squares on the map below) are procedurally generated every time you die. This allows us to make design choices which are core to a Metroidvania experience, like backtracking and unlocking new abilities that unlock new sub-sections, while keeping the experience fresh.\nThe structure of the world stays the same. Purple, red and blue rooms are always there.\nSub-sections in action:\nThis adds a multiplicative layer of uncertainty, since the layer of randomness of the dungeon gets added over the random monster spawns. The final game will have three unique regions, each with a multitude of monsters, secrets and challenges.\nSundered builds on Jotun's foundation and maximizes our team\u2019s visual talent through our signature hand-drawn art style, creative characters and impressive vistas. \n  A selection of concept sketches\n  As with our previous game, immersion is key to the experience and having an original soundtrack composed by Max LL is essential to the player experience.\nFor sound design, we'll be working with the amazing Pixel Audio team who worked with us on Jotun.\n  Back in 2014, with the generous help of many friends, we put together a Kickstarter campaign with very few resources. And thanks to our amazing backers, we were able to make a great game: Jotun. \nOur award winning hand-drawn Viking game!\nJotun was a critical and commercial success. We are proud to say we released Jotun on time and on budget, while still releasing an award-winning game. We learned so much during the process and are already applying it to Sundered!\n  We\u2019ve come to Kickstarter to put the game in your hands and make it the best it can be. We know how important feedback is and Jotun\u2019s alpha and beta backers transformed the game into something special. We need you to tell us what we can do better. It's about polish, feedback and using Kickstarter funds to make Sundered the best it can be.\nHere is a sampling of things we want to improve with your help:\nOverall balancing and pacing\nSpecial nodes for the Skill Tree\nDifferent ideas for Perks\nWhat exactly defines the core gameplay experience and how we can improve it\nThis also explains why anyone backing at the $15 or higher tier will get an automatic invite to Sundered's Beta. Yes, we want your feedback, but we also need the money for development time to implement that feedback. The July release date reflects this extended timeline.\nWe've been hard at work on Sundered for just over a year. All the money we raise during Kickstarter will be invested in the game's production, which will allow us to extend the game's production until June, for a July release.\nSundered's total development budget is $700,000 CAD, coming from Jotun revenues and a loan from the Canadian Media Fund (the same entity who helped fund Jotun). Sony is acting as our marketing partner (which explains why we are only releasing on PC and PS4 for now), but is not funding the game.\nHere is how we're breaking down the months until release:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelays are one of the biggest issues in game development. Bringing so many different aspects together in an innovative product necessarily brings its own set of challenges. With Sundered, the complexity and amount of systems we're bringing together can cause our heads to spin, requiring a ton of balancing and polish. The amount of feedback we get from you guys can also impact our timeline, as we want to make sure that our backers are happy with the game before we ship it to the masses.\n\nThis leads into the other major risk: game quality. Most people making a game are trying their best to make a great game. No one enters this industry while thinking \"Let's make some very average games that not too many people will like\". There is always the risk that the game doesn't turn out as good as you hoped it would. However, we are 100% focused on delivering an amazing gameplay experience, building on what worked and didn't work with Jotun. We also believe that with your help in alpha and beta, we'll be able to mitigate most design/fun issues and polish the game until it is great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Sundered Advocate", "descp": "The heartfelt gratitude we feel towards our more frugal well-wishers will shine through every lovingly crafted pixel of their exclusive Sundered digital wallpaper!\nINCLUDES:\nOur heartfelt thanks!\nKickstarter-Exclusive Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 20 or more", "title": "Sundered Core", "descp": "A digital copy of Sundered on Steam, PS4, or GOG (Windows, Mac or Linux), plus access to the exclusive beta test version of the game!\nINCLUDES:\nSundered Digital Copy (Steam, PS4 or GOG)\nClosed Beta access\nAll previous rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["2,190 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 30 or more", "title": "Corrupted Core", "descp": "Enjoy Sundered's haunting digital soundtrack!

We're mad about old school games that are a challenge to play. We're passionate about pixel art. We really love Roguelikes and classic RPGs. And we sincerely believe that every good game should be a piece of art, not just business. As a result, we're creating UnDungeon to reflect all of our principles.\nEvery gamer probably has their own perspective on what the ideal game is, but as developers we're in the special position of being able to bring our ideals to life. So, UnDungeon introduces a mix of Action, Roguelike, and old-school RPG styles and wraps them in a gorgeous pixel skin. And now, we\u2019d like to share it with you!\nUnDungeon will be released for PC/Mac/Linux on Steam and GOG (DRM Free). Additionally, we'd like to launch it on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and PS Vita - but ports for these consoles will be possible only after achieving corresponding stretch goals!\nSince our childhood, we've always been told that the universe is endless; that there are billions of worlds and that it's impossible to reach any of them. They\u2019ve been telling us we are billions of light years away. But what if they haven\u2019t told us the whole truth?\nWhat if we live in a multiverse of parallel worlds which are separated by nothing but a thin membrane. And what if this membrane is not impenetrable?\nThe moment in history, known as The Shift, not only made the Earth absolutely insecure, but destroyed it as a shelter for mankind. The reasons for the cataclysm are still far beyond human understanding, but its consequences have essentially changed scientific dogma related to the structure of the Universe and the position of the human race within it.  \nA small failure in the Multiversal mechanism combined seven parallel worlds together. Inhabitants of these very different civilizations suddenly became neighbors... against their will.\nThe game world is based on the Multiversal principles. This means that all dimensions which exist in the Multiverse are parallel. Therefore, multiple variations of the same place, such as Earth, are possible.\nThe affected worlds are not aliens to one another. They are just different variations of the same planet; variations where something went wrong in the past, causing unusual scenarios to develop.\nWhat if one variation of our Earth was inhabited by aliens long before the appearance of homosapiens? What if, in another dimension, the evolution went a completely different way? And somewhere else again, common physical laws don't work as you'd expect? \nNo matter how dissimilar they are, The Shift brought them all together into a single melting pot.\nRight after The Shift took place, seven Heralds appeared in different parts of the world. Each one is a keeper of the artifact called The Core.\nThe Core does not let its carrier die, instead causing him or her to be reborn again and again - changing the surrounding world each time the Herald resurrects. This artifact is a clue to the nature of the Shift. Each Herald feels a craving for a certain location of the newly-created world, where the power of the Core can be revealed.\nThe Herald moves across a procedurally-generated map which is divided into regions relating to the different worlds. He or she visits various locations communicating, fighting, and trading with other inhabitants.\nThe Herald desperately explores the environment trying to obey the call of the Core. Mistakes are not allowed because the score is ruled by permadeath. \nAlthough the Core will resurrect the Herald, the old world will be lost forever, and you will have to start the exploration of a completely new planet - the equivalent of a new game beginning.\nAll combat takes place in real time. A character uses artifacts and amplifiers that can be combined, enabling the Herald to adapt to all possible threats.\nTraditionally for top-down games, UnDungeon provides fast-paced combat with dodging, reflectors, frequent change of positions, etc. We rely on realistic physics to create more spectacular projectile trajectories, debris scattering, bouncing, grenade throwing, etc. \nEach action performed in a battle, except movements, consumes a certain amount of energy points (EP).\nThe energy is an alternative to the traditional weapon-recharge mechanic, which makes combat more comprehensive and helps avoid mindless ability-spamming.\nAs a player, you act as one of the seven Heralds, each of whom comes from a particular world destroyed by the Shift. The Heralds are not ordinary creatures; they are absolutely unique in comparison with common action\\RPG heroes. So let's get to know them better.\n            It's necessary to mention one important aspect: all characters in UnDungeon are not going to save innocents or fight for love and peace. Some of them are willing to destroy humanity and other competitors in order to gain new territory for their race.\nThat said, you will certainly play as a positive hero as well, but don\u2019t hope for any privileges as with most RPGs. There's no way to solve quests the 'right' way in UnDungeon, because each solution leads to different consequence... and there is always someone who will disagree with your choice.\nExploring the world, the characters will find various supernatural objects and artifacts. There are two types of objects: passive and active. The passive ones alter various characteristics, add small additional properties, and can be stored and used in an unlimited quantity. As for active objects, they provide new features or essentially change the existing ones. \nSince such objects are placed in special slots, it is possible to mix all the available character's abilities, forming a huge variety of combinations.\nEach Herald has a unique pool of objects which is not available to the other characters. Consequently, each one has an exclusive playstyle and development path. What's more, each artifact provides an impact on characters' appearance.\nAnd since the order and number of objects are totally random, each new trial is characterized by a unique character's look. Plus, each equipped artifact provides the influence on the character's appearance (sometimes these changes are vital). See the examples below:\n  UnDungeon is created in the isometric perspective: hand-drawn pixelart is combined with a large number of animation frames and extremely high detail.\nWe also plan to create a set of pixel cutscene movies that would illustrate some key events of the game. 90% of our art is drawn by hand. Seldom, we use 3D-workpieces as a basis of large objects.\nThe graphics were inspired by such projects as Hyper Light Drifter, EITR, Dungeon of the Endless and a mix of different genres - sci-fi, fantasy, steam and cyberpunk. Since we think that pixelart, like any branch of art, should evolve, we use features that are not common to pixel games: glowing, gradients and various colors blending modes, unlimited palette. Plus, glitch art is used to emphasise the Shift.\nAll game graphics and animations are made manually. We have set a goal to make the visual aspect of Undungeon as bright as possible preserving the vibe of hand made pixel art in a top-down perspective.\nMusic and sound design for UnDungeon are created by our good friend and experimental musician stonefromthesky. Both music and sounds are two very important components that affect the gaming experience. The sound designer's goal is to emphasize the game atmosphere. Therefore, music varies from ambient to sludgy electronic depending on a surrounding world and situation. For instance, The Wasteland Law was written for the exploration of a post-nuclear desert world. We are trying to make more studio and live sounds, because we don't want to use common chiptune soundtracks. Below, you can listen to several songs that will become the game soundtrack.\n    Currently, UnDungeon is situated at its pre-alpha stage of development. The working prototype has been already developed. It includes the combat system, map and local level generation, ability combination system, loot, and other aspects. The next one is a quest system.\nAt the same time we work on sound design. A part of OST is finished and the work on sounds is in progress.\nIt is hard to estimate the volume of work on art, texts, and level design - the game requires as much content as possible to become more flexible and saturated. But we are going to finish core of the game by the end of the year.\nDuring the year, we plan to release an exclusive demo for backers - and we're looking into the possibility of creating a public demo after this.\nWe started working on UnDungeon more than a year ago, just as a hobby as a change from the boring office routine. The history and concept elements of the game were combined from lots of various notes, sketches, ideas (that were impossible to release during a full-time at office), and all features that other games lack.\nNone of us believed that the game would become such a big project. We were confident that it was impossible because of our daily jobs. Meanwhile, our idea was getting more concrete and detailed, the first animations appeared, and the first line of code was written.\nLater on, we realized that we loved this game and wanted to finish it at any cost. But to implement all our ideas we needed financing.\nAll that we have so far has been achieved without any financial support. And we don't want to find an investor or become a part of an already existing studio, because it seems vital to make the game as we see it. Therefore, Kickstarter is the only opportunity to get the necessary finances and not to lose the game of our dream. \nScout -  \u20ac10\n *EARLY BIRD* You become a part of the Shift!

You and up to five friends are cave explorers who have become trapped deep underground. You must quickly explore a tile-based cave system, utilise your character's specialist skills and carefully manage your actions to find the way out before your flashlights die and you're lost in the darkness forever.  \nYou'll need to work together to overcome deadly subterranean hazards - stick together for safety, or split up to cover more ground. One wrong step could knock you unconscious and your friends will need to stage a rescue. Light and hope are scarce. And worst of all, you don't think you're alone down here...\n Looking for the Stretch Goal announcements?\n  Let's descend...\n        Check out the how to play video below (courtesy of Toucan Play that Game), which outlines the game setting, objectives, gameplay and some strategies for attempting your escape!\nSub Terra is a team-based push-your-luck game. Together, you'll decide what risks are worth taking and when. The caves is a dangerous place - no matter how well you plan, things WILL go wrong, and your survival depends on how well you react to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE: Escape the cave before you run out of time.\n1) CAVERS: Everyone picks a caver, and gives that caver 3 health points. There are eight characters to choose from in Sub Terra - each has unique abilities that change how they play\n2) TILES: Cavers begin the game on the START TILE. You're all trying to get to the EXIT TILE, which is near the bottom of the TILE STACK.\n3) ACTIONS: Every round, each caver has two action points to spend (and can risk a health point for a third) \nThe basic actions are: \nReveal (Flip the top tile of the stack and place it a gap next to your current location) \nMove (Move to an adjacent connected tile) \nExplore (Reveal a tile, then immediately Move onto it. Faster, but riskier!) \nHeal (You or another caver on your tile regains one health point)\nRun (Move three times) \nTogether, you must place tiles as quickly as possible while not getting too spread out. Why not run off by yourself? Well\u2026\n4) HAZARDS: At the end of each round, resolve the top card of the HAZARD DECK. Each affects a certain type of tile: cavers on those tiles will lose health, and the tile may become harder to traverse. For example, GAS hurts cavers on GAS TILES a medium amount, whereas a FLOOD hurts those on WATER TILES only a little but makes the tile twice as costly to enter in the future.\n If you lose all your health points, you fall UNCONSCIOUS - you're unable to take further actions until another caver reaches your tile and HEALS you. If a friend is nearby, this won't take long. If you've strayed too far down a side passage, it might take some time to reach you. Why does that matter? Well\u2026\n5) RUNNING OUT OF TIME: When the hazard deck runs out of cards, your flashlights are nearly out of power: instead of resolving a card, each caver has a chance of getting lost in the darkness forever. Turns are precious - time spent rescuing fallen cavers or backtracking through difficult passages is time you'd rather spend uncovering more tiles and getting closer to the exit.\n6) HORRORS: You're not alone down here. Some hazard cards can spawn...things...which will relentlessly hunt you down. If they catch you, you'll immediately lose all health points and fall unconscious. If you try to fight them, you will die. RUN.\n7) MORE STUFF: Sub Terra also contains: cave-ins, squeezes, ledges, slides, ropes, rough treacherous terrain, tremors, dynamite, cave diving, \"geology\" and soul-crushing despair \n(soul-crushing despair supplied separately)\nEager to play Sub Terra?

The team is poised!\n\nMANUFACTURE:\nWe're partnering with Whatz games from Shanghai, the team behind Iello's manufacturing, they're fast, reliable and produce high quality games. We're confident they'll produce a box that helps us deliver the Sub Terra experience. I will personally review the blank samples, the pre-production samples, and if the budget permits, visit the factory itself to inspect the production run.\n\nFREIGHT & SHIPPING:\nWe're working with a specially honed team of fulfillment and shipping experts, in Hong Kong, Shanghai, the UK and elsewhere to ensure that we can offer leading backer shipping rates as well as deliver you your games speedily and in good condition. We're aiming to get a chunk of games once manufactured to the UK Games Expo in June, so we're aiming to get shipping on the go before then. November is our worst case scenario. We may obviously sell copies of the game at the UKGE before some backers get their copy elsewhere in the world. We're hoping that this doesn't happen but we want to be upfront, we can't afford as a small publisher to not take that opportunity.\n\nHORRORS:\nThere's a small chance the darkness will close in on the ITB team and the horrors will catch up to us. If this happens, we may not be able to ship your game, as we'll probably have been eaten. But don't worry because we've got he 'Experienced' ability and we've got a +1 to our skill check rolls.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Surface Dweller", "descp": "(Doesn't include 48 flash signed art print)\nINCLUDES:\nCredits in Rules Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}], "stat": ["196 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "Caver's Edition", "descp": "Approx.

Survive against all odds, and shape the fate of this realm!\nSupported Platforms : Windows / Mac / Linux\nDRM : No\nController Support : Yes\nPrimary Languages : English, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4, \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\nNumber of Players : Single-player\nPlanned Final Release Date : Mid 2018\nDescriptors : roguelike, sandbox, action RPG, simulation, dungeon, romance, multiple endings\n                  Drawn by @hepari00\nOverworld Survival - Turn-based, exploration survival on a large hex grid map without hand-holding.\nReal-time Action - A huge motion palette including melee and ranged attacks, spells, dodging, blocking, deflecting and special moves.\nHuge Arsenal - A minimum of 4 weapons types, different armors, accessories and items that can be upgraded, repaired and enchanted.\nDynamic story - Each move and interaction with factions and characters has a huge impact on your multi-ended journey. Gain respect and affection of NPCs that inhabit the dynamic world.\nWe believe that having a game with good combat mechanics isn't the goal to strive for, but only a starting point. That's why we've decided to go beyond the common action RPG. We've put a heavy emphasis on bringing you a dynamic and autonomous fantasy world.\nYou can deal with this world in many ways: You can take up quests, break sieges and stop raids, work for or against a faction, find and explore deep, devious dungeons, meet interesting NPCs and even engage in romantic relationships. \nLet this world feel your presence, and watch as your actions lead to logical consequences and unexpected twists. \n  The once great Kingdom of Verad lies in total chaos. Verad was invaded and conquered by Irsil 12 years ago, but scattered sections of the Resistance army is still bringing the fight to the Irsilian oppressors.\nBut according to some rumors, the insurgency isn't the only thing to be concerned about. There is talk of undeads creeping across the lands, and monsters from old fairy tales returning to this realm, sending their Wildren minions ahead to spread panic, and even a dark ritual to bring doom upon the world is going on in the heart of Verad...\nAnd as always, not many believe these stories.\nIn this grave age, you assume the role of Kuruna, a young strider who travels far distances on a regular basis to help people in need.\nOne day, you receive reports of suspicious Wildren activities in the province of Hummingwoods, and venture out to investigate the situation. What has started as a simple patrol mission for Kuruna, would soon turn into an epic journey that would decide on the fate of the realm.\nKuruna - your avatar in this epic journey.\n  An Authentic world\nYou will travel through many sectors of different settings and types, Explore vast lands with a day&night cycle and weather conditions (fog, rain, snow...) that can make or break your journey.\nYou can't admire the landscape on an empty stomach.\nResource management\nEvery activity drains your stamina, and each battle will exhaust your fighting capacities. Low stamina exposes you to infections and diseases! Therefore manage your resources well, and plan your journey ahead. Take a rest where you can.\nSet up camp to get some healing.\nBalanced Perma-death\nDeath is irrevocable, but there are reasonable ways to prepare for an unforeseen failure. For example, if you fall in a dungeon, someone who holds you dear might come to your rescue.\nThe simple rule is \"I am hard, but I am fair.\" \nAction cards - Use them wisely!\nDynamic AI\nYou are not the only one to roam the world. Various NPCs and combatants fill the sector, playing by the same rules as you.\nThey will chase, fight or flee from enemies, reinforce friendlies, return to base and refit, besiege settlements and do anything that helps themselves or the faction they belong to.\nThe Pale Horde has an endless supply of recruits...\nDynamic Settlements\nSettlements can accommodate different vendors and buildings, and serve as your main source of quests and supplies. As they are necessary for R&R, you might want to protect them from raids and sieges.\n\"A room for two knights, please\"\n  Dynamic Dungeons\nDelve into forgotten ruins, cursed catacombs, lairs, nests, military outposts and more. Special rooms in dungeons are designed to boost each other, filling different roles.\nExamples:\nGuard Room: The guards stationed here can flip a switch to trigger an alarm. A guard that slips away will also alert the dungeon.\nTrap Room: A room designed to kill intruders more easily. Pitfalls, arrow-shooting slits, giant metal ball of death, and many more.\nGenerator Room: Shutting down the generator can also bring the trap rooms offline, making your life much easier.\nTrap Workshop: But if the workshop is still up and running, other facilities such as the generator room will be repaired again.\nAvoid guards by taking a hidden route.\nvs Dungeon Master -- A smart AI is in charge of each dungeon, and it will try to best you by spending its own resources, powering up traps and sending out underlings. If you don't play well, it can become impossible to beat the dungeon... in which case, you should turn around and flee.\n  Fast and tactical real-time battle -- Dash, dodge, block, reflect and use a myriad of special moves against your opponents equipped with dangerous abilities and a smart AI that's capable of great teamwork. And you are not alone - You can also side with other NPCs or have them join you in your fight.\nCritical hit!\n  Countless enemies and bosses -- This is not an empty promise, but something mandatory due to the number of factions that populate the game. We estimate over a hundred enemies and bosses at the start of Steam Early Access.\nThe Hollow Colossus - a walking disaster.\nHuge Selection of Items -- Item and gold drops are random. Weapons, armors and other items come in various qualities and levels, and can be upgraded, enchanted or cursed. \n  Random Events --  Roll a dice! Traditional Pen and Paper-style encounters \n'Strength' : Intimidate people or be the force of nature itself. \n'Agility' : Sneak past enemies, evade traps and find secrets. \n'Constitution' : Withstand poison and survive the worst wounds.\n'Wisdom' : Resolve conflicts without spilling blood!\nKuruna - your avatar in this epic tale.\n  Multi-Ended Dynamic Story -- Sandbox-style gameplay allows for a multitude of possibilities. Each of your actions will lead to various outcomes, and these will, in turn, cause new events to occur. The multi-structured ending will reflect your journey, instead of just forcing you to our will and disregarding the things you've done.\nI believe that just writing a branching story doesn't make it 'dynamic' or 'emergent'. My only solution to make that happen, was, as you can see, 'simulating a world', however small.\nTalking to Liselotte, a knight gone rogue.\nCharacter Interaction -- You will meet a number of interesting characters in PPB. As part of the dynamic world, they are not mere objects of your will, but autonomous personalities that act in their own interest.\nAn example: In the undead-infested sector, you might come across Liselotte who's trying to evacuate all civilians against all orders. Even if you decide not to assist her or don't meet her at all, she will pursue her own honorable goal.\n Attitude System - the main NPCs will make their own judgement on you, depending on how you approach them and how the game plays out for them and for you; under certain circumstances, you might even be able to win their heart. There's no sex and nudity, but there are a number of sweet bonding moments as logical consequences of prior events - in conjunction with characters of both genders.\n Update : About Dynamic Narrative and Romance Options\nPixel Princess Blitz isn't just some side project for fun; it's my passion and hope.\nFor two decades, I've been honing my craft through sleepless nights and restless days - All I've done, all that I am, builds up to this game. That's why not in my faintest dreams would I let this game fail or be abandoned! And the entire team shares this dedication of mine.\n\nPlease have a look at what we're doing, and how far we've come; and imagine how much we could accomplish with a financial help from backers. Perhaps I'd even be able to get more than 5 hours of sleep a day, live longer and make many more games in the future!  \nHelp!!\nYour pledges will go towards everything that puts us a step closer to the goal. With your help, I can:\ncompensate our team for their ongoing effort \ncommission qualified outside help (This would enable me to spend more time on drawing and writing.) \ncover license fees and business costs \nIt would mean the world to me if you would put your trust in me and back my bold attempt of making something that has never been done before.\n Stretch Goals\n#1. Alternative In-game Retro Soundtrack : We will provide an alternative soundtrack that you can switch to in the option screen. Below you can listen to a demo of the main theme's remix track.\n#2. Settler Campaign : This is an additional game mode, separate from the main campaign. You will settle down in a town of your choice, and help it flourish by erecting and upgrading new buildings  with accumulated resources, increasing the population and training town guards. To keep your town happy and well defended, you would have to venture out into the wilderness to find and destroy mob-spawning dungeons and fulfill quests. There could be a deep dungeon with an ever-increasing difficulty. You would be heading there to obtain unique / rare items to equip yourself with, or treasures to boost your town's wealth. There will be a predefined goal in this mode as well, but you will be able to keep on playing after the ending. \n#3. Multiplayer Co-op Mode (Local or Online): You will delve into a gigantic dungeon that consists of randomized and handcrafted floors alongside a friend, either local or over  This dungeon will have exclusive puzzles, death traps and extra enemies and bosses, and you can only hope to overcome them by looking out for each other. \nI have tried to design the tiers in a way that you can find your sweet spot under 50 USD, as we don't want backers with small budgets feel deprived of rewards that are only given for ridiculously high pledges.\nWe have also removed most physical rewards so we don't get distracted off the actual development. Though high amount of pledges would help us for sure, I believe that finishing this game should be our top priority, and the fulfillment process of physical rewards introduces a new risk that could topple the entire undertaking.\nPPB's estimated price at release is 25 USD, so grab a copy before it's too late!\nRewards Overview.\n  Early Access Key :\nGet a DRM-free copy of the game via Steam when we enter Early Access. You'll be able to play even when we move to full release.\nAt the point of Early Access, the game will be as good as finished. We intend to keep improving this game even after its completion, by adding new contents and fixing issues without getting lazy. I've seen great games that could have used a final sprint being abandoned after release which is always disheartening to watch.\nInvitation to Closed Beta : \nYou will be invited to our beta build approx. 4 months before we hit Early Access, and you will retain your copy of the game through Early Access and the full release.\nThe project plan.\nDigital Official Sountrack : \nThe talented Ethan Jeffrey is writing every piece in the magnificent soundtrack of PPB. The digital OST will come with an exclusive cover art that you can admire on your player. Here is one full sample of the soundtrack, please enjoy! :)\nOST Booklet : \nA digital booklet with exclusive illusts, sketches, a comic in color, plus an insightful developer commentary about the music and sounds of PPB. \nPPB Guidebook : \nThis traveler's guidebook will contain stories, diary entries and interviews written by common people of Verad. It contains a bestiary, information about main factions and characters of PPB, exclusive illusts, comic pages and more.\nDigital Art Book : \nThis gigantic art book will allow you to look behind the curtain, bringing you tons of visual materials, including sketches, concept arts, colored in-game art assets in their original size, pixel-art sprites and more.\n    Your Name in the Game : \nYour name may be on the 'Adventurers of the Month' board, found in the Adventurer's guild house.The player will compete against other adventurers by racking up renown, and you can be one of them.\nYour name may also be on the 'Injured Adventurers' board, where the player can donate a few coins and get a better rep.\nThese are great roleplaying opportunities for the player, and you can be a part of that fun experience.\nBe in the Newspaper : \nThe game will generate newspapers that report about recent events. Think up a fictional story to be featured on its front page.\nIt can be about yourself, or even just a funny story. Imagine other gamers reading about the discovery of a dangerous ruin, and finding the story about your heroic act beside that: \"Steve from Bullworth wins the annual eating contest for the third time in a row.\"\nAlso, you will be credited as 'Guest Creator'.\nDesign an Event : \nWork with us to design an event based on your ideas. It can be for the sector map, for dungeons or settlements. Also, you will be credited as 'Event Designer'.\nDesign a Unique Item :\nEquippable items in PPB, such as weapons, shields, armors etc. are randomly generated, but there are also 'unique items' that look different on the inventory screen and have a few special properties that make them stand out. Work with us to design a unique item with special properties, and a lore the player can read after identifying it. You are also free to include your own name in a lore-friendly way.\nDesign a Quest Line :\nWork with us to design a quest and a string of events tied together with it. Do you want a quest that starts out as a simple fetch mission, but later turns out to be a plot designed to benefit a supervillain? It's your choice.\nYou will be credited as 'Questmaster'.\nDesign a Monster :\nCome up with an idea of a regular monster, first. If we agree that it's viable, you can give us some visual cues to make the monster that looks as you envisioned and acts as you've ordered. If you ever wished the monster of your imagination to enter a real video game, now is the chance!\nYou will also be credited as 'Monster Designer'.\nDesign a Faction :\nBeside the major factions such as the rescue force led by Liselotte of Falkenheim, or the resistance led by Erin 'the Lion', there will be a multitude of minor factions, too. (Imagine the smaller houses in Game of Thrones.) Come up with such a minor faction, and be a big part of the game. We will accept your request to modify your faction even after the game is out.\n\n1. First, decide on which side you want to be on.\nDo you like the mighty Irsilos Army? Resistance forces that fight to restorate the Kingdom? Wildren? Shady cults? Healers? We will introduce you to the world of PPB and show you the wide range of your choices, trying our best not to spoil the game's story! :D\n\n2. Name the faction and its leader, and give it a background story.\nIs it a small section of the Resistance that tries to hurt the Irsilos in any way they can? Is it a band of monsters gathered under the command of a crazy mage?\n\n3. Finally, suggest a behavioral pattern of the said faction. Do they keep to themselves, or do they venture out far and often? Do they raid villages, or ambush soldiers?\n   We need your help, but don't want to take them for granted. You can reach these small milestones pulling it with us together! Share the story and join us on Twitter or Facebook, make fanarts and publish them, send tips to reviewers and journalists to get PPB noticed.\nThe rewards are as following.\n6 gems: 16-bit remix soundtrack is added to the OST, and we will reveal one of the remix tracks right away.

We will do our best to stay on our plan, avoiding laziness or arrogance. \nIn case of an event that would hinder us from keeping the release date, we will inform you thoroughly and without delay, and not try to sneak around the problem.\n\nI believe that the current state of Pixel Princess Blitz proves that we've got what it takes to finish the game as we've imagined it and promised to you.

Expect the unexpected as this clown takes you through a world of imagination. Just think, if Super Mario Bros., Yoshi, Kirby, and Little Big Planet had a child, this would be it.\n Acquiring Skills! You start the game with NO skills, only walking. Think Link chasing after his uncle with no weapons at the beginning of A Link to the Past. You need to learn how to clown, before you can jump! (Just kidding, kind of)\nA few of the many skills Ayo acquire throughout the game.\nPlatforming! Each stage has a unique theme and interesting platforms to ensure gaming is fun and not repetitive. Ayo is not the kind of clown to make the same old jokes over and over again. His jokes get better each time. No, really.\n  You don't have to visit japan to experience these rock sumos.\n  Disorienting wheels, it's like being in an amusement park.\n    Just your everyday stroll at the dock.\n  Help me out Mr. Pig.\n    Tire swing for the win!\nComic Book! Ayo\u2019s adventures are so many, we just couldn\u2019t confine them to one game. Discover 3 torn comic book pieces in each stage that form a full comic book page. Collect them all in each stage to put together a spectacular prequel story of Ayo and Bo\u2019s adventures.\nEarly comic book tests.\nVehicles!Take a joy ride on Ayo\u2019s helicopter and tank to do some major damage. No pilot\u2019s license required, which is a good thing because Ayo would never pass.\n  A turtle, on a clown, in a tank...\n  This world looks delicious. Yummy!\n  Early vehicle concepts\nCollectibles and Accessories! Besides the gems you can collect to buy stuff in town, there are also tons of accessories and items you can collect to make Ayo look FABULOUS.\nIt's time to look clown-fabulous.\nSolve light puzzles! Act like a clown detective and solve fun puzzles that get you one step closer to saving Bo! By putting on your problem-solving clown hat, you\u2019ll unlock abilities and useful items that will help you progress in the game.\nHelp Folks! Help memorable characters progress and earn rewards such as new skills and extra life. For Example, if you find a way to help the Shoemaker, he will grant you the jump ability. With each newly acquired skill, you would be able to explore previous areas you weren\u2019t able to reach before. Ayo knows it\u2019s always smart to lend a helping hand!\n  A music loving frog.\n    Show Off! Items collected and trophies earned will be displayed in Ayo\u2019s house that you can visit (maybe even take a nap and use the toilet?) anytime you want. He isn\u2019t an entirely humble clown, but we don\u2019t blame him.\nTown Hub! Ayo can purchase items and extra lives, talk to town folks to hear their stories, and uncover juicy secrets and side quests.\n   What Other People Said!\n  In Ayo\u2019s hometown, things are generally peaceful. He juggles in the park with his talented circus dog, Bo, hangs out at the carnival, and longs after the shoemaker\u2019s daughter. Until one day, his dog goes missing!\nYou play as Ayo, your not-so-average clown embarking on an epic journey in search of his missing (or perhaps ran away, or kidnapped?!) best friend and beloved dog, Bo. What happened to Bo? Will they ever juggle together at the park again? Or put together a legit circus act? You\u2019ll find out along this incredible adventure as you struggle to reunite clown and dog. Like all good adventures, you won\u2019t be all on your own. Ayo\u2019s world is full of friendly people and interesting creatures that are willing to lend a helping hand.  \nYou\u2019ll learn of courage, love, friendship, and the amazing things that happen when you never give up. He might not like to ask for help, but Ayo is ready to admit that he needs you to rescue his best friend and restore peace to his hometown.\n      World Map.\nAyo's world consists of 8 worlds, each of them unique and vastly different. Ayo starts in the Suburb in the comforts of his own home (it may or may not be clown-size), then travels to Town where citizens are buzzing about. From there, adventures abound at the sunny sunflower farm, the strange Sleeping Forest, the fun Flying Whale Dock (Giant sunflowers! Sleeping trees! Flying Whales! Oh my!). At the action-packed Factory, the dreamy Candy Land, the colorful Carnival (Ayo\u2019s favorite hangout), and the exciting Circus, Ayo will be challenged in the most exciting of ways and get closer and closer to Bo!\n  Why are these trees sleeping?\n  Harbor with flying whale, you don\u2019t see this everyday.\n  Watch out for the maniac claws!\n  Everybody loves the carnivals. Where is everybody?\n  Along this incredible adventure, you\u2019ll meet a fat fairy, a giant singing frog, a surprisingly helpful radish (don\u2019t eat him), cake mountains, candy soldiers, and many more fascinating characters. All unique and all very fitting friends and foes for an ambitious little clown on the adventure of a lifetime. These rather creative characters are pictured in the same adorable design as Ayo himself. It\u2019s a feast of color and cuteness!\n  Bo:Ayo's lovely dog. Pan:Ayo's good friend and Shoemaker's daugter.\n  Shoemaker:Pan's grandpa, a grumpy and forgetful old man with a few untold secrets. Balloon Lady:A shy little lady, afraid of needles.\n  Wolf:A very friendly businessman. Thief:Not only good at stealing, but also very foxy.\n    vendor concept arts\n    Enemies and Bosses! Take on bosses bigger than life itself and prove that clowns are much tougher than they seem. Don\u2019t be fooled by Ayo\u2019s handsome look!\n  Watch out for crow droppings.\n            Well, that\u2019s terrifying (and not just for Ayo).\n      Grrrr, I am so cute and round.\n  Depicting the cuter, brighter side of clowns, kids and adult alike will fall in love with the style of this game. We all loved Mario and Yoshi in our childhood. Ayo is our way of giving beloved characters of the past a new life in the form of an incredibly cute clown.  \n\nYou\u2019ll see and hear our inspiration in Ayo the Clown. With a reminiscent look and music score, we\u2019ll take you right back to your childhood (wouldn\u2019t that be nice?). The platformer genre is one that will never go out of style, but we can\u2019t say the same for Ayo\u2019s clown hair.  \n\nAyo the Clown keeps the integrity of the platformer genre while also giving it a clown-tastic spin. The gameplay will feel comfortingly familiar, but still provide a new challenge and a fascinating new story. This game is accessible for all ages with an unforgettable story, and definitely has a high replayability.  \n\nOn a deeper level, we wanted to capture the emotions of loyalty, friendship, and dedication. Ayo develops, just as we all do, throughout the game. By pursuing his best friend and never giving up, Ayo grows into the clown he\u2019s meant to be and that\u2019s something we are incredibly proud of.  \n\nAyo the Clown is also inspired by all the hard working clowns and performers out there. Entertaining others is not a simple task and you haven\u2019t really tried to entertain until you\u2019ve tried juggling knives, blindfolded.\n  More Info. \nImagine your kid playing as himself on this super fun journey.\n  Mockup of Game Box and Art Book.\n  Paper craft Ayo, Poster, and the 3D printed figure(Early Mockup).\n   A clown act isn\u2019t much without music and neither is a quality game. In Ayo the Clown, you\u2019ll hear music from our very talented Nick Dragonas.\n\nThe music of Ayo the Clown will take you back to the fun of classic video games from your childhood with a fitting clown-centered twist. You\u2019ll hear cute squeaks from little Ayo and tunes that will remind you of a joyful circus (we like to make Ayo feel right at home on his adventures). These tunes are all upbeat with a bit of whimsy, just like Ayo, and very fitting for the incredible journey of an adorable clown. It will transport you into the fun and whirlwind world of being a clown with a mission.   \n\n Ayo\u2019s just a little clown, he has a lot of growing up to do. While his maturity is questionable and probably past the point of help, he could use your help laying out his journey.  \nWe\u2019ll send out polls and surveys to our clown-tastic backers letting you choose how dastardly an enemy will appear, what accessories will be available, and more.   \nWe want you to be a part of the fun-filled game-making process. Besides giving us your expert opinion, you\u2019ll also have access to our forum. Whether you\u2019d like to Q&A, discuss a certain clown, or share some fan art, you can do it here.\n  Ayo the Clown is initially planned for PC(Steam) and Mac, but the clown is itching for more.\nPotential platforms include ps4, xbox 360, xbox1, wiiu, 3ds, vita, ios, android.\n  Ayo is not a very well-known clown and neither are we. We aren\u2019t big name veterans from the video game industry nor have we worked on any big AAA games; therefore, we can\u2019t use our fame to share Ayo with the world.  \nWith that in mind, we want to share with you, our passion and skill through our alpha demo (download at the beginning of this campaign). In a previous project, we created the mobile game, Knight Blitz OMG, free in the Apple app store. From this game, you can see how far we\u2019ve come. Ayo the Clown is our biggest and most exciting project and we\u2019re excited to put all our efforts into creating it. We began as just a two man team with our mobile games, but now that we\u2019re creating Ayo (and he\u2019s quite the handful) we expanded to a team of five, talented individuals each with his/her own unique skills.\n Xiu Liang(Director/Artist)-A 2D/3D artist by trade, a gamer by heart. Spent most of his waking hours playing games through the 90s and now it\u2019s time for him to make them. Started Cloud M1 a few years ago and now dedicating 100% of it\u2019s resources to Ayo The Clown. Favorite games: Street Fighter, Mario Bros, Zelda.\nJD Lu(Game Designer/Developer)-A dreamer and a developer, his biggest passion is to make video games. Helped in building Knight Blitz OMG and another very ambitious adventure game under Cloud M1 studio. When it comes to his passion, he doesn\u2019t clown around. Favorite games: Monster Hunter, Dragon Quest, Fallout.\nQuentin Bellay(Developer)-Growing up playing games like Sonic and Shenmue since 1991, only until recently has he figured out that his passion is to develop them. Besides helping making Ayo The Clown a reality, he also partakes in game jams, you know, he likes the excitement. Favorite games: Sonic, Shenmue, Super Meat Boy\n.Mao Liang(Developer)-Having worked with Xiu on all the previous apps/games, Mao\u2019s relationship with him is second to none, also being Xiu\u2019s older brother helps. When not gluing his face to the monitor, he glues onto his fish tank to not miss the tiniest life he\u2019s created in his aquarium. Favorite games(enjoys the most when playing together with his kids): Minecraft, LittleBigPlanet, Disney Infinity.\nChristine Tada(Project Manager)-A casual gamer by day, and casual gamer by night too. Loves playing video games, especially those with a good storyline, gorgeous graphics, and amazing music. Helping with the PR aspect and managing Ayo the Clown and making sure the world knows about it. Favorite games: Witcher Series, Fire Emblem, Diablo III, Portal\nNick Dragonas(Musician)-A musician and composer, since 2000 he composed countless original music ranging from television to video games. He\u2019s capable of composing music in many different musical genres, and his best friend is his guitar. Favorite games: Battlefield series, Batman Arkham City, Rayman.\nBackers-We count our backers as honorary team members and future clowns. Your support means so much to our team and to Ayo. We look forward to talking with you in our community and getting your opinion.\n Video games are expensive and time-consuming to make. Despite his small size, Ayo is a very ambitious clown and so is his game.    \nWe need to give Ayo more love and work on his game full-time. Funding will not only help us concentrate fully on Ayo (no need for moonlighting as a clown anymore, j/k), but it will also help us put food on the table for our families. \nAyo is a lonely clown and we hope to find a family for him at Kickstarter. The biggest benefit of crowdfunding is building a community around the game\u2019s development and having fans to give feedback and build the game with us.\n\n Ayo is one impatient clown, so we couldn\u2019t help but get started on his game.   \nFrom early concepting to a somewhat final design.\nSo far, the character controller and engine is in a good place and the overall game structure is set up. We\u2019ve built part of the 3D assets, including some of the worlds and enemies, which we are very excited to show you. \nThe bigger task ahead, which we\u2019d love the backers\u2019 input on, is to polish the story and design fun, memorable levels. Creating a deep, inspiring story such as Ayo\u2019s takes time and that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019d like to focus on this game full-time.\nWe want to launch this game at the end of 2017 or early 2018.\n Ayo is one handful of a clown and any support we get from you will be invaluable to us and help us make this game even more fun and quirky.\nWe thank you in advance, our clown-loving friends. Ayo The Clown will only be possible with your support.\nAyo never quite sits still. To follow along with his progress and to find out more about the campaign, follow Ayo the Clown on social media.\nTwitter, Facebook, Site. \n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will be the first to admit that Ayo sometimes falls flat on his face. Sometimes it\u2019s on purpose and followed by a lemon-cream pie to the behind, but other times he ends a routine with a slapstick comedy piece that wasn\u2019t in his plans. A project this size will have several potential problems that could arise and we will do our best to minimize it or mitigate it without taking a pie to the face. Since most of the engine is done, technically it\u2019s a matter of fixing bugs and designing more fun to play levels and 3D assets. We are very confident that this game will finish on time, but we are only human and the world is not perfect. The greatest risk we face could be a slight delay to ensure the game is fun and up to par with our standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Cloud M1 LLC\n2 created \u00b7 32 backed\nI am a 3D animator, gamer father who's been working on this game for a few years now.

The game is fully designed and developed in Rome, near the Roman Forum, and we're striving to create a highly engaging and immersive playing experience that takes you back to a period of glory.\nMaking video games is a costly passion and we have already gathered \u20ac250k from our own pockets and invested it for the development of ROMA. We believe that if you love doing something you have to start right away and everything needed will come along the way. It would have been very hard to receive funding through traditional methods for a game like ROMA, and at the same time we don't want to compromise on quality and gameplay to please some external investors or publishers. We love Kickstarter as it is a way to directly reach the people who love to play strategic games as much as we do and we want to share our dream with them. We want to be accountable only to our principles and to you, our supporters and co-founders of ROMA.\nKickstarter is a great way to interact with you and make everybody feel welcome and that they are an active part of this project. We want you to get involved and to help us with your feedback and suggestions to make ROMA the very best strategic indie game ever created. We want you to know what's going on behind the scenes, from the the initial development to the final completion, and we want you to enjoy the journey together with us, with more awesome things to come.\nWHAT IS YOUR MONEY GOING TOWARD?\nWe need to raise \u20ac80k to complete the initial stage of the project and to make the game fully playable. All the money will help us to run a bullet-proof team with the highest quality results. We are are creating a new way of playing strategic games, from an open and expandable gameplay, to a new graphic style that leaves plenty of room for your imagination when it comes to \"completing the scene\" and to developing new possibilities of interaction between players. We have paid careful attention to the historical reconstruction and we\u2019ve also designed the game to have a modular system that can expand as the budget rises. We have planned tons of great game add-ons that we can bring to life through stretch goals if we reach our initial goal. We plan to recover our initial investment by selling in-game goods later on, so all the additional money we raise through Kickstarter we'll go straight to a richer gameplay by adding more stories, more graphics, more adventures and more fun.\nGameplay (Prototype / Under Development)\nPLAY\n\n The Music of ROMA\nThis trailer music by (Musician's name) gives you a taste of the music of ROMA. Should ROMA become a commercial success, we'll produce an epic album with additional live ancient instruments. \nStart in Rome's Archaic Age\nRomulus was the first King of Rome. When he founded Rome in 753 B.C. he couldn't imagine that a puny village of the Iron Age would one day turn into the mightiest empire of the Ancient World. Or perhaps did did he planned this from the very beginning? Find out how life was almost 3000 years ago and face all the challenges that the early kings of Rome needed to address to survive in the Archaic Age.\nBuild a mighty Capital.\nBuild the ancient city of your dream and unleash your creativity with beautifully designed buildings, wonders and decorations that change through the ages and give you the exact measurement of how your power has grown. Show off your mighty Capital and set an example of beauty and sound city planning. Enjoy every 3D building with its peculiar animation and function and relocate the city blocks as your needs expand. \nFight real-time epic Battles.\nChallenge thousands of players around the world and direct super-interactive and realistic units with a click of the mouse or the touch of a finger.\nPlan and lead your wars with 55 unique, beautifully designed units that can multiply into thousands at your command. Enjoy the feeling of epic fights, direct your army exactly where you have planned and zoom in and out to watch spectacular battles unfold. Challenge other leaders and barbarians and be ready to invade a nation as the opportunity arises.\n  Conquer the known-world and achieve the \"Pax Romana\".\nBuild, Conquer, Expand. The Roman Empire is big. Everybody is fighting for supremacy and above all for honour and power. ROMA is a virtually endless game and you'll always have things to do as a leader. Your goal is to achieve the PAX ROMANA and to establish peace and prosperity for your nation. The Known World is conquered once the strongest alliance gains control over 51% of the map (and this is not an easy task). But this is not the end, the fight for supremacy continues and you have to be smart and wise to stay in power. Will you fight for glory? Will you fight for Rome?\nUnlock the 4 Ages of Rome in order to advance from chieftain to emperor.\nThe game is being developed in Shiva engine for Web Browser (PC / MAC), iOS and Android. The game will be available in English, and with your help we may add French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish languages.\n  Your Glorious Rewards for being a founder of ROMA Blades of Victory.

Together we have brought several award-winning products to market, and gained all the necessary experience needed to bring Roma Blades of Victory to life. We are passionate about the project, and we love ROMA.\nROMA Blades of Victory Team\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re turning a dream into reality with ROMA - Video games are complex projects, especially those that are about strategy and with an historical base. Fortunately, we collectively have great experience with the technology, design and production. We are a team of professionals with a combined 120+ years experience in Game Design, Production, 3D modelling, Engine Design, Project Management, Sound Design, App Development, and we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a high-quality game that will honour the name of ROMA.\n\nOur workflow has been planned and designed to complete the full game structure first and then to refine and enhance every detail. We want to have a product that has been fully developed and tested before it is released. ROMA will be out in the first half of 2017 and we've set our first deadline to 21st April which is the day Rome was founded in 753B.C. (This amounts to a total of 24 months of development since we began working on the game.) We are also planning to bring new talents on-board to further polish the game and make it really great.\n\nWith such an ambitious project and schedule, you may ask yourself how we can still deliver ROMA if we don't meet the goal. We\u2019ll tell you straight away that ROMA is a modular game and it is fully scalable, which means that we can still release a great title by focusing on our core objectives, while still adding new features and a richer gameplay as our resources increase. As our target goal is reached, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a full and satisfying Ancient-Roman experience with full details and thicker plots and surprises. As we exceed our goal and reach further targets, we'll continue to enrich the gameplay by adding more stories, graphics, adventures and more fun. Should ROMA also become a success outside of Kickstarter, we've already planned a series of exciting game expansions and cross-media gaming experiences.\n\nByosphera is also establishing a series of side activities like the production and selling of Ancient Roman merchandise and gadgets that can partially cover some of our game expenses. Of course, even if we cannot develop a game like ROMA without your support, we are still investing our own resources in the development of the game. This is our dream and just like you, we want ROMA to be the best it can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Byosphera Srl\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nByosphera is an Italian game developer and publisher, focussed on next generation mobile, tablet and browser games.

The game blends elements of drafting forces, card management, and special dice to enable skilful use of combos and player influence over chance.\nThe Titans have escaped their prison in Tartarus to wreak havoc and devastation upon the world. Seeking revenge on their jailers, they attacked the home of the Gods - Mount Olympus itself! The battle was long and closely-fought, but in the end the Gods were victorious. Even so, the battle cost them dearly.\nThe surviving Gods are greatly weakened and have lost their immortality. The only way to regain this power is to assimilate the energy stones called Omphalos. The first to absorb enough of this energy will become the new ruler of the Gods, and can create a Pantheon in their own image.\nA typical army is made up of one God and their group of fighters. Here, Athena, the Lernean Hydra, Achilles, Odysseus and a group of five hoplites. Illustration by Stefan Kopinski.\n  The Gods, monsters, and heroes of Mythic Battles: Pantheon are represented by incredibly detailed miniatures. They\u2019ll make your tabletop come alive!\nEach miniature possesses unique powers: Zeus throws lightning bolts, the Hydra regenerates, Achilles is almost invulnerable\u2026 These powers can be combined to create devastating effects. At the start of each game you choose a God, and then build a warband around them. Choose wisely!\nAfter you've chosen your God, you get a recruitment point budget to buy their followers with. This budget depends on the number of players at the table. In the more narrative campaign mode, you play with a pre-selected team of fighters that evolves from one scenario to the next.\nYour warriors fall into four different categories: Gods, Heroes, Monsters, and Troops. Each type has its own advantages, and you may build your army with any combination you like \u2013 the only restriction is the overall cost. If your God only wants Monsters to fight beside them, that\u2019s fine.\nClick the link to download the first scenario of our Hephaestus campaign.\nEverything you need to use a character in the game is written on their character dashboard.\nEach character has an individual Dashboard which lists their cost, statistics, powers, and skills. These can change as the character takes wounds.\nSTAT CLIPS\nIn order to track the changing stats of each God, Monster, and Hero, their dashboards can be fitted with specially designed stat clips. These plastic clips simply snap on to a dashboard, showing the current stats in a window. As the unit takes damage, the stat clip slides easily down the track to show the modified stats.\nThe core box comes with enough clips for all 14 dashboards, including the KS Exclusive Apollo. Clips are removable and can be swapped between dashboards if you choose.\nThe cost in recruitment points tells you how useful a character is in battle.\n  Plastic production miniatures - Zeus (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron), Ares (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Athena (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani & Aragorn Marks) & Hades (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon).\nThe Gods are the most powerful miniatures in your army. However, since having your God slain means you are out of the game, they can also spell your defeat. \nPlastic production samples\n    Plastic production miniatures - Heracles, Achilles, Leonidas (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Odysseus (sculpted by Irek Zieli\u0144ski) and Atalanta (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani).\nHeroes are often leaders, they enhance the use of troops and offer greater control over your army.\n  Plastic production miniatures - Medusa (sculpted by Aragorn Marks), Minotaur (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Cerberus (sculpted by Edgar Ramos), Hydra (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron).\nMonsters are formidable in battle, though they lack the ability to command others.\nPlastic production samples.\n    Plastic production miniatures\nUnits of Troops are represented by more than one miniature. Troops are the only kind of unit that can return to play after being destroyed.\nAll miniatures presented in this campaign will be plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nOne feature of Mythic Battles: Pantheon is the number of large miniatures included in the game. The Gods in particular are all at least 65mm (2.5 inches) tall, and some of the Monsters also tower over normal mortals.\nMythic Battles: Pantheon plays a lot on scale. The Gods are gigantic, as are some of the creatures you can recruit into your army.\nA LOT OF SPEARS\nThe universe of Mythic Battles: Pantheon, counts many a spear, sword, and other long, thin weapon among its vast armoury. To avoid all the bent weapons we so often see in other board games\u2019 PVC miniatures, we\u2019ve decided to innovate by making some of the weapons in ABS (hard plastic) instead.\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\n    Activation cards allow you to activate the illustrated unit on your turn. Art of War cards work kind of like Jokers.\nYou activate the units in your army by using the cards that make up your deck. Each unit has 3-5 Activation cards. This means that before exhausting your deck, you\u2019ll be able to activate them that many times. Particularly fast or aggressive units tend to have 5 Activation cards. More cautious or slow units only have 3.\nThe second type of cards are Art of War cards, a kind of Joker that can be spent to trigger special effects such as drawing 2 extra cards, searching your deck for a specific Activation card, activating a second unit, or using a special power. Clever use of your Art of War cards is often the key to victory.\n  Mythic Battles: Pantheon\u2019s special dice are marked 1 to 5, with one blank face\nCombat in Mythic Battles: Pantheon uses special dice. When a unit attacks, you\u2019ll roll a number of dice equal to your fighter\u2019s attack rating. Each die is read individually and needs to equal or beat the defence rating of the opposing warrior to injure them. Blank faces count as misses.\nEach 5 may be re-rolled, and the new result is added to 5. This allows you to hit enemies with a defence greater than 5.\nOn top of the re-rolls, you can discard any rolled die (except for blanks) to add +1 to the result of any other die. If, thanks to this, you obtain a 5, it can be re-rolled. Each die with a final result that is equal to or higher than the defence value of the attacked warrior inflicts 1 wound. Move the statistics clip down by one line per wound.\n  The Olympus and Styx boards, ravaged by the cataclysm.

Artwork by Georges Clarenko\nMythic Battles: Pantheon is played on a series of lavishly illustrated, mounted boards (60x60cm). Each is divided into a number of areas for game play. Your miniatures are placed in one area at a time, and move from one area to the next. The symbol in each area\u2019s center tells you what type of area it is. The number in each area tells you the maximum number of units it can hold. You can place trees on a Forest area and broken columns in a Ruined area.\nThe boards are also compatible with the Conan game both in style of art and general layout. This means that owners of Conan can use the Mythic Battle boards for new scenarios.\nThere are four boards in the Mythic Battles: Pantheon core box: Olympus, Tartarus, Styx and the Minos Labyrinth.\nHere is a close-up picture of an actual Conan board. Mythic Battles: Pantheon's boards will be of the exact same quality.\nOlympus has been put to fire and sword after the battle against the Titans. This board is ideal for beginners, offers a great variety of terrains, favors movement, maneuvers and close combat. \nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\nTartarus is the prison of the Underworld. It is there that Monsters and Titans were safely locked away\u2026 until they escaped. This sinister board requires zigzagging between the giant chains and spherical metallic prison, unless you have the Climb skill - particularly valuable here.\nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\nThe antechamber of the river Styx was the place where souls prepared to embark upon their journey into the Underworld, but it is also the route through which they\u2019ve escaped, ever since Hades no longer watches over them. This board is rugged and movement isn\u2019t easy. Only the smallest units can sneak into the crevasses flooded by the Styx. This is a more complex board that favours ranged attacks.\nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\nThe palace of Minos was built above the labyrinth in which the Minotaur was imprisoned. The cataclysm caused the collapse of the palace, and this board is now composed of two levels. On the upper floor, you will have a view over the maze and can easily take on anything that moves. But there are only two ramps to access it, so controlling these can be vital.\nArtwork by Georges Clarenko\n  Here is a quick presentation of the rules by Paul Grogan:\nPlease note that this video displays dials that were used in an earlier version of the game. We changed them to the current enhanced more ergonomic dashboards.\nHere\u2019s a video of a 2-player game by Beasts of War:\n 4-player video (part 1) by Tric Trac: Explanations & set-up\n 4-player video (part 2) by Tric Trac: Beginning of the game\n  4-player video (part 3) by Tric Trac: Combat!\n  4-player video (part 4) by Tric Trac: Debriefing the battle\nCheck out our other videos on our Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeD16Wayf5GLJtyzsL6EMHA\nBased on our Conan experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), Japan (Japanese backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package that is roughly the same weight as Conan (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. \nUSA: $20-$30 to most states. $30-35 to Alaska, Hawaii & Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $20-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $18-$30 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package, there is too great a risk of the package being sent back to us.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\n  We are actually not one but two companies. Monolith is the publisher of the very successful Conan board game, who broke records when it was launched on Kickstarter and whose first wave has just been delivered to backers (everything but the 3 expansions which will arrive soon). Since Monolith's team was so busy coping with Conan's extraordinary success which meant much more work than expected, another team was gathered to work on a new project so a new company was created: Mythic Games.\nBeing prepared: it\u2019s not just for Boy Scouts. It is, in fact, one of the main lessons learned from Conan, and which has been applied to Mythic Battles: Pantheon. That preparation has taken many forms.\nThe rules are written and laid-out in a beta version accessible now. They have been played over a thousand times, so they work!\nWorld-class artists have helped to create a visual framework for the game, to help you understand the vision.\nTo help the physical production of the game work smoothly, Monolith hired an experienced production manager. She regularly visits the factory to check the status of each element in the process, just as she did with Conan. Working with the same factory, and building on existing relationships, builds greater confidence in the manufacturing process and reduces the chances of unpleasant surprises during fulfilment.\nOne direct result of this additional preparation are the grey miniatures of the core box you see on this page. They are not mock-ups, 3D prints, resins, or carefully Photoshopped 3D renders \u2013 they are the first test shots from the actual production moulds. All the miniatures from the core box are at this stage already, giving time to refine and perfect this already impressive first test.\nOn top of the people from Monolith and Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Mythic Battles: Pantheon.

To this date, over 2,500 different players in France and abroad. This is without counting the hundreds of playtests that the game has been subjected to internally. Check out a few pictures of what we called the Mythic Tour, that brought us to dozens of cities for public playtests of the game: \n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTWO COMPANIES - ONE GREAT GAME\nHindsight is always 20/20, but you can\u2019t get it in advance. Or can you? By working together with Monolith, Mythic Games has been able to draw on their experience with Conan. This has allowed Mythic Battles: Pantheon to avoid many of the pitfalls which Conan discovered the hard way.\n\nSo, Mythic Battles: Pantheon is brought to you jointly by Monolith and Mythic Games. Each company has been responsible for specific parts of the process, playing to the different strengths and experiences of the individuals involved. \n\nThe teams have also adapted their work to the different stages of game production. As with any other manufactured product, some tasks happen at the start, others later on, and some continue throughout. In our case, as tasks were completed on Conan, the attention of the relevant staff shifted to Mythic Battles to apply their experience to the new project. Even so, the core Conan team was, and remains, focussed on that game alone: their task is not yet complete so they cannot move onto new ones. \n\nAs an example of this division of responsibilities, Mythic Games took care of the game design, art direction, communication, and the Mythic Tour to gaming events across France and beyond. \n\nMonolith, on the other hand, were focussed mainly on the manufacturing end of the process. Working with the same factory, and having just finished one demanding project, they have even been able to improve on the already excellent quality of the Conan miniatures. \n\nIn the future both companies hope to produce many more games, and by focussing on quality, and learning from their mistakes, they aim to produce games that are a pleasure to own and play.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nThe estimated delivery date for Mythic Battles: Pantheon is December 2017, but please keep in mind that this is only an estimate. Also note that due to logistical restrictions in different regions, some backers may receive their pledge rewards before others. We will be doing our utmost to avoid these situations and, in the unlikely event that we are unable to deliver the game, we will be refunding pledges in full. \n\nDue to the fact that the core box of Mythic Battles: Pantheon is 95% complete as we head into this campaign, and that we have already signed agreements with many of those in charge of production, delivery and distribution, we have no reason to suspect that this eventuality will ever occur. We\u2019ve successfully delivered Conan (only the three expansions and the campaign are not delivered yet, they are in production now and the estimated delivery is March/April 2017).\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, fees included. After which, we have a policy of no questions asked for a refund, but will be unable to refund you the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe (as we will not be refunded by them after this 14 day period), Pledge Manager and also the other charges for your payment (PayPal, VISA, credit card...). This represents approximately 15% of the full payment. Once we have started to process and packed your order, when the first ship leaves China, refunds will no longer be available. If any part of an order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the cost of this component, fees included. Refunds within the 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. Any refunds requested after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in the USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8-weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf these terms are not acceptable to you, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in stores.

You can hear them when you are alone and close your eyes, the nausea and the cold sweat that announce to you that there is no hope and that one day, they will reign on earth, as they did countless aeons, under the command of their disgusting and pustulant King, Ctulhu, until they were stopped by unfathomable heroes, who managed to seal it for thousands of years, with the secrets of the ninja's arts, and their tenderness.  \nPaw Fury is a platformer beat'em up video game with Metroidvania style elements, with craftables weapons and armors and three playable characters with totally different abilities and weapons; this gives Paw Fury a big replay value. \nWe opted for this mix of styles for our first video game, because these are the kind of games that we have always loved, action packed with a good share of puzzles, gathering and armament options. \nWe got our inspiration from games like Megaman, Metal Slug, Castlevania, among many other games that despite of time they don't get old nor lose the fun factor. The characters in Paw Fury grant the game a unique personality, using comedy as the cornerstone to develop a story of world conquest and cuteness. Paw Fury's official website.\nPaw Fury allows you to go from shooter to beat'em up depending on the character you choose to play. The stars of this story are Pugginstein, Shaggrath y P-ludis.\nPugginstein wields firearms, machine guns and cannons. Furthermore, his armor is equipped with a jetpack that helps his movement, because he's the least nimble character of them. His armor has a unique ability, it can transform into a tank too. By crafting new weapons, Pug can improve damage, more area of effect and other kinds of enhancements. Crafting his armors he will be more resistance to physical damage, able to use his jetpack for longer periods of time, and also a more powerful tank, etc.  \nPugginstein, guardian of the Bacon of Destiny\nShaggrath is a black ninja cat that is a master of swords and chains. He's the most dexterous of our three heroes, he can make extra jumps in the air and hide in the shadows. Crafting his equipment he can be even faster, improve his weapons reach and cause extra damage, etc.\nShaggrath, Master of the Shadow Blade\nP-ludis is the calmest one, and the strongest too. He mainly attacks with his iron fist weapons, but he's also able to use his Ki to strike with energy explosions and create magic-like effects. P-ludis's chooses to fight close range, as his hits are very powerful. Crafting fist weapons he can improve his damage and Ki usage. He can craft special items that will teach him new abilities.  \nP-Ludis, Mighty Fist\nThe stages will not be linear, they will allow exploration in each mission, so the player could gather the needed items to craft his new gear. New and different weapons will grant access to new zones, big and small, as a result, the game experience will vary not only based on the character you play, but the different weapons you craft.\nMissions in the main path will reveal segments in the story, confront the players against the main villains and will ultimately lead to the great final battle against the scariest and most powerful enemy.\nWe have been in the software development business for several years, earning experience in a lot of development fields such as web sites, mobile applications, and many others. After work for third parties we decided to begin a project of our own and so Paw Fury was born. We always dreamed about making video games, but either because we lack of resources or time, we have reserved it until now. Kickstarter is the platform that can finally make possible our goal.  \nEarly stage of animation\nWe want the kickstarter community to help us finish our game, Kickstarters is the place where we can find support from those who share the nostalgia of the metroidvania genre and who, like us, have also dreamed of making one on their own.\nMore recent stage of animation\nWith your help we can make a much better video game than if we only used our free time and limited resources, it will be more professional and will have way more content.\nFor now, we only have planed to release Paw Fury on Windows, Linux and Mac. But we don't discard the idea of releasing on other platforms.\nOf course, backing our campaign will have it's rewards, not only you will help making this game a reality and playing it before anyone else, you can also get items that will only be available for this Kickstarter campaign.\nThis is tentative design for the T-shirt.\n This is an early concept of the final boss.\nCthulhu Early Concept\nShare Paw Fury on Facebook\n       Share Paw Fury on Twitter\n   Disclaimer\nImages, sound and art in the campaign video and the rest of the campaign are not final for the game.

The early colonists on Mars discovered an ancient Peregrinus ruins containing technology unheard of at the time. Humanity used this knowledge to spread and drain new worlds of resources bringing with it new heights and new depths. They found Elido, a planet rich in exotic materials, technology and ruins of the Peregrinus. Their former home, now desolated and returned to nature. Humanity started fighting itself for the riches the world contained, corporate greed reached fever pitch.\nEnter Overstep, a tournament broadcast throughout the galaxy. It exploded from an underground gambling league, into a way for the corporations to show they were superior. Today these corporations are on the verge of war. Will the next season of Overstep lead to all out war or greater profits?\nYour spot in Overstep is reserved, transfer your mind into a Vanguard today and show us what you are made of! Earn glory, tear your enemies limb from limb and be broadcast around the galaxy for your efforts. Join the league, earn your rewards and decimate all who stand before you in our gladiatorial arena!\nIn the words of Sto Adrian, our composer: \"The prime objective of Overstep's soundtrack is immersion. A combination of musical styles, it aims to fit like a glove over the game's visual style, lore and overall personality. It's varied without losing depth, it's powerful at times without being cliched or campy, and it seeks to impact you emotionally. It makes the player feel invested and connected to the world.\"\n\"FORGOTTEN is a dramatic take on the violent fighting that takes place on Elido. It's a tale of struggle that forces the listener into the plodder's perspective.\" - Sto Adrian, Composer\n\"FAHRENDEPTH's own title is conflictual and chaotic to begin with. It merges classical bowed strings and distorting guitars into a symphony of fiery menace, evoking an immersive atmosphere that's sure to keep you glued to your seat.\" - Sto Adrian, Composer\nHere's some of the rewards we've prepared for you! Any in-game visuals and skins are not final. They will be much more awesome!\nWe have prepared our studio wall to write thousands of names on it!

Still, everything needs a balance. Go outside.\"\nCMO Batuhan Avucan - \"I hate when companies don't answer to my emails. This is why me and my team will answer to all of you!\"\nCEP Aidan Roberts - \"At my core I\u2019m a gamer so I know what is important for you in Overstep. I make sure the game is fun and that we include what you need to enjoy yourselves.\"\nLead Game Designer Grant Egglestone - \"My aim for Overstep is to bring breakneck, thrilling gameplay to the FPS genre and ensure style is as important as slaughter. We are wrapping this in an in-depth customization system that is deep in lore. I can't wait for you all to play it.\"\nArt Director Tim Kaney - \"Art is freeing. Games are mind-bending. We are liberators working to free your mind.\"\nSince the beginning, the scope and vision for Overstep has scaled remarkably. The somewhat different hobby FPS has grown into something that could be an exciting experience for millions. As we've finally locked down what we want to build, it's time to have everyone working full time and do everything to launch Overstep in 2017.\nThere is a big difference between a prototype and a final look, so you can assume how much work goes into making things pretty. If we reach our initial funding amount, a stretch goal for visuals will be revealed. Another important factor with Kickstarting Overstep, is that it allows us to communicate with you. This, combined with publishing the game ourselves, means that we can actually tweak the game based on YOUR feedback. Here's where we've been discussing it so far: FPS Must-Have's\nWith this funding, all of the above will be possible.\nWe are planning to have Overstep ready to launch on PC, before the end of 2017. The Xbox One version would follow shortly after, dependent on resources and the performance of this Kickstarter campaign. However, if our crowdfunding is a big success and stretch goals met, then we will look to secure the resources required to pull off a simultaneous, day-one release on both platforms.\nTaxes are included in the expenses above.\n\nTo make the best of Overstep, we will need to get our team members on full time. This will be done immediately upon reaching our funding goal. Therefore the vast majority of our budget will be allocated to wages, plus the cost of outsourcing testing. Overstep is a real passion project for the Gamecan team and we\u2019ve all made financial sacrifices to get it this far. We\u2019ll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter doesn\u2019t succeed, but the game will be bigger and better if it does!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are entering a very competitive market, with a lot of games to choose from.

You never have to readjust or fluff, and your head doesn\u2019t sink or shift. SCIENCE! \nPurple includes an adjustable air booster if you want to add a little extra height to your pillow. This is great for side sleepers and snorers, making the Purple\u00ae Pillow perfect for just about anyone. \nThe Purple\u00ae Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 and air booster fit perfectly inside a super soft cover. The cover is made from polyester to make it gentle on your face, breathable so you don't sleep hot, and stretchy so your head can sink into the squishy Purple goodness.\n Every time you share Purple on social media, the Sleepy Scientist will save a Wookie! Support Purple (and Chewbacca) by taking 2 seconds to share the Purple\u00ae Pillow with your friends! \n               Who Needs a Purple\u00ae Pillow? \nAnyone who sleeps or has a head.\nThe traditional idea of a \u201cpillow\u201d isn\u2019t working. They\u2019re lumpy, flat, hot, and lack proper neck support.\nWe didn\u2019t treat the pillow like an accessory to your mattress, but as a mattress in and of itself\u2014a bed for your head.\nThe head has its own set of needs: \nYour 8-10 pounds of precious cargo need to be supported and comfortable \nYour shoulder needs some strain relief \nYour neck needs gentle, yet firm support \nYou need breathability so your head stays cool all night \nYou need a pillow that keeps its shape so you aren\u2019t waking up and readjusting \nWe reimagined the \u201cpillow\u201d as a \u201chead bed\u201d and used the same revolutionary material that has worked so well for so many people in our Purple\u00ae Bed to create it.\nWhat\u2019s the Purple\u00ae Bed? \nThe Purple\u00ae Bed is the first product we launched on Kickstarter exactly one year ago. The response to our launch has been so overwhelmingly positive, and the warm welcome we received on Kickstarter encouraged us to come back with our new, game-changing product.\nThe mattress is made with a layer of Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122\u2014a super stretchy, super durable, non-toxic, food-grade material that we invented to give people the perfect balance of support and comfort they need in a mattress.\nThe Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 is arranged in a grid system we call the Smart Comfort Grid\u2122. This grid system creates small columns all over the mattress that help support your body while allowing your pressure points to relax into the mattress.\nThis is all wrapped in a super stretchy and soft cover to make the perfect mattress. And now we have the perfect pillow to match! \nRevolutionary Technology & Design, You Say? \nIndeed!\nUnlike most pillows, our Purple\u00ae Pillow isn\u2019t a bunch of old, ineffective materials smashed together in an uncomfortable, lumpy rectangle. Instead, we took the game-changing material in our mattress, Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122, and optimized it for your head.\nThe pillow is 24\" long, 16\" wide, and about 3\" tall without the booster. The optional air booster adds up to two extra inches of height. \nWarning: This pillow is not for pillow fights! It weighs about 10 pounds, and that\u2019s a good thing because weight equals quality. Purple is heavy because we use the highest quality materials to make our ultimate comfort technology. \nPurple believes all sleepers deserve a great night\u2019s sleep, so we wanted to make the Purple\u00ae Pillow customizable. That\u2019s why we included an air booster that can be inflated to raise the pillow to your desired height. \nThis is great for side sleepers or snorers who need a little extra boost (see what we did there?) when they sleep. No matter how you sleep, your neck should always be in beautiful alignment with the Purple\u00ae Pillow!\nThe material on the outside of the pillow (or head bed, as we like to call it) is super soft and comfortable. It is made from polyester. This fabric makes your pillow ultra-touchable and super stretchy, so your face feels like it\u2019s being hugged by a panda bear while your head comfortably relaxes into a pool of Purple awesome. \nPurple vs. Other Pillows \nNeck support completely evacuates to either side of your head, forcing you to fluff all night.\n  The Wedge causes neck strain so your spine can't be in perfect alignment. Ouch!\n  Too much neck support means neck and shoulder pain so you look like an evil henchman the next day.\n  Not enough or too much neck support\u2014either way you wake up sweaty from the hot memory foam.\n  The Purple\u00ae Pillow perfectly cradles your cranium while supporting your neck without you needing to readjust.\nWhat\u2019s In It For Me?\n   What Are Other People Saying About Purple? \n\"Purple is one of the most unique mattresses I have tested to date. A combination of a Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 and two layers of polyurethane foam come together for a feel unlike any other. There are great levels of support, comfort, bounce, and exceptional cooling. Purple does a nice job of relieving pressure points in addition to minimizing motion transfer across the mattress.\" - Sleepopolis Review, 4.7 Stars\nHow Purple, Uber and Airbnb Are Disrupting and Redefining Old Industries - Entrepreneur\n3 Highly Memorable Product Demos That Made Their Brand - Inc.\nCan't Fall Asleep or Stay Asleep? 6 Products That Will Change Your Life - Lifehack\nPurple Is Better Than Any Mattress at Macy's, Walmart or Costco - Clapway\nWhy Kickstarter? \nStep one in our mission to bring comfort to everyone in the world was the Purple\u00ae Bed. We were blown away by the incredible support we got from the Kickstarter community and for the mattress after our campaign ended. Clearly, we are addressing a problem millions of people are experiencing every day: bad, uncomfortable sleep that affects their health, productivity, and happiness.\nWith the Purple\u00ae Pillow, we begin step two. We are calling on our community of innovators on Kickstarter to help us launch this new, unique product. We can\u2019t do this without your support, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve come back to Kickstarter, to share the next step in our comfort mission with you first. \nHistory of Purple \nIn 1989, two brothers, engineers Tony and Terry Pearce, partnered to change the world.\nTony\u2019s 13 years of experience in advanced aerospace materials, and Terry\u2019s 20 years of experience in manufacturing, design, and project management, led to a partnership creating high-tech carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs.\nThe Pearce brothers created technology that was used in products by Nike, Johnson & Johnson, and Hill-Rom. But, eventually, the Pearces set out to create a technology that could revolutionize cushioning at a much lower cost. Purple began to evolve through a series of discoveries and product developments. The first breakthrough came in 1996, when the Pearces invented Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122.\nThis amazingly soft, yet strong material could stretch 15 times its resting size, was uber-durable, and never took a body impression. The key discovery came when Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 was molded in a shape that could \u201crelax\u201d under pressure points, redistributing the pressure to other areas. The same feature turned out to give amazing back support in mattresses.\nThree years ago, the Pearces set out to combine all their knowledge of cushioning into the world\u2019s best mattress. The Pearce brothers use custom designed and built machinery to make Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 in the USA at production rates that allowed them to significantly cut the cost of this miracle material to consumers. \nThe Purple\u00ae Bed was born! And just as the Pearce brothers dreamed it would be, it is better than any $4000 mattress and costs significantly less. That was the goal, and Purple achieved it!\nWhy Purple? Well, why not? It is an awesome color, and it signifies treating everyone like royalty. The Pearces have spent most of their high-tech careers advancing the world of cushioning. With the Purple\u00ae Bed, and now Purple\u00ae Pillow, they have put all they\u2019ve learned into the world\u2019s greatest sleep products, and they figured out how to do it so everyone can afford it.

We\u2019ve built the molds and machinery for our initial launch, and a portion of the money we raise here will go to fund the production of more molds and machinery so we can continue making Purple in the USA at our Alpine, Utah factory.\n\nProduction time will be our biggest challenge, as we do make all of the Purple for all of our products at our factory. However, we are guaranteeing the first 1,000 will be delivered by Christmas! Another portion of our funding will be used to grow our Purple team to meet production demands.\n\nAnother challenge might be working with our product partners to get certain international components to the factory in time to hit delivery deadlines. However, we\u2019ve worked hard over the last several months to build up these relationships and plan accordingly.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

Now we finally want to show you what we have accomplished so far and ask for your support so we can start to work on our dream project full-time! \nWith Kickstarter we hope to raise the funds necessary to finish the development of our game while still staying independent and keeping our creative freedom.\nIf you don't know what Kickstarter is: you can buy the different editions of the game and if we reach our goal, the game will be developed and you will receive everything you ordered at the release of the game!\n\nYou can find out more about it here.\nIn Lost Ember you uncover the secrets of a fallen civilization as a wolf that has to find his place in the world. With the ability to control every animal you see, you have everything you need to find your way to Machu Kila - the city that shall answer all the questions that your mysterious companion raises.\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay in Lost Ember focuses on experiencing the world and the story from fascinating perspectives. Each animal you can play offers new possibilities and opportunities for breathtaking moments. Dive into deep waters, fly at lofty heights, dig underground as a mole or even climb steep cliffs with a mountain goat. We want players to move through our world in their own pace without interrupting their gameflow with combat, too hard puzzles or dying in general.\nTHE COMPANION / STORY\nOn your journey you are guided by a companion that used to be part of the old Inrahsi culture and witnessed the fall of his world. As the last soul of the old civilization he wandered the world for an eternity, searching for someone who could help him on his quest. \nHis ability to show you his memories - echoes of the past - lets you relive what he's been through. These memories can be unveiled at different places throughout the world.\nDuring the game, the wolf and his companion form a deep relationship of friendship and trust. \nSWITCH PERSPECTIVES / GAMEPLAY  \nWhile the main character is the wolf, players can possess any other animal they encounter in our world which gives them great mobility. Some of the animals featured in Lost Ember are parrots, fish, moles, eagles, capybaras, mountain goats, buffalos and more. Additional animals are planned as part of some of our stretch goals.\nThese animals inhabit different areas in our world and while some occur in various scenarios, others may only populate a specific region. On their way to Machu Kila, the wolf and his companion cross through a lot of distinct areas with their own flora and fauna.\nLost Ember will be available for XBox One, PC and Playstation 4. If you buy the game here at kickstarter, you will be able to choose your preferred platform at release. \nWe plan to bring the PC version to Steam and GOG.com. Vote for us in our Greenlight campaign to get Lost Ember to Steam!\nPowered by Unreal Engine 4\nYes, Lost Ember will be playable in VR! We already tested it with HTC Vive and Oculus Rift and let me tell you: it's awesome! We don't consider Lost Ember a \"VR game\", however, and still concentrate on the game itself and not the VR part. But if you have a VR headset at home, you will be able to switch on the VR mode at any given time and dive even deeper into our world. Whether we'll be able to bring Lost Ember to Playstation VR is still unsure.\nCraig Connor (former Music Director at Rockstar North) and Will Morton (former Senior Audio Designer and Dialogue Supervisor at Rockstar North) from Solid Audioworks produce all music and sound for Lost Ember! With a combined experience of over 30 years in the games industry working on games like GTA I-V, Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire and more, they bring a ton of expertise and talent to the team. You can find out more about them at their homepage www.solidaudioworks.com.\nWe founded Mooneye Studios about 2 years ago after meeting in a game development masters program in university. We all worked in the games and media industry for several years and together as a team on some smaller projects. Soon we realized that we work extremely well together and since none of us wanted to work in a big company with huge hierarchies and no real creative freedom anymore, we took an a bit risky step and quit our jobs to start our own indie studio.\nAnd that's us! :) From left to right we are:\nPascal M\u00fcller - Programming - @RichAndBit\nTobias Graff - Programming - @tobiasgrf\nFlorens Huhn - Narrative Designer - @FlorensWho\nMatthias Oberprieler- 3D Artist - @MOberprieler\nMaximilian Jasionowski- Art Direction - @M_Jasionowski\nTo make supporting our campaign as rewarding to you as possible, we thought of a bunch of really cool stuff that you can get in our reward tiers! The individual items are illustrated below:\nWell, this one is pretty self-explanatory: you will get the game as soon as it's released for either PC, XBox One or PS4.\nYou will be mentioned in Lost Ember's credits!\nIncludes the digital copy of the game and your name in our credits\nThe soundtrack for Lost Ember featuring music and sound by Craig Conner, Music Director for the entire GTA series and more, and Will Morton, former Dialogue Supervisor & Senior Sound Designer at Rockstar North.\nChoose between 3 extra skins for your main character. Extra skins are only available during the kickstarter! After that, there won't be any option to change skins in the game.\nYou will get the PDF version of our artbook with a lot of concept art from the very early days up until the final product. We will explain some of our design decisions and try to give you an in-depth look behind the scenes of the development.\nWe will design a high-resolution wallpaper exclusively available to kickstarter backers!\nA digital map of the game world with an overview over all the different areas from the wide grasslands to the decayed city of Machu Kila.\nIncludes Digital Game Edition with everything above\nGet our printed hardcover artbook to browse through the pages and always have it at hand in your bookshelf.\nIncludes Digital Plus Edition and the physical artbook\nLooking for that extravagant touch? Get our soundtrack on a 12\u2033 Vinyl-LP! You will also have the option to choose a CD version of the soundtrack, if you don't have a way of playing a vinyl LP.\nYou will get access to the closed beta version of Lost Ember and help us to improve the game!\nRevisit the places you found in-game and follow your path to Machu Kila on a poster of our game world! \nYour chance to actually be in the game! Find your name on a memorial plate for fallen heroes, that is discoverable by all players and even holds a memory to uncover.\nA few very rare legendary animals inhabit our world. While all players can find and possess some of these legendary animals, you will be able to find 3 additional animals that are kickstarter-exclusive!\n6 additional deluxe wolf skins that are only available on kickstarter and let your wolf shine in a new light!\nIncludes Physical Artbook Edition with everything above\nThe Limited Boxed Edition of Lost Ember contains a key for the digital download of the game in an kickstarter-exclusive case with the soundtrack on CD, as well 3 postcards printed on high quality paper.\nA handmade statue of Lost Ember's main character, crafted by the incredibly talented Isabel from www.allerleiunfug.de! This statue will be cast in resin, very high quality and roughly 18cm (7 inches) high.\n  A DIN A2 (that's 420 x 594 mm or 16.5 x 23.4 inches) poster of this amazing artwork.\nAdditionally to the regular poster, you will get one that is signed by the whole team!\nBe one of the firsts to get your hands on Lost Ember with our alpha access key! Make Lost Ember an even better game by giving us your feedback and ideas.\nIncludes Explorer Edition with everything above\nYou will get 2 tickets to Lost Ember's release party at the release of the game! We will celebrate with an amazing party in our hometown Hamburg in Germany. \nYour travel costs are not included in this package.\nThe old Inrahsi emperors were buried in the tombs of Machu Kila. Massive statues still remind their descendants of their grandiosity. You can become one of them! You will be immortalized as one of the statues that we will design with you after your image. The tomb will be discoverable by all players and even be a part of our story.\nYou will get a premium mention in our credits to let the world know that you were a huge help in finishing our game!\nIncludes Physical Gold Edition with everything above\nAnd, because it's not long until Christmas, we thought of a little something to give to all our backers! We will send all of you a PDF with 11 different cards to print at home! So if you think about getting Lost Ember or some of the rewards as a present for your loved ones, you now have the perfect card for it :)\nWe've planned much more for Lost Ember than we have shown you here! In case we exceed our goal of ~$110,000 (100.000\u20ac) we can include even more awesome features. These are the first stretch goals we have planned:\n       Aside from our regular stretch goals, we planned a few social stretch goals through which you can decide which animals will be added to the game on top of the current 9! Participate at www.lostember.com/animals!\n                     Kickstarter helps us secure funding for the development of Lost Ember while retaining full creative control. \"Creative control\", you ask? That means we can continue developing freely and independently without interference from the outside. \nNow I'm gonna be honest here: with our target goal of $110,000 (100,000\u20ac) we still would need some additional funding from publishers or alike. However, the money would get us to a first, full alpha version of the game. It is the minimal budget that brings us to a point where we feel comfortable enough to talk to publishers about deadlines and all the features that we want in our game. \nWe're certain to be able to get that last chunk of money to finish Lost Ember, as we are already talking to several publishers who all are extremely interested in our game. So Lost Ember will be finished with just $110,000 (100,000\u20ac) from Kickstarter. But to get to a point where we could finish the game with full creative freedom we would need about $390,000 (350.000\u20ac). With that we could truly make Lost Ember everything we want it to be. \nNow maybe some of you ask themselves, for what we need that much money. Well, one big reason is that we not only have to pay us and our office space, but also taxes, payment providers, and Kickstarter, who take 5% of the raised money. We made this little pie chart to visualize this for you.\nBecause we are a small independent team without a huge marketing budget, we thought of a little something special to spread the word about Lost Ember and our kickstarter campaign: During our campaign we will visit different youtubers, press and other indie developers in a camper van we got from Tobias' mother and uncle and play a pre-alpha demo of Lost Ember with them! \nWe want to show you how the current game looks and feels to give you a better idea of where it is heading. To make that a little more fun for you, we will make videos of the whole thing and upload them as often as we can to our youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/mooneyestudios.\nSo make sure to support the campaign to get notifications whenever we release a new video! :) You will be able to follow us and check out where we are constantly on a GPS map at our website at lostember.com/tour and, if we are anywhere near you, feel free to drop us a line and if possible, maybe we can arrange a meet-up and show you our demo in person!\nSPECIAL THANKS\nWe thank Jacob Pavek for prividing the Song \"Illume\" for our Kickstarter Video.

And of course there is always the possibility that we don't get that. But with as many interested parties as we are already talking to at the moment and a successful kickstarter campaign in our bags, the likelihood of this is pretty low. And even if it happens, we can always go back to doing contract works or side-jobs as we do at the moment. That would of course increase the development time, especially if we get significantly less than $390,000 (350.000\u20ac), but we can definitely promise you that we'll do our best so that Lost Ember will see the light of day as soon and as magnificently as possible!\n\nAnother risk of the development is the release date, of course. We hope to be able to bring Lost Ember to you in early 2018, but there are always unforeseen factors that can delay the release of a game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Special thanks!", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

That's why we decided to pause all shipping, including merch store, outside the EU until we can be reasonably sure that the rewards actually make it to their destinations. I'm regularly checking on the shipping restrictions and hope they can be loosened soon to give us the Go for the rest of the world!

Play as the gallant Branson a.k.a. \"Beard Blade\" as he strives to reclaim the town's stolen goods and uncover the truth behind a dark secret. His weapon of choice? An enchanted beard teeming with powerful magic that allows him to shape-shift his stubble to overcome hairy situations. The enemies are tough, but so is your scruff!\nWhat can you expect from Beard Blade?\nAttack, travel and solve puzzles using the powers of your beard\nVisit the barber to style your beard and change-up your moves\nExplore colorful worlds and meet a cast of humorous characters\nMaster skills like timed-hits to defeat foes and reach hidden areas\nCarefully comb through every level to find all hidden treasures\nMeet the village folk and take on small side-quests\nMore puns\nThe most important part of any game! We\u2019re committed to making Beard Blade a fun and charming experience like the games we grew up with.\nWhile we are admittedly not trying to redefine the platformer genre by any means, there will definitely be tight controls with plenty of fresh concepts along the way. Feel-wise, Beard Blade has a good speed and flow so far, giving players the ability to blast through a level, but also offers enough to explore and collect for those who like to take their time.\nBeard Blade boasts all of the standard moves you\u2019ve come to expect from the genre, though we've largely been influenced by the Wario Land series, Yoshi's Island, and Ristar - if you've played any of those games, you can expect a similar degree of varied abilities. You can glide, grab, throw, punch, climb, swim, crawl and more! We've even lifted the idea of timed-hits from Super Mario RPG when you jump on an enemy, which will make way for more skill-oriented challenges. Master these moves and your tour of Imp Isle will be a breeze!\nTo maintain a level of transparency and openness, we have provided a working demo for PC, where you can roam around a sample of two early levels and a boss battle - all without even needing to back the project. While we can certainly guarantee there will be bugs, we hope this demo gives you a glimpse at the potential of Beard Blade, where we're at right now and how much better it could be with funding!\nThe Kickstarter demo is no longer available for download. Thanks to all who have submitted feedback after playing. It is helping us greatly improve the game as we go forward. We will offer a new demo after development progresses more - stay tuned!\n  Beard Blade will be released for Windows PC and Mac,with the full release intended to be distributed on Steam as well as GOG.com. The game will be DRM free unless the service/platform demands otherwise.\nWe are very eager to aim for other platforms through stretch goals and are currently looking into consoles. After all, we would love for as many people to be able to play Beard Blade as possible! \nWhen a quaint seaside town is invaded by imps, a humble bearded farmer named Branson assumes the role as hero and chases them back to their vile isle. After an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim the stolen goods, our hero is thrown into a fortress dungeon and left for dead. \nAmongst a group of hostages attempting to escape, Branson meets a reformed wizard-turned-barber who enchants his beard as a last-ditch effort, granting him amazing new abilities that allow the captives to flee through the dungeon's sewer. Now aptly dubbed \"Beard Blade,\" our hero sets forth to thwart the imps and uncover the truth behind a dark secret...\n  Take a listen to these tracks by Steven Melin! His whimsical tunes have given a lot of life to the world of Beard Blade and help give the game a bit more of a nostalgic vibe.\nOverworld Theme (Beach)\nVillage Theme\n Mini-Boss Theme\n     Cordial Cove\nThis warm setting in the ideal hang-out spot for imps. Truth is, they're here to have fun, but you had to go and ruin it.\n Lavender Cavern\nJust off the coast is a cave that is home to a now abandoned mine. Someone has kept the lifts running, making this a hot tourist spot for adventurers and a means of commute for some of the locals.\nThe Lighthouse\nThis lighthouse is responsible for keeping the ships out at sea safe, but it in recent days it looks like it's under new management.\nForest Manor\nDeep in the woods lies a creaky old house that used to belong to a sorceress. Some say she still haunts the halls of her old home. What, you don't believe in that kind of stuff, do you?\nStarlight Shipyard\nThis bustling harbor showcases the pinnacle of imp-engineering. They're not as dumb as they look! \nBeard Blade: The Game (PC or Mac)\nThe game itself! Get a digital download of Beard Blade for your PC or Mac!\nRetro Instruction Manual (PDF and physical)\nRead how to play the game by looking at character art, maps and more- just like the good ol' days! This is available as both a digital and physical reward.\nBeard Blade Original Soundtrack (Digital only)\nOwn the tunes of Beard Blade, composed by Steven Melin. This is currently only offered as a digital only reward.\nOriginal Signed Artwork (Physical)\nA 5\" x 7\" print (postcard size), with printed artwork on one side, and a signed original drawing from one of the creators on the other side! The best of both worlds! The exact art on the card is yet to be decided, but each backer of this tier will receive their own unique inked drawing. Which character will you get? No two drawings will be alike!\nBeard Blade T-Shirt\nWe've commissioned Leigh Davis for this charming design that sums up the Beard Blade experience. Exact color of the shirt is TBD, but it will be some kind of blue and hopefully all kinds of comfy. Available in S, M, L, XL, 2XL and 3XL sizes.\nHardcover Artbook (PDF and physical)\nPeruse several pages of concepts, character art and sprites from the game in a nice hardcover book.\nCurrently, we've estimated that we are about 20-25% complete with Beard Blade, including features, artwork and soundtrack for Beard Blade. We were aiming for a similar scope of content found in Wario Land 4, however, since funding has been unsuccessful, we are going to reduce the amount of planned content and rethink our approach to how the levels are designed and how you will progress. More info on this at a later date!\n  Glovebox Games - Aaron Clark & Joseph Andrews\nAs the two co-founders of Glovebox Games and creators of Beard Blade, Aaron and Joe share a lot of responsibilities. Both contribute art assets and animation, as well as game design and level design. Joe is taking on the huge responsibility of programming the game.\nSteven Melin\nSteven is a music composer, educator, and performer in Atlanta, GA. He has composed for mobile games, console games, feature films. and television. He teaches music lessons, guest-lectures for master classes and presentations at schools and conferences, and is an active recording artist for soundtracks, albums, live events, and YouTube. He is responsible for the soundtrack of Beard Blade, which you can listen to a bit by scrolling up or playing the demo!\nShannon Mason\nShannon will also be contributing audio for Beard Blade and is currently working on sound effects. She's nailing that SNES feel!\n  For a long time now, the two of us have been working on Beard Blade on and off in our own free time whenever we got the chance. Since it began as a project on the side, we have never been able to dedicate ourselves to it full-time due to other jobs and commitments. Developing in this way was not ideal. We would love to finish Beard Blade the right way, and we think that this is currently the best route for the project. We owe it to ourselves and to all of you who have supported us to complete this game! A successful campaign will allow the two of us to work on Beard Blade full-time for almost a full year, pay for the rest of the soundtrack, sfx and more. \nWe want to thank everyone who has supported us so far. Beard Blade wouldn't have gotten this far without the encouragement we've received. Please check back regularly for new reveals, updates and more!

The content on this very page has already consumed an immense amount of man hours. A game takes a lot of time, iteration, and planning - as animator's first, this is nothing new to us. However, as a newly formed studio, we have not yet shipped a title and this will be our first game. This project has become bigger than the two of us already, and we are committed to creating a fun experience, but we are being very careful with the scope of this game. We're only two people, so there is a lot of weight to be carried by so few - luckily, we're a bit experienced in this area, having previously worked for a few years at a edutainment games start-up. In our time there we've learned what works and what doesn't in a small team, and as long as we hold up our end of the deal and carefully plan and schedule all aspects of development beforehand, our journey creating Beard Blade should be relatively low risk. Should something come up, the game gets delayed, or we run out of money too soon for whatever reasons, we will do whatever we can to deliver a game, even if it means reducing content or scope. The greatest challenge is delivering a quality game that meets not only your expectations, but our own.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Glovebox Games\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nGlovebox Games is an independent development team of two, founded by Aaron Clark and Joe Andrews.

He rides along in Rad's backpack, providing (sometimes questionable) verbal support, and lays waste with his punching power gloves.\nWe feel that this mostly forgotten genre -- which ruled for ten strong years beginning in the mid-80's -- is in dire need of a revival using today's most modern engine, Unreal 4, with a Rick and Morty sense of humor.\n      Rad is a rambunctious but spirited young boy who maybe plays too many video games. After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure.\nDusty is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!\nRad & Dusty's adventure begins in the First World, taking them through seven dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.\n  Weapons: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry. The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by. There are 5+ weapons in this first chapter, with more to come.\nSounds & Music: Our composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers!\nThe Pixelverse: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the running game world, allowing both Rad & Dusty to continue their journey.\nClassic Easter Eggs: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your precision platforming skills to collect 'em all.\nVoice Acting: Dusty is voiced by none other than incomparable industry legend Jon St John. Rad's human counterpart is breakout child star Hunter Pratt. The two distinct personalities nurture a rare and cherished bond that can be felt throughout the entire game.\nHumor & Gore: Rad Rodgers may appear to be an 'E for Everyone' game at first glance, but it's not. The explicit language, SFW adult themes, and the sometimes overkill action plants it firmly in the 'M for Mature' category (actual ESRB/PEGI/USK rating still pending).\nUnreal Engine 4: Powered by Epic's incredible Unreal Engine 4, we're able to put more details than ever before into Rad Rodgers.\nA Palette of Levels: You can't get bored with these levels -- each one has a completely new visual style with its own set of graphics, and music!\n  The vibrant living world of Rad Rodgers is steeped with mystery, revelation, and of course, perilous peril. Below are some examples of early concept art for the game that describes the kind of variety for which we've strived.\nClick to view the concept art.\n  There are a total of six unique environments planned for the first world of Rad Rodgers, but check out the Stretch Goals to find out where else we could take this!\n    Click to view the screenshots.\n    We'll just let Andrew speak for himself about the behind-the-scenes process that went into scoring Rad's retro tracks.\nNow just listen to his mind-meltingly mesmerizing sample tracks from the game!\n        Rad Rodgers will be releasing on PC and PlayStation 4. We'd love to include Xbox One, Mac and Linux by adding them to stretch goals later in the campaign.\nA Stretch Goal -- As a bonus we've drawn up plans for an extended 2nd screen experience called Dusty's Surfatron. Players will have the option to play a challenging mobile game which takes place entirely in the Pixelverse, where Dusty can earn you power-ups and weapons that you can transfer back into Rad Rodgers in real-time.\nIt's more than just a 2nd screen -- Dusty's Surfatron is an addicting, standalone endless runner, which will provide players who love these types of games an awesome extended experience.\nDusty's Surfatron will be developed by our great partners at Not Even Entertainment, and will not be required to fully experience Rad Rodgers, but is a fun expansion to the universe we'd really love to bring you guys!\n        Exclusive Artbook - You'll get the awesome physical artbook that includes a comic prologue as well as the level maps.\nBig Box - Get the rad-ass, retro Big Box Collector's Edition of the game containing all physical rewards.\nExclusive Backer T-Shirt - We'll send you an exclusive backer T-Shirt in the size of your choice.\nCartridge - This is a custom made Super Nintendo cartridge that has been converted to a USB drive that will hold a DRM free copy of the game for PC along with all other digital rewards.\nLimited Edition Figurine - You'll get an extremely limited figurine of Rad and Dusty.\nMouse Pad - Get a limited edition mouse pad.\nExtremely Rare Sealed Apogee/3D Realms game - You get a really rare, boxed and sealed Apogee / 3D Realms game from the 90's. \n  Interceptor Entertainment is an indie studio founded in 2011.\nWe're currently located in Aalborg, Denmark, but have Team Members from all around the world. Our first title was a re-boot of the legendary first person shooter, \"Rise of the Triad\". \nWe're a small and efficient team of both legacy- and new talents, and have more than 100 years of combined experience in the industry. \nWe made it our goal to bring back the golden age of the games we used to love as kids, with new and innovative game mechanics, beautiful sound and graphics, and interesting characters with attitude.\nOur team have worked on a range of titles ranging from indie to AAA - including League of Legends, Evolve, Halo 5, Duke Nukem 3D, Call of Duty Black Ops, Max Payne and Rise of the Triad\n  Meet the team behind Rad Rodgers below!\n  We've put a lot of work into Rad Rodgers to get it to where it is today, but we need the Kickstarter community to help us cross the finish line. There's still a lot of work to be done with finishing up our levels, polishing our weapons, voice acting, and of course, quality assurance.\nHere's how we intend to spend your hard-earned money:\nIt's super important that a precision platformer like Rad Rodgers *feels* just right. The controls must be tight and fluid, the puzzles intuitive, and the gameplay fun & challenging. A successful Kickstarter allows us to tighten the screws on every inch of this game.\nWe have a number of social media sites where you can follow Rad Rodgers.  \nFacebook: A good place to follow to have insight in the development of the game as well as future updates.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/radrodgers/ \nReddit: Join our official subreddit.

If this is your first time seeing our project, welcome aboard! If you are coming back from our first campaign, welcome back! You'll notice a lot of similarities in this campaign - it is the same game after all - but there are some major differences:\n1) We've streamlined our rewards both to reduce our costs and to add clarity!\n2) We have more artwork to show (2D and 3D)!\n3) We have some gameplay footage to show (coming soon)!\n4) We have more YouTube content and an updated website!\n5) Through Hashbang Games, we are officially on Steam!!!\nDimension Door is a turn-based, horror/sci-fi/supernatural fusion themed, pseudo-cooperative multiplayer computer game on Steam where players play as a character that found their way into a strange mansion filled with evil creatures and deadly magic. Based on the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics, this mansion was built within a pocket of space-time where many of those choice branches all converge and roil in that chaotic space simultaneously. As guests of the house, players will do whatever it takes to survive and escape back to their homes. This is no ordinary mansion; the rooms do not stay still, and neither should you... \n   PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  Dimension Door will push the boundaries of strategy games by combining supernatural horror, science-fiction, strategic choices, immersive lore, and moral ambiguity together. The lore is the backbone of this game's world, but short-term adaptive pseudo-cooperative strategy is the engine of gameplay.\nIn terms of design, Dimension Door was originally conceptualized as a board game. It could randomly generate the rooms that players would enter and used cards for EVERYTHING! While the game could function well as a board game, we thought it'd be better as a computer game. Plus, we couldn't pass up the advantages that computers could give the players: quicker gameplay, hidden information, fog of war, communication hindrances, etc. But with Dimension Door as a computer game, we want to preserve that board game feeling still. So we kept the turn-based system and top down \"board-like\" viewpoint.\nPLAY\n\nWe want to give players a holistic experience. One way we are doing this: \"Lysander's Journal\" is a book written by the game's creator to supplement the game and give players background story. You do not need to read \"Lysander's Journal\" to enjoy Dimension Door, but rather it's for those interested in delving deeper into the bigger picture Dimension Door paints.\nWe will also include tons of flavor text with each piece of content you find in game to hint at different events and storylines that occurred (including easter eggs for future content production).\n  -Exploration: Guests traverse an ever-changing mansion, attempting to escape its various hostile inhabitants, possibly including other guests. There will always be something new to encounter, whether it is a new room or a new monster or a whole new strategy for survival!\nPrivate Security - Nikho de los Santos\n  -Strategy: Guests will obtain various items and magical artifacts to help them survive and hopefully complete their objectives, whether it means to fight or run from your fears. But let\u2019s face it, in a nightmarish place like this, your fears will always catch up. Unless you can outrun your friends!\nField Medic - Gavin Lockhart\n  -Social Politics: Guests can form alliances or cut off communication from everyone else at will. They can work together or kill each other; the mansion and it's horrific inhabitants won\u2019t care how you die!\nSociology Professor - Tanya Paulson\n  -Diverse Win Conditions: In this session-based game, there is an overarching win condition based on the chosen scenario. Guests can work together as a team towards completing that scenario objective to win together; however, each player will have a hidden agenda that they choose among a list, which if fulfilled, that player will be the only winner. Be wary of those that stray away from the group objective!\nThief - Julia Sibella\n  -No Feeling of Being Left Out: Don\u2019t worry if you die first! You won\u2019t be kicked out of the game and have to wait for your friends to finish, because that's annoying! Instead, you return as a servant of the house and increase the game speed and intensity because your sole purpose now is to kill your friends! Sweet vengeance!\nServant - The Slithering Slime\n  -Chaos is Fun!: This game is filled with random events that can cause the guests to struggle to survive, or possibly help them towards their goals. Teamwork greatly increases survival in the mansion, just be aware of backstabbing! The benefit of this randomness is that no two games will be the same, giving tons of replayability!\nFire Rescue - Vaughn Green\n  Lobby:\nPlayers will join together to start a session of Dimension Door by creating or joining a lobby. Once in, players will individually choose a Guest to play, starting items for that Guest to enter the mansion with, a Hidden Agenda that that Guest has as an alternate win condition, and a Servant they will become if they die in the mansion. Other players will only know which Guest you've chosen, the rest is hidden information!\nIn-Game:\nPlayers will take turns performing movement and other actions, such as searching for items or fighting monsters. When a player's turn starts, they are able to rearrange their equipped items or choose to rest. Resting heals you but also ends your turn. Each player that does not rest on their turn will have 2 Action Points (AP) and a number of Movement Points (MP) equal to their Guest's Speed. Once a player uses all AP and MP, or if they choose to stop earlier, that player's turn ends. After all players have finished their turn, all monsters take their turn and also other mansion effects will occur at this time before shifting back to the players' turns again.\nHow To Win:\nThere are a few ways players can win. Dimension Door is a scenario-based game so the most apparent way to win is by fulfilling the conditions of the main Scenario Objective. If the main Scenario Objective is fulfilled, all Guests win! But players also chose a Hidden Agenda in the lobby... If a player fulfills the conditions of their Hidden Agenda before the Scenario Objective is completed, only that player wins! Backstabbery! Also, notice that if you die as a Guest, you can't win by completing the Scenario Objective or your Hidden Agenda. But you're also not out of the game yet; when you die as a Guest, you become the Servant you chose in the lobby. Each Servant has specific conditions for them to win as well, but ultimately they only win if all Guests are killed!

In Dimension Door, players can either fulfill the Main Scenario Objective, thereby winning as a team, or a player can complete his or her own Hidden Agenda, thereby being the sole winner. Therefore it comes down to social politics: \"Guys, we need to watch out for this person, they seem to be going rogue.\" How can you convince someone that it's easier to win as a team versus them completing their chosen hidden agenda? It comes down to short-term \"adaptive\" strategy. Also, it depends on who you play with! Maybe your group of friends hates backstabbing, so you all vow to only go for the Main Scenario Objective! Or maybe your group likes the thrill of competition and only wants to backstab! Or maybe you'll enjoy a happy mixture of both!

Imagine a multi-genre anthology film where fans and long time entertainment professionals collaborate to create 10 original stories, all intertwined and taking place over a single convention weekend. Fans are submitting scripts and resumes, as you read this, to work with our professional team from some of your favorite hollywood movies and shows. \nPLAY\n\nHave you seen the credits at the end of a movie? There are hundreds of jobs needed to make a feature film, and fans will participate every step of the way in each key department. For example, cosplayers can design and create original wardrobe with our Costumer Designer for a slew of Hollywood actors. The very people who love the content of conventions play a leading role in its creation. \n  A huge slew of fantastic actors who are regulars of the convention circuit are all excited to be a part of \u201cThe Circuit\u201d. Icons of sci-fi, fantasy, superhero and horror, you name it.  We have signed actors Walter Koenig (Pavel Chekov, Star Trek), Tim Russ (Lieutenant Commander Tuvok, Star Trek: Voyager), Gigi Edgley (Chiana, Farscape), Robert Beltran (Chakotay, Star Trek: Voyager), Armin Shimerman (Principal Snyder, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Terry Farrell (Jadzia Dax, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), Robert Picardo (Dr. Dick Richards, ABC's China Beach), Ethan Phillips (Neelix, Star Trek: Voyager), JG Hertzler (Martok, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), Robert O\u2019Reilly (Chancellor Gowron, Star Trek: The Next Generation), Corin Nemec (Jonas Quinn, Stargate SG-1), Hana Hatae (Molly O'Brien, Star Trek: TNG, DSN), Rob Archer (Pixels, Kick Ass 2), Jai Koutrae (Nathan Chapel, Death's Requiem), Mindy Robinson (Tabitha, V/H/S/2), Olivia D\u2019abo (The Wonder Years, Conan The Destroyer), Cody Saintgnue (Brett Talbot, MTV's Teen Wolf), Doug Jones (Abe Sapien / Chamberlain / Angel of Death, Hellboy Series), John Billingsly (Doctor Phlox, Star Trek: Enterprise), Miltos Yerolemou (Syrio Forel, Game of Thrones) and many more will be joining!\nThanks Yoshi! Fan contribution!\n     PLAY\n\nWe already have on board creatives and technicians from some of your favorite shows. With SFX credits from features like \u201cBeowulf\u201d, \u201cBASEketball\u201d, \u201cWhat Dreams May Come\u201d, and VFX credits from, \u201cIron Man\u201d, \u201cHellboy\u201d, \u201cSpiderman 2\u201d, \u201cStarship Troopers\u201d, Disney\u2019s \u201cPlanes\u201d, as well as TV credits from \u201cFlash\u201d, \u201cDC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow\u201d, and \u201cArrow.\u201d Plus so many more big budget shows that we don\u2019t have room to name, our team is very well equipped to make a high end feature film.\nHow can we hire these fantastic folks? Because they are fans just like you. They are excited to work on something made for all of us, by all of us. The content that is celebrated at conventions is exactly why we became filmmakers in the first place.\nWe have pulled together team members from other fan funded projects like, \u201cFor the Love of Spock\u201d, \u201cRenegades\u201d, \u201c5th Passenger\u201d, and others. So we know what we\u2019re doing.\n Check out the cool Bonuses as we achieve our goals! \nOur goal is raise enough to make at least three episodes, which will cost $450,000. However, if we only raise $200,000, we can pay our pre-production costs as well as the first episode as a proof of concept. In Spring of 2017 you will get to see how amazing this anthology film will be.\n Of course, if you believe in \u201cThe Circuit\u201d as much as we believe in it, then we can raise our ultimate goal of 1.5 million dollars and shoot the entire feature! We want to provide big time talent with big time effects on the big screen. To do so, even at pennies on the dollar, it will cost us over a million dollars. So please tell your friends, donate to the campaign so we can make the most collaborative Convention Feature Anthology Film ever.\nIf we are making the entire feature, you can expect to watch the final version, available to donors first, in Fall of 2017.\nConventions are awesome, duh.\nThis year is the 50th anniversary of science fiction pop culture conventions. We HAVE to make a movie that takes place at one!\nIn honor of the fans, the setting of the stories will be a massive pop culture convention. Some of these stories come directly from our actors who have been at conventions for decades and are based on true stories, and some will be completely be fictional. Telling the difference between the two will be part of the fun.\nDid we mention many of the stories in THE CIRCUIT will be written by the fans? Fans have the opportunity to submit screenplays for the movie, making them truly a part of the process. Because it wouldn't be THE CONVENTION \"CIRCUIT\" without YOU!\nConventions cover all genres and so shall we. We want to include all fans, so all genres are open; Sci-fi, horror, suspense, comic book, drama, comedy, fantasy, action, adventure, holiday, crime, legal, docudrama, mockumentary. No Genre or cross genre is off limits. \nNot sure if you noticed, but the studios really like to make the same thing over and over. They want marketing focus group tested corporate cookie cutter revamps. Blarg (I vomited in my mouth a little). So something new like \u201cThe Circuit\u201d is completely out of the question for the studio system. The studios don\u2019t go to conventions and celebrate with the fans. They don\u2019t understand the passion and the experience we all have. But our team has and will continue to, because it isn\u2019t about making money, it\u2019s about inspiring generations with our collective stories that make the world a better place to live in. Are the studio executives even aware that it\u2019s been 50 years of conventions?\nAs one fan told us, \u201cwe fans are more supportive of the actors [in the convention family] than the franchise ownership, but you seem to inherently know that.\u201d\nHow can we have ten stories in multiple genres and have them tie together? That depends on what you write. But as an example:\nEp1 Genre: Spy Thriller/Dark comedy Ethan Phillips, as himself, is secertly a CIA undercover assassin. After 35 years of friendship, Robert Picardo discovers his secret. Uh oh\u2026\nEp2 Genre: Horror Cody Saintgnue is an actual werewolf. Unbeknownst to him, the full moon is the night of the convention that Phillips and Picardo have just arrived to. Will Mindy Robinson survive the convention massacre?\nEp3 Genre: Zombie apocalypse Cody\u2019s rampage ignites a Zombie apocalypse and Ryan Eggold must lead the convention survivors to safety.\nEp10 Fortunately, Terry Ferrall is actually from another dimension, and with the help of Doug Jones and , they successfully travel back in time and stop the apocalypse from ever happening.\n\u201cThe very first professional feature length, convention based, multi genre, anthology film in the history of hollywood.\u201d\nPLAY\n\n  JOIN US!!\n   If you want to join \"The Circuit\" simply visit our webpage and sign up.

The drawings I like best make me laugh.\nThis project is about producing museum-quality dinner plates with the added zest of impending calamity that modern audiences crave. Imagine your guests discovering zombie poodles or a flying dinosaur behind their Chicken Piccata!\nCalamityware dinner plate 11: zombie poodles\nCalamityware dinner plate 12: pterodactyl (pteranodon)\n To take advantage of an early production window, I am offering two Calamityware\u2122 plate designs in one Kickstarter project. These are plates 11 and 12 in my long-running series. Many people said they are eager to get all the designs as soon as possible, so offering two designs at once should make you happy.\nIn case you missed the previous Kickstarter projects, there\u2019s even a pledge level (H) to allow you to get all four plate designs from Calamityware Series 3.\nTop quality. Like the previous Calamityware dinner plates, these plates will be produced at the award-winning Kristoff workshop in Poland using the in-glaze technique. Final production will feature white porcelain with a rich blue image\u2014destined to become treasured family heirlooms.\nIn-glaze plates are fired at extra-high temperatures to allow the image to melt slightly into the surface of the plate. Connoisseurs will appreciate the beauty of the in-glaze technique which the artists at Kristoff have been refining since 1831. This is the look of porcelain you see in museums. Sweet.\nCalamityware Series 3 includes four designs. Plates 9 and 10 have already been Kickstarter projects. This project makes both plates 11 and 12 available at once.\nSeries 3. The Series includes [9] Too Many Frogs [10] Jogging Sasquatch, [11] Zombie Poodles, and [12] Pterodactyl. This Kickstarter project introduces both of the last two plate designs. In case you missed the previous 2016 Kickstarter projects, there\u2019s a pledge level (H) to get the whole series with one pledge. I expect all these rewards to ship before the end of October, probably sooner.\nWill all the plates in this series match? No. The designs of the plate borders and central image of each Calamityware plate are different. If you appreciate the notion of \u201ceclectic,\u201d you\u2019ll be delighted. But if you are a perfectionist about matching, you should order enough of your favorite Calamityware plate so all your guests have the same design.\nDesign trivia\nZombie poodles have been a design theme since ancient times.\nMultiple poodles are always trouble, but multiple zombie poodles are far worse. Down boy!\nIn 2011, I added a pterodactyl while drawing my Grandma\u2019s Blue-Willow plate. That\u2019s what got all the Calamityware projects started.\nFor nerds only. Yes, I know that pterodactyl isn\u2019t the right term. I should be calling the creature a pteranodon (large body, crest on head, short tail. no teeth). But there are three problems with that term. 1. No one seems to know what I\u2019m talking about. But when I say pterodactyl, folks get it right away. 2. Pteranodon is bland and somehow doesn\u2019t convey the mystery and sinister glamor that pterodactyl has. 3. I\u2019m an old guy and my capacity to absorb new stuff is pathetically limited. I still think Pluto is a planet. \nBoth zombie poodles and pterodactyls appear on the Things-Could-Be-Worse mugs. So using your plates and mugs together will look amazing.\nUnmatched gift potential. Isn\u2019t it obvious that Calamityware porcelain dinner plates make superb gifts? Maybe you should get some extras?\nWhen can I expect my Calamityware plates? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, everyone should have their rewards before the end of October 2016. Probably sooner.\nFree shipping in USA. If you live in the United States, there\u2019s no additional charge to deliver your reward to your door. We\u2019ll also apply the amount we\u2019ve budgeted for postage to international orders, so international sponsors only need to pay the extra amount beyond what a U.S. shipment costs.\nInternational shipping. Calamityware plates can ship anywhere in the world. Orders outside the U.S. have a postage charge that varies depending on where the package is going. Porcelain plates are heavy, so postage costs are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, perhaps you can justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to plate shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your porcelain in their luggage next trip.\nCustoms inspectors are unpredictable.\nWe\u2019ll be using the U.S. Postal Service for the international shipments because that seems to minimize the number of packages that get hit with customs fees, and there are no extra broker fees added.\nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\n**********\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds. You can also receive a trickle of news about designing, producing, and enjoying Calamityware plates (and the other projects Don is working on) by liking the Calamityware Facebook page.\nCaring for porcelain is easy. How much pampering you give your porcelain should depend on how long you want it to last. I wrote a blog post that offers practical advice about living with porcelain. Read it and follow the advice if you want to keep your porcelain pristine.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section of this page.\nLeftovers from my Kickstarter projects are available after the rewards are sent out.\nPrevious Calamityware plates. If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find a few earlier plates at Calamityware.com. There are some other unusual products there, too, that began as Kickstarter-Don projects.\nWant to see more of Don\u2019s drawings? I post a new drawing of something almost every day on Flickr. You can see my preliminary Calamityware sketches and drawings in this Flickr album.\nDon", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors for a production run, I can green-light production right away.\n\nI\u2019m using a workshop that produces porcelain for monarchs and potentates and has perfected production techniques over 180 years. So technical problems are unlikely. The biggest risk is that the finished plates won\u2019t catch the cargo ship we want and will have to come over on the sister ship a month later.\n\nI promise that I\u2019ll do everything I can to accelerate the production and logistics steps.

Founded in 2015 by three AAA industry artists that wanted to create a game inspired by colorful and gross Saturday morning cartoons.\nOur team has worked on a lot over the years, from indie to AAA -- including League of Legends, Darksiders 2, Enter the Gungeon, and Ori and the Blind Forest!

We're big fans of 90s-era combat platformers, and are especially inspired by games like Mega Man X, Metal Slug and the Metroid series! Blubber Busters is definitely snuggled up in that same blanket and we aim to make something that stands toe-to-toe with the greats.\nWhales come to you for help, and who are you to turn them down? Pick your patient and get out there! Each afflicted whale effectively works as a single stage with its own set of problems and objectives you need to solve to help get it happy and healthy again. A whale with a stomach ache may have you trekking down into the stomach to clear out unwanted debris while dodging digestive acids, or a parasite infection may have you wiping out swaths of critters before taking on their queen!\nSwap between crew members to tackle each situation. Switch to the more agile Eva to climb a wall, burn through barriers with Rudy's flamethrower or kick-start machinery with some juice from Emmett's defibrillators! Or just cycle between all of them to give infections a thrashing. There's no I in team, so get to know the whole crew!\nTreating patients earns you cash! As you play, the whales who show up to your orbital \"waiting room\" will start exhibiting more and more acute symptoms; you'll have to quickly decide how to optimize your exploration for upgrades and needs for cash against the growing demands of your patients.\nDeck out your crew! Enhance their abilities, making them stronger, faster, and more effective! Give their health a boost or add some pep to their punches.\nUpgrades don't come free and some need to be researched!

Expand to accommodate more patients or build a lab to analyze new infections and get an edge with the latest tech -- spend that down-time growing your space station from a gutted wreck into a thriving medical facility!\n      Humans and space whales live in harmony among the stars. Why? Because we need them and they need us. The whales provide us with transport across the galaxy, access to resources and materials, and much-needed companionship and in return they only ask that we keep them healthy. For being such an ancient species living in deep space, they're not too bright and get themselves into all sorts of trouble.\nTheir docile and cuddly demeanors make for perfect company in the lonely expanse, so what kind of monster WOULDN'T do their best to make sure they're happy and disease-free?\nNaturally, clinics have sprung up across the stars offering these magnificent beasts relief from whatever ails them in return for a number of goods and/or services. Usually cash.\nA new mutation has started manifesting in the patients causing all sorts of aggressive behaviors in these otherwise sweet and docile space beasts.

As you race to save every patient that comes to your door, a sinister plot is unfolding... Good luck, Doctor!\n       Help us go beyond the stars and expand our game's content, platforms and more!\n  Swap that formal medical education for hands-on experience!

This gives us the freedom and speed of 3D animation while still harmonizing with stylish 2D effects!\nLook at all that harmonizing\nWe\u2019re extremely excited to announce that Chris Christodoulou - of Deadbolt and Risk of Rain fame - will be joining us to compose the soundtrack for Blubber Busters!

Talking to one that IS YOU! Become one with the lore or just mop up the floor. Work with us to figure out your place at the Orbital SVP!   \nBreakdown\n  As a funding solution, Kickstarter affords us the most independence, control, and artistic freedom. Most of our team is remote, but our core members will be moving closer to work under the same roof. We'll all be basically living in a small, hobbit-like commune scrabbling with one another for an extra flavor-packet for our ramen noodles. But we'll be making a game - a game that we really believe in!\nThis game is our passion project, and what you see already is the culmination of months of work through late nights, weekends, and some missed engagements. Most of us were wholly unpaid thus far - the others, paid out-of-pocket for their services by the core team. These out-of-pocket funds are starting to run dry, and so it's come to the point that if Blubber Busters is to become a reality, we need to focus on it - full time.\nWe strongly value being transparent and listening to our community - a great trait that we've learned from working at Riot. We want to make sure that our game is just as fun for us as it is for you, and we hope for your feedback throughout development to make that happen! \n Budget \n                                                                                                                                                                                                              Please feel free to reach out to us through any of the above channels, and if all else fails, you can shoot us an email at info@tharbemonsters.net\n   Special Thanks!\nShout out to all those that have helped us through our earlier stages of development - Alex Redfish, Kevin Culler, Priscilla Tsang, Khai Tran, Skylar Surra, Mike Ton, Terry Nguyen & Ai Tran.\n& thank you to Koujaku for the Ferr2D tool!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks come from the fact that game development is sometimes unpredictable and when that happens scheduling can be effected.\n\nLuckily, every core member of the team has more than five years experience working in game development and has seen at least one shipped title. We've been through the scoping and development process and we're confident that we've budgeted time appropriately given our funds. Should several designs take more iterations than previously estimated, we have several publishers and investors already courting us, so we're willing to entertain those options to ensure that the best

We are united by an interest in the gaming industry and the desire to develop vivid and memorable games. A year ago, we started developing a game called Furious Jack and look forward to your support in completing this project.\n    The player can fight with his fists or use various weapons.\n        We love hand-drawn graphics and animation, and we want to create a high-quality image. We were inspired by games such as Comix Zone, Street of Rage, Castlevania Symphony of the Night. And we want to create a non-linear \u2018beat \u2018em up\u2019 and introduce a variety of branched levels.\n    Various platform elements.\n  Various combos.\n  FORGINGAMES TEAM\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur team is a group of friends who dream of creating video games. Gathered together, we spent our spare time for a year working on our first game - Furious Jack. After a year of hard work based on pure enthusiasm, we realized that keeping the team and finishing the game would be very difficult without the help of the Kickstarter community.\nIn the end, we realized that we have to devote all our time to our work or it would be very difficult to complete the game. We have to spent not only our free time but also a lot of money and the cost of the development became more than our daily earnings.\nThe help of the Kickstarter community will help us to devote all our time to the development as well as provide us with the necessary funds for production costs.\nWe appreciate your opinion and comments. We really want to create a game that will please both you and us, and we believe that with your help, we will succeed. If there is something in a project that you do not like or you think that you have a good idea for the game, we are happy to listen to you and try to improve.\nRelease date\nWe hope with your help to release a working beta build of the game in the summer of 2017 and the final version in the fall of 2017.

And often, developers cannot reasonably estimate the time and amount of future work. It would be a mistake to think that our project will not have some problems. But the good news is that most of the preliminary work is completed. During the initial development, we have managed to assemble a team of enthusiasts, all dedicated to the work of the dream.\n\nThe greatest risk is that in order to polish the game, we will have to move the release date. We are fully aware of the importance of respecting the deadline, so the community continues to believe in the project and support us. The game means to us a lot, because it is also the work of our dreams and we believe that the quality of the final product is important to you, as well as us. We will do everything possible to release the game in this period without affecting the quality of the project.

If I were a blob, I would be just a random blue blob in the middle of nowhere, eating pizza and playing video games like Minecraft, Pokemon, Pokemon Go, and Legend of Zelda.

With the help of a growing list of partners like Xbox, Intel, the MIT Game Lab and so many others, we're determined to address the gender gap in the games industry, one camp at a time. \nEmily's story is not unique. From being stereotyped to being ignored, it's hard work trying to combat the hostility that women - especially young women - face in video game communities these days.\nOne of the reasons we started Girls Make Games was to give burgeoning young developers in the face of these sometimes discouraging experiences the confidence and experience they'll need to pursue careers in video games or technology.\nThe more support we can get for programs like Girls Make Games, the more confident young women will feel about becoming developers - knowing that others like them are getting the recognition, encouragement, and support they need.\nA special Thank You to all our industry partners and sponsors!\nLet's be Friends!\nThe girls and team would be very thankful if you could help spread the news about this game development project on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram, or whichever social media network you prefer.\n\nPlease feel free to leave a comment on this Kickstarter, or follow us on Facebook or Twitter!!! We would love your feedback.\nNext Year and BEYOND\nWe're so excited to share that as of this August, 929 girls that have gone through Girls Make Games summer camps + workshops around the world! \n\nSome interesting stats:\n#Cities: 38 US + international\n#Events (camps/workshops): 61\nNew international cities this year (2016):\nLahore, Pakistan,\nSao Palo, Brazil\nBerlin, Germany\nLondon, UK\nAl Ain, UAE \nMontreal, Canada\nFor the first time ever, we're also launching an online curriculum this December that will be available for download at no cost.

After coming face to face with the glitch, GUS is able to interact and speak to you- the player of GLITCHED. The traumatic event of suddenly losing his friend significantly affects GUS, but luckily you\u2019ll be there to guide him through.\nTogether, you and GUS will explore the world of SOREN and discover the truth behind it all. Each choice you make might influence who decides to be your friend or foe   \nYou\u2019ll travel from crowded cities to ancient kingdoms. Remnants and tales of the past will lead you to the answers of the present.\nYou're bound to meet plenty of strange characters on your journey. Some will be friends and other foes- perhaps that choice is left up to you.\n  At its core, GLITCHED is a story driven RPG where the player is constantly making decisions that have an impact of the world of SOREN. \nIn GLITCHED, the ESSENCE SYSTEM will track a player's choices and shape their personality and morality. This system will give each player a unique experience. \nBy exploring the world in your own way, you\u2019ll generate points towards six different ESSENCE alignments. \nThese alignments serve as personality types which will impact characters, story and the world around you. Your interaction with NPCs, how you explore the environment, combat, and even your conversations with GUS will determine your ESSENCE.   \nEach ESSENCE focuses on certain character traits and ideologies. No ESSENCE is good or evil, but instead explains the reasons behind your actions. Through meeting and talking to different NPCs, you\u2019ll get a better idea of what each ESSENCE is about. \n  GLITCHED uses traditional turn based combat with a few twists:\nThere is no leveling or random monster encounters.\nAll combat is story based and players will be making choices that may or may not lead to a brawl.\nLeveling up and experience are also removed. \nPlayers will have to use different party members and equipment in order to change how they approach each battle.\nDeciding to kill, spare, or find another way to stop a fight will all lead to different story outcomes.\nActions in battle are limited to three types: Fighting, Interacting, & Goodies. When enemies cannot fight anymore you'll be able to choose to kill or spare them which will alter the story. \nYou might also choose to interact with your enemy to resolve the conflict in a different way . Lastly, you'll be able to use items in battle to bring about various effects.\nCheck out our stretch goals section to see possible additions to the features of GLITCHED. There are plenty of things to be added, but prioritizing main game play features in the demo means smaller additions did not find their way in.\n  The soundtrack for GLITCHED features music composed by our very own Justin Hilton. Our friend Stijn Van Wakeren also composed a few songs and produced all of the tracks for the demo. Check out more of his work here. Visit the GLITCHED Soundcloud for more tracks here or check out the Band Camp to purchase some of the songs here.\n                                                               Forget Me Not\n                                                                  Kinda Lost\n                                                            Slick Like Green Skin\n                                                     Composed by Stijn Van Wakeren\n                                                                  Safe & Sound\n                                   We kept backer rewards as simple as possible.

The early bird special includes the full game, the soundtrack, and the dev book for $10 but is only for the first 75 backers.\n                                          \u22c6 STRETCH GOALS \u22c6\n  Customize a hub town! You\u2019ll be able to pick and choose the layout, buildings, and residents. A quiet (or noisy) place for you and your friends to kick back.\nBebo's are our lovable flightless birds. As a species, they are quite infatuated with Gus. As you traverse the world, you\u2019ll run into all different sorts of them. As any good RPG would have you do: it\u2019s time to collect them all.\nPut your number crunching to the test against a series of turn based combat trials. You\u2019ll be able to build an arcade in your hub town which will include boss rush modes, new game play, and more.\nOur pixel portraits for each character could use a little love, and with this stretch goal you\u2019ll get two upgrades for the price of one. First, each character will get a nice little talking animation to go along with their speech. Second, each character will get a full sheet of emotions to help bring conversations to life just a bit more. \nLet\u2019s get those enemy sprites movin\u2019 and groovin\u2019. With this stretch goal we\u2019ll add enemy animations along with some animation to the character cards for your allies. Making the battles just a bit more lively might help during some of those longer encounters.\nThis stretch goal will encompass quite a lot of content. We can\u2019t give away too many details about additions to the game, but you can expect more hours of game play at this stretch goal. This will add things like new places to explore, new quests and characters, new equipment, and more branching stories. At this funding level, we\u2019ll be able to create our \u2018dream game\u2019 without leaving content out that we really wished to see in the full release.\nGLITCHED already has tons of replay-ability with the Essence System, but with New Game+ you will challenge tougher enemies, uncover hidden secrets, and more to reward players who want to experience everything. More details will come once it's unlocked! \nThe friendship system will allow your party members to interact with one another. They will gain points being in the party together and learn tag skills in battle. More character backstory and cool skills await with the friendship system!\nNew quests and characters come along with the day and night system. You'll be able to wait or use an inn to cycle the time of day. Different quests and characters will be available during different parts of the day. More secrets and complex quests!\nPlay GLITCHED on PS Vita! All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nPlay GLITCHED on PS3 and PS4!

While the team is small, we are completely dedicated to this project. Through the demo, we hope to showcase our ability to fully develop GLITCHED. En House Studios LLC is an established limited liability company. \nAll funds earned through Kickstarter will be put directly into the company and go towards the development of GLITCHED. Funding allocation can be seen below in the money section.\nTUMBLR | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | RPGMaker.net | Itch.io | Press Kit | Steam GREENLIGHT\n    ZACK - Programmer  |  JUSTIN - Composer & Designer | NIKKO - Lead Designer & Artist \nOur friends:\nAnthony Luna (Enemy/Faces Pixel Art) \nStijn Van Wakeren (Soundtrack Production) \nLou H.\nIf you have any questions, get in contact with us through Kickstarter or social media. We\u2019ll make a video of us answering questions we get!\n  Let\u2019s talk cash. The reason we are here on Kickstarter is because we need more than our personal funds to fully develop GLITCHED. Above, you\u2019ll see the breakdown plan of our spending. A sizable chunk will go to backer rewards. Our development costs can be seen by adding art, soundtrack, licensing, and graphic design together. These all add up to fifty percent of the total. Art will go towards paying our pixel artists and promotional artists. Soundtrack will go towards producing our compositions. Kickstarter fees and taxes will take about ten percent. What\u2019s left will be spent on promotion which gets us to our full budget.   \nThis budget changes in the event that we earn more than our asking amount. We\u2019ll update this little pie chart if that does happen to keep you informed on where your money will be going. We wish to be transparent on how we will use these funds and will answer ANY possible question you have about spending. We take development costs very seriously and believe open communication is important to crowdfunding.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter is a risk. What we have tried to do is showcase not only our serious dedication to the project, but also that we have the skills, means, and environment to develop GLITCHED. We hope that our Kickstarter and demo has provided you enough confidence to consider backing us.\n\nWith that said, game development has its risks. There are everyday risks such as health, family, and life issues that might happen to anyone. Development risks are where most problems arise. For us, this means extended deadlines, delayed development, or the feared \"running out of funds.\" We have taken a look at the necessities for GLITCHED and have carefully based our budget around that. With more money behind the project comes more security, content, and quality. Our main goal is to deliver GLITCHED. We have estimated a release date of February 2018 but the stated risks could possibly change that.\n\nWe have laid out our case in this Kickstarter. We have the ability to produce GLITCHED and our demo shows a taste of what the final product will look like. We hope you understand the risks that might happen down the road but also take a look at what we have done to earn your trust in us. We believe greatly in transparency and there will be nothing that happens in development which we don't relay to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "Our thanks & a tiny place in our hearts.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Full Game", "descp": "Digital download of GLITCHED upon release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["1,841 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Soundtrack", "descp": "Digital download of the soundtrack for GLITCHED.

We\u2019ve already attached the extraordinary Dileep Rao (Avatar, Inception) to lend his vocal chords to the character of Death.\nNEW 35,000 - New Game Plus\nWith New Game Plus you\u2019ll be able to pick the version of Close Your you want to replay, and strategize ways to make sure you see all the story content the game has to offer. Want to share your unique experience of Close Your with a friend? At the start of the game you\u2019ll be able to control what Randomized events will feature in your play playthrough Want to explore every nook and cranny of what Close Your has to offer? You\u2019ll be able to pause and view a constantly updating diagram showing paths you\u2019ve already taken and give you hints to what's still out there to explore. This mode will appeal to die-hard complesionists, but also anyone who wants to make their experience of Close Your completely their own, becoming a true co-author in the story we\u2019re telling together everytime you play.\n                     Close Your is a first person interactive short story where you live an entire life, from birth to death, and make decisions big and small that shape the outcome of that life. The catch is that each scene only lasts as long as you can keep your eyes open. The game uses your webcam to track your eyes in real life, so every time you blink, you skip forward: could be five seconds or five years. Life literally flashes before your eyes as you try desperately to hold onto each fleeting moment.\nWith your help, Close Your will release onto Steam in February 2017.\nAs you look up, you see the oncoming car. It's too late. You close your eyes to brace for impact and time seems to stop. When you open them again, you are standing in front of Death himself\u2026\nAfter signing away your life, Death sends you back to earth for one last visit. You now blink through your entire life, from the most mundane moments to the most vital. You learn to walk, struggle through school, face the monotony of work, meet the person you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life with, and even raise a child of your own. \nSince blinking is an inevitable physical process, each of these vignettes is imbued with inherent tension. You may close your eyes on your first kiss, and open them at your wedding, or close your eyes on a fight with your mother, only to open them at her funeral. \nClose Your\u2019s narrative branches by tracking how you behave in each scene, rather than presenting you with obvious moral choices. When sitting at the office do you do your work on the computer, or do you listen to an amusing co-worker\u2019s joke? The game clocks these behaviors and the story adapts dynamically to reflect your unique disposition and values, your strengths as well as your flaws.\nWith each iteration of Close Your we\u2019ve improved our game's look with the resources we had at our disposal. With your help, we want to redesign our game\u2019s look from the ground up, with unique models and animations for each character and every scene. We think this is absolutely vital to creating an immediate connection between players and in-game characters.\nWe\u2019ve already begun creating a more specific and emotionally rich aesthetic for Close Your\u2019s levels and NPC's. Take a look at a small sampling of concept art below:\n            Close Your has a dynamic score that responds to the game's branching narrative. Each scene triggers a unique musical sequence or phrase, so as we expand the game, we're going to need to record a much larger score. We also want to elevate the tonal quality of the score by paying for high quality recording equipment and professional musicians. We think that a more lush expansive score will bring Close Your to life.\nListen to some samples of our current demo\u2019s music below: \n  Right now, Close Your is a great proof of concept demo, but we're asking for your support to make it the best game it can possibly be. \n  Redesigning the characters and environments will be our largest task. We\u2019re going back to the drawing board in order to create characters and environments that live and breath. With your support we\u2019ll be able to hire talented 3D artists to model, rig, and animate our concepts.\nOne of our big goals for this campaign is to rebuild the blink detection software we\u2019ve been using so that it\u2019s universally compatible with any webcam-equipped computer. We've already spoken with capable freelancers who've given us quotes and are ready to go.\n3D art without 2D art is like rhythm without melody. This part of our budget will go towards texturing our 3D models and creating other assets like user interface, titles, and promotional images.\nThis part of our budget goes towards recording a new score with professional musicians and diverse instrumentation. We\u2019re also going to use sound design to add another layer of detail and texture.\nT-shirts, posters, shipping, and any other costs associated with delivering physical assets to get you what we've promised.\nKickstarter takes a 5% fee, and additional 3-5% are charged for processing payments. The last 5-7% is to help us account for cancelled payments and taxes.\n    GoodbyeWorld Games is a fresh game studio made from old friends with new ideas.

It is John\u2019s hope that through playing games, people will be opened up to new viewpoints, patterns of thinking, and understanding.\nGraham Parkes is a filmmaker, playwright and independent game designer from Los Angeles.

At the moment our software is PC only, so one of our biggest priorities will be making it universally compatible. That's one of the main reasons why we decided our game was right for Kickstarter. We've joined forces with a team of programmers who are geared up and ready to rebuild a more robust, flexible and OS agnostic blink detection software. If we reach our goal anyone with a webcam will be able to play our game.\n\nA challenge that many video game Kickstarters face is the possibility of delay. With Close Your, we've given ourselves a reasonable margin of error in our timeline. Even so, we know from experience that making games can be a visceral and organic process. Ensuring that every moment feels and plays right is always going to be the most important thing to us, but we've learned over the years how to prioritize perfectionism without sacrificing expediency.\n\nWith your support we hope to make the best possible version of our game. We have a clear idea of what that entails: A rich new look and feel; a longer, more intricate branching narrative; a sweeping, emotional score; and a homegrown blink recognition software that will work on any computer with a webcam.

Interact with unforgettable characters and visit the shop to stock up on equipment and buy new special abilities. See the Blacksmith outside the arena for powerful weapon mods and replay levels for diamonds which can be used to purchase unique special abilities and buffs.\nVisually the game draws inspiration from cartoons such as Adventure Time and Gravity Falls, aiming for a bright and engaging aesthetic everyone can enjoy. The gameplay may remind you of a mashup of some classic 2D and 3D platforming games such as Zelda 2 and Banjo Kazooie. We\u2019ve also added modern mechanics and fresh ideas to reinvigorate these genres for a brand spanking new adventure.\nThe Adventure Pals is a mixture of lovingly handcrafted platformer levels, combat focused arenas and RPG-like locations with townsfolk who provide quests, items and other goodies for you to buy to aid you on your journey.\nYou will always have another quest to complete. Rescue Lady Pancake, the ousted ruler of the toast kingdom, and find the ingredients to make an owl & trombone soup for a crab-chef. Find a bikini so a whale who is too embarrassed to swim naked can become your personal water taxi - or assassinate an emo deer who refuses to like your Facebook status - y\u2019know, normal stuff like that.\nCompleting quests earns you rubies, and rubies are what you need to get your Papa back. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and get questing! We want to keep each one fresh so we\u2019ve made a big effort to avoid tedious fetch quests.\nExplore the world on the back of your giraffe. Your travels take you across a huge world filled with zombie pirate cats, post-apocalyptic dinosaurs and hotdogs that poop explosive mines. Explore the mystical forests of Treevale, hike the haunted craters of the moon and dive into the depths of the ocean to find the lost city of Crablantis.\nExplore a magical world atop your giraffe!\nThe world will be big; with 5 distinct areas, each with unique characters, traps and enemies. Each area has 2 towns with their own stories, histories and whacky populations for you to meet. They also each have an arena, a shop and 5 sets of levels. Once you have unlocked these locations, you will be able to ride to any of them at any time.\nTake down colossal monsters in nail-biting boss fights! We have put a tremendous amount of effort into making sure that the bosses are all as EPIC and ridiculous as possible.\nThe Breakfast Buccaneer\nThe game is full of bizarre enemies because, for us, it\u2019s all about being as whacky and creative as we can be. So when designing enemies, we\u2019ll scrap ideas that aren\u2019t \u2018weird\u2019 enough. This has resulted in a really unique world that is always rewarding to explore.\nTreefist - The terror of Treevale\nAdventuring by yourself is great, but let\u2019s be fair, isn\u2019t everything better with your best buddy by your side? Well, that\u2019s why Co-op game play is a big part of the Adventure Pals. Now you can bash up baddies alongside your BFF!\nIt\u2019s super simple so that nothing stands in the way of jumping into some high intensity 2 player co-op action! It works like this: Player 2 plugs in a gamepad and hits the 'Start' button. Immediately a new character bursts on to the scene, and just like that, they are in. You don\u2019t need to start a new adventure or go to a menu screen. Simple! We aim to make everything in the game as elegant, intuitive and unobtrusive as possible. Plus - everything is better with your friends.\nBut wait there is more! There are so many things that we are excited about with the Adventure Pals that it is hard to tell you about everything.\nA backpack full of explosives and potions! A simple inventory system lets you store bombs, potions and special items. \nBombs; some blow things up, while others turn enemies into harmless bunnies. \nShops with an abundance of goods & services. Timelapse below of Julian drawing the shop in Pirate Cove.\nThere are many potions to uncover which give you special bonuses such as double XP or temporary invulnerability. \nActivate special moves such as Sparkles the giraffe pulling a scary face so terrifying it throws enemies into a panic! \nMini-games: Wager your hard earned gold at the chicken racing or kick-back and relax with a spot of Yak herding.\nFully animated cutscenes: We have one already and have another one planned, but with your help, we'd like to add more. \nImpress your friends with these exclusive Kickstarter skins for your pals. Who will you choose the moustache pals or the potato pals?\nWith this fabulous t-shirt, you can wear a giraffe. You can be a giraffe. You can wear your friends. Top it off with the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, an exclusive hand-made collector giraffe beanie hat. Each one individually created with love and care, making each unique in its own special way.\nWe have teamed up with Indiebox to bring you a physical Collector\u2019s Edition of the game. Just like in the olden times when you could actually hold a copy of a game you loved in your hands and then go to sleep hugging it as it kept you warm through the night.\nWe're also pleased to announce that we'll be part of the Kicking It Forward initiative, meaning we'll be supplying 5% of the games earnings back into other Kickstarters.\nSo why has it taken you guys so dang long? \nAs mentioned above, the game has changed and transmogrified from a creepy and disgusting caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly. That is to say, we have gone from creating something destined for the web and the restrictions that that implies into building a fully fledged game title. This has meant abandoning an old technology (Flash) in favour of a new one (Haxe + Unity). In terms of programming and art assets, this also meant starting again\u2026 from scratch. Twice.\nWe haven\u2019t been able to work on it full time all of the time. For the first 2 years, it was a part-time project, with Julian studying and me trying to keep the wolves from the door making web games. After Julian\u2019s visit and our partnership with Armor Games we were able to put a good 7 months full time into the project before our funding ran out. And this is where we are now. With more to do, without the funding to finish and in need of your help.  \nThere are two reasons we are excited to be a part of Kickstarter. Firstly, we need funding for us to be able to finish the game:\nWe still need to complete the quests and polish some of the levels \nFinalise all the dialogue and story sections to the game. \nImprove the role of player 2 in co-op \nPay for more audio and sound effects.\nCover software license fees.\nSecondly, we want to connect directly with you and have backers help shape the game. We think Kickstarter campaigns are an amazing opportunity for small developers like us to communicate directly with you and those who may be interested in the game. We really want to hear what you think and have you help craft the game and be a part of its story. We really hope you\u2019ll consider backing the project.\nEvery game needs music, right? Right. Well so does this one. But we don't make music we make games, so to solve this problem we have enlisted the mighty HyperDuck SoundWorks who you may know from Dust: An Elysian Tail, Knightmare Tower and Kingdom Rush. They have 10 years of experience under their belt and have created some incredible soundscapes for the Adventure Pals already. We have been fans of their work for a long time and so it has been a real thrill for us to have them on the project and the work they have done so far is absolutely incredible.\n\nJulian has the power to bring objects to life with his magical drawing. He draws a face on a cup of coffee and BANG! It bursts to life. It's true! OK, so it's not true, but it would be cool if he could. He has worked on over 15 games and has an imagination the size of an elephant, a really big elephant.\nJay Armstrong is the fella who puts the 'code' into 'guy who codes things'. Equipped with a vague knowledge of how to make sure the computer doesn't spontaneously set on fire, he programmes particles, physics, projectiles, pyjamas, parcels and paperclips. He has worked on a bunch of games and has even had one featured in a London museum (no, not because it was old, but because it was related to the exhibition silly!)\nJimp is your man for door opening, Got a door? Does it need opening? Jimp can open it. Some people find it difficult, but not him. He is good at it. He co-created Sushi Cat and has worked on loads of games you might have played such as Crush the Castle Adventures and Achievement Unlocked.\nWe have been working on this game for a long time. It's been a crazy journey but we are so excited about what we are creating and truly hope that you'll be a part of the adventure and back the game. Thank you so, so much.\nxx Jay & Julian xx", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking any game is a challenging and difficult thing to do.

Click HERE!\nPrey for the Gods is coming to PS4, Xbox One, Mac and Steam, with successful campaign completion! No stretch goal required.\n  Read about this recent announcement of PS4 & Xbox One.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802508750/prey-for-the-gods/posts/1635921\n  In Prey for the Gods, you play a lone hero sent to the edge of a dying world to discover the mystery behind a never-ending winter. Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to.\nCore Features:\nColossal battles with giants where you can climb your foes \nA vast and mysterious frozen world with dynamic snow terrain that you must traverse\nIntense survival game play\nExplore mysterious temples that contain secrets and treasure.\nDynamic weather and day/night cycle\nNon-linear game play where you choose who to battle and how\nLoot the fallen heroes and equip yourself with weapons and supplies\nUnique musical score\n  Prey for the Gods ambitiously combines the game play of Shadow of the Colossus, Deus Ex, DayZ, and BloodBorne. It has tight controls, action-packed boss fights and a frozen mysterious world to explore.\nPrey for the Gods can be played with a keyboard or a game pad. Your basic actions are attack, move and dodge/climb. Simple to learn and critical to master. You control the hero from a third person perspective and can explore the world in any direction. Dodging is crucial as the creatures that inhabit this island are not forgiving in battle and will not give mercy.\nThe combat in Prey for the Gods is fast-paced, brutal, and up to you. Each of the giants you encounter will be unique. To be victorious, you need to discover and exploit their weaknesses then climb on and defeat them. Do you take the giants head-on and dodge their massive attacks, striking when the time is right? Or hide from their gaze and sneak up on them? Pick up a sword, find a bow and arrow, fly through the air with a grapple hook, or use your bare hands.\nYou decide how to fight, and you decide how to survive. In battle, weapons can break, and arrows are finite, so do your best to make every shot count. Luckily, you can pull out the arrows you shoot. Discover the giants weaknesses, climb and defeat them.\n    Composer Ian Dorsch has been writing and recording music for games and related media for the better part of 15 years. His game audio work runs the gamut from AAA (Gears of War 3, Xbox Fitness) to indie (Airborn \u2013 Pino\u2019s Journey), and as a contributor to Polygon, The Escapist and Gamers With Jobs, Ian has written theme music for some of the longest-running podcasts and video series in gaming (Zero Punctuation). In addition to his work as a freelance composer, Ian is also a singer and choir director, and he currently directs the Grays Harbor Chamber Singers and the Vestr Singers, a professional vocal ensemble from the Seattle area.\nSkewsound has the experience and talent to bring the cold atmosphere of Prey for the Gods to life. Having done sound and music for a number of AAA and notable indie games including Chariot, Lost Within, Knee Deep, Magic Circle, RockBand 4, Gigantic, and Grim Dawn\nExploration is rewarding but risky. Luckily, your footsteps in deep snow will help guide you back if you get lost. However, the deeper the snow the more tired and hungry you will be. Hunt for food, then pick up what you can and find a safe cave to rest. Build yourself up from nothing, salvage items and weapons from fallen heroes including swords, bows, outfits, and more.\nSpend too long out in the cold and risk exposure that will chill you to the bone. Our dynamic weather system is treacherous and ever changing. From a sunny day, to a blizzard at a moment\u2019s notice you never know what to expect. The weather is just as dangerous as the giants you are after. A trek out to find your next foe could have you changing course and looking for shelter to warm yourself.\n   \nNo Matter Studios is developing Prey for the Gods. Comprised of three veteran game developers with approximately 30+ years of combined experience.\nBrian Parnell - @brianjparnell\n\"Director\"\nArt and Design and email LOTS of email;)\nIn 2004, I got my first job play testing at Nintendo and then my first development job as an artist at Iron Lore working on Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Immortal Throne, Dawn of War: Soulstorm. After that I worked at Harmonix which included Rock Band 2, & RockBand: Beatles. I mainly did 3D character art and some concept/UI work too before getting more interested in proper management and focusing on game development as a whole. All of this while staying up late helping with friends indie projects including Natural Selection 2, and Grim Dawn. \nTim Wiese - @timjwiese\n\"Alchemist\" Art and Programming\n\"I've been working in the games industry since 2009, started off as an Environment Artist and over I time transitioned into Technical Artist/Tools Engineer, then to Engineer. As a gamer with love for a good story, I'm driven by the desire to develop a game that is Fun first and foremost (yes fun with a capital \"F\", it's important), with the depth to leave a lasting mark.\"\nHung-Chien Liao - @akyangliao\n\"Architect\", Programming\n\u201cI make the magic happen.\u201d That\u2019s all Chien wanted to say, mainly because the guy is too busy atm.\n  We started development of Prey for the Gods game in 2014 part time. We've been full time, living on our savings, since January 2016. For 3 people, we've come pretty far and are about 25% of the way in development. While we've come a long way, there's still a lot of work left to do. In order for us to continue development and keep creative control we need to ask for your help.\n    UPDATE: Prey for the Gods will launch with 5 bosses. At the initial budget of $300k, we'll release the game on Windows/Steam with boss types ranging from bipedal, quadruped and flying body types. Following Steam release we will begin porting the game to PS4, and Xbox One. This combined with intense survival based action combat, dynamic weather, and non-linear game play will give players a great experience at a fair value.  \nFurther stretch goals allow us to expand scope. We can add more art, animations, orchestral score, and more bosses. Most importantly we can hire an animator and hire a world builder. \nBoss stretch goals will be released after the initial 5 boss launch on Windows/Steam and not-simultaneous console release. Stretch goal bosses will be free to all backers that back at the $15 amount or more. \nStretch Goals!\n    $15 Backer = PC Digital Copy of the game, to be delivered via Steam upon release.\n  $25 Backer Plus = A Digital copy of Prey for the Gods (choose which platform if stretch goals are met), Elite Grappling Hook In-Game Item, & Digital Wall Papers\n  $35 Backer Deluxe = Digital copy of the Original Soundtrack for Prey for the Gods, and a digital copy of the Art Book.

To do this we have put in a great deal of our own funds into the development of this so far. It was important to us to have real skin in this before asking for outside funding. We have also been incredibly ruthless with our scope and brutal with our budgeting. Because of this effort we\u2019re able to have a road map that we feel comfortable with as Prey for the Gods come to fruition with your help.\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: There is inherent risk in completing any project let alone a video game project. Estimates are much harder to lock down early in development. Prey for the Gods is far enough along in development to shed some of that risk, but it needs your help to get across the finish line. We have been working on this game part time since 2014 and full time since January 2016. During that time we\u2019ve developed, and documented our core mechanics, game play loops, combat, climbing tech, and weather systems. Doing this has allowed us the ability to scope and estimate more accurately. However, we\u2019ve been shipped a number of games and we know that even with the best planning development can change, and slip. Given our past game development experience we know how to manage this when it does crop up and our backers will be first to know and we will do our best to meet those challenges head on.\n\nCONSOLES: We've listened to our fans and placed consoles platforms in a position where we can make it work for our development. To make this possible we had to remove the Mac version. This was no easy decision but one that we feel is possible if the stretch goals are met. It is very likely that the console development will be staggered to allow us the time and resources to release each version in the best state possible. To speed this up it could mean working with partners to deliver specific platform versions for an even smoother deadline, by entering into these partnerships it can also push out other platform releases for a number of reasons.\n\nHYPE vs REALITY: Our plan is to stay as true to our vision and make necessary adjustments for the goals of making the game as fun, and exciting as possible. However, sometimes the last 10% of development can take 90% of the time. Luckily, we\u2019ve made enough solid games to understand that early feedback and iteration are key. Our plan is to do play-testing during development to help us guide that polish so that we focus on what matters most.

Sometimes we take time to make adjustments in order to deliver a better game. Other times we take time because there are external factors that push our hand. This is one of those times where external factors have come into play.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous update, one of us has been dealing with an unexpected family emergency. This has unfortunately progressed to where they'll need some time away from work. In the meantime, we will continue to polish and finalize the game, but this means that we will not make our April release target as hoped. We're sorry that you'll have to wait a little longer, but we need to do what's right by our team and the people closest to them.\n\nWe're a small studio and we want to keep it that way. The downside is that when one of us needs to take some unexpected time away, it means that 33% of our company is suddenly not there. Even with that difficulty, we couldn't have started a studio and worked on the game if it wasn't for the direct support of our families and all of you. Releasing the game is how we can thank you; being there for our families in times of crisis is how we can thank them.\n\nWe also want to assure you that the v1.0 version of the game is still coming to consoles and Steam.

We're giving you an extra pair free to compensate.\n      Having stumbled upon a study by social psychologist Dr. Adam Galinsky proving colorful socks literally change the way we think, act and how others perceive us, we knew we had to test the theory.\nWe created a batch of incredible socks and went to work. We found those wearing colorful socks received 427% more comments on how well they dressed and 97% of people wearing Bryt Socks felt happier and more confident! \nAs a result of our research and requests for more designs we injected 8 proven features into the drab sock and created the ultimate 25 designs. Bryt Socks say - 'I know the rules and I\u2019m confident enough to break them.'\nSee what our founding community from June 2015 had to say.\nAfter our first campaign we shipped over 10,000 socks from a limited range of 9 designs in the most unforgettable boxes on the planet. Our backers said:\nSo we listened, enhanced the technology and brought you more enviable designs to choose from.\nWhether you're at work, the gym or its time to play, Bryt Socks 2.0 will make you the standout performer and centre of attention.\nSince our first campaign in 2015 we've got much better at producing the ultimate colourful sock. We're now able to bring you more designs for a better value at up to 51% off retail prices.\n  Prices shown in USD and EURO are approximate conversions from GBP. \nOnce the project ends, we'll send you a Backer Survey to gather your design and size choices. Pick how many pairs you want at this stage.\n    Bryt means - BOLD\n  9 designs wasn't enough. With plenty of requests for more we created the ultimate 25 designs.\n  25 Awesome Designs\nWe learnt that shipping charges feel bad but are essential to receiving your product. As a compromise we're throwing in an extra pair for International backers and complimentary shipping for all UK pledges.\n      We have partnered with Playtonic, a fellow British Kickstarter-funded company to dream up the merchandise item you\u2019ve all been waiting for\u2026 limited edition Yooka-Laylee socks!\nTo buy a pair, select a reward tier between 1 - 9 pairs and when our campaign ends you can choose your size and design options in the post campaign backer survey. You\u2019ll want to keep a pair fresh for when Yooka-Laylee arrives.\nThey're crafted in the same material with the same added features as the rest of our range of 25 designs. Make sure to add a couple of Bryt designs whilst you're here. \nBryt means - FUN\n  3 Packs or more come in the most outrageous boxes on the planet. Its a surprise which turns up at your door. \nLooking down on Bryt Socks 2.0 signature Gift Boxes\nThey fit 3 pairs, so for every 3 pairs you order you'll receive a signature Gift Box. You can re-use it to package anything you want. Christmas is only around the corner :)\nWhen you open our bundle of joy you'll have a laugh, but don't laugh your socks off.\nA snippet of humour. Comedy cards included in every reward.\n  Bryt means - CONFIDENT\n  Designing the Ultimate Colourful Sock isn't easy. Calling on proven added features and valuable feedback we've tweaked our product to perfection.\nBryts new elasticated cuff design means your socks stay high, just like your mood.\nSuper Stretchy Cuff Deisgn\nWhether you want to pull them high or hang low, we incorporated the best elastane to make exceptional linear stretch. \nExceptional Linear Stretch\nLearning from our first socks, we tested and created our new socks to cater for the widest populace whilst retaining the best fit.\nBryt means - UNIQUE\n  We appreciate everyone is different. Some have big feet and others small and tested 100's of sizes to ensure the best, most ergonomic fit available in 2 sizes.\n  Bryt means - EXCITEMENT\n  We'll be adding the ankle sock style to our range in 2 designs when we hit our first goal.\nThey'll be added to our roster of awesome designs and you will be free to choose which you want when the backer survey lands. Remember, for now, choose how many pairs you want.\nA lot of preparation goes into creating the Ultimate Colourful Sock and since November we've been working on just that. We learnt our lessons and set realistic production and shipping dates in time for Christmas Delivery. Woop.\nWe learnt from our mistakes - Realistic production and shipping time frames.\n  Bryt means - ADVENTURE\n      Now we need your support. In order to produce the Ultimate Colourful Socks in 25 amazing designs we must place a Minimum Order Quantity with our manufacturer.\nWhen we hit our funding goal every penny will go towards producing, packaging and shipping your rewards in plenty of time for Christmas.

Taking inspiration from Conker's Bad Fur Day, The Legend of Zelda and Metroidvania-style games.\nAction-platformer with metroidvania elements.\nCharacters fully voiced by voice actors.\nIncredibly dynamic main character.\nAvailable for Windows, Linux and Mac.\nVast world with many contrasting regions.\nCountless secrets and weapons.\n\nMeet the clumsy hero, Finch!\nFinch is a half human, half frog - a mongrel! This gives him mysterious powers. As quick as a hawk and strong as a bear Finch faces danger without fear!\nMongrel has an emphasis on action and exploration. We've included a very diverse arsenal of weapons. These items will never feel restricted to a certain dungeon or area since the world was built around their mechanics. \nWe want to challenge the player through intense combat sections and mindbending puzzles. \n    The world in Mongrel is vast and has huge contrasts. From the troll jungle, the icy cold island where the dead rest to the underworld where all the banished creatures dwell. \n\nWe got to show you some of the world in the trailer, but here are some concepts for areas we haven't started working on in-game. \nThis is a concept from the main human town in the overworld. With three levels that separate the different social classes of the comunity, the town will be the center of the world.\nTo the far west there's a jungle where trolls live up in the tall trees. This is to protect themselves from the evil that corrupts the ground-level. \nDeep underground is where all the banished creatures live. This is a concept for the underworld dungeon where Finch finds a new friend.\nInside of the volcano there's a chamber that the trolls use as a garbage dump. It stinks! But to reach his goal Finch has to dig through worse things than used toilet paper!\nThis is the Hollow Mountain, where Finch might find a new bird friend! \n   We also would like to show off some of the races and different cultures found in the game. There's lots of content we haven't started working on yet. Have a look!\nIn the east there's an icy island filled with freezing cold enemies! Some of them are already dead but haunt the island. \nA closer look at the trolls from the troll jungle! As you can tell they love eating eggs.\nThe human race, they're a huge pack of goofs!\n A collection of creature concepts for the jungle area.\nAs the game begins our hero Finch sets out on an adventure to retrieve 4 stolen artifacts. Not with the intention of saving the world, but to find his father. After the artifacts were stolen by evil the world has been corrupted. If retrieved and placed in a magical wheel these artifacts will let Finch communicate with the Gods and in turn he will find his lost father.\nBut there's a twist. Finch wants to find his father mainly so he can buy a toy he's not old enough to buy himself. Having a main character who's selfish and accidentally stumbles into situations where he does good deeds gives us a great angle for the more comedic moments in the game. It also gives us a great opportunity to make fun of the usual clich\u00e9s in games like this.\nJonathan Geer has already made 5 beautiful themes that adds an amazing atmosphere to the game. We've put together this video to give you a taste of the soundtrack, enjoy!\nWe also want a good sounding sound design. We've had Jordan Fehr help us a bit, and we've done some ourself (hint: the good sounds were made by Jordan). We will have a stretch goal that helps us get more professionally made sounds.\nWe formed a company last fall called Fischmell. This is the first title we're working on together. The team consists of long-time friends and we couldn't be more happy to be working on this together!\nRoar Haug\nRoar studied animation in Hamar, Norway. He loves to add a goofy element to almost everything he makes which gives the game a special kind of charm!\n\nFavorite games: Zelda: Wind Waker, Cave Story and Yoshi's island\nH\u00e5kon Wollan\n\nH\u00e5kon studied game design at NITH in Oslo and loves making games. Before Mongrel H\u00e5kon used to make games just to torture his friends.\n\nFavorite games: Zelda Ocarina of Time, Dark Souls, Super Metroid and Conker's Bad Fur Day.\nRasmus Gorset Berg\n\nRasmus also studied game design at NITH in Oslo. He loves to write and create lore. He also goes crazy at parties and loves orange cookies.\n\nFavorite games: Final Fantasy 7, Buck Bumble and Pokemon Stadium (mainly the mini games).\n  Domen Kozelj\n\nDomen has done some incredible work for us. Making a great foundation for us to build a visual style on. We've been very lucky to have Domen work for us. He's currently working on many exciting projects. Check out his website at http://www.domen-art.com/ to see more of his incredible work!\nJonathan Geer\n\nAnother person we're very lucky to have working for us is Jonathan Geer. We've been fans of his work for a long time. He's composed music for games like Hearth Forth Alicia, Owlboy, Neon Chrome, Wanderer, and many more! Listen to samples from the work he's done in the sound section. Check out his site at http://jonathangeer.com/ if you want to listen to more of his stuff!\n  This kickstarter is set up mainly to fund our external costs, not paychecks for the team. So we've set up this budget as the absolute minimum to make this project possible. \n   \nWe really appreciate help of any kind. Sharing the campaign on social media really makes a difference and would make us dance the happy-dance!\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe wont deny that there are risks, but those risks are not related to a lack of motivation, or a lack of desire to finish this project. The risks are related to one of our core members dying in a car crash or some other far fetched scenario.\n\nBut the team already failed to get funded in 2015. Despite this, we had a burning passion that kept us going even when it meant spending all our free time working. Never was it considered to drop the project. We've worked on Mongrel for a long time. We've grown as developers working on each iteration and we really want to complete it!\n\nAs long as the members of the team stay alive we will finish this. If we encounter any major issues we will be as transparent for the backers as we possibly can. Game development is difficult to plan, with so many obstacles to overcome that you don't see coming.

The drawings I like best make me laugh.\nThis project is about producing museum-quality dinner plates infested with a plethora of frogs. Imagine these bad boys behind your French toast! The closer you look, the more frogs you\u2019ll see.\nPlate prototype inspected and approved.\nWhat you\u2019ll get. Sponsors will receive porcelain dinner plates that are sturdy enough to use every day. Food safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe. Or you can hang them on your walls as evidence of your refined good taste and wry sense of humor.\nToo many frogs is a special kind of calamity.\nTop quality. Like the previous Calamityware\u2122 dinner plate series, these amphibian-infested plates will be produced at the award-winning Kristoff workshop in Poland using the in-glaze technique. Final production will feature white porcelain with a rich blue image\u2014destined to become treasured family heirlooms.\nIn-glaze plates are fired at extra-high temperatures to allow the image to melt slightly into the surface of the plate. Connoisseurs will appreciate the beauty of the in-glaze technique which the artists at Kristoff have been refining since 1831. This is the look of porcelain you see in museums. Sweet.\nFiring at high temperature fuses the image into the surface of the porcelain.\nA new dinner plate series. This plate design is the first in a series of four that will be Kickstarter projects in 2016. Next in the series you\u2019ll find [2] Jogging Sasquatch, [3] Zombie Poodles, and [4] Pterodactyl. There\u2019s even a pledge level (E) to get the whole series with one pledge. I\u2019ll ship the E-level rewards when the last plate in the series is done.\nWill all the plates in this series match? No. The designs of the plate borders and central image of each Calamityware plate are different. If you appreciate the notion of \u201ceclectic,\u201d you\u2019ll be delighted. But if you are a perfectionist about matching, you should order enough of your favorite Calamityware plate so all your guests have the same design.\nFree shipping in USA. If you live in the United States, there\u2019s no additional charge to deliver your reward to your door. We\u2019ll also apply the amount we\u2019ve budgeted for postage to international orders, so international sponsors only need to pay the extra amount beyond what a U.S. shipment costs.\nWhen can I expect these plates? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be dining with a plague of frogs in August 2016. Probably sooner.\nInternational shipping. Calamityware plates can ship anywhere in the world. Orders outside the U.S. have a postage charge that varies depending on where the package is going. Porcelain plates are heavy, so postage costs are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, perhaps you can justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to plate shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your porcelain in their luggage next trip.\nCustoms inspectors are unpredictable.\nWe\u2019ll be using the U.S. Postal Service for these shipments because that seems to minimize the number of packages that get hit with customs fees, and there are no extra broker fees added.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhat people are saying about this project\n\u201cThe frogs might be my favorite Calamityware design.\u201d The Amazing Karen\n\u201cFrogs! OMG! I can\u2019t wait to pounce on these.\u201d Suze\n\u201cAt first, everything looks normal. Then one notices a frog. Suddenly frogs are visible everywhere. Riveting.\u201d Charles\n\u201cNothing captures people\u2019s attention like a plague of frogs.\u201d Moses\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds. You can also receive a trickle of news about designing, producing, and enjoying Calamityware plates (and the other projects Don is working on) by liking the Calamityware Facebook page.\nCaring for porcelain is easy. How much pampering you give your porcelain should depend on how long you want it to last. I wrote a blog post recently that offers practical advice about living with porcelain. Read it and follow the advice if you want to keep your porcelain pristine.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section of this page.\nPrevious Calamityware plates. If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find a few earlier plates at Calamityware.com. There are some other unusual products there, too, that began as Kickstarter-Don projects.\nWant to see more of Don\u2019s drawings? I post a new drawing of something almost every day on Flickr. You can see my preliminary Calamityware sketches and drawings in this Flickr album. \nDon", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors for a production run, I can green-light production right away.\n\nI\u2019m using a workshop that produces porcelain for monarchs and potentates and has perfected production techniques over 180 years. So technical problems are unlikely. The biggest risk is that production or delivery will take longer than anticipated. In the past, I have had to wait while bigger orders got to go in the kiln ahead of me. That might happen again. But our turn will come eventually.\n\nI promise that I won\u2019t stop working until all my sponsors receive their Calamityware plates. My gloomiest prediction is that we will ship by the end of August 2016. I will try to make it sooner.

I thought the Nura sounded too good to be true. But then I tried a pair, and that shut me up quick smart.\" - Luke Lancaster, CNET\n    We know that most backers won't have the opportunity to experience Nura before pledging, but we are confident that you are going to love Nura. We will reward your faith in us by offering a 30-day money back guarantee. It\u2019s simple. If you don\u2019t like the comfort or love the sound of your Nura headphones, send them back within 30-days for a full refund.\nSome headphones sound tinny and lack beat, others have too much bass which drowns out the detail. The acoustic separation of Nura\u2019s design allows for the deepest bass and clearest tones. The over-ear cup delivers bass you can feel through your skin. The earbud prevents the bass from drowning out the detail and delivers crystal clear notes directly into your ear. Your brain combines the sensations into a fully immersive experience - you hear and you feel the music.\n  With Nura, you can experience the music you love for the first time again. Be immersed in all the beautiful detail and nuance of the recording.\n  Just like every human face and voice are unique, so too is the structure of everyone\u2019s inner ear. These variations in anatomy result in us hearing sounds differently. There\u2019s a very wide range in our sensitivities to different frequencies - normal hearing range is >20dB at each frequency (that\u2019s about seven clicks on the volume button of a smartphone).\nWhen soundwaves enter your ear canal, they vibrate the eardrum. These vibrations are transferred through a series of small bones to the cochlea - our favorite organ in the body.\nThe cochlea converts these vibrations to electrical signals which are sent to the brain. Our brain then interprets these signals as sound!\nIncredibly, at the same time, signals are also sent back out through the ear creating a very faint sound. Yes, your ears create sound!\nNura uses a microphone to know exactly what sound went in, and also uses the same microphone to listen to the faint sounds that return from the ear. This makes Nura very different from any other type of calibration. It actually knows the response of the inner ear. The inner ear detection is performed using an adaption of OAE (otoacoustic emission).\nThe sound that is produced by our ears and detected by our headphones\u2019 internal microphone is encoded with information about how well you actually heard the sound that went in.\nNura headphones connect to your smartphone. You press go, and they sweep through a bunch of tones for about 30 seconds. At the same time, they listen to the sounds your ear is making. By processing these signals it works out how well specific frequencies of sound got through to your brain. Once they know this, they sonically mould to match your ears perfectly and provide rich, balanced sound for you.\n  Our technology combines deep hearing and neuroscience, psychoacoustics, signal processing and acoustics. Nura does not require you to answer a test. You sit there and listen for 30s. That\u2019s it.\nThe first time you put them on your head, they\u2019ll measure your hearing - a process that takes about 30 seconds.\n\nNura headphones actually know you. Any time you put them on, Nura will recognize you in less than two seconds.\n\nOnce Nura identifies you, they load your profile. Any music you listen to (no matter the app) will be optimized for your hearing, so you can hear every note perfectly.\n  You don\u2019t have to spend countless hours and lots of money to find great audio. It\u2019s not necessary to be a sound expert either (that\u2019s where we come in). Nura is designed for music enthusiasts. So, if you love music keep reading!\n    We\u2019re hoping to raise $100K with our campaign. The money will be spent on tooling for mass production, regulatory certifications and sourcing of materials.\n  Music is meant to be shared. We\u2019re beginning our journey to production with Kickstarter to share our passion with the community, and also to let the community share their vision with us. We believe that the backer community will play a vital role in the future development at Nura.\nThrough Kickstarter, we aren\u2019t just pre-selling our product and raising funds to enable us to begin mass production, we\u2019re also building relationships and learning from passionate, innovative and visionary backers. We welcome your feedback on how we can make the experience of recorded music even better.\n\nPlease share your thoughts with us. And if you\u2019re passionate about music, please share our story with the world.\n          Music has the power to unite. It has brought together our team of experts in engineering, acoustics, biology, hearing science, and product delivery.\n  Being a lifelong music lover and engineer, Kyle started systematically looking for the perfect pair of headphones and discovered that headphones are like shoes - perfection depends on who\u2019s wearing them. This led to the realization that headphones need to be able to understand the person\u2019s hearing so that they can adapt and match the listener.\nKyle approached Luke to explore whether it would be possible to squeeze a hearing measurement machine into a pair of headphones and make a closed-loop music experience. They found out it could be done and started working on the core technology to make it possible.\n    We\u2019re passionate about music and enabling people to experience it fully.\n\nIn January of this year, we were accepted into the\nHAX Accelerator, which has lower acceptance rate (3%) than Stanford (4.7%) or Harvard (5.2%). We dropped everything, leaving our friends, families, and careers to come to China for four months to work on development and prototyping.\nWe\u2019re now ready to move ahead with manufacturing and plan to start production at the end of 2016. This includes tooling, sourcing and regulatory certifications. Our product will be ready to ship by April 2017.\nPARTNERSHIPS & CREDITS\nHAX Accelerator  \nMelbourne Accelerator Program \nPR by Proper Propaganda and float \nCGI by Vladimir Petkovic and Vuk Nikolic \nGraphic elements by detraform \nVisual Identity, Industrial Design and Product Photography by Office For Product Design \nEarly Concepts by Tricycle \nVideo by Antony Bui and blanktape music \nOriginal music by Luke Howard\nOnline marketing by Jellop\nThank you to Kickstarter, for helping us bring this design to life!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike any hardware project, there are risks and challenges associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics.

Players choose from a number of core character classes and explore dangerous locations full of monsters, treasures, and deadly boss fights.\nDesigned specifically for the Dark Souls\u2122 universe and introducing a number of innovative gameplay mechanics, with world-class miniatures faithful to the rich universe, this game delivers an experience that captures the very essence of the original video games.\nClick here for Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game 101\nWe don\u2019t like complicated Kickstarters, so we\u2019ve made this one as simple as possible. There is just one pledge level for gamers, and one pledge for retail stores.\nAs the campaign progresses, some stretch goals will unlock an \u2018Add-On\u2019 which is an optional item to purchase; to buy one of these, simply increase your pledge amount. This also drives the campaign total up thereby unlocking even more stuff!\nThe best bit is that every 'non Add-On' stretch goal that gets unlocked during the campaign will be included in your pledge! So the more people that support the project, the more goals get unlocked, the more value we can squeeze in, and the bigger the box we're going to need!\nRead the FAQ Here\nClick here to read the first AMA with Mat Hart, one of the Game's Designers.\nClick here to read the second AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the third AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the Reddit AMA with Mat & Rich\nClick here to read the fourth AMA with Richard Loxam\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game is much more than a classic dungeon crawler. Just like the Dark Souls\u2122 video games, this is a game that requires strategic thinking, clever planning, and exemplary execution to succeed.\nDragon Slayer Ornstein & Executioner Smough\nTo triumph, players must explore dangerous locations, discover and defeat enemies, and collect equipment and treasures before ultimately facing the boss in an epic fight to the death.\nThe Player Characters - Knight, Warrior, Herald & Assassin\nPlayable in either Solo or Co-op modes, players choose their role from a number of core Dark Souls\u2122 character classes. Each class has a distinct role to play in the game, with a unique set of strengths and abilities.\nWith multiple difficulty modes and a high-level of replayability, this is a game designed to be deep enough to satisfy hard-core tabletop gamers whilst remaining accessible to newer players.\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game features an exciting \"fast setup, long reveal\" mechanic that gets you into the game faster and builds the location and encounters as you explore.\nWith no fixed scenario layouts, it\u2019s as simple as choosing the direction to explore, placing a new tile down and flipping a card from the Encounter deck.\nEach time you decide where to go, you will experience a new danger as you explore, with each new location a real risk to your hard-won progress. If you die, then you drop everything you have collected and reappear at the nearest bonfire. So do you return to the bonfire to rest and spend Souls to strengthen up, but in doing so fully reset the locations? Or do you press on and pray that the next encounter isn\u2019t beyond your capabilities? After all, the next location may contain a clue to the Boss and how to defeat them\u2026\nCombat is both fast and deadly. Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game rewards clever players and punishes \u2018button mashing\u2019. Players must learn enemy behaviors in order to fight more effectively, with classic fighting game style combat windows. \nThe Titanite Demon mini-boss\nThe game features a \u201cdynamic positioning system\u201d which makes combat fluid and ever-changing. With the game state constantly shifting as combatants move around the battlefield, players must stay alert to danger and opportunities. \nEquipment, armour, and weapons are discovered or earned during play, but with limited slots players must think carefully about what is best to keep and use. Using a simple stamina management system, players can potentially leave themselves exhausted and vulnerable. Death is usually swift to follow a poor decision in combat.\nThe Dancer of the Boreal Valley boss accompanied by a group of Hollow\nUsing our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working with one of the finest board game manufacturers in the world, the quality and detail in the miniatures is world-class. With the entirety of the Dark Souls\u2122 universe available to use, one of the hardest decisions has been to narrow down which enemies and bosses to include in the core game.\nThe Gargoyle mini-boss\nThe Core Game contains:\n3 Boss Models\n5 Mini-Boss Models\n4 Player Character Models\n4 Large Grunt Models\n12 Grunt Models\n7 Double Sided Game Tiles\n2 Double Sided Mini-Boss/Boss Tiles\n4 Player Character Boards\n3 Boss Dials for Tracking Damage\n60 Equipment Cards\n40 Treasure Cards\n26 Boss AI Cards\n36 Encounter Cards\n15 Coloured Dice\n100+ Game Tokens\nPrepare to Die...\nCheck out the prototype Boss Fight versus the Dancer of the Boreal Valley and people's reactions to it...\nAdd-Ons will unlock as the campaign progresses.

This project is our first step towards changing this for the retailers.\nSteamforged Games Ltd are determined to support retail at every level. With our previous project - Guild Ball, we committed that after the project had launched all further products within the range would be direct to retail. We kept that promise. With Dark Souls\u2122 - we go one step further and are building support directly into the Kickstarter itself.\nThe Retailer Pledge level contains 6 copies Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game along with a number of other benefits:\nRetailer Bonus Unlocks - We have built into the Kickstarter several additional retailer bonus unlocks that once unlocked (via the number of retail backers in the campaign) will provide 'Add-On' purchases available only at retail and not purchasable during the Kickstarter by backers. These will not be limited runs but a general release available to all customers upon launch of the game in shops.\nCurrent Bonus Unlock Items\nExclusive Timed Access - You will be the first stores to receive the Core Game and the only stores to have 4 weeks early access to the launch day products and retailer exclusive stretch goal products upon release.\nExclusive Point of Sale Items - Along with your retail stock, we will send exclusive point of sale items as a thank you for supporting us from the start.\nTo help retailers guarantee their initial stock, you may purchase additional Retailer Pledges by increasing the pledge amount.\nWe will be supporting localisation options for the game and have confirmed the following languages currently: \nEnglish\nFrench\nSpanish\nGerman\nItalian\nWe are also considering other localisation options depending on demand during and after the Kickstarter campaign ends. You will be able to choose the language of your version via the pledge manager system.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: \nUnited Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers)\nUSA (US backers)\nCanada (Canadian backers)\nGermany (EU backers)\nChina (Asia Pacific backers)\nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers)\nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the core game (4kg volumetric weight).

I'm Thomas, and I love making games. For the past 3 years, I've been working on Pinstripe in addition to college and my day job. Honestly, I've been trying to prove to myself that I can make an awesome game completely alone and self funded. It's been an exciting journey, but I've learned that Pinstripe is a much bigger project than originally planned.\nSo to be honest, I've been a little scared to launch a Kickstarter. But I think it's time to ask for help. I'm here to ask the Kickstarter community for support to continue and complete Pinstripe. It's not only exciting to potentially get funding from you guys, it's also exciting to get some much needed community support. \nEvery frame in Pinstripe is meticulously crafted and polished.\nBeautiful, unique, and satisfying adventure games are a bit of a rarity, and can be challenging to pull-off. But the past 3 years have been an amazing learning experience, and I like to think that Pinstripe has slowly evolved into exactly what an adventure game should be: fun, beautiful, interesting, and personal. With Kickstarter's help, the adventure of Pinstripe can be completed and released by August of 2016.\nStarts at 1:52:42\nPinstripe is a 2D adventure game about an ex-minister named Teddy who must explore Hell in search of his daughter Bo, who has been kidnapped by a strange entity claiming to be God. \nTeddy, Bo, and his puppy George.\nPinstripe features bizarre and interesting puzzles, strange monsters to shoot with your handy shotgun, and unique and lovable characters to engage with in order to advance through Hell. \nExplore a vast and freezing cold Hell.\nDiscover super weird creatures in Hell.\nSimple gameplay is the cornerstone of Pinstripe, and was the goal from the start. With simplistic and casual gameplay, the player can focus on the art, music, and story, and become immersed in the beautiful atmosphere. The goal of Pinstripe is to make you feel like a kid again without being bogged down with stuff that is confusing and unnecessarily. This is achieved by picking up the controller, running around and exploring the strange world, hanging out with funny characters, and occasionally shooting your shotgun to complete puzzles. For Pinstripe, simple gameplay makes exploring Hell super fun.\n Features:\nHighly polished, illustrative 2D graphics.\nAn emotionally charged story about fatherhood and Hell.\nA detective styled adventure. Help your dog George uncover clues about your past.\nExamine clues about your past life.\nA moody, beautiful soundtrack reminiscent of the Zelda franchise featuring piano and classical instrumentation.\nOld-school, simplistic platforming and character interaction. \nStrange and challenging on-screen puzzles.\n6 strange and elegantly designed worlds (forest, train, cave, canyon, lake, and cliff!)\nThat wonderful feeling of adventure and exploration you used to get when you played games like King's Quest, Myst, and The Legend of Zelda.\nPinstripe was Greenlit in just 7 days!\nSometimes the characters in Pinstripe are extra weird, like this crotchety old tree.\nPinstripe has already received some awesome awards nominations and honors at IndieCade's E3 Showcase, Whippering Indie Cup in San Francisco, and Reboot 2015, and most recently, at SXSW 2016. However, it's nowhere near where it needs to be for release. \nI've been making games for almost 10 years now. My two most recent games, Coma and Skinny, became viral online hits and won several awards from companies like Indie Pub, Mochi, and Newgrounds. Although they were much shorter and less ambitious than Pinstripe, I like to think that all of my games have a similar heart and style.\nPlay Coma!\nPlay Skinny!\nPinstripe is about 60% complete. However, the remaining 40% is looking more and more daunting as I continue to work on this project. As many of you know, the older you get, the less time you have. When I was in college, I had plenty of time to mess around with this project on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this is not the case for me and my family.\nI need your help to be able to quit freelancing, and focus specifically on Pinstripe. With a serious jolt from the Kickstarter community, Pinstripe will be exactly where it needs to be by August of 2016.\nBefore Pinstripe, Coma and Skinny received multiple awards for their distinct and atmospheric soundtracks. Pinstripe's soundtrack is no different. It is beautiful and reminiscent of the Zelda franchise, and plays a key role in the game's mood and story. This is one of Pinstripe's strong suites. Pinstripe is a unique in that the entire experience, from the visuals to the music, is intentionally crafted by one individual, resulting in one cohesive piece of art. Feel free to take a listen to some of the songs written for Pinstripe so far:\nBut the soundtrack isn't perfect. It still needs a ton of work.\nI finally decided it was time for Kickstarter because I knew keeping this game alive and seeing it finished the right way would be extremely difficult without help from the Kickstarter community. \nUltimately, I need to focus on this game full-time, otherwise, it's going to be extremely difficult to finish. I need funds to pay for the game's production and also make up for the loss of funding due to quitting my day job. Feel free to see the budget below.\nAdditionally, your feedback and criticism is crucial. Seeing a project for what it is can be difficult without a community's involvement. I really just want to make a game you love, and I'm 100% positive I can do that with your help. If you don't love it, I want to know why and how I can make it better. \nWith your help, a beta build will be ready for testing by May of 2016, and the final build on Steam by August of 2016. By then, Pinstripe will be available on Steam for Mac, PC, and Linux, all because of you guys.\nThe budget above is only an estimation, and is subject to change.\nProfessional Advisory Board\nWithout these people and their incredible industry-specific input, Pinstripe would not be what it is today.\nKickstarter Shoutout #2: Go Check Out \"Knights & Bikes\"!\nCheck out Knights & Bikes!\nGo check out \"A Place for the Unwilling\"! It's a very interesting adventure game set in a living city filled with secrets to unveil. An open world inspired by Majora's Mask and Sunless Sea! Check it out!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping games is hard. Developing games alone is even harder. But I have 10 years of experience and have released 3 games prior to Pinstripe. I also have the support of an incredible advisory board. Ultimately, it can take a long time to develop a game alone, and a lot can go wrong from start to finish. But this game is not at the start, it has already been heavily worked on for years and with your help it will launch this summer.\n\nAnother concern is story: what makes Pinstripe special is a unique story surrounded by beautiful visuals and music. Pinstripe's story is written, but it is not implemented. I'm concerned that, although the story looks great on paper, it will not translate well in the actual game. To overcome this, I have a team of professional advisors who are very close to me, who will play the game and be sure to highlight any areas where the story just isn't working.

If you're not familiar with Sentinels of the Multiverse, check out the game and its website! The Multiverse began five years ago, and now we're back on Kickstarter to go out with a bang!\nThe heroes of Earth and beyond have fought against the effects of an unknown cosmic power for a long time, and each time they managed to prevail. However, other realities and timelines have not been so fortunate. The goal of this cosmic entity's encroachment upon the Multiverse has been the collapse of all realities and timelines into a singularity which will self-implode, leaving naught but OblivAeon, the true heir to nothingness.\nOblivAeon itself has manifested on Earth in this timeline to put an end to the pitiful resistance. If it succeeds, everything will be destroyed. However, if the heroes are able to stop OblivAeon, the cracks which run through all realities will be repaired as the cosmic power that created them is destroyed, effectively cutting the timelines and realities off from each other. \nOne way or another, the Multiverse ends here.\nBesides the key hints in each chapter told by the core game and every expansion to Sentinels of the Multiverse, there has been a lot of lead-up to this cosmic event. The Sentinels community discovered clues hidden throughout our products and website, and those clues led to some very interesting information, ultimately revealing the end of the Multiverse: OblivAeon!\n Behold! Sentinels of the Multiverse: OblivAeon!\nSentinels of the Multiverse: OblivAeon is the final expansion to the Sentinels of the Multiverse line of games, and what an expansion it will be! The game will contain:\nFive familiar heroes (more on them below in the \"Characters\" section) who are coming to this last defense of the Multiverse!\nA \"Mission\" deck full of quests the heroes embark on to gain allies and tools to aid them in the conflict!\nSeveral villain decks that work together in different ways to make up the OblivAeon scenario, including decks for Scions, Aeon Men, and OblivAeon as well!\nTwo environment decks and a comic book! Unlocked from Stretch Goals by YOU on DAY ONE!!\nThese five new heroes have everything to lose - everyone does when facing OblivAeon. Though their origins make them at odds with the other heroes, these five characters all stand stalwart against the cosmic threat, willing to set aside differences, previous conflicts, and villainous plots in order to save the Multiverse itself!\n---\nIvan Grigori Ramonat is more commonly known as the villainous mad scientist Baron Blade. He has faced the many heroes of the Multiverse in countless conflicts, each time with a new doomsday plot that is as dangerous to the Baron as those around him. \nHowever, with OblivAeon's assault on this reality, the mad Baron must put aside his long-standing enmity with the heroes, especially the Parsons family.\nBaron Blade has learned much from his conflicts with the heroes, and his inventions have never been better! As Luminary, he stands alongside many powerful heroes and shows them the true might of his brilliance!\n---\nThe Matriarch, after time in jail, was aided by NightMist in controlling her magical powers and now fights alongside Dark Watch, hoping to atone for her previous villainous ways.\nAs The Harpy, Lillian Corvus is a true hero, though she is haunted by her not-so-heroic past.\n---\nAkash\u2019Bhuta goes dormant for decades between attacks on humanity, needing to regrow and regain power after defeat by a Virtuoso of the Void. \nHowever, with her planet and all reality at stake, she has reformed with what power she has recovered so far as Akash'Thriya and joins the fight against OblivAeon.\n---\nIn her advanced age, Maria Helena de Falc\u00f3n has shed most of the names and all of the crew she acquired as she sailed the timelines. Time is a fickle sea - it gave her much, but when it came time to take, she barely survived the temporal Black Spot.\nLa Comodora has sailed to the end of time and seen the lack of a future beyond OblivAeon. She returns to this time which vexed her younger self so thoroughly. She wears a time-locked outfit that prevents time from taking more from her than it already has. Hopefully, she can use her knowledge of the timelines and her technology from times and places beyond the scope of this reality to combat this ultimate destroyer of all.\n---\nWhen Tarogath - the would-be decimator of planet Earth - was reclaimed by the Terminarch Jansa Vi Dero, he wept. He knew that the destruction of Earth was now unavoidable. All of his magical power and Endling technology could not prevent the future.\nWhat he did not know was that the planet he tried to save was to be a nexus of all reality. Jansa observed the ripples in spacetime and read the ending of all. She could not interfere - that was not her way. But Tarogath had already proved a willingness to bend the ways of the Endlings.\nNow, Tarogath has returned to Earth with Jansa\u2019s blessing. Lifeline joins his formidable command of mystical energy and ley-lines with power from the Enclave of the Endlings in order to oppose OblivAeon and prevent the destruction of all that is.\n---\nAnd each of these heroes also have hero variants! Learn more in the Stretch Goal section!\nGameplay\nThe Sentinels of the Multiverse: OblivAeon conflict will take place across two battle zones, each in a different environment. When fighting OblivAeon, the heroes will have to move between battle zones, complete Missions to gain allies and grow in power, fight terrible Scions and survive, and work to take down OblivAeon's impenetrable shield before ultimately taking the fight right to OblivAeon. Are you up to the challenge?\nWe posted an update full of OblivAeon gameplay information a week and a half into the campaign. Check it out!\nWhen we launched the Sentinels of the Multiverse core game at Gen Con 2011, we had a few hundred copies of a promo card in the form of a hero character card variant for our flagship hero Legacy: his daughter, America's Newest Legacy. With that, we started our now long-standing tradition of releasing story-based hero variant cards that told more of a character's story with alternate innate powers, incapacitated abilities, and art that reflects those stories.\nVery few people have a copy of that coveted America's Newest Legacy card. Even though promo variant cards we've made since then have been more available, the majority of Sentinels fans are missing most if not all of the hero variants. \nThat is why we're releasing the Complete Hero Variant Collection! This pack of cards includes EVERY hero variant card we've ever made, as well as the new ones released as part of this campaign. To set these cards apart from their original print runs, Adam Rebottaro (artist for all things Sentinels Comics) is doing ALL NEW ART for every single card! Check out how great America's Newest Legacy and Rook City Wraith look!\nThe Complete Hero Variant Collection contains over sixty variant hero characters cards, including all of the awesome variant cards unlocked during this campaign! However, as we unlock more and more Stretch Goals, we will be adding alternate art versions of those cards to this pack as well! Keep watching here to see that number go up!\nWith the reissue of all of the hero variants, a product that has been requested by many Sentinels fans is a collection of FOIL hero cards! Well, as 2016 is the 5th year of Greater Than Games and Gen Con 2016 will be the 5th anniversary of the launch of Sentinels of the Multiverse, we decided to make something awesome:\nThe 5th Anniversary Foil Hero Collection is a box full of over one hundred hero character cards, all in foil and with new art! It will have not just the hero variants, but all of the hero character cards, including those from the core game and each expansion! However, we want to make this a special thing for just this year, so we're only going to make enough to cover this Kickstarter plus a few hundred extras to sell at Gen Con and to retailers. After 2016, these will not be available for purchase from Greater Than Games. If we have any left over, we will use them for charity events or other special things.\nAdditionally, since the focus of this product is our 5th Anniversary, we are going to accelerate the production process for this box in order to have it for sale at Gen Con 2016. In fact, Adam is already busy at work on all of the arts for this! As a result, if you order the 5th Anniversary Foil Hero Collection as part of this Kickstarter, we WILL ship it to you BEFORE we leave for Gen Con. We have been talking to our printer for a while to make sure they know we have to get these post-haste, and we are confident that we will have all of these in the mail well before we leave for Gen Con 2016. Anything else you back will still be shipped at the same time as the rest of your rewards, but the 5th Anniversary Foil Hero Collection will ship this July.\nWe've made a lot of Sentinels of the Multiverse products. Between the core game, the expansions, and mini-expansions and more... well, it's a LOT of cards. We have received a few comments about how many boxes people are carrying around for this game, and just how heavy those boxes are. Believe me, we hear you. We can't do anything about the weight, but we can certainly make the carrying process a bit more elegant.\nIntroducing, the Sentinels of the Multiverse Ultimate Collector's Case! Decorated with beautiful art and elegant design, the interior of the case features trays in the top for tokens, rulebooks, and more, and drawers for oversized cards, hero character cards and variants, villain decks, hero decks, and environment decks. The Ultimate Collector's Case can hold ALL of the Multiverse!\nAs a result of unlocking all of the Stretch Goals in this campaign, the Ultimate Collector's Case also includes additional tokens for damage types and nemesis identification, a complete chart of hero, villain, and environment complexity/difficulty, four foam blocks, a \"Completionist Guise\" variant card, and features spot-UV and spot-foil printing on the outside of the box.\nAs part of the lead up to this event, Adam crafted a beautiful piece of art featuring all of the heroes and villains from the Multiverse with OblivAeon as the centerpiece. We're pleased to be able to make this art available as an 18\" by 24\" canvas print.\nAll canvas prints will be signed by Adam Rebottaro and are only available at the upper Pledge Levels.\nWe have two Add-Ons in this campaign:\n$1 set of three art prints\n$49 Complete Foil Oversized Villain Collection\nThe art prints are three prints of images from cards in Sentinels of the Multiverse: OblivAeon.\nThe Complete Foil Oversized Villain Collection is a set of every villain character featuring gorgeous foil art! This includes every villain from the base game and each expansion, including mini-expansions, variants, Vengeance, Villains of the Multiverse, and OblivAeon! The foil oversized cards come in a sweet case with magnetic closures. Additionally, the case features spot-UV and spot-Foil printing.\nThe art prints and the Complete Foil Oversized Villain Collection will ship at the same time as Sentinels of the Multiverse: OblivAeon, so expect them early next year.\nJust go to \"manage my pledge\" and add $1 to your pledge for the art prints, $49 for the Complete Foil Oversized Villain Collection, or $50 for both. You don't have to send us a message about it or anything - we'll follow up with you via BackerKit! (Here's our update about how we're using BackerKit with this campaign.)\nNote: EVERY pledge level gets the benefit of hearing Christopher Badell (designer of Sentinels of the Multiverse) read your name in a giant list of names from the first pledge level. Join the campaign! Become a Sentinel! Save the Multiverse!\nOn day one, we soared past our entire first batch of Stretch Goals! Since then, all of our stretch goals have been unlocked! Well done, Sentinels!\nIn the day one update, we revealed a TON of the stretch goals that you'd unlocked in record time!\nIn the second update, we revealed a lot more heroes and hero variants! Additionally, we talked about the video game and the Ultimate Collector's Case!\nIn the fourth update, we introduced the variants for all four members of Void Guard!\nAnd in update #8, you unlocked variants for Ra and the Freedom Five!\nWe're going to try something here that is unusual for us at Greater Than Games, and we hope you'll like it. We are now shipping in great enough volume that we think we can manage to pay for free shipping for backers in the US and Canada. That's right, Greater Than Games is offering free shipping!\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive. However, any EU orders will be \"EU Friendly\", in that they will not incur VAT or customs fees on delivery.\nThis means that the shipping charges for this campaign are as follows:\nUS: $0\nCanada: $0\nEU: $35\nOther: $50\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have a work-around. For those of you living outside of the US and Canada, if you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like, and you'll all receive every stretch goal! However, please send us a PM first letting us know what you are doing so that we can watch for it and help you out.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPreviously, we announced that we were moving away from Kickstarter for Sentinels of the Multiverse products. However, as we worked on developing OblivAeon a few things occurred to us. First, a preorder works best when it focuses on one or two flagship games, but we wanted to include a number of products that have been long-promised and long-anticipated, and we didn't want them to get lost in the shuffle in a preorder. Second, we had some technical difficulties with recent preorders on our website that resulted in a lot more work for us on the shipping end and a few international shipping problems; using Kickstarter helps us neatly avoid these issues. Finally, Kickstarter and the Kickstarter Community - including all of you - were instrumental in the success of the Sentinels of the Multiverse.

This update has been quite challenging to write, and I\u2019ve started and discarded my progress a number of times in search of the correct way to frame it. In the end, I opted for loquacity; we\u2019ll see how it turned out!\nDemographers often talk about how the post WWII Baby Boom generation forced institutions to change throughout the west due to its size. First childbirth and childcare, then schooling, then work and homeownership, and now, finally, retirement and senior care. At each life stage, social institutions were forced to expand and adapt in the face of this massive cohort. In this way, OblivAeon was Greater Than Games\u2019 \u201c Baby Boom Generation\u201d. It was so massive that, at every stage of the project, we were forced to change and adapt in ways we did not anticipate. Since you Kickstarter backers were the initiators of this whole enormous project, and since a number of these challenges impacted you negativity, either directly or indirectly, I wanted to share with you my reflections on the project now that it has drawn to a close."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Customer service and news from the world of Sentinel Comics!", "update_content": "Hey folks!

And we'll be joined by additional collaborators that we know and trust, like \"Audio Daredevil\" Kenny Young (Tearaway, LittleBigPlanet) and composer Daniel Pemberton (Steve Jobs, The Man from UNCLE, LittleBigPlanet). And hopefully we'll be joined by you as well!\nInspired by games like Earthbound and Secret of Mana and films such as The Goonies, we would like to take these, along with of our favorite childhood memories, and channel it all through our years of experience making games.\nThe key ingredients of Knights and Bikes:\nIn Knights and Bikes, you can play as Nessa and Demelza on their quest for the truth behind the medieval legends of Penfurzy, an island on the fast track to financial ruin and literal destruction. Recruit a party of creatures from all walks of life, enlist and inspire deflated islanders, and embark on an adventure to find the hero the island so desperately needs.\nTeaming up with Demelza's pet goose, and the pickled severed head of a fallen-knight, they fling Frisbees at demons, trick-out their bikes to reach new locations, and increase their abilities with each islander they rescue.\nOk ok, what Demelza said.\nPedal Yourselves into Danger!\nPlay it single-player, or with a friend!\nTo purchase an add on, all you have to do is:\nClick \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d (or click here). \nClick \"Change your pledge\" \nAdd the costs (including shipping) of the add-ons to your pledge amount without changing your tier. \nThat\u2019s it. We'll ask for all the details in the backer survey after the campaign.\nTrailer Super Cut\nSome of our lovely friends and fans helped us put together a new, extra shouty cut of our trailer!\nKnights and Bikes is currently confirmed for PC, Mac, and Linux. It's also coming to Playstation4, and all pledges at, or above, the Digital Game Plus tier are eligible for the PS4 version.\n\nWe will update this section if and when we add more platforms. \nKnights and Bikes takes place on the island of Penfurzy, an island off the coast of Cornwall, where great medieval legends have driven centuries of culture. Inspired by Rex's childhood, it is a place where fact and fiction are inextricably intertwined. \nAs such, the island has a case of multiple identities. On one hand, it is a home for the islanders who live a life full of tradition, history, and pride. But on the other hand, it is a tourist attraction that is expressed almost as self parody through arcades, crazy-golf, and other fleeting diversions.\nOur story takes place in the 80s when the island's most prized relic is proved to be fake, raising questions about Penfurzy's legends. We pick up in the fall of 1987, the end of the island's worst tourist season ever. All the mainlanders have gone home. Well, all except one. \nAs Nessa and Demelza begin their search for the truth behind the island legends, they unleash mysterious spirits that possesses many of the island's inhabitants, human and animal alike. It's up to our heroines to figure out what these spirits want, where or even when they're from, and ultimately how to stop them. \nKnights and Bikes is filled with characters for you to meet (or be) from all walks of life. They each have their own goals, personalities, and abilities. Here are some of the cast:\nNessa is an orphan from the mainland who follows an old keepsake to the island hoping to learn who she really is. As an outsider, she clashes with many of the islanders, but not Demelza, who becomes a fast friend.\nSample Ability: Frisbee-Lob\nDemelza is a video game-obsessed believer in the Penfurzy legends. She comes equipped with a Power Glove in her quest to fight for the honor of her favorite video game hero. She lives in the island's Caravan Park with her father Gryffyn, but dreams of the mainland and all the comic-books and video games that might exist there.\nSample Ability: Puddle-Splash\nCaptain Honkers is Demelza's pet goose. He has an incredible sense of smell and an insatiable appetite for seaweed.\nSample Ability: Peck\nThe Pickled Knight claims to be the great hero of legend, but even if true, spending many years trapped in a briny rockpool has robbed him of his looks (and abilities).\nSample Ability: Ankle Bite\nIslanders come in all shapes and sizes, each trying to support themselves on this remote island--from the volunteer running the mobile library to the bike-shop-owner. But as things start to go wrong on the island it will be up to you to save them from the ancient spirits. And some may have special talents or items that could be helpful to your quest. \nSample Ability: Worrying\nKnights and Bikes is an Co-op Action Adventure Game where players will explore an island on foot and on bikes, find treasure, battle through \"dungeon\" areas, rescue islanders and upgrade their gear in the town hub.\nLocal Co-Op - Play through the entire game alone with AI helpers controlling the other characters in your party or have a friend join you on this mysterious adventure.\nExplore - Jump on your bike and ride through the ominous wilderness areas of the island following the ever trusty beak of Captain Honkers.\nTreasure - Trade collected treasure to acquire new abilities as well as upgrading those you already have by employing the various odd abilities of rescued islanders.\nQuests - Complete the noble requests of the islanders to win their favor by rescuing loved ones, finding ancient relics, and solving puzzling mysteries.\nBattle - Keep an eye on your health as you fight your way through treacherous dungeons using your improvised arsenal.

We remember a time when games were something that you would play with your mum, dad, brother, or neighbor and together you could join forces and defeat the ultimate baddie.\nWe wanted to capture the feeling of forming a group, being part of something bigger, but also finding out who you are and where you fit into the world. Of course, a game about friendship wouldn't be complete without the ability to play with friends. We hope that we can give our players an experience that brings them together like so many video games anchored some of our best childhood friendships.\nThe theme of the game is inspired by several classic movies of the 80s like Goonies and ET, films that show the adult world from a child's perspective, and the ways in which they try to understand it.  \nAnd the art-style is a mixture of Rex's own natural style, combined with influences from Eyvind Earle, Ronald Searle, Alex Grigg's exceptional \"Phantom Limb\" short film, and the production-design of Paranorman.\nWe've been extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to meet fans of our games in real life. It's an amazing feeling, but when we hear what they loved most about the game, we wish they had been there the entire time.\nKickstarter gives us an opportunity to recruit a group of fans who share our passion for this project. They can cheer us on and keep us moving forward when we are feeling down with misdirected doubt. More importantly, they can let us know if we're losing perspective and veering off track.\nOn such a small team, it's critical to not only get more voices, but the right voices. We're hoping that Kickstarter is a great way to find you all.\nRex Crowle served as the Creative Lead on both Tearaway and Tearaway: Unfolded and was a key artist on the LittleBigPlanet series.

We have created a few different areas in the game to establish the range and consistency of the art style. We love the way it looks already, but will continue fine tuning it over time.\nOn the gameplay side, we've used these various areas to experiment with three of the core aspects of the game. We have built a conversation system to talk to the islanders, deal with quests, and purchase new gear. We've created a basic dungeon as a testing ground for our many enemy and weapon prototypes. And we've created a sprawling forest to get a feel for the explorational aspects of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a very ambitious project, especially for a team of two, but we definitely feel like we are up to the challenge. We each have over a decade of experience making games and have worked together for many years on a number of projects. Not only do we have experience making games with the backing of a studio, we have also shipped games with smaller teams like EpicWin and Ring Fling.\n\nEven though there are only two of us, we do cover a lot of disciplines, each willing to dive into any task that we think will result in making a better game. In addition, we are being smart about using off the shelf solutions (like Unity, Spine, and Yarn) when possible.\n\nWe also have a great support structure. On the personal side, we have great friends and family who have supported us through difficult projects before. On the development side, we have many friends in other development studios big and small who can give advice and lend a favor when in need. Speaking of which, we have some stretch goals in mind to bring in some specialists to help with certain aspects of the game to make it even better.

Having said that, I find it very disturbing that you want to report me to them. As if they didn't already know. You truly want to see some be in debt for the wrest of their life because they had a dream for a video game that they never created. Very selfish, and very ironic. Disney was created because Walt Disney had a dream, was it not? I find it ironic because on a lot of the news and the forums there was a quote from something I said. It read \" I have talked to Disney, and they have informed me to contact Lucas arts\". I believe most of you said quote \" that's like a father telling the kid to go ask their mother because they do not want to deal with them.\" Yet I recieved emails from random people basically telling their dad to send me to timeout because they don't like me. \nSecondly, I am taking this kick starter down myself. Disney has not contacted me to tell me to shut it down for those of you who think you own Disney. I am taking this kick starter down, because I very much respect Disney, and I do not want this to get to big. I love all their pirates of the Caribbean movies. I always wanted to be captain jack, but I think Mr. Depp is to good to be replaced. I have faith that somewhere in the future, a game like the one I described, will be made by Disney/EA/LucasFilms/Bioware or whoever is going to do it. \nThirdly I know my spelling and grammar sucks, but all you need is the force and you will do ok in life. I wrote the entire thing on my phone while in Childress Texas with a JUAN bar. So I did not care for spelling mistakes, because of that and I really didn't think I'd actually be doing this.

It is a narrative focused game telling the story of Angel, a young woman who may or may not be expecting a child as she has to journey through twisted nightmares plagued by horrible monsters from Filipino folklore.\nSimilar to Neverending Nightmares, the story is told through seemingly unconnected dreams and nightmares. However, we will tell a compelling story in this game rather than just focusing on emotions and symbolism. Because of the importance of the game's narrative, we are focusing on telling one story well rather than having branches and multiple endings.\nThe protagonist of the game is Angel, a young Filipino woman who is living in the rural area of Aklan in Western Visayas in the Philippines. Visayas is a region rumored to have the most aswang - Filipino legendary monsters that are like vampires and werewolves only more twisted.\nWestern Visayas was also devastatingly affected by super typhoon Yolanda (known internationally as Haiyan) in November of 2013. The game will also feature other real locations from the Philippines including the Kabayan caves, which house fire mummies - incredibly well preserved bodies using a unique preservation process. Since the game takes place in nightmares, we can explore different regions of the Philippines that express the fears of the protagonist.\nThe narrative is character focused. As you play through the game, you'll find out more about Angel, her situation and her fears through what happens in the nightmares as well as by examining items and letters that she encounters through her journeys through terrifying places in the Philippines.\nIs Angel really pregnant? What happened to her child? Where is her family? Why do aswang haunt her in her sleep? You'll have to play the game to find out!\nSimilar to the P.T. demo, much of the gameplay will be focused on exploring a nightmarish world with a completely oppressive atmosphere. When traversing the world, there will be clues to the story as well as other items that give insight into what it is like living in rural areas of the Philippines. The game's main purpose is to terrify, but we want to expose gamers to the Philippines and its interesting culture.\nLike our last game, Devastated Dreams takes place inside nightmares, so if the player meets a terrible end, she'll wake up elsewhere and continue exploring the nightmares. The nightmares will have different settings as well as different situations for the protagonist. In some nightmares, Angel is pregnant but in others, she's not.\nDevastated Dreams features several items that the player can use including a flashlight. When you have the flashlight, you can direct the beam with the second analog stick or the mouse. Besides amplifying the horror since you don't know what danger lurks in the darkness, the mechanic can be used for solving puzzles. Clues can be hidden in darkness and some demonic enemies may be afraid of the light, so the flashlight is very useful.\nWe aren't creating an action hero, so Angel can't sprint forever. When she runs out of stamina, she just walks slowly until she catches her breath. When you run, you lose the ability to aim your flashlight, so running should only be used when necessary. We want to limit the amount of time you spend running through the game by design because it's unrealistic for anyone except marathon athletes.\nWhile we won't have a combat system, we will have Quick Time Events where you have to mash the interact button in order to get yourself out of a terrible situation. While QTEs are sometimes misused, tapping a button rapidly in order to fight off an imminent threat can get your adrenaline flowing. They were particularly effective in Telltale's The Walking Dead series. Because of our commitment to immersion, we won't be presenting the actual button prompts. We indicate when it is time to fight from the player's animation. If Angel is struggling, then you should mash. Some gamers with physical disabilities have trouble with fast button presses, so we will have an accessibility option to switch the QTEs to just one button press.\nWith Neverending Nightmares, one of our principle goals was to focus on the horror and have very few puzzles. While I still feel that was the right choice for creating the nightmarish feel of our previous project, not having the objectives that puzzles provide made some nightmares feel like you are wandering around aimlessly. In Devastated Dreams, we will have more puzzles to provide the framework of objectives that push the character forward. However, our puzzles won't be head scratchers like creating cat hair moustaches! When you have to use a walkthrough or are frustrated trying to guess what the game designer had in mind, it ruins the immersion we are working really hard to create. The puzzles will often rely on finding the correct objects and using them intelligently. Our alpha and beta backers will be instrumental to insuring that the puzzles make sense and are solvable by everyone.\nDevastated Dreams has a grayscale watercolor/ink wash art style. This fits in with one of the narrative themes - things aren't always black or white! Interactive objects appear in color, so there won't be any pixel hunting trying to figure out what can be picked up. Blood and gore appear red to really make it stand out.\nWe have a dynamic lighting and shadow system that builds on what we developed in Neverending Nightmares to create an even more interesting effect. Layers of ink blots and other abstract paintings combine to form an animated darkness that constantly feels like it is closing in on the player.\nWe've created an advanced 2D animation system that is a blend of skeletal based animation as well as morph targets. The end result of the system is that we can create silky smooth animations that run at 60 Hz (or 120 Hz if your monitor supports it) as well as blending between animation poses.\nWe use advanced 3D rendering techniques to create interesting effects like water reflections, 3D splashes, as well as impressive lighting effects.\nDevastated Dreams is a spiritual successor to Neverending Nightmares. We were able to create a dark atmosphere thick with tension, and we want to build on that for Devastated Dreams. We learned a ton during the development of our last game, so we will be able to make a scarier and more compelling game.\nDevastated Dreams is not a sequel to Neverending Nightmares though. It is a completely new story and features brand new gameplay elements. Neverending Nightmares was designed to make you feel disempowered - a passive observer in a world you couldn't control. With Devastated Dreams, we want to create something more interactive and where the player has agency like more traditional games. There will be puzzles to solve and letters and other elements to find that advance the story.\nBesides our past work, Devastated Dreams is influenced by the P.T. Demo, and the amazing atmosphere, immersion, and tension it creates with minimal mechanics. The Silent Hill series is a huge influence with its psychological explanation of all of its monsters and apparitions. We are also impressed by Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and its focus on evading enemies. The Siren series is another inspiration because of how it crafts terrifying settings inspired by foreign small towns.\nFilipino folklore has been an amazing source of inspiration - especially when creating monsters that psychologically represent the anxiety of becoming a parent. There are no definitive images of these monsters, so our artists have had to use their creativity to try to imagine what they are like based on our research into the legends. Here are some of the aswang we plan to feature in our game.\nManananggal (left) / Tiyanak (right)\nManananggal - The manananggal is the most unique aswang. Their name means \"self-segmenter\" because they are female monsters who separate their top half from their lower half and grow wings. Their favorite food is unborn children, and they have a long tongue that enables them to suck out the hearts of fetuses, but they are also known to eat babies.\nTiyanak - Tiyanaks are demon babies that roam the forest crying while looking for their next victim. Once they are adopted, their monstrous true self is revealed, and they eat their would-be parents.\nTik-tik concepts\nTik-Tik - Tik-Tiks are similar to manananggals since they also love eating babies with their long tongue, but they are known for the ticking noise they make. It is said that the tik-tik noise is louder when they are far away and gets quieter as they approach you, so you won't expect their attack!\nBy backing the project, you are on the development team! That's why everyone, even $1 backers, are featured in the credits. On Neverending Nightmares, the community was extremely helpful shaping the game and keeping me on track. As any backer of our last game can attest, I take my responsibilities to the backers seriously. We will provide weekly updates, and a backer forum on which I am a frequent poster. I have over 2,000 posts! I read every single message there as well as all comments on the kickstarter page and updates. We want your feedback on the game, and we couldn't do it without you!\n Name in credits - Your help is essential to making this game a reality - both financially and also your opinions on the work that we do. To show our appreciation, we\u2019ll put your name in the credits.\nBacker forum \u2013 We want to have a special place where we can discuss the game, nightmares, horror movies, game development, and more with you guys, so if you back the project with at least $5, you\u2019ll get access to this. The development team shares more details about the game on the backer forum than they on the public forum.\nDigital game \u2013 Get a Steam key and DRM-free digital copy of the game for Windows, Mac, Linux, distributed via the Humble Store.\nDigital soundtrack \u2013 Get the unsettling dark ambient soundtrack by Skyler McGlothlin, the composer of Retro/Grade and Neverending Nightmares.

I love it! The game will come in an attractive DVD case, and the disc will include DRM-Free versions of the game as well as lots of goodies! \nT-Shirt - Why be naked when you could wear an attractive Devastated Dreams t-shirt? Female t-shirt sizes will be available!\nMagnet - I'm sure you have a fridge, and it looks boring!

If your walls are boring, be sure to get this reward tier!\nPersonalized signed postcard - Matt Gilgenbach will write a little message on a postcard thanking you personally for supporting the game and sign it.\nYour name in game \u2013 We will work your name into the game somewhere - perhaps on a tombstone, on a letter, or as the author of a newspaper clipping found in the game. If you don't want to use your real name, that's fine, but it has to sound like a real name and match the tone of the game. (No Seymour Butts please!) Please don't use the name of someone famous - unless that is in fact your name. If you back at a more expensive tier and you don't want your name in the game, just mention that in your backer survey.\nPhysical art book - Is your coffee table's life devoid of meaning as it longs for accompaniment by an attractive book? Fear not! We will be printing a full color, hardcover 7x9\" art book with over 100 pages!\nHand-Painted Manananggal Bust - Besides doing art for Infinitap, Adam is an extremely talented sculptor and has brought to life our horrifying manananggal. He casts the bust in resin and then hand paints them. It measures around 4.5\" and you can see it below:\nStylized portrait of you in the game + a giclee print - You will be converted to our art style and included somewhere in the game. Possible locations are portraits on the wall, busts, newspaper articles that appear in game, etc. We will create a high resolution digital version that we will use to make a 18x24\" giclee print. (Giclee print is the art world's way of saying a high quality digital print)\nPick a developer diary topic (or have Matt talk about whatever you'd like) - I can create a developer diary for my YouTube channel based on whatever topic you'd like. Alternately, I can give you my personal thoughts on anything. This might be particularly useful to game developers because I have 5 years of experience in AAA development and 7 years as an indie. If you back this tier, I'd be happy to check out your game demo or design documents and give you honest feedback.\nWork with the team to incorporate your fears - While I have plenty of fears that I am channeling into Devastated Dreams, do you have any fears that you'd like to see in the game? If you get this reward, we\u2019ll work with you to put them in! Please note that we may have to veto some ideas or make adjustments to your ideas to fit them in the fiction of the game, but we want to work with you and come up with something cool.\nName the main character - Would you like to name the main character in the game? Back at this tier, and you can. Our only restriction is that it has to sound Filipino to fit with the fiction of the game. Fortunately, that includes most English names as well as many Spanish ones. There are also some Filipino specific names like Imelda, Mayumi, and Luzviminda as well.\nRent Matt Gilgenbach for a day \u2013 Spend a day (at least 8 hours) with me doing pretty much anything you want! Would you like to act as producer on Devastated Dreams? Sure! Would you like me to work on your indie project? I\u2019d be happy to help. Would you like me to give a presentation on game development? Love to. Do you want to hang out and watch horror movies? Sounds good! Do you want me to clean your house? I\u2019ll do my best, but I am warning you that I am not very good at cooking or cleaning. (Price includes airline ticket within the US for me.)\nWhile I am more than willing to travel internationally to meet up with you, I can\u2019t meet you on Mount Everest or anything like that. If you aren\u2019t in the United States or near an airport in a foreign country, please contact me first to ensure the feasibility of my travel. (Also note that while I am open to a lot of things, I won\u2019t do anything immoral or illegal.)\nIn order to purchase an add-on, select the tier you'd like and add the amount to your pledge for the add-ons. So for example, if you'd like the $15 tier and the $25 pack of extras, you still select the $15 tier but change your pledge to $40. \nNeverending Nightmares game on Humble Store - $10 This includes the DRM-free version of the game for Windows, Mac, and Linux plus a Steam key.\nNeverending Nightmares digital art book - $8 This is a PDF packed with high resolution concepts and production art with over 100 pages showing how we made the game.\nNeverending Nightmares Dev commentary - $8 This is a 720p video file of Matt Gilgenbach playing through Neverending Nightmares and explaining the various design decisions.\nNeverending Nightmares Designer's notebook - $8 This features over 100 pages of design docs, notes, and brainstorming related to the production of Neverending Nightmares. If you want to know the true meaning of that game, be sure to pick this up.\nDeconstruction, a novel by Matt Gilgenbach ebook - $8 Several years ago, I attempted to communicate what I was going through with my mental illness. I tried to write a semi-autobiographical novel called \u201cDeconstruction\u201d. After completing the first draft, my obsessive nagging voices discouraged me from continuing to work on it. (I\u2019m not a real writer. It\u2019s no good! And so on.) Since it is quite rough and I really am unsure of my writing skills, I'm not going to finish it. Instead, I annotated it and gave a \"director\u2019s commentary\" explaining what I was trying to say, what I drew on from my own life, and other information to make it a more interesting read. If you are looking for more of a portrait into the mind of someone suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, I think this will be great for you.\nNeverending Nightmares Extras bundle - $25 This includes the art book, dev commentary, designer's notebook, and the ebook. It does not include the game.\nWe are very fortunate to be working with the exact same team that created Neverending Nightmares, which received the runner up for best horror game and best looking game from Giant Bomb's 2014 GOTY podcasts.\nMatt and Dan solving Calc problems at dinner\nMatt Gilgenbach (Creative Director) - After working 5 years in AAA game development on titles like \"Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters\", \"Secret Agent Clank\", and \"The Incredibles\", he has been trying to make ends meet for the past 7 years as an indie developer. After the devastating financial flop of Retro/Grade (for more info, watch his GDC talk), he was fortunate to get his next project (the much more successful) Neverending Nightmares off the ground due to the generosity of backers like you!\nDaniel Sass (Programmer) - Daniel has over 20 years of industry experience. In addition to most recently working as Director of Engineering at THQ, he has also worked for studios developing console and PC games for leading publishers including EA, Activision, and Nintendo.\nFrom L to R: Joe, Matt, and Adam\nJoe Grabowski (Lead Artist) - Joe has spent his entire professional career as an indie working with Matt Gilgenbach at 24 Caret Games (as principle artist on Retro/Grade) and Infinitap Games. He also does animation and helps with level design.\nAdam Grabowski (Environment Artist) - Besides working in video games on Neverending Nightmares and Retro/Grade, he also runs MurderForge, a mask and miniature company. We are fortunate to have him on our team, and he'll be creating the mini-bust reward.\nChris Ewald (Character Artist) - Chris is an accomplished artist with a history of work on a variety of great looking mobile games including National Geographic's DinoLand. He designed all the characters for Neverending Nightmares.\nMatt & Eduardo at GDC showing Neverending Nightmares\nEduardo Ortiz Frau (Sound Designer) - Eduardo is an indie sound designer extraordinaire having worked on such titles like Neverending Nightmares, the Stanley Parable, Gorogoa, Apotheon, and more!\nSkyler McGlothlin (Composer) - Skyler (AKA Nautilis) is the brilliant composer of the Retro/Grade and Neverending Nightmares soundtracks as well as the phenomenal albums \u201cSketches\u201d and \u201cAre You An Axolotl\u201d.\nJoanne and Matt at their baby shower! (It's a boy!)\nJoanne Gilgenbach (Creative Consultant) - Joanne was born and raised in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. in her mid 20s to practice Occupational Therapy where she met her husband Matt. They are expecting the birth of their first child later this year. She is an invaluable resource to the team as they strive to create an authentic experience.\nWhen looking at the kickstarter budget for our game, it's easy to say that\u2019s it's not enough money or it's too much money compared to other kickstarters. A valid question is if we made Neverending Nightmares with $99k, why do we need more for this game? Our last game was in the OUYA Free the Games Fund program, so we received an additional $99k. That means we actually need less total investment for this project because all of the proceeds from Neverending Nightmares (present and future) are going to the development of this game. In addition, Devastated Dreams is more ambitious in scope with a host of new features.\nBased on our sales projections for Neverending Nightmares, we've calculated the minimum amount to ask for on kickstarter in order to see the game completed. That's why it's $115,896. We don't want to ask for a penny more than we need!\nHere is the breakdown of where the kickstarter funds will go to:\nKickstarter \u2013 5% This is Kickstarter's fee for all projects.\nPayment processing \u2013 5% The payment processing fees vary between 3 and 5% based on the number and size of pledges, but since some charges don't go through, 5% is a safe estimation.\nTaxes - 20% The exact tax figure is difficult to pin down, but what we make on kickstarter is treated as income, so we are going to pay roughly 20% of the total fee to the government. You can't escape death and taxes!\nPhysical rewards \u2013 8% The cost of goods with shipping for our unique rewards is going to be 8% of our kickstarter budget. Note that doesn't include all the time that goes into designing and creating them.\nActual development - 62%  23% is for art, 20% for programming, 12% is sound design (and VO), and music at 7%. (Those are percentages of the total - not of the development budget.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nScoping and budgeting a video game project is extremely challenging, which is why many games (kickstarted or otherwise) go over budget and/or are late. Because the nature of video game development is iterative, it is possible to spend too much time and money trying to find out what the game is and how to make it. Matt learned this lesson the hard way on Retro/Grade.\n\nThat is why we have created a playable vertical slice demo for Devastated Dreams. That wasn't just for you! It also proves to the team what the game is and how much effort it will be to see the project through to the end. \n\nWe also are the exact same team that shipped the successful Neverending Nightmares project. Completely finishing a kickstarter project has given us experience and understanding of all aspects of managing a kickstarter from supporting the community to the cost of fulfilling rewards, so we are confident that we can deliver an amazing project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Matt Gilgenbach\n2 created \u00b7 185 backed\nMatt Gilgenbach has been developing games professionally for 12 years and has most recently developed the successfully kickstarted...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "We didn't succeed, so what's next?", "update_content": "When I went to check for comments on the updates today, I saw \u201cProject failed\u201d at the top of our timeline.

It is definitely tough emotionally that our campaign failed \u2013 especially when we did so many things right. We were much better prepared than when we launched Neverending Nightmares. The campaign didn\u2019t succeed, but I am trying to not think about it as a failure.

I've met Joost, and he's super smart, so I'm inclined to agree with his pie chart that luck is 33% of success. The one thing that I am constantly trying to accept as a small business owner is that there are so many factors outside my control. You can do your best to control what you can, which I think is Joost's point, but some things are always out of your control.

They have joined forces to create a new type of combat card game, Gruff.\nGruff is our flagship project. It aligns with our mission by taking aim at the world of combat card games. Without regard to tradition, or expectation, we have torn down the genre to it's foundations and built something new in it's place. We hope you will enjoy the results as much as we do. \nHistory We've always been excited about playing and developing card games. In 2012 we decided to make this passion a reality. Now three years later, and through extensive testing, our project evolved into this crazy game called Gruff. The game is now complete and in the final stages of preparation for manufacturing. We are seeking support from our Kickstarter campaign to bring this game to players and help build its community.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGruff has already been designed, play-tested, and laid out.The biggest risk with a project like this is getting through the manufacturing and distribution phase in a timely and efficient manner. We are very fortunate to have several friends that have gone through this process and have been happy to share their advice and experience. We have a solid plan to fulfill all of the commitments that we have made to our backers.\n\n The estimated delivery of Gruff is 6 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. If for some cataclysmic reason, Gruff can\u2019t be delivered at all, then we will promptly refund your pledge, including fees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Final 48 hours in the Gruff: Whispers of Madness Campaign", "update_content": "The Gruff: Whispers of Madness campaign ends in less than 2 days!

Your name will be displayed under the clan of your choice!\nMiriam\nPicked up as an orphan by an Alchemist at a young age, she became a host for the dark Alchemists\u2019 curse. Although the magi-crystals were fused with her body at a young age, for 10 years she lay sleeping while the curse matured to its full form. It was during this period that the demons arrived, meaning that she missed their appearance and awoke with a mild form of amnesia, not quite fully understanding what happened to her.\nShe is a woman of few words but strong of purpose. Her youth is deceiving, making her seem confrontational and quick to judge, though in reality she is constantly evaluating her next step. The pain she felt as an orphaned child fuels her compassionate desire to protect her loved ones and friends.\nGebel\nOriginal host for the magi-crystal curse that summons demons to the planet. Gebel (JEE-bill) was the only one to survive its effects at such a high level. He destroyed the guild that created him, but in doing so realized he was no longer human and had no place on Earth. This in turn, lead him to summon the demon castle from hell to appear on the planet.\nIt is said that his real purpose in summoning the castle was to give Miriam a place of her own, but as his Magi-crystal disease progressed, he soon forgot his own reasoning. The more he surrounded himself with hell-spawn, the quicker the magi-crystals engulfed his body. He continues to plot the downfall of man, and how to best convince (or use) Miriam to achieve his dark ambition.\nJohannes\nA member of the defunct Alchemist guild and Gebel\u2019s best friend. Johannes (yo-HAH-nis) was the only Alchemist who dissented with the plan to call demons to the earth to cement Alchemy as the prevalent philosophy. His rejection of the other Alchemists\u2019 scheme is what kept him from sharing their fate. He has a vague understanding that Miriam\u2019s awakening and the demon castle\u2019s appearance are no mere coincidence.\nExploration: Bloodstained's story unfolds as you explore Gebel's hellish castle; a sprawling structure that features a variety of locations. As you explore the massive castle you'll find warp gates that will allow you to travel quickly without having to backtrack too much.\nRPG Elements: It's not an Igavania without leveling, and Bloodstained will be no exception. In addition to the classic elements everyone\u2019s come to expect, enemies in Bloodstained will drop a wide variety of items, materials, and magi-crystals necessary to create the items that will get you safely through Gebel\u2019s castle. \nCrafting: As you explore, fight enemies, and complete quests you will gain experience and become more powerful, acquiring a variety of weapons along the way. Enemies will also drop materials you can use to craft new weapons and abilities using Miriam's training in alchemy.\n\n \n \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDarkness lurks around every corner, seeking to corrupt all that it touches. The world is torn between those in power and those the powerful would destroy, and both sides are held in thrall by the demons lust and avarice. Games get delayed sometimes, and it would be dishonest of us to promise you this one won't be.\n\nBut Inti Creates has shipped more than 30 games on eight different platforms, and Koji Igarashi personally oversaw the production and design of one of Japan's most legendary franchises. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the kind of game they love to make, and they've got a lot of experience making them.\n\nBetween us, the people behind this Kickstarter have helped to launch and fulfill several of the biggest, most complicated gaming Kickstarters ever launched. We've spent months trying to get this one right because we believe in the game (and really, really want to play it.) We\u2019re certain the game will be made, and that you\u2019ll get all the rewards you\u2019ve backed for.\n\nIGA has worked for more than a year to prepare and gather support for this game because fans have asked him for it. Now that he's come to you for help, his goal is to make the game you've been waiting for. By backing this campaign, you'll become a part of the process. During and after the campaign he hopes to keep you involved, whether it's voting on swords and whips, telling us how you play his games\u2014as fast as possible, or exploring every hidden passage\u2014or helping us find the perfect style for the graphics.\n\nFinally, the possibility exists that a man scarred by unfeeling, power-mad alchemists could summon a hell-castle filled with demons across the street from Inti Creates headquarters in Tokyo. IGA has as much experience handling that risk as any game designer on earth, but we estimate that it might set production back slightly (depending on whether or not he's allowed to backdash).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #106", "update_userinfo": "Classic Mode and Kingdom Crossover Are Here", "update_content": "Hello, Army of the Night!\nClassic Mode and a new area and boss based on the hit game Kingdom: Two Crowns launched on January 14th.

You touch them and it's game over. No checkpoints. Not for beginners.\n\nGauntlet Mode\nDodge obstacles in a procedurally generated environment as you try to escape a giant laser wall barreling towards you. Different from most 'runners' as you will have to make 90 degree turns and travel parallel to the deadly laser wall you are trying to outrun.\n\nTurbo Mode\nThe player will start the race with unlimited 'Turbo' for boosting.\nMultiplayer\nOnline and local multiplayer support. The player can also challenge ghost plays from the leaderboard.\n\n MEET C.A.T.

If something were to happen to me or I meet an early demise, the game would cease production. I'll do my best to make sure I'm extra cautious during the game's development--and always look both ways before I cross the road.\n\nVideo game development is also no easy task; it's grueling work and people burnout or quit. That should be a concern for backers, but it's also why I choose to work alone on this (as much as I can). I don't have to worry about the lead coder or artist quitting on me, or the person handling the budget taking the money and skipping town.\n\nSince I started creating the game, there hasn't been a day that's gone by where I haven't woken up and been excited about the game--not what the game COULD be, but the actual WORK itself. It's my passion and I hope it shows!\n\nThe biggest risk is to the game itself. If the Kickstarter goal is not met, it's not possible to finish the game in any capacity, much less what I have envisioned.

Thanks for your support.\nYooka-Laylee is an all-new 3D platformer from the creative talent behind the Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country games. We\u2019ve come together to form Playtonic Games and create a spiritual successor to our most cherished work from the past!\nOur new heroes, Yooka (the green bloke with no pants) and Laylee (the wisecracking lady-bat with the big nose) were conceptualised from the ground up for stellar platforming gameplay, created by the same character artist behind the rebooted Donkey Kong family and legendary N64 heroes Banjo and Kazooie.\nUsing an arsenal of special moves like Yooka\u2019s tongue grapple and Laylee\u2019s tactical sonar blast, players will explore \u2013 and expand \u2013 gorgeous 3D worlds drawn up by esteemed environment artist Steven Hurst (Banjo-Kazooie series, Viva Pinata) and through skill discover the plethora of delicious collectibles hidden within.\nWe did this in 3 months. It took me almost that long to write this page.\nHeroes Built for Fun: Our new buddy-duo were dreamed up specifically for entertaining platforming gameplay and exceptional colour coordination. We think we've captured the spirit of our past heroes while introducing our most inventive moves yet.\nAn Arsenal of Abilities: Sonar blasting, tongue whipping, sky soaring\u2026 a move roster built for platforming fun \u2013 and unlocked with added freedom. Additionally, there may or may not be a move involving a giant fart bubble.\nYooka regretted filling out that PPI claim.\nA Dream Soundtrack: David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) and Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) combine in what's sure to be a melodic masterpiece! Seriously, clean out your ears - they're in for a treat.\nCollect-em-up 2.0: A roster of shiny collectibles with gameplay progression at their core (as well as other, more valuable materials). Every collectible type in our new game will expand gameplay in a meaningful way. Yes, we employ the man responsible for DK64's myriad of trinkets, but we've had a stern word. Our main collectible, Pagies, are used to unlock and expand new worlds in Yooka-Laylee.\nExpandable Worlds: Experience more of the playgrounds you love by spending collectibles to expand your favourites into bigger, more challenging worlds.\nTake (musical) note: our new collectibles are work in progress.\nA Cast to Last: A huge cast of memorable characters to meet (or beat) brought to life by the art and audio teams behind Banjo-Kazooie and destined to endure in future games as part of Playtonic Universe. Expect all manner of grunts, squeaks and squawks.\nIntroducing Play Tonics: Discover these unique gameplay modifiers and use them to customise gameplay to suit your style. Will you run faster, hit harder or fly further? Also, are they named after our studio or vice versa? We'll never know.\nArcade machines: Each world hides at least one secret arcade game encasing old-school gaming goodness. Complete its retro-tastic challenge to claim your Pagie!\nYou can expect accurate bat physics.\nDuring their adventures Yooka and Laylee will complete challenges to unlock and collect Pagies. These golden collectibles are the main currency in the game, used not only to unlock new worlds but expand them too.\nIt's snow joke, this world's going to be cool.\nIn the jungle world showcased in this Kickstarter for example, new islands containing advanced features and challenges will become available once you\u2019ve decided to hand your Pagies over to the world-building construction crew.\n\nDon\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s? Spend your Pagies elsewhere. If you desire, world expansion can be ignored entirely and you can hop, skip and roll your way through the standard worlds towards the final boss lurking in his or her mighty keep. And once the pivotal villain is nought but ash on the pavement, you can still opt to explore the expanded worlds with your full moveset post-credits to hunt down those leftover Pagies.\n\nYooka-Laylee will feature a truly mouth-watering (ear-leaking?) soundtrack created in collaboration by three of gaming\u2019s greatest composers, the legendary David Wise (Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing), equally esteemed Banjo-Kazooie composer Grant Kirkhope (Viva Pi\u00f1ata, GoldenEye 007) and Banjo sound effects supremo Steve Burke (Kameo: Elements of Power). \nThis is one musical performance you definitely won\u2019t want to miss! Don't believe us? Listen to the early excerpts below and tell us you're not excited. Go on, we dare ya.\n'Jungle World' (working title / progress) by Grant Kirkhope:\n'Jungle Challenge' (working title / in progress) by David Wise:\n  What's more we've already had Chris Sutherland - part time programmer, full time voice actor extraordinaire - locked in the recording booth to bring his iconic 'gibberish' style to the characters (and googly-eyed objects) of Yooka-Laylee, ensuring a genuine audio treat. You might as well play it with your eyes closed, to be honest.\nIf our initial Kickstarter funding goal is reached, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team will deliver a complete and satisfying game package. However, given the opportunity and additional resources required, we have a list of \u2018dream\u2019 additional extras \u2013 and release structures - that we\u2019d love to deliver in order to make Yooka-Laylee an even better game.\nIf funded, Yooka-Laylee will be released for Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Wii U. However, the exact release timing and scope of each version will be determined by the success of this Kickstarter campaign and specifically, our stretch goals.\nWe\u2019d love to be able to guarantee a simultaneous, day-one release on all platforms in order to satisfy every Yooka-Laylee backer. In order to do this we\u2019ll need to significantly expand our resources and budget, and if we can reach the funding number required we\u2019d be excited to do so.\nAny extra money will of course go towards improving the game. Below is an example of some of the extra features we\u2019ll be able to fulfil by reaching stretch funding goals:\n What the Bleedin\u2019 Norah is a Toybox? Our Toybox experiences are designed to deliver hands on time with Yooka and Laylee before the game even comes out. You can be the first to take our heroic duo for a spin (literally, if you press X) but we promise this self-contained plaything won\u2019t spoil the full game: It\u2019s built from in-game assets arranged specifically for this experience. There won\u2019t be any objectives to beat, just a controllable duo, nice music and a few surprises too\u2026 !\n Toybox ++ The Enhanced Playtonic Toybox? Well of course, sir. A fine choice. I\u2019ll prepare the improved play space, advanced props and special moves right away. Oh I\u2019m sorry, are those sports shoes? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\n   It'll look something like this: (work in progress!)\n     [Updated 08 June] The concert will be in Stuttgart, Germany at the Hegel Saal on October 30th 2016 \u2013 David and Grant are confirmed with more details to follow soon\u2026!  \nThe Playtonic Team, composers and our backers will meet up in Stuttgart \u2022 You will be our VIP guests, we\u2019ll all sit together at the concert and dinner and discuss the potential reasons why Grant talks so fast \nYou may want to know more details before pledging, so please get in touch with us on kickstarter@playtonicgames.com or check out the organisers Facebook page here; https://www.facebook.com/rareconcert/info?tab=page_info\n    Playtonic was formed in 2014 by veterans of Rare Ltd. Between them, the seven-person Playtonic team has over 100 years of combined experience working on blockbuster franchises such as Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pi\u00f1ata and Kameo: Elements of Power \u2013 and using this Kickstarter we intend to grow our talent even further! Allow us to introduce the team (so far)\u2026\nOur plan is to have Yooka-Laylee ready to ship on PC, Mac and Linux by October 2016. Console versions will follow shortly after, dependent on resources and the performance of this Kickstarter campaign. However, if our crowdfunding is a big success and stretch goals met, then we will look to secure the resources required to pull off a simultaneous, day-one release on all major console platforms alongside PC, Mac and Linux.\nIn order to finish Yooka-Laylee we will need to expand our team to an \u2018N64 size\u2019 roster of around 15, which we\u2019ll look to do immediately upon reaching our funding goal. Therefore the vast majority of our budget will be allocated to wages and office space, plus the cost of outsourcing sound, testing and version creation. \n\nYooka-Laylee is a real passion project for the Playtonic team and we\u2019ve all made financial sacrifices to get it this far. We\u2019ll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter doesn\u2019t succeed, but the game will be bigger and better if it does! \n                                                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development can be a harsh taskmaster, with time and financial constraints often providing unexpected challenges that can ultimately lead to changes and delays. Fortunately, the Playtonic Games team has collectively been involved in more than 30 different games across more than ten different platforms and has great expertise in the 3D platformer specifically, with a strong track record of shipping some of the genre\u2019s greatest hits. \n\nSo not only do we have extensive experience delivering quality releases within this genre, but we\u2019re also well versed in working under the pressures of strict deadlines, budgets and high expectation. We\u2019re very confident we can deliver a game that lives up to fan expectations, on time and on budget.\n\nAnother challenge is to find the perfect balance between our own ideas for Yooka-Laylee and the expectations of the community. We\u2019re well aware that many fans are deeply, passionately attached to our past work and in some ways probably understand and adore its intricacies even better than we do. That\u2019s why over the coming months \u2013 and during this very Kickstarter campaign \u2013 we\u2019ll be consulting the community on some design issues and then ultimately making the final decision within our development team on the absolute direction.\n\nIn the past our most famous games have been single-platform releases. However, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team already has the necessary experience and channels to deliver a multiplatform release, and if certain stretch goals are met we\u2019ll recruit in this area to deliver different versions of our game to an even smoother deadline.

A peal of laughter echoes down a neighboring passage \u2014 one of the Baron\u2019s goons, no doubt, laying more of his traps for you. From a crack in the wall you hear the unmistakable sound of slithering. Best to not go that way either, then. This whole cave has the stench of death about it. If you had any sense, you\u2019d be high-tailing it for the exit already. Instead, you lace up your boots, tighten your grip on your trusty whip, and step forward into the darkness.  You\u2019re an adventurer, and there\u2019s treasure down there somewhere.\nSkulldug! is a pulp exploration game where 2-6 players race to collect 3 treasures and escape from an ancient and treacherous cave system.\nYou build out a new map every time you play, discovering new passages, equipment, and monsters.  Passages are generated on the fly from three decks of cards, so you never know what might be around the next corner.  It will take all of your wits to escape past your opponents\u2019 traps with your cursed loot, but make it out alive and all the glory will be yours.\nThanks to our awesome backers, we've unlocked a slew of new contents. The updated elements include:\n15 unique explorer tokens\n6 Dazed cards\n30 Health gems\nBonus Fortune and Hazard cards (see the Bonus Cards stretch goal below for details)\n                              You can also provide feedback on the manual by commenting on Google Docs!\n  If you'd like to try Skulldug! out for yourself, you can download the free 2-player print-and-play version of the game.This contains a slimmed-down selection of cards and passages, but is a great way to familiarize yourself with the rules and play of Skulldug!\n\n\"I really enjoy the game.

Many of your decisions are completely blind \u2013 you could be walking to your doom as easily as walking to victory, and you just won\u2019t know until the cards flip.

The quality of this cardstock effects a number of attributes, including how much light the card lets through and how much 'snap' the cards have when bent. Upgrading to bluecore stock will increase the feel and longevity of every card in the game!\nUnlocked: We've upgraded the Skulldug! box interior from a simple cardboard insert to a custom molded plastic tray, perfect for keeping all of your passages and explorers organized!\nUnlocked: Skulldug! will ship with rules and components for a new team mode, allowing you to partner up with a friend as you explore the cave! Team mode will support up to 3 teams of 2 players each in a competitive yet cooperative race for the treasure!\nYes, you read that right: this goal raises the max player count to 6 players! Team mode provides a totally different dynamic than the base free-for-all mode, and we're excited to get to share it with you. \nBut that's not all! In order to enable team mode, we will ship 15 unique explorers in every copy of Skulldug! This means that you will always have a variety of explorers to choose from, even in team mode!\nUnlocked: We've upgraded the passage cards to a set of chipboard tiles! These tiles will be much thicker and sturdier than the previous cards, making them perfect for building out a cave map with a minimum of sliding.\nWe will also increase the size of the box to fit all those tiles. The new box will measure around 175x250x66 mm, an increase of over half an inch on each dimension. This increased size should make the game look and feel a lot more substantial on your shelf!\nWe're adding a set of entirely new cards to the game!

But Zoombiniville is more than just the end of the game: it's also where your Zoombinis make their new home, save their progress, and celebrate your success.\nWe would like to enhance Zoombiniville to create a more rewarding experience as each pack of Zoombinis arrive and add a few extras to unlock, as well as improve the grand finale! Help us reach this goal by sharing our Kickstarter with your friends and family. Thank you for your support!\nZoombinis is a classic, beloved, and award-winning puzzle game created by TERC (that\u2019s us) and Broderbund in the late 90s. Back then, the little blue Zoombinis enjoyed the good life. They lived happily on players\u2019 computers, entertaining and enriching gamers\u2019 lives with challenges of logic, learning, and adventure. But over time they languished, passed over by a lack of updates, a changing market, and the coming of touchscreens. For years, fans have asked us to make Zoombinis available to a new generation of players, young and old.\nHaving now re-acquired the rights, we need you, trusted guide, to help them return, on a range of modern devices and with updated artwork, but still true to the spirit, gameplay, and challenges of the original. You will help expand our platforms, add new content, and bring Zoombinis back for everyone!\nFree the Zoombinis! Make your pledge, begin the adventure, sharpen your logic, and collect strange and unique tokens of their journey as your reward!\nAs their guide, players create and lead Zoombinis with varying characteristics of hair, eyes, noses, and feet, in groups of 16, through sets of challenges, working to get them to the promised land of Zoombiniville. The challenges increase in difficulty as more packs make their way through. Depending on players\u2019 skill levels, a few Zoombinis may be stopped along the way, but they can always go back for them later! The game features wonderful artwork and music, funny and endearing characters, and subtle building of the player\u2019s math and logic skills along the way. Challenges include the Allergic Cliffs, Stone Cold Caves, Pizza Pass, Captain Cajun\u2019s Ferryboat, Titanic Tattooed Toads, Stone Rise, Fleens, Hotel Dimensia, Mudball Wall, The Lion\u2019s Lair, Mirror Machine, and Bubblewonder Abyss.\nWhile the new adaptation is immediately recognizable as Zoombinis, we are updating the graphics for modern devices. The original art was just not scalable. All our characters were pixel-based sprites, and the background art was a fixed resolution. We\u2019re working with super-talented artist Chris Cyr (creator of http://plaidcats.com/) to redo all the backgrounds. Original creator Scot Osterweil has gone back to the original Zoombinis look, and we're recreating all the characters the Zoombinis interact with by tracing over their animations from the original but in vector form. The game will look amazing and work with tons of different devices and screen resolutions. Here is a first look at some of our favorite characters \u2013 enhanced!\nHip! Hip!

The players are kept challenged \u2013 and learning.\nFor example, in Pizza Pass, players must make an increasing number of trolls their favorite kind of pizza based on clues such as \u201cMore toppings!\u201d or \u201cEwwww, yuck!\u201d. Each time Zoombinis come through, Arno and his pals will want something different! Be thoughtful or some Zoombinis may be tossed back to Zoombini Isle!

We\u2019re already working hard to bring the game to tablets this summer, and this initial goal will help us make the new Zoombinis the best it can be on a variety of platforms, stay true to the original, and really polish the game. In particular, we want to increase the range of devices we support beyond the iPad and Android tablets to include PC, Mac, and tablets of all sizes. To accomplish all this we need to deal with some assets from the old game that are either missing or aren't in the shape they need to be, perform additional QA and testing, and help ensure we offer a great experience for the players.\nAny funds raised beyond the goal will go directly toward improving and expanding the Zoombinis experience.\nTERC is a not-for-profit in Cambridge, MA, where the Zoombinis were originally created and whose work is centered on K-12 math and science education.

Many educational games focus on teaching, with the game as an afterthought. For Zoombinis, the creators worked hard to find the fun inherent in the logic and math concepts that children and adults find compelling every day, such as looking for patterns, organizing information, reasoning about evidence, and systematic testing \u2013 aspects of many good, thoughtful games!\nSchedule\niOS and Android versions version 1.0 are planned for Summer 2015, and will be available worldwide in English and Spanish. \nTo make the Zoombinis game we want to make, we need your help.

We are well into the development process for the iPad version and are on time and on budget for a planned late June release. Our platform is Unity, which allows for builds to the range of platforms we\u2019ve outlined in this Kickstarter. Our costs are for improvements to artwork, QA and testing, adaptation to the quirks of each platform, etc. In other words, the risks are fairly minimal.\n\nThere are some challenges, though. We want this game to be spot-on for new technology and devices, and because of the outdated tech that was used to build Zoombinis, we\u2019re basically having to re-develop it. It\u2019s not just a port of the old game, which is, of course, great news! However, because we want to remain true to the original title and we don\u2019t want things to wind up on the cutting room floor, this is a fairly expensive and extensive project. The biggest challenge we face is satisfying both nostalgic and brand new fans.\n\nAnd, of course, getting Arno\u2019s pizza right.

Thank you!\nThreshold is a puzzle platformer game where you play as a gnomish wizard, known only as Hood, who needs to find their way through a series of mysterious doorways. All is not as it seems, however, as depending on which direction Hood faces the world changes to present different challenges. \nThreshold was originally developed during the Global Game Jam of 2014. You can download the original GGJ version of the game at IndieDB. Some of the original team have gotten back together and, in cooperation with QuadraTron Games, are currently re-developing the game from the ground up. \nThe game is currently in development, and we estimate it will launch sometime in the last quarter of 2015 for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. We are strongly considering mobile platforms such as iOS and Android sometime after. We also, most definitely, have our sights set on consoles such as PS4, Xbox One, and WiiU.\nFeatures\nA hand painted watercolor world inspired by the works of Mary Blair and Gustav Klimt, Threshold breathes life into a natural looking world with natural mediums. While beautiful, Threshold is a world of mysterious and magical adventure.\nA dynamic ambient soundtrack that is influenced by the players actions. Its world switching mechanic not only affects the look of a level, but sounds too.\nMany hours of head-scratching platforming puzzles to solve. The world of Threshold bends and stretches with the seasons creating new challenges to players. With the game spanning multiple worlds each with two seasons, players have much to look forward to.\nGame Play\nPlatforming with a twist: It\u2019s one thing to play a game set in a magical land unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen before but we wanted to take that idea and turn in on it\u2019s head. That\u2019s why you get to play in two worlds at once! Based on the direction that you\u2019re facing you will shift back and forth between two distinct worlds with their own unique layouts.\nYou break the barrier between worlds with every move: Since you are the only thing that can bridge the gap between the two worlds you\u2019ll need to choose wisely, and sometimes quickly, what goes where and when! Pick up a key in the summer world but find out that you can\u2019t take it into the winter world. See a key frozen in midair in the winter world but if you don\u2019t get in to the right place at the right time when you enter that world that key will resume it\u2019s descent\u2026 you just need to be there to catch it!\nCrack each level your way: As we build up the challenge in each of the levels the player will have more and more tools at their disposal to solve each one. We want to give the player the freedom to combine the effects of items or objects in the world to see what happens! Think that by placing a key at the top of a ramp and freezing it in that world so that you can run down to the other side and catch it? Then go for it! Think that you know a way to make a jump that no one has ever made before by bouncing in just the right place? Show us! \nInspiration \nThreshold has evolved out of our love of games that have made incredible contributions to the way that we all look at games. Drawing inspiration from games like Braid and Fez that take interesting core gameplay and push them to their absolute limits. Not stopping there we saw how important it was to combine that gameplay with a visual aesthetic that would draw the player in to the world that we were creating for them to play in.\nGames like Spelunky, Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country are others that give us a ton of inspiration. Not only do they create worlds that give the player the freedom to go their own way and take risks but also reward the players for those risks. Hiding secrets just below the surface that give the player more and more reasons to keep coming back and visiting those worlds time and time again. Bringing all of this in to our game is extremely important to us. Making something that we think is the coolest and most fun version of the game, the game we want to play and explore!\nWe have been working on Threshold over the last year as a labor of love. Part time at first, then around fall of 2014, full time for three months. We wanted to advance the project to a state we felt best fit our vision. As a small indie game development team, we were entirely self funded during this process. There is still much that needs to be done to take the game to the level of quality, depth, and beauty we would like to see before we can say that it is finished. We would love to have your support in our journey forward!\nWe are confident that no matter what Threshold will be a playable experience that we fully stand behind. Going forward we may want to bring in some freelance artists, writers, or musicians to help us add even more cool content to the game.  \nCosts\nHere's a pie chart of our budget estimate for Threshold.

Mila has worked for her fair share of games in the past including Schell Game\u2019s PlayForward, and the anime convention favorite Tekkoshodown. \nShe also has thrown her hat into the ring on a bunch of game jam games such as Global Game Jam and Ludum Dare. Mila proves to be a huge asset on a game jam team usually whipping together some sort of stylus wizardry to finishing her art at about double speed to everyone else\u2019s work. She usually just uses that free time to work on her card battle game Mahou Shojo.\nChristian Plummer (Programmer)\nChristian is a stubborn code monkey that breathes caffeine and will eat just about anything. He loves problem solving. If there aren\u2019t any problems readily available he is quite proficient at inventing some of his own.\nChristian is part of the Mark of the Old Ones team, that earlier in 2014, ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for their game to see it all the way through production.

These 2-4 players must then work together to navigate a labyrinth that shifts and changes as you play, while trying to accomplish the task of finding three ancient artifacts the gods have demanded in order to prove your worth and gain access to the exit - but there's a catch!  This labyrinth is filled with mythic monsters and traps...\nThe game itself is done.  The mechanics have been heavily tested and an algorithm was created to allow for mathematically balanced game-play which has helped us create a game that can be a challenge to overcome while still providing multiple ways to do so.  Sometimes, the game is simply going to win - that happens!  It'll be up to you and your friends to make the decisions that ultimately see you through to the end.\nWe need your help finalizing the artwork, and getting our game to the manufacturer so that we can put it in your hands and on store shelves.  Take a look below for some of the great artwork, more information about gameplay, voting rights and what that entails for those who pledge at higher levels!\n GAMEPLAY\nThe sons and daughters of Zeus, Athena, Hephaestus, Apollo, Hades, Hermes, Ares and Poseidon have all received invites to a location known as \"The Labyrinth\".  You can read more about how they received those invites on our site, HERE!\nOnce you all enter The Labyrinth with the characters you've chosen, you'll work together to locate the three artifacts that will grant you exit from the maze while fighting your way through monsters that have been locked down there for centuries, and doing what you can to avoid the deadly traps they've taken care to set up for you.  They're quite angry about their confinement, and the gods have promised them freedom should they defeat you...\nEach room is represented by a tile, as shown in the video above.  We don't have artwork for these tiles yet - that's part of why we need your help!  When you enter a room, you turn over that tile, and choose how to orient it.  When you do so, the room you came from shifts - the Labyrinth is ever in motion, and a more difficult room takes it's place.  Take care that you don't have to backtrack!  Once complete, you'll draw an Encounter for that room.  Maybe you'll get lucky and simply find resources; or maybe you'll find a hungry chimera...\nYou start by turning over the tile for the next room. Then orient it however you prefer, as long as one path points back the way you came. Lastly, replace the tile you came from with one from the next level.\nOnce you reach the other end, you'll be able to claim an ancient artifact.  These artifacts have special abilities, such as the Daedelus' Wings that Alexis uses in the video above to bypass a bottomless pit that would otherwise have killed the party.\nThere are only four levels within the labyrinth - if you find yourselves exiting a level 4 room and have to upgrade it, you actually remove the entire stack of tiles from the table altogether.  That area of the labyrinth becomes a bottomless pit, making navigation all the more treacherous as the party will fall to their death if forced to enter without supernatural aid.  Think ahead, rather than rushing aimlessly through, when you get to the later stages of the game!\nWe didn't get a chance to mention in the video, but Holden's Guardian ability grants him an automatic +2 Defense for each monster beyond the first in that fight!\nThroughout the journey to acquire the three artifacts, you'll be able to enhance your gear, use special character abilities (they're demigods, after all!) and give gifts to the gods with resources you find for boons in return (such as healing, or extra attack power).\nTo exemplify this, take a look at Holden above.  He has three attributes: Offense, Defense, and Speed.  He's a pretty solid guy and his defense reflects this.  Like the other characters, he also has three abilities.  He can use the Guardian ability any time it's applicable, as it is free.  If he wants to use his his Fortified ability, he'll need to discard 1 Gold and 1 Herb resource cards.  Later in the game, after leveling up his weapon or armor (more on this later), he'll unlock his Fate ability.  Fate is fickle, and this is represented by flipping a coin.  If the flip succeeds, Holden will be able to absorb damage for an ally, as he moves to protect them.  If the flip fails, he fumbles his attempt and the ally actually takes some extra damage that was meant for Holden...\nHere's a brief example of what you're seeing on the cards\nEach character has their own interesting abilities, and we'll be spotlighting more of these as the campaign progresses!\n We've got a lot of great artwork - but it's not done!  The card text is ready and playtested, but we still need artwork for room tiles, additional monsters, weapons, armor, and elixirs before we're ready to head to manufacturing.  By pledging, you'll also get access to some of that great artwork to use as desktop wallpaper as soon as the campaign finishes! \nOnce we finish commissioning the artwork we will be set to send everything off to a manufacturer.  We're already in talks and know what to expect with regards to time frames, and have created our pledge goals to adhere to those.  The games will be delivered in summer of 2015!\nEIGHT DEMIGODS\nBelow is a closer look at the eight playable characters you'll have to choose from.

We'll take you out to dinner (you can choose where, within reason, since you know the area) and afterwards we'll play Demi: Labyrinth of the Gods with you and yours!  We may play other boardgames too - we like games.  When we leave, we'll high five you again, just to drive the point home that you're awesome.  We'll then post the pictures we took while we played the game with you on social media, and talk about how awesome you are.\nARTISTS\nSo far we've brought on three great artists.

The only real risks at this point are delays in getting the product in your hands. There are two things that could cause a delay:\n\n1.) Artwork Delays - Obviously we cannot send off the game to the manufacturer until all of the artwork is ready. As this Kickstarter is seeking to finish funding the artwork, we then have to wait for the artists to actually do it. A delay may occur. While we fully intend to work with our artists to ensure that the job is completed in a timely manner, life happens.\n\n2.) Manufacturing Delays - As we will be working with a manufacturing company, there is the potential that something will happen at their facility that will cause a delay in production of our product. We will do everything we can to ensure they ship on time, but a delay on the manufacturing end is a possibility. If a delay becomes something significant and the manufacturer will be unable to proceed, we will work with other manufacturers we have already communicated with to ensure production - this will not cause a price change for anybody who pledged. Regardless, it will ship in the end!\n\n3.) Extra Shipping Fees - Our pledge tiers (which can no longer be altered) state that shipping will be calculated upon completion of the campaign - and that's still true. However, we will never charge more than $10 for Domestic, and $30 for International shipping. Ever. Furthermore, if when it comes time to ship, the costs are less than that, we'll return the difference to you - we will never make a profit on shipping!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Three Guys Gaming (deleted)\nFirst created \u00b7 15 backed\nWe are board game designers, prototypers, and publishers.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Cancellation and a fresh start!", "update_content": "Hello Backers!\nThank you all so much for showing support these past few weeks!

The world is seamless. You\u2019ll walk into the Holloway-Exeter docking bay, board the Starr Wolf and control the flight sequence, blasting off to space. You\u2019ll be bargaining deals at the bar in order to afford repairs and upgrades to your Starr Wolf and using information gleaned from characters to find hidden routes while flying between destinations. Be careful which passing enemies you attack, as not all are foes, and a few could have dire consequences. Even while facing the charging death beam of a G'ell cannon, use your charisma to dodge bullets.\nOPEN-MIDDLED GAMEPLAY (OMG!)\nStarr Mazer is driven by an Open-Middled Gameplay (OMG!) narrative. An entire playthrough of the game is like a season of a show, but each episode within can appear in almost any order. These episodes all have many entry points and exit points, but the core content of each episode is meticulously crafted. We record not only how a player starts an episode, but the decisions that player makes within, and how that player decides to end it. Your actions modify situations and outcomes of future episodes. As you complete key episodes in the overall narrative, the scenarios start funneling into one of a few logical and satisfying endings influenced by your actions throughout.\nDYNAMIC SHMUP SEQUENCES\nYou'll spend a lot of time traveling between planets, asteroids, and space stations. Each time you do, the ride will reflect the state of the world. Are you flying through Tarsec sept-space as they meet a fleet of G'ell straight from depths of the Helix Nebula, or did you wait just a little longer and see scattered remnants of a great battle? Anger pirate groups and you\u2019ll be sure they\u2019ll find you, even in the most remote reaches of space.\nSHMUPs are known for their carefully crafted sequences that encourage you to perfect maneuvers. Starr Mazer will have the best of both worlds. The developers on the team are no strangers to dynamic AI. SHMUP segments will be generated from a vast collection of hand crafted encounters that can be modified dynamically in difficulty and scale, in addition to being layered on top of other encounters. You\u2019ll recognize tactics used by each group, as their history will provide a style in which they fly, fight, and chase.\nGUTS AND BUCKS\nBrick\u2019s been out of touch stuck in a sleep-lock pod for nearly a century and a half. His skills are rusty and his wallet empty. By taking missions from all sorts of shifty folk at the Holloway-Exeter station he\u2019ll earn bucks to buy gear and guts to increase his skills. This isn\u2019t just a system to make SHMUP parts easier or to give you more dialogue options in the Point-and-Click parts. This is a way to customize Brick to play as you want. Use items to influence major characters. Upgrade the Starr Wolf into a dominating fighting fortress, or use your guts to become an ace pilot and never scratch the paint.\nBRICK\u2019S STORY NEVER ENDS\nBecause of the power of the OMG! narrative, each time you play through Starr Mazer it will be a different experience. Maybe in your first playthrough it\u2019s not till the end that you meet Declination Jane, the galaxy\u2019s most powerful space lord, just after she finds peace between two warring clans. You win her over, and she provides help in your last few episodes. But in your next playthrough you meet her earlier, and catch her at a bad time when she\u2019s on the brink of war. Brick says the wrong thing at the wrong time and insights her furious wrath. Now every time you cross the BARATHA DIVIDE she makes sure to send you a gift of a battalion of warships to fight your way through.\nTHE UNIVERSE OF STARR MAZER\nThe galaxy is a cored out husk. It's one hundred and thirty years after THE GREAT WAR and any hope of unity, peace and whatever else you could want that doesn't end with you dead went out of style with microwave ovens and heavy fuel oil.\nThe core systems are an impenetrable cabal of aristocratic solar-states and the badlands at their border, clear up to the BARATHA DIVIDE, are filled with pirates, prospectors, colonists and cowboys in ceramic-alloy mess makers.\nLittle bastions of hope are scattered among the detritus. Little societies spinning in oblong orbits with sticks pointed outward and hopes turned in hoping to make it another cycle without some mercenary band of space-pop trying to pound their way in.\nThe galaxy needs a hero.\nThe Holloway-Exeter Station\n\"Ain't nobody e'r left outta' Holloway richer'n 'ay came in. Aint' nobody came up inta' Holloway deader'n 'ay left.\" -- Supchup Tanglewarn, Space Pirate\nThe Holloway-Exeter is a frontier town packed into a spinning ringed cylinder orbiting the fourth moon of the third planet of a dying star; a great place for a mercenary pilot like Brick to find himself at the pointy end of some clatter and sin.\nA century worth of gentrification has built layer upon layer of complication and perturbation onto the small outpost Brick once knew. Now the rich line the outsides of seedy den within, and have no idea of the crusty society which lives deep within their walls.\nThe BARATHA DIVIDE\nThe BARATHA DIVIDE is that place you imagine you'll end up when you kick it if you spend your life kicking over lemonade stands and ripping tags off of mattresses. It's the big empty; a kind of black local space looks into and gets lost. It is the end of everything and the beginning of nothing. Some don't even think reality works out there. \nIt's also where the G'ell come from.\nThe Helix Nebula\nTearing a multi-dimensional rift smack dab in the middle of sea of conflict was the Helix Nebula. For some its arrival has been an inconvenience or a loss of wealth, spewing all manner of terrors and lost souls into the once corrupt but stable district this side of the DIVIDE. For others it\u2019s an omen of a greater prophecy, and the time of a new god. \nFor Brick it\u2019s one hell of a way to earn a few bucks from superstitious investors.\nThe G'ell\nThere is no other known race so perfectly bred for combat. The G'ell have learned from a history of violence and stepped up to survive at the brink of extinction. This single minded society holds a million year grudge that has turned a few pockets of the universe into suicide districts.\nThe G'ell are a race of meticulous mathematicians, incorporating advanced calculus into every shot. Their attack patterns would look beautiful if you weren\u2019t stuck in the middle of a parabolic demise.\nBrick M. Stonewood\nBrick M. Stonewood (the \u201cM\u201d stands for \u201cMetal\u201d) is a remnant of an older time. A time where men were men and truth spilled at 60km/s from the barrel of a gun. Found by ingot miners in sleep-lock, drifting in a LOKATT MkII DSP eject pod and revived at the Holloway-Exeter Station, Brick is a man driven to unlock the secrets of his past and the strange mysteries that lie just beyond the DIVIDE; a specialist with a ceramic alloy steed, the Starr Wolf, and a fate to make among the stars.\nThe Lokatt MkII DSP Special Assault Frame \"Starr Wolf\"\n\"She's a world class rig, this beauty. Built of tri-cordal folded breon and pitch molded bitanium and armed to the hilt with all manner of noise makers and jail breakers. An imperial body with the smarts of an Exeter planet-pop and the guts of a top suit smuggler's tail. The Wolf's got a way with space, you see. She's hungry with her curves. She'll dance a fancy to dazzle but has the stuff to let fly when it gets to be a tussle. She's got a screaming howl and a ripping bite. Magna-casters bristle from her snout and she's carrying chain-dump slips to crackle the hull of anything smaller than a capital boat with a right fat uniformed commander in a big comfy chair. And she's all mine. I'm her captain.\" - Brick M. Stonewood\nBunny Bitshift\n\"One hundred thirty in the sleep is what we fly-boys used to call a raw deal. The full turnover. The reset button. Every Tom-Tom, Blaze Rider and Hooch-man you knew is dust and there you are with nothing but your grin and your chin. That's what it was for me on the Exeter, unfroze and lonely with the stink of kraz on my breath and a big dumb scowl. Nothing to lose but my guts and nowhere to go but sideways into the deep. That was what came of the Thearsal Knife, the whole-wide hero of THE GREAT WAR. Reduced to pan ash and staring at pin darts through the bottom of a bottle. And then I met Bunny.\" - Brick M. Stonewood  \nBunny Bitshift is not what she appears to be. Not to you, anyway. You see a girl with a wicked grin in a bunny suit. That's because you're a million years too early to this party. You've come with your eyes out of time. Just like Brick.\nRead more about Bunny here!\nThe aesthetics are key to the era of media Starr Mazer strives to evoke. In that time, art was forged despite limitations and beauty crafted in 16x16 pixelated tiles. From this we have embraced a style that is not just nostalgia, but a representation of a period of time in gaming. Our artists have managed to imbue the essence of that generation into the game. The art in Starr Mazer isn't something that could easily run on a 16-bit processor, but it looks like what you remember those games looking like the first time your cathode ray tube blasted the RF input out of the most advanced gaming technology of its time.\nThe original concepts and designs come from J\u00e9r\u00e9mie P\u00e9rin, a writer, animator, and director for TV animated series, video games, and short films. Well known among animators, pixel artists and retro fans for his amazing video \"Truckers Delight\", we're thrilled to have J\u00e9r\u00e9mie involved as a concept artist.\nThese designs are being realized into the game by Christina Antoinette Neophotistou, who is a rising star of the pixel art world. Having contributed to everything from full published games to weekend game jams with art, music, and design, Christina has proven herself as a pixel painting machine to be reckoned with.\nChiptune legend Alex Mauer is creating the score to Starr Mazer and we can think of none better for such an undertaking!  Here is a sample from our OST: \n\nAlex won't be working alone! We've assembled a dream team of influential artist from the indie, chiptune, and synthpop scenes.

Every hour spent clicking through puzzles and burning through credits were inspirations for a greater game. Each aspect of the characters, universe, and message of Starr Mazer have been solidified. The only thing the game needed was an opportunity. That time is now. Through Don\u2019s work in the game and film industries he\u2019s met a host of skilled individuals, always considering if they could be part of the team. He\u2019s now found the people to do it. They have the passion and understand what this game can be. We have the team that will make Starr Mazer the absolute best game it can be. Now we just need you to want it as much as we do. We want to be supported by the people who have always wanted this game, but never knew how to ask. We want to be supported by people who understand this vision and know that, if made uncompromised, this game will be better than any game we could have made on our own. Really, we just want to give you the absolute coolest game we can possibly conceive.\nThe majority of the team is currently building Starr Mazer as a part-time passion project. The amount we're asking for will enable the whole team to work full-time on Starr Mazer and bring Brick's story to life.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDon has over 15 years of combined experience in programming, making award-winning films, and game development. His passion & history with the classics of each genre has provided the skills he needed to do justice to the concept. Starr Mazer's art is built off of the strong concepts of a renowned artist, and executed by one of today's most skilled pixel artists. He's found developers who build comprehensive game systems with amazing speed. He's brought together a team who can build and share it with the world.\n\nHowever, a game of this scale and precision requires more commitment than the whole team's current schedule can provide uninterrupted.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

But what if that escape plunges you further to lands where skeptics go blind?\nKiller Odds is the story of a blood-craving firestarter named, Dice. Named after her penchant for chaos, this girl is no tank-girl, but she couldn't give two sh*ts if she's left a scorched earth for the authorities to trail her. The treaty between the Leech Lords has been destroyed and while her Motorcycle Club could have left the various city rulers to bewilderment, Dice decided it would be more interesting to see the filth in the shadows besiege eachother. Because-- seriously, seeing a bunch of supernatural creatures fighting each other is worth at least 10 minutes of unlife.\nThis isn't the setup for a blood-sucking version of Sons of Anarchy nor is it inspired by The Lost Boys, but it has similar elements. Dice will be dealing with other Motorcycle Clubs both vampiric and normal. Unfinished business, new threats, and an ever-unfolding chaos of her recent actions. What is worse is that Ophidicus has an interest in her.\nTHE FINAL PRODUCT:\nThis is intended as a graphic novel, but may evolve to being a motion comic. So you might wonder, how does a sponsor get a motion comic? This will be made available in a viewable format and further details concerning how to view it will be made known as time goes. However, it will first be made into a graphic novel for ease of viewing.\n I have three story arcs planned. The first story arc is my focus for this Kickstarter and will be the one distributed to those who contribute at $15 and above (also whoever does the INFORMANT tier). Each story arc as three sections to them which covers a certain bit of development in the story. While all three story arcs are tied together, each story arc can sustain itself. Would backers see the future story arcs? I'd like to do one story arc at a time and see if I can produce more in a timely manner.\nThis Kickstarter is designed to propel this idea and project further along with the support of friends, family, and interested individuals. Its not merely to sell a product, there is a greater vision in creating more properties with my colleagues, but this is just the beginning. Killer Odds is a pet project that I've been working on for the last few years and the most I require is the funding to get the tools. Once those tools are acquired, I'll be able to dedicate a significant amount of time to creating content.\nYou will notice that the Delivery date is September 2015 (if all goes as planned, I can release content by May 2015).

The primary allocation of these funds is to get the tools which will help me streamline my production process. The ability in having these tools will help me generate other income producing work.\n\nTime-\nAside from working on this project, I'm continuing my higher level education to put more meat into my work. I'm happy to juggle this with the project as this is a spark which I feel I'm compelled towards.\n\nDigital work versus Physical work-\nVarious Kickstarters endorse their results in the delivery of physical products. Unfortunately, unless you're very experienced with these kind of details, I've read Kickstarter updates that have had difficulty in having the funds to compensate for all the shipping that had to happen. For the time being I'm only promising digital work, if funds go beyond the goal stretch goals will include calculations for physical compilations.\n\nAssurances:\nGraphic Design-\nWhile I contribute my design abilities to varying projects on jobs, I find myself sharper when I have a greater sense of control in the creative process. I'm not outside accepting peer review to ensure people get the best version of the vision being explored.\n\nFashion-\nAfter several years in the fashion industry, I've maintained a constant collection of magazines and collected ideas which fall in line with current trends. Although I've read my fair share of comics and understand the directions of character design, there is a lot that can be used in current fashion trends.\n\nNerd-\nI\u2019ve been engaged in comics, video games, online games, movies, TV series, and other material that has its fanbase of nerds/geeks. I grew up watching films from the 80\u2019s, with its vast collection of horror, sci-fi, adventure, and action movies. I\u2019ve been inspired by the talents of Joe Mad, Michael Turner, J.Scott Campbell, ArtGerm, and many contemporary comic artists. It is my sincere hope to learn from my endeavors and exemplify the details I\u2019ve acquired.\n\nTrust-\nOver the last decade, many individuals from various walks of life have been interested in my doing something with my skills and passion.

Go!\nAs players explore the five physical spaces in the game, they will unlock our memories, hear our thoughts, and discover the joy of Joel's laughter as they play through our family\u2019s experience fighting this terrible dragon called Cancer.  \nThe game is designed in the style of a 3d point-and-click adventure game, without the puzzles.  The objective of the player is not to solve problems, but simply to be present in each moment. We have intentionally kept the controls simple to remain accessible to both core-gamers, casual-gamers, and non-gamers alike.\nMove left stick/mouse to look around, press a button to perform an action based on the cursor.\nThe rich audio environments and simple interactions create a beautiful, narrative experience, free from time constraints, that encourages players to take their time.\nThough the dragon does not appear in the game, his violence is felt everywhere, which makes the gameplay an emotionally trying experience, but one we're told enriches the lives of those who have played it.\n\"...

We are excited to announce that we will be bringing \"That Dragon, Cancer\" to the OUYA and Desktop Computers when we launch.\nThe last two years of our lives have brought the game into clear focus, and now feels like the right time to engage the community of people who have always believed that games matter and that modern games can have an even bigger cultural impact.\nKickstarter is the perfect platform to partner with with all of you who have so passionately supported this game, and include you in the story itself through backer rewards.\nAs we have shared the game with over 1500 players over the last two years, we have realized that while the details of Joel's story may be personal, the feelings, questions, and experiences his story unearths are universal. There are many places in the game where we would like to show that Joel's story is representative of many similar stories.

Raising $85k through Kickstarter will leave us with about $70k after Kickstarter's fees and the cost of the rewards. If the campaign reaches its goal, the remaining $75k will come from a private loan (up to $25k) and Indie Fund, a group of successful game developers who support the growth of games as a medium (up to $50k). If the campaign exceeds its goal, our private investment will provide the remaining budget.

If our Kickstarter succeeds, this will be unlikely, for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, Ryan and Josh have developed and shipped several videogame titles before and know the work involved in finishing a game, including within more limited hardware limitations like the OUYA console. This is not our first shipped title as individuals, but it is as a company.\n\nSecond, to reduce risk as much as possible, we have the entire game planned from start to finish. Most of it is already built, and most of what\u2019s built is beyond a crude prototype stage. We've estimated our remaining development time based on previous building and polishing tasks for this game, plus we've allotted extra time for unforeseen issues, such as with QA for the PC.\n\nLastly, this estimate includes several deadlines that allow us to track overall progress. In the unlikely event we miss a deadline and aren't able to catch up on our own, we'll notify our backers as soon as we're aware of this problem and seek help to provide as small a delay as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "New Accessibility Initiative inspired by Joel", "update_content": "I have this sneaking suspicion that the things that will ultimately matter the most in my life are not the ones I value the most.

The game combines the horror of Amnesia with the sneaking and archery of Thief. The player will have to carefully pick their path through the dark hallways on Temple Island, through catacombs and amphitheatres to solve the mysteries that lurk within the labyrinthine garden at the peak: Hesperides.\nEarly concept of Medusa\nA unique blend of setting and mechanics.  Getting chased through the labyrinth by a minotaur is scary enough, but our game is filled with architecture, art and mythos from ancient Greece. No other major horror title has used the setting for a long time, and we believe that it offers the perfect background for a horror game.\nSatyr enemy concept\n A manifested inventory. Horror needs to be immersive in order to be successful. That\u2019s why we make sure that everything the player can pick up is manifested in the gameworld, and not on a separate screen. Arrows, for example, are placed in the quiver and the player has to look at it to see how many arrows he/she has left.\nConcept of the minotaur\n The inclusion of Oculus Rift is something that has not yet become a thing on the market, and Medusa\u2019s Labyrinth is ideal for the technology. Horror games are amongst the most requested projects for Oculus users and we have already worked with the technology in previous projects. Oculus is also a great way to market the game, and will surely be featured on YouTube by popular personalities such as PewDiePie.\nEnvironmental concepts\nGuru Games is a new company, we have only existed for about a year and we are currently in the finishing phase of our first game Magnetic: Cage Closed. We are currently eleven people, consisting of 3 designers, 3 programmers and 5 artists. At Guru we strive to create awesome and immersive gaming experiences that respect the players time and commitment to the game. We specialize in single player first person games, and have been fans of the Oculus Rift since it was first announced right here, on Kickstarter.\nAs mentioned before, we are already finishing up a game called Magnetic: Cage Closed. Now, you might ask \"if you are almost releasing a game, shouldn't you guys have money, why are you Kickstarting Medusa's Labyrinth?\". The truth is that we developed Magnetic out of our own pocket while studying and living on bread crumbs. Now we have all graduated and we are bleeding money each month with no secure income. Magnetic has as of yet just cost us alot of money and time and we don't know if the game will be successful upon launch. That is one of the scary things being a developer, especially an yet-unknown indie developer. We don't know if releasing this game will keep us employed or if we have to disband the company!\nThat is why we are coming to Kickstarter. To seek funding for our next project, to bypass a need for publisher funding, so we can continue to exist as a company and to develop cool games for you guys and gals, the fans.\nFor Medusa's Labyrinth we want to start out with a healthy time for pre-production. Pre-production will allow us to flesh out the narrative and story, work deeper on how the mechanics interact with the overall gameplay and theme of the game and also set the mood and tone of the game and its several areas. We want to put the game in pre-production from November 2014 to February 2015. We will use no money from the Kickstarter during this time. This is because we can't dedicate the whole team to Medusa's Labyrinth since we are finishing up Magnetic: Cage Closed during that time. However, half of our team can still work on pre-production! We feel that it wouldn't be fair to you guys and gals to use the money from the Kickstarter when our whole team isn't working for the project you pledged for.\nThe money we get from Kickstarter will be spent on salaries while stuff such as licenses will come out of our own pockets (which is the salaries). So, if we meet our Kickstarter goal of 350.000 USD / 2.500.000 SEK that means a monthly salary, after taxes, will be roughly 1100 USD / 8000 SEK. That's not a big salary so while the overall goal might seem like alot of money (in fact, it is alot of money!), running a studio consisting of eleven people for a year is expensive. But that salary is enough for us to keep paying our rent and enables us to buy food and clothes. With a bed to sleep in and food on our table, we can focus all our energy on just making the best game possible for you, the fans!\nAnyway, onward to the four phases our development will go through, starting with pre-production!\nHere is a short summary of what we will work on in pre-production:\nResearch\nConcept art\nFirst playable prototype\nWorld building\nBuilding a modular level system\nOculus Rift\nLevel handling, loading and transitions between levels\nDummy monsters\nPlayer functionality (Torch mechanics. Basic archery functions, players will be able to hit monsters but not kill them (yet). Hiding from the monsters.)\nAfter the pre-production, by the end of February, we will be in full production speed. At this time we enter our first milestone production and that lasts from February 2015 to June 2015.\nHere is a short summary of what we will go through during that time:\nDesign\nGame flow for the whole game experience. This will be built with basic placeholder assets. Focus will be on \"scary levels\" but not \"finished levels\". We will also work on puzzle design and functionality.\nStory flow\nDecide which areas will be in the game\nResource management\nPlan for Oculus Rift unique game elements (Weeping Angels etc)\n----\nProgramming\nCore mechanics such as:\n- Functional AI for the monster\n- Torch, brazier and fire functionality\n- Archery functionality\n- Stealth mechanics\n- Inventory functionality\n- Character functionality\nSave system\nOculus Rift support\n----\nArt\nCharacter avatar\n- Animations\n- Torch\n- Bow\n- Arrows\n- Inventory\nMonster\n- Updated model\nModular level system with basic meshes\nBasic visual effects\nBasic atmospheric lighting\n----\nSound & Music\nBasic atmospheric sounds\nCharacter sounds\nMonster sound concept\nBasic background music\nTriggered tension music\nMilestone 2 will see the start of some real playtesting but also work on the tutorial and the intro sequence of the game as well as the ending will begin here. It will run from June 2015 to October 2015.\nHere is a short summary of Milestone 2!\nDesign\nPlaytesting\nResource placement (such as arrows, torches, etc)\nTriggered events\nNotes and story implementation\nIterate based on playtesting\nFinalize the structure of the levels\nTutorial/Intro and ending sequences\nImplement Oculus Rift unique game elements\nWeeping Angels\n----\nProgramming\nMain menu\nGUI (reading notes, journals, etc)\nIterate on core mechanics\nExpand AI\nVisual feedback on in-game tools\nPost processing effects\nIterate on Oculus Rift integration\nIntegrate Oculus Rift game elements\nWeeping Angels\n----\nArt\nWork on the visual feedback for the amount of torch light left before it burns out\nMonster animations\nUpdate basic models\nMake levels unique\nUpdate visual effects\nUpdate lighting\nWork with post processing filters\nWeeping Angels\n----\nSound & Music\nFinalize sounds for the monster\nFinalize atmospheric sounds\nFeedback sounds (hitting an arrow in a target, missing, etc)\nVoice acting\nPost process sounds\nMenu sounds\nUpdate background music\nUpdate tension music\nFor the final step, milestone 3, we will have our content stop. What this means is that no new features will be implemented and the ones in the game will be locked down. Then we will just polish what we have until it shines like gold! Scary gold!\nHere is a short summary of what we will do in milestone 3!\nContent stop!\nFinalize game and complete the final post processing effects\n----\nDesign\nPlaytesting\nWork with the AI to make encounters that are not foreseeable\nWork with the atmosphere and where the encounters should take place\nFinalize intro/tutorial and ending scenes\nBalancing archery and stealth\nPopulating the environments\nConnecting the pieces into a finalized game structure\nDesign is also responsible for causing optimzation problems at this stage (don't worry, we are pros at this stuff)\n----\nProgramming\nBugfixing\nOptimization\nPrelaunch preparations such as launch platform integration and achievements\nPost processing effects\n----\nArt\nPolish all the assets of the game and finalize the game environments\nPopulating the environments, making stuff look good\nOptimization\nTweaking post processing filters\n----\nSound & Music\nFinalize monster sounds\nFinalize atmospheric sounds\nFinalize post processing sounds\nFinalize feedback sounds\nFinalize voice acting\nFinalize the main music theme of the game\nFinalize tension music\nThe baths are not a place where you would want to take a swim. If we reach this stretch goal, we will add an additional environment inside the temple area: An ancient Bath House, where the once beautiful and warm pools are now cold and filled with murky water and the halls are filled with an eerie song that dares you to take another step towards the water. This area will add additional puzzles and obstacles, enriching the game as a whole.\nNo labyrinth is complete without its Minotaur. If we reach this stretch goal, we will add an additional monster to the game, and one that we ourselves are very excited about. This Minotaur will have a unique behaviour and will add additional depth to the gameplay, as well as serve as the role of protector for the once holy temple.\nWe will give the Minotaur his own home and a new area for the player to explore: The Temple Gardens. This level will be an outside area, a Temple Garden and a labyrinth in its own right, housing the huge beast. This area will add additional puzzles, more environments to explore and more game time.\nIf we reach this goal we will add a whole new area to the game: High Priests\u2019 Refuge, where the Elder Priests and Scholars lived in luxurious halls and immense riches. This former gem of the island has now fallen into an eerie darkness. This area will add more puzzles, more levels and grant the player additional game time. This will also give the player a more rich game world and a broader experience of what has happened on the Island before the player arrived, fleshing out the story and the ending parts of the game.\n Below are the different reward tiers.

We have discussed this and tried to figure out why people aren't latching on to the project. Is it the video? Is the comedic sketch in the beginning more off putting than enticing? Should we just show gameplay first? Is it confusing when the Kickstarter goal is set in Swedish kronor (SEK) instead of U.S. dollars? Have we done a poor job marketing and reaching out to people?

Get a concept art print for sharing the project!\nA 2D puzzle plaformer with a novel and broad mechanic: Cloud is constantly throwing lightings at Gnome. This is both a curse and a blessing, since these lightnings will kill you but also help you solve puzzles with their side effects.\nGorgeous digital painted art: Our talented artist Juan Novelletto has been crafting amazing concepts for Nubarron's world. All the graphics of the game will be done using digital painting techniques, providing it a nice artistic look, something that is hard to find in this type of games.\nVast universe full of stories, creatures and awesome landscapes: We want this game to be the first instance in a series of stories about this broad universe. We're creating a bestiary book with short story fragments and sketches gathered by adventurous scouts that travelled across these lands. Checkout Nubarron Diaries for a sample on this!\nA fairytale story with a dramatic dark twist: The story of Nubarron is not like any other fairytale. Things don't work as one might expect in this twisted world, and the forest is aware of this. Perceive the world morphing in the most mischievous ways at every single step.\nHardcore puzzles: The game is based on difficult puzzles that will put you in the dilema of using Cloud's thunder bolts to modify the environment. Usually not in happy ways.\nMade with Unity: We're using Unity engine so porting to different platforms will be an easy task to achieve.\nWhen we think of a fairy-tale forest, a warm and friendly feeling arises. It certainly smells like flowers in bloom and rainbows give color to every morning. Well that's not the case in the Peaceful forest of the Deep Blue Sky. Something has brought trouble to the ever happy neighborhood. Something is terribly wrong with one of its inhabitants.\nGnome, one of the merry and lucky inhabitants of the forest, lost his lucky hat. This unfortunate event turns out to be a little bit more important than it may seem at plain sight. Gnome's hat was the source of his luckiness and with it gone an unpredictable thing happened. The stormy Cloud formed on top of Gnome taking the place of his hat. This was no game. Cloud seemed to enjoy throwing lightnings at every single thing below her. An Gnome was no exception.\nGnome wanted his luck back. And so, a shakespearean drama began\u2026\nCloud is Gnome's dangerous companion in this long journey across the Forest of the Deep Blue Sky. She has several skills, among those known by mortals one can find:\nKill Gnome: You'll have to be in constant movement to avoid Cloud's lightnings. If not, poor Gnome.\nDon't stop! Don't Stop! Ouch!\nTake care of  enemies: If you manage to avoid lightnings, the next step is to use them at your favor. Those bolts will take care of any unfriendly creature that you may cross.\nCloud, the badass companion\nBring light to dark places: You know abominable creatures live in the dark. Luckily, Cloud's Lightning bolts produce enough light to keep shadowy places visible. For short time spans though.\nCloud can be helpful in dark places.\nTurn machines on: Those same lightnings that kill you can be used to power up machines that need electricity. You'll find several of these across your journey.\nIt's alive! It's alive!\nSet stuff on fire: Sometimes you'll need to get a little aggressive with the environment to find your way. Cloud's bolts will set several things on fire when hit.\nYour log is on fire! \u266b\nThere is an old version of Nubarron that was made in pixel-art. We took that path mostly because the whole idea was to make a homage to the 8-bit era.\nIn this new instance we completely changed the aesthetics for a digital-painting art style, but following more traditional techniques from the romantic period, like Caspar David Friedrich, making emphasis on the idea that our little adventurer is traversing imposing natural environments, surrounded with life and mistery.\nBesides this we've been influenced by some of the greatest indie games. Limbo provided us a reference on playing with silhouettes and oppressive ambiance. Journey was awesome at creating visual emotion moments. \nEach environment is unique and every detail is going to be present only once if you happen to see it.\nThe Forest of the Deep Blue Sky is an amazing fantasy world full of creatures, stories and gorgeous landscapes.\nBelow are some of the early concepts that Juan created to start giving shape to this magical world.\nAnd there is also Nubarron Diaries:\nNubaron Diaries, the log created by our own researcher traveling the world of Nubarron.\n We're all big fans of indie games. We love when they reach a great balance between quality, innovation and artistic expression. These three features are the pivot points of how we see game development should be done.\nAmong several indie games that we love, these three had special influence on us:\nLIMBO's ambience, lights and layered design gave us a lot to think about in the artistic side.\nJourney's conceptual and emotional nature, mood and deepness got us thinking about making our games more meaningful both to us and the players.\nBraid's clever game design was a major player in helping us create and combine Cloud's mechanics.\nWe like to think of Nubarron as a combination of what we found interesting in these games with a new setting and our own look at what videogames should be.\nWe're a young full stack independent game development team from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Our most profound wish is to create deep experiences that not only connect with players through gameplay but also in an emotional and more artistic way.\nAll of us worked individually in several games projects in the past, but we consolidated as a team about a year ago.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe world of Nubarron is vast, we want it to have a lot of content, besides the game itself.

Dozer - Stretch Goal\nUpdate #30 BEDLAM Boss Battle - Stretch Goal\nBEDLAM is a strategic single-player roguelike turn-based role-playing game, created for the PC and Mac utilizing 'The Banner Saga' engine.\nThe player is cast as the mysterious Mechanic, the last known member of a once-thriving guild of brilliant inventors, intrepid travelers and operators of the rolling fortresses called Dozers.\nAs the Mechanic, you are in charge of commanding your crew in battles, managing your resources, improving your Dozer, interacting with various characters, and protecting your passengers while navigating through the post-apocalyptic wasteland known as Bedlam.\nThink you have what it takes? Then grab the controls, equip your Dozer, load your passengers, assemble your diverse battle-ready crew and prepare for your journey to a new destination on the far edge of Bedlam!\nRemember \u2013 One chance and one crew to make it through!\nOur unique blitz battle system! Turn-based combat with swift play, over-the-top animations, action point based movement and attack system, environments and battles that gradually affect your team, crew-buffing Dozer upgrades, and tide-changing Dozer weapons!\nBattlefield Equalizers that affect overall movement and attack strategy.\nRandomly generated world! Unpredictable environments!\nRoguelike influences and RPG features, including randomly generated encounters and discoveries, meaningful permadeath, three different supplies to manage, crew veteran rankings and incredible replay value.\nDozers, the gargantuan rolling fortresses covered in armor and weapons to protect passengers and crew during the journey through Bedlam.\nFour class-based crew member types: Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle and Melee all with their own strengths, weaknesses, movement and attack ranges.\nFour unique enemy factions: Marauders, Mutants, Cyborgs and the A.I. - all with their own appearances and behaviors.\nEvolving Crew -- battle survivors will evolve into Elite and Veteran units!\n\u201cDouble-Down\u201d (a New game+): Travel back through Bedlam for the opportunity to defeat merciless overlord King Viscera and his minions for untold riches... or the sacrifice of everything!\nYour goal is to travel from the futuristic metropolis of Bysantine through the chaotic realm of Bedlam to reach the rumored utopia of Aztec City with as many of your passengers and crew intact as possible.\nYou will constantly consume supplies as you travel across Bedlam. Meat, Metal and Crude are what you will need to keep your passengers fed, your Dozer repaired and your engines running. These critical resources can be collected through random events, salvaged from defeated enemies, or received after completing quests or prevailing in battles.\nBut keep in mind that all territories, Points of Interest, NPCs and events are randomly generated at the start of each new game, encouraging multiple playthroughs for a fresh experience each time! We want to focus on the fun of finding something different in every game. The unpredictability of Bedlam is both its biggest challenge and its greatest appeal!\nIf you successfully navigate through Bedlam, you will be given an option to \"Double-Down\". This is the BEDLAM version of a New Game+ (unlockable video game mode), offering a chance to transport your crew and Dozer (with all upgrades and weapons) back across Bedlam for subsequent journeys - but remember, it's double-or-nothing!\nUpdate #10 goes into detail about the gameflow of BEDLAM!\nCheck out these jaw-dropping, ear-melting BEDLAM tunes composed by none other than Kevin Riepl (GEARS OF WAR)!\n* Hit play and continue reading to get the whole BEDLAM experience!\n\"Drifters\" by Kevin Riepl\n \"Marauders!\" by Kevin Riepl\nOur battle system is called blitz because the battles are swift, aggressive and intense \u2013 it\u2019s an all-out attack from the very beginning! Opposition beware!\nThe battles in BEDLAM will offer plenty of depth and variety! A battlefield is similar to a chessboard, with an isometric view and each opposing side taking turns. Battlefields can be a variety of sizes and many special battles will take place on larger or irregular-sized boards. Certain battlefields will also feature protective cover, making every battle different!\nDuring a turn, each side has two action points to expend. Because there is no forced character turn-order or action order, these action points can be used in many ways. During each turn, you will decide which crew member(s) to move and/or attack, or which Dozer Upgrade or Weapon to use. Each turn gets you closer to ultimately destroying the enemy and overcoming that territory!\nYou also have the option of retreat! It just depends on how much of your crew and resources you are willing to risk versus the possible rewards you could acquire!\nA significant strategic element during combat is the inclusion of battlefield Equalizers! These items and objects are randomly inserted onto battlefields and can take many forms: atomic waste barrels, dead creatures, scrap containers, vendetta contraptions, or even packages of coveted resources! Some Equalizers can be used as temporary cover, but you\u2019ll need to be cautious as they can also be destroyed by incoming weapon fire, resulting in the loss of any valuables they might hold!\nIn order to gather the riches that may result from various Equalizers, you will need to maneuver a crew member to that position -- which means weighing the risk of those rewards against coming under attack from foes. The caveat is that you must collect these bonus items BEFORE each battle ends!\nYOUR BATTLE CREW\nYour Battle Crew is the first and last line of defense against the hostile enemies that roam the wasteland trying to claim territories throughout Bedlam, threatening the progress of your Dozer and the safety of your passengers. Your crew can be deployed in teams of up to six members, including one Elite or Veteran.\nCrew member death is permanent! Those who survive will gain higher levels of experience and status, allowing them to equip deadlier weapons against the ferocious enemies in Bedlam!\nCREW MEMBER CLASSES\nFrontliner (Melee)\nThe Melee class is both the sturdiest and most agile combatant, ready to dash directly into hand-to-hand combat and inflict punishment as well as absorb it. Another strategic use of a Melee combatant is to treat them as a human shield for more vulnerable Rifle crew members.\nTrencher (Shotgun)\nAs the close-combat weapon specialists on the Dozer crew, the Shotgun class is fairly resilient and packs whopping firepower when the enemy is near, but is much less effective at a distance.\nGunslinger (Pistol)\nThe Pistol class is a great balanced soldier with moderate endurance, movement and weapon range. These hand-cannon hotshots are also the only class with run-and-gun ability.\nDeadeye (Rifle)\nThe long-distance engagement expert in your crew, the Rifle class has the lowest health and movement range but also deals the greatest damage at the furthest distance. These sharpshooters are integral to any good battle plan and should be protected!\nELITES\nA variety of Elite characters from various Factions can be discovered and recruited during your travels through Bedlam... or they can be promoted from existing crew members through in-game events.\nOver time, as crew members survive brutal battles and toxic environments, their bodies may show signs of heavy physical damage or radiation effects. These are tracked by meters on each crew member, and when the corresponding levels reach a certain plateau, you will have a chance to convert that crew member to an Elite class as a Cyborg or Mutant!\nCyborgs are considered a \u201cHeavy Weapons\u201d class, which has greater health and inflicts more damage. Mutants are the \u201cMega Melee\u201d class that can deliver a tremendous amount of melee brutality, but also has access to powerful grenades and healing abilities.\nIf you decide not to convert your crew member into a Cyborg or Mutant, they will remain human and have the opportunity to reach the coveted Veteran Status... if they can survive long enough!\nVETERANS\nThese tried-and-true crew members have survived more battles and seen more horrors than they\u2019d care to remember. They have shunned ALL cyborg enhancements or biological improvements and have embraced their own humanity as the strongest weapon in their arsenal. These rare and legendary characters live by their own rules, and can help turn the tide of battle in an instant!\nYou can usually only have ONE Veteran or Elite crew member on the battlefield at any time, so choose your team wisely!\nDOZER UPGRADES\nDozer upgrades are technologies that can be purchased through NPCs, discovered by exploring locations, or acquired after successfully negotiating a hostile situation. You never know what you'll find on any given playthrough!\nDozer Upgrades (like the Dreadhound Kennel above) can be used during battle with major effects, giving your crew members various buffs and powers, calling in reinforcements, or even raising the dead! Possible upgrades and technologies include an Alchemist laboratory, robotic research department, nuclear engines, science facility, cloning vats, agricultural center, meat processing plant and sick bay.\nUpdate #3 has more information about Dozer Upgrades!\nDOZER WEAPONS\nLast but not least are the devastating Dozer weapons that can be discovered during your journey through Bedlam. Only a single weapon can be installed on your Dozer at a time, and each has a specific impact and recharge timer. Spin up the Gatling cannons to deal vicious area-of-effect damage, or trigger a laser strike to blaze a lethal line of light across the battle board! \nDuring your navigation through Bedlam, these primary Dozer weapons can also unlock inaccessible areas if you have the proper tool for the job -- with lasers equipped, you could cut through a crashed spaceship's hull to search for extraterrestrial technologies, while missiles could demolish that landslide blocking your path, revealing a new route through Bedlam.\nWhile forming a battle strategy, you must factor crew member positions, relative health of all friend and foe combatants, control of key battle board areas, crew-impacting Dozer upgrades and, of course, the primary Dozer weapon.\nIf you plan your battles effectively, triumph is assured! On the other hand, a few wrong choices could result in grisly death... and once a crew member falls in combat, they are lost for the remainder of the game (\"permadeath\"). The wasteland is a cruel and unforgiving place!\nSuccessful outcomes in battle earn resources that can be used for barter, upgrades, or Dozer improvements. However, enemy victory can result in game failure \u2014 a Dozer is defeated once its armor is obliterated or when all passengers and crew are eliminated, sending you back to the beginning for a fresh start.\nThe realm of Bedlam is the result of the catastrophic clashes of black science that caused the Barren Age... and the impact of those terrible wars still linger after centuries.\nCivilization survived and ultimately flourished in the spectacular walled metropolis of Bysantine... but as this technological marvel begins to fall victim to overcrowding, class distinction, corporate conflict and organized crime, there is a new hope in the distant utopia of Aztec City!\nYour travels through Bedlam may take you into tachyon mists that can distort time before your very eyes, hallucinogenic squalls that can present literally unreal threats, alternate-dimensional bleeds that can drop legendary parallel-reality champions into battle with (or against) you, or ancient necrotech that can reanimate the skeletal remains of long-fallen warriors... with a vengeance!\nThe unpredictable environment can even affect battles. Because of Bedlam's constantly fluctuating climate, your combatants may have to fight during blinding blizzards of crimson ash, near patches of homicidal vegetation, or in confounding fields of X-ray wavelengths. Or a corrosive enzyme cyclone could suddenly swirl through the middle of an encounter, which may prompt the enemy (or your own crew) to flee or risk molecular degeneration!\nTemporal anomalies, freak storms, bone soldiers and deadly apparitions? It's no exaggeration to say that anything can happen in these bizarre lands -- Bedlam truly earned its namesake!\nRandom Events\nYour path through Bedlam will take you through a series of Faction-controlled territories, and your Dozer traverses each of these areas by navigating and visiting separate Points of Interest.\nArriving at a Point of Interest may lead to a Boomtown -- settlements like Gluttonhold and Trudgefoot dotting the charred domain -- or you could be sent immediately into battle with the dominant Faction of the territory. But it could also initiate a Random Event, delivered to you via NPCs through the Dozer's Communications Window.\nKing Viscera\nThe massive and merciless tormenter who proclaims himself the overlord of Bedlam, King Viscera is known mostly for his fearsome blood-streaked armor and complete lack of compunction.\nThough he rarely handles matters personally, he dispatches his infamous (and particularly vicious) patrols to eliminate his competition, harass the denizens of independent Boomtowns, and generally disrupt any semblance of peace. All the while, he scours the blackened sands of Bedlam for valuable artifacts to help him gain the dominating power he seeks. During your journey through Bedlam, you will become keenly aware of King Viscera's notoriety. And there's a very good chance you will encounter his scouting parties, because despite the expanse of Bedlam, it would be all but impossible to hide your rolling fortress from his attention... and it's just the kind of thing he would desire.\nBut will you also have the opportunity (or misfortune) to actually face him? Even the mighty Dozer may not provide protection if you cross his path or draw his wrath!\nSimply put, we want to be completely in control of both the design and execution of the game! We at Skyshine have all spent years working at large companies, which in turn have large publishers behind them - and it is always the same story. The publisher will flex its muscles and insist the game design bends to 'current trends', while demanding the game ships on their schedule (even when it's not ready) just to meet quarterly numbers. Been there, done that! Now it is our turn!\nBut... we need your help! So we are asking you for your support in raising enough money (or more) to escape the metaphorical shackles and bring to market our vision of BEDLAM!\nKickstarter also empowers us to go directly to you, the gamers who love to play role-playing games, to get your support, input and feedback that would normally be impossible.

It features a blend of facility management and real time strategy mechanics that creates a unique experience quite unlike other games in its genre.\nIn Basement, you play as a great scientist that has to do not-exactly-legal stuff underground, as nobody wants to support his idea. Basement is all about management. You build your own enterprise producing and researching drugs. Find the right place, build production rooms, hire workers and security staff, avoid federal agents and raise the most effective company.\nGameplay overview\nProducing and selling \u2018drugs\u2019 is the core gameplay. At the beginning of each level, you have access to a few production rooms - each producing a single type of \u2018drug\u2019. You organize raw materials, assign scientists to the proper rooms, and finally create specific drugs, which you need to sell to particular customers.\nTo keep your business running, you should hire workers and pay them their salary. If you don't pay them weekly, production will go down, and then you even may be sabotaged or completely lose all employees.\nWith the rise of your enterprise, federal agents become interested in you. They'll start with rare inspections.\nDepending on your rough behaviour, inspections may become more frequent and severe; DEA, FBI, and something much more dangerous will come knocking at your door...\nYou need to find the right balance and develop an optimal strategy to grow and flourish your dusky business. You can research new \u2018still legal\u2019 drugs, or escalate manufacturing powers. You can bother with security, hiring guards and building traps in your basement. You can even hide your basement behind a bar or any other legal establishment. Each cover has its advantages.\nEven if you have an ideal production line, where everything is well secured, you won't be able to relax. The world is ever changing and unpredictable. You may come up short with a supply, or an accidental market change can make your product unwanted; any production room can burst into flames! What else can happen? No one knows!\nSometimes you need to do something pleasant for yourself. Why not gather a large collection of luxury cars? Completing VIP customers\u2019 requests will grant you them.\nAnd most importantly, you should understand that you're in illegal activities - sooner or later, you'll be jailed. Get ready.\nWe created this concept during the Ludum Dare 29 game jam, just this past spring. The main theme of the competition was \u201cBeneath The Surface\u201d. Basement seemed like a great idea. There was a whole city above the surface, with shops, caf\u00e9s, and churches. Everything is fine and dandy there, above ground. Everything underground is the opposite. There are criminals and dangerous situations. We\u2019ve integrated this idea into a game.\nThe playable prototype was created in two days during the contest. It is great to know that it is still being played around the world. As a result, we also came 11th place out of more than 2500 projects overall, and got lots of requests to finish this game. So, we are seriously going to do this!\nBasement\u2019s atmosphere is very dark \u2013 we needed a soundtrack that perfectly emphasizes and represents the \u2018pharmaceutical underworld\u2019. We were fortunate enough to team up with The Otherworld Agency, who brought in Matt Mclean to compose the original soundtrack.\nMatt Mclean (A.K.A. feeding | ear) is an award-winning composer and producer from Australia, whose music has been praised internationally. Matt\u2019s dark, complex electronic style has been widely regarded as infectious and aurally mesmerizing \u2013 perfect for Basement.\nThe requirements are all subject to change. We're doing our best to accommodate as many machines as possible, but with our currently limited testing we're unsure of what the final requirements will be.\n\nOS: Windows (XP/Vista/7), MacOS, or Linux\nProcessor: 2GHz Core 2 Duo\nMemory: 512 MB \nGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 Support, 256 MB (dedicated card preferred)\nMinimum Resolution: 1280 x 720\nThe core team was founded in 2013 by former Nival employees. When we started Halfbus, we set a goal - make games as we see them, not paying attention to current market trends. If we weren\u2019t 100% interested by a project or passionate about it, then we wouldn\u2019t develop it.\n If you want to know more about our team, here is few interview with us.\n(English) http://blog.xsolla.com/2014/09/29/halfbus-how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-indie-game-in-minsk/\n(English) http://www.counterfrag.com/basement/\n(Russian) http://tech.onliner.by/2014/10/15/basement-game-by-halfbus\n(Russian) http://blog.xsolla.ru/2014/09/09/halfbus-basement-interview/\n(Italian) http://pixelflood.it/crowdfunding/basement-intervista-agli-sviluppatori\nProject supporter. You'll receive a postcard designed and signed by developers! Also you\u2019ll get access to our closed forum thread for backers only.\nDRM-free copy of the game for PC, Mac and Linux, at a lower price available only through this Kickstarter, including game Steam key if it beats Greenlight! Previous reward is included.\nGet reward above and an exclusive kickstarter-only game build with additional content, including in-game VIP prison cell.\nGet reward above plus cool stickers with game characters.\nGet reward above plus a game soundtrack from Matt Mclean!\nGet reward above plus a big Basement poster for your room and access to a closed beta where you can play development versions and help us improve the game.\nGet reward above plus. Plus four copies of the game for you and your friends. Also all your friends will get access to closed beta!\nFor the most creative bakers! We'll collaborate with you to create a new game event that can happen to characters. This could be a new sort of incident in the production, a different style of raid, or a trader offering a strange bargain. Or, whatever else you can think of!\nTactical battles\nA new game mechanic that'll make city mode more dynamic and interesting. From now on, it's not just loading the truck with goods and sending it to the nearest spot. Sometimes, your runner could be intercepted by cops or gangs who control a selected district. Here is the new fighting mode. Truck escort under your control should protect goods you're delivering. Attack, use special abilities, or maybe drugs from the truck.\nNew platforms\nWe've got lots of feedback from you that is very appreciated, and there were lots of requests to make a version for mobile devices. We checked our current design and abilities, and decided that the game would perfectly fit tablets. As we use Unity, it won't take long for us to make iOS, Android, and Windows 8/8.1 builds. But please keep in mind that the App Store has very strict rules for content. For now, we can't guarantee that the game will pass moderation on the App Store, but after checking all the rules in the documentation, we didn't find any implicit reasons for our game to be rejected.\nNew localization\nAlso we wanted our game to be available for as many people as possible. We understand that not everyone is comfortable playing the game in English only, and lots of people want to see Basement in their native language. Localization is a quite costly process, so we set it as a long-term goal. Please tell us in the comments as to which language(s) you would prefer, and we'll try to adjust our plan. Currently, we want to add Spanish, German, and French.\nWe are launching this kickstarter company with one main reason - to give you more \u2018deep\u2019 gameplay. We have many interesting things to realize: creating \u2018research graphs\u2019 and the city map; developing character and room upgrades, etc. There will be much more than what you see in the trailer. We specifically left blank space in the overall design, so that we can work with you - our players. All our backers will get access to a closed Forum thread, with an ability to vote for features and suggest new ones!\nAll of this won\u2019t be possible without your help.\n\nAlso, you may be wondering, \u201cWhy do you need our money?\u201d When we quit our jobs last year, we intended to work on a small project for a few months. During development, we received such overwhelmingly positive feedback that we changed our plans. We decided to pursue developing Basement into a finished quality game. However, releasing a game requires money, and our funds are starting to drain. Your generous pledges will go towards:\nSounds and Music: The biggest, and most important expense \u2013 A professional musician who helps to bring life and atmosphere to the game. The sounds, music, and ambiance must be perfect! Matt Mclean and The Otherworld Agency bring their talent and expertise to Basement and really bring the game to life.\nSoftware licenses: Unity Pro and some plugins that we want to use.\nBusiness Costs: there are basic costs for setting up a company.\nIn addition, there are some fees for Kickstarter and Amazon, and part of the money will be spent on producing the backer rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge is executing our large vision of the game in the limited time that we have. To achieve this, we're relying on our experience and passion.\n\nNext risk is development delays. It happens. We've all seen it. Our plan to combat this is by offering alpha/beta access to you all, so that you will be able to play the game, regardless of delays.\n\nAnd last, but not least, the main risk is failure to receive funding. If this is the result, we can't bring to the game all features that we want, and it will end up being much smaller due to the limited amount of finances that we have. So, we hope for your support.

The black vacuum of space has taken its toll, and hope for finding a new home wears thin.

Lauren has won multiple competitions for both screenwriting, playwriting, and her short stories. Beyond film and television, she has a love for anime, video games, and voice acting. The live-action adaptation of the parody Attack on Space is an endeavor that will allow Lauren to combine all mediums of the entertainment industry she loves. \nMarco Bottiligeri (Director) is a nationally acclaimed, young director who began filming when he was five. With experience and determination beyond his years, Marco\u2019s films and music videos have been screened and televised internationally. \u201cAn actor\u2019s director,\u201d as some have called him, Marco values the relationships he builds with his actors on set to bring out the very best in their performances.

Composing for audio projects such as Attack on Space and featured in VSauce, Nathanael joined our team to produce a high quality, original soundtrack for Attack on Space: Live Action. \nCreating a short film is not an inexpensive process.\nWhile AoS:LA is a non-profit project which will be accessible online for free, the genre of science-fiction is not an inexpensive realm to produce in. While we have reduced the costs associated with the production of this film primarily through having crew members donate their time, there is still a great deal that is left for us to cover.\nThe current budget for a ten to fifteen minute short film adaptation of Attack on Space is $35,000. A rough breakdown of our budget is as follows:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is ambitious for any film crew. The struggles that we experienced while producing the promo boiled down to cost. We have the know-how to make this type of film, but we lack the monetary resources to execute our vision as we see it. That's not to say we are all-knowing; what we are unfamiliar with we will supplement with the guidance of industry professionals to ensure a streamlined production.\n\nThe content of this film presents obstacles. The reason students normally avoid producing sci-fi is due to demands inherent in producing a work within the genre. There are many elements necessary in producing sci-fi, and each aspect demands the highest quality of resources and effort. There is little room for error, and there's no way to cut corners without the audience noticing.\n\nDespite all of this, we have already produced a promotional pilot to demonstrate that this is possible, and that we are capable.

Check out our website at www.nevermindgame.com for the latest updates on the project and details on how to get the game when it launches!\n3 DAYS TO GO: Randy Pitchford Offers His Support!\nAmong all the amazing tweets and messages we've seen over the past few days on social media, we were thrilled to see Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford (of Borderlands fame) offer his support for Nevermind, noting:\nRemember: When you back Nevermind, you are not only supporting our ability to create a unique biofeedback horror game, you are also helping to open the door for a wide variety of uniquely compelling biofeedback-driven experiences moving forward!\nJoin us today! Help us forge the future!\nNevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced horror adventure game that takes you into the dark and twisted world within the subconscious minds of psychological trauma victims.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nAs you explore surreal labyrinths and solve the puzzles of the mind, a biofeedback sensor monitors how scared or stressed you become with each passing moment. If you let your fears get the best of you, the game becomes harder. If you\u2019re able to calm yourself in the face of terror, the game will be more forgiving.\nNevermind\u2019s goal is to create an unforgettable gameplay experience that also teaches players how to be more aware of their unique internal responses to stressful situations. If you can learn to control your anxiety within the disturbing realm of Nevermind, just imagine what you can do when it comes to those inevitable stressful moments in the real world\u2026\nFor more info, check out this playthrough of the original proof of concept of Nevermind by Markiplier!\nWARNING: Some of the content in this video depicts intense imagery and situations relating to the psychological trauma experienced by a fictional character. This video and all Nevermind content in general, may upset, disturb, and act as a trigger for some viewers/players. As always, your discretion is advised.\nBack in February 2014, we launched a Kickstarter for Nevermind in the hope that it would let us make the first biofeedback-enhanced horror game a reality. Although we didn\u2019t end up hitting our funding goal (we came close!), our campaign got the attention of the fine folks over at Intel, who approached us about creating Nevermind to support their new Intel\u00ae RealSense\u2122 camera technology.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nFast forward to October, and Intel has provided us with the support to make an incredible experience for PCs leveraging the RealSense camera. This includes raising the quality bar for the game, creating two brand new levels, and supporting their new RealSense camera technology (which can detect your heart rate using only their camera).\nThis has been HUGE for us. We\u2019ve been able to use the funding to hire a team, secure a small studio space, get the equipment we need, and really dig into making Nevermind a reality. For that, we can\u2019t thank Intel enough!\nThat said, this is just the beginning -- there is SO much more we want to do with Nevermind to realize its full potential!\nOur dream for Nevermind has always been to provide as much game as possible for as many platforms as we can so you don\u2019t have to invest in additional biofeedback hardware.\nIf this new Kickstarter is successfully funded, it will allow us to create the following:\nINCREASED DEVICE SUPPORT\nAlthough we already support the Intel RealSense camera and the Garmin Heart Rate Chest Strap, we want to support EVEN MORE ways in which we can track your Heart Rate data, including potential solutions such as:\nWild Divine Iom Sensor\nApple Watch\nAffectiva Affdex software (no new hardware needed)\nIntel BioSport Headphones\nIntel Basis Peak Smartwatch\nThe Dash\nMio LINK\nThis is by no means a complete list, but rather a subset of devices we would like to support. The more prominent the device, the higher it will be on our list!\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nYou may notice that this time around we didn\u2019t include a biofeedback sensor reward tier option. That is because we\u2019re hoping to find a way to provide a solution that doesn\u2019t require *any* additional hardware (or, minimally, support as many existing hardware options as possible). In brief, we don\u2019t want you to spend $100 on a chest strap that you may not even need!\nMAC VERSION\nWe know many of you out there are Mac users -- we want to make sure that you are able to play Nevermind (with sensor support) as well!\nOCULUS RIFT INTEGRATION\nWe\u2019re HUGE believers in the potential of the Oculus Rift to change immersive experiences as we know them. Furthermore, games like Nevermind are uniquely equipped to capitalize on some of the most compelling elements that virtual experiences like Oculus have to offer. For example, imagine a horror game that plays with the fact that we know exactly what is/isn\u2019t in your peripheral vision. We can\u2019t WAIT to bring Nevermind to Oculus, including tuning all existing content to suit the technology.\nXBOX ONE VERSION\nAlthough the game would be primarily played with the controller, the Xbox One's basic Kinect 2.0 comes with built-in biofeedback technology just waiting to be tapped into! This was one of our most common requests from the first Kickstarter campaign, and we have gotten TONS of great support from the folks at ID@XBOX. We have the kits - now we just need the funding to make it happen!\nNOTE: For those of you that don\u2019t own an Xbox One, this version will minimally help us generate additional revenue, which will - in turn - be poured back into making more great level content for Nevermind!\nNEW LEVELS AND MORE!\nLastly, we want to create more great content for Nevermind. Even with the new levels from Intel, we are only scratching the surface of the breadth of ideas and topics that we want to tackle with Nevermind. Trauma affects us all in so many ways that we often don\u2019t realize -- with Nevermind, we have a unique opportunity to use our surreal, immersive canvas to shed light on psychological trauma in a manner other media can\u2019t.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nNaturally, all of us are pretty excited about Nevermind and its potential - but don\u2019t just take our word for it. Here is just some of the press coverage we received with just our early proof of concept version!\nAs seen in: Kotaku, Polygon, Huffington Post, Fox News Business, Upworthy, GameTrailers, Joystiq, IGN, GameInformer, WiredUK, GamesBeat, FastCompany, PCGamer, KillScreen, BloodyDisgusting, GizMag, PSFK, Rock, Paper, Shotgun and many more!\n\u201cThis sounds super cool, if you ask me.\u201d - Kirk Hamilton, Kotaku \n\"And it works. Not only was the game obviously tuned to my emotional state, by the end of the journey I found myself pausing and taking a deep breath to slow my heart rate and more calmly tackle the nightmares that confronted me.\" - Brian Crecente, Polygon\n\u201cIt\u2019ll play a bit like a free-roaming version of Myst, but with the scare factor of Slender and the visual aesthetic of a Nine Inch Nails video directed by Kyle Cooper of Se7en\u2019s title sequence fame. You know, the stuff bad dreams are made of.\u201d - Will Johnston, Xbox One Gamer Magazine\n\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in seeing this game come to [...] Xbox One, fund it. If you support indie game developers, fund it. If you love horror, fund it. Hell, if you just take games seriously and think that they have more applications than just fun and random bits of escapism, fund it. I did.\u201d - Jonathan Gronli, Technology Tell \nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nBy popular demand, we removed most of our physical tiers and instead made them add-ons!

Unfortunately, Early Access will not be available for Xbox One players.\nXBOX ONE: Due to Xbox Live constraints, our number of Xbox One codes may be limited. If this is the case, codes will be granted to backers on a first come, first served basis.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nNEVERMIND SOUNDTRACK\nA digital download of the full Nevermind soundtrack for the final game composed by Derek Baird, including EXCLUSIVE tracks only available to Kickstarter Backers.\nDIGITAL ART BOOK\nA digital PDF of the Nevermind Art Book containing 40+ pages of concepts, sketches and commentary from the development of the game, including unused materials.\nBE IMMORTALIZED IN NEVERMIND\nYou will be prominently immortalized in Nevermind!\n\nOnce the campaign is over, we will provide a full list of all of the locations in game where your name and/or likeness can manifest in game, and you will be able to select your preferred option on a first-come, first-served basis -- so get your pledge in quickly to reserve the spot of your choice!\n\nExamples include:\nNeurostalgia Welcome Hall - Become a permanent part of Nevermind history! That could be YOU cutting the ribbon in the framed photo of the opening day ceremony, YOUR face amongst the opulent Founders oil paintings, or YOUR name forever etched into a donor plaque for every new Neuroprober to see!\nFellow Neuroprobers - Have your name listed on the handful of other Neuroprober offices in the institute!\nPatient Mindscapes - Each mindscape presents several opportunities for names to be woven into the world. Perhaps you were a friend or a family member, or perhaps you authored a book, the title of which serves as a clue to a puzzle. The sky is the limit! \nNEVERMIND T-SHIRT (LIMITED EDITION)\nA unique Nevermind T-shirt that will be designed and printed ONLY for Kickstarter Backers.\nMore T-Shirt designs will be made available depending on how popular this reward ends up being!\nHARDCOVER ART BOOK (SIGNED)\nA physical, hardcover edition of the Nevermind Art Book from the folks at Blue Canvas (makers of The Art of Journey) containing 40+ pages of concepts, sketches and commentary from the development of the game (including unused materials) - signed by the team!\nMockup of final printed Art Book\nHARDCOVER ART BOOK (PERSONALIZED)\nAs above, but also personalized via a unique creepy doodle by Erin!\n\nRELIC IN THE HALL OF FEARS\n(PLUS A SKETCH OF YOUR OWN PERSONAL FEAR)\nThere is a special room in the Neurostalgia institute dedicated to chronicling fear and trauma triggers of past patients. If you support us at this level, you will be asked to provide us a list of your fears (the more unique the better!) and we will create a unique \u201crelic\u201d statue in the final game dedicated to your fear! (final content subject to creative discretion of the dev team)\n\nUpon completion of the campaign, we\u2019ll send out a survey to all backers to get a list of your fears. We will do our best to accommodate as many of your first requests as possible, but it is likely that SOME fears will be shared amongst backers. That said, regardless of the final statue, you will receive a unique, one-of-a-kind sketch by Erin representing your fear!\nNOTE: Each fear sketch will be unique, but each in-game model MAY be shared.\nUNIQUE POSTCARD DRAWING BY ERIN\nA unique, Nevermind inspired hand-illustrated postcard-sized piece by Erin!\nORIGINAL CONCEPT PAINTING\nYou will be able to choose one of a variety of original concept art pieces (primarily paintings). Backers will get to choose on a first come, first served basis. Pieces will range in size - 4x5 inches and up!\nNevermind is - at its core - an adventure game (in the spirit of classic games like Myst), where you must explore strange worlds and solve puzzles to unlock the terrifying mystery that lurks within each patient\u2019s inner psyche. \nIn Nevermind, you are a Neuroprober at the Neurostalgia Institute - a unique physician of the not-too-distant future who, through the use of cutting-edge technology, is able to venture into the minds of psychological trauma victims for whom traditional treatment methods have proved ineffective.\nPhotos represent the patient's memories - discover and collect them to ultimately solve the mystery locked within their mind. (all gameplay is \"Work in Progress\" content)\nAs such, each \u201clevel\u201d in Nevermind takes place within the surreal subconscious of one of these victims. Your goal is to explore the often dark and twisted world within, solving abstract puzzles as you recover fragments of memories (represented by photographs) surrounding the traumatic event. \nTraumatic experiences, especially those left untreated, take their toll in countless ways, often triggering other serious problems as the victim\u2019s subconscious desperately tries to cope. As a result, the patient\u2019s mind doesn\u2019t take kindly to those who attempt to peel back these layers, often prompting it to lash out in terrifying, unexpected ways.\nOnly the most vigilant of Neuroprobers can survive the horrors of the mind to help their patient find peace at last. \nCan you?\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nNevermind uses biofeedback technology to detect your Heart Rate Variability while playing. When you start to become scared or anxious, the game will dynamically respond to your stress levels, which in turn directly affects gameplay.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nNevermind currently supports both the Intel RealSense camera and the off-the-shelf Garmin Heart Rate Monitor strap (similar to what one would use for exercise).  Nonetheless, our goal is to support as many hardware devices as possible to ensure every player has the opportunity to use a low cost, multi-function biofeedback device to \u201cenjoy\u201d the true Nevermind experience.\nNO HARDWARE? NO PROBLEM.\nAlthough the biofeedback element takes Nevermind to the next level, you can always play Nevermind without ANY biofeedback hardware and still have a great time. In the absence of hardware technology, we use secondary responsive cues (such as camera and player movement) to emulate the biofeedback experience.\nOne exciting facet of Nevermind is its potential to serve as a full-fledged therapeutic tool for those who struggle with challenges - mild or severe - relating to stress, anxiety, PTSD, or other similar conditions. Although informal testing results have been promising thus far, we are excited to be in discussion as we speak with researchers who are eager to explore Nevermind's potential impact via rigorous clinical trials.\n\nAs a prime example of our passion to create \"games that give back\", one of our long-term goals is to craft a health-centric version of Nevermind specifically targeted to help actual patients develop tools to manage and ultimately overcome their conditions. Funding from this Kickstarter Campaign will help support these efforts.\n\nNevermind started as a 2012 MFA thesis project at USC\u2019s Interactive Media Program, led by industry veteran Erin Reynolds - who returned to academia to pursue new ways to create \u201cpositive\u201d games for traditional gaming audiences. After an academic year, Erin and the Nevermind student development team were able to create one fully-functional level - a proof of concept that demonstrated Nevermind\u2019s unique vision and the feasibility of the core technology.\nNevermind has since been featured in numerous festivals and conferences, and nominated for several awards for innovation and technical achievement, including at IndieCade, Games for Change, SIGGRAPH, Unity Unite Awards, and the Serious Games Showcase and Challenge.\nNOTE: We have temporarily disabled the link below due to some reports that browsers are errantly marking it as potential malware.

Check back soon and sorry for the inconvenience. \nInterested in experiencing Nevermind for yourself? Download the original (PC only) proof of concept of Nevermind for FREE! \nNOTE: This is a TWO YEAR OLD version of the game - it looks and plays MUCH better now! This demo contains a rough version of the Neurostalgia Clinic and one full level (~45-90 minutes of gameplay).\nIf you want to play the old demo with true biofeedback functionality, you will need to use a Garmin Heart Rate Chest strap ($35) and an ANT+ USB stick ($45).\nWARNING: Some of the content in this demo depicts intense imagery and situations relating to the psychological trauma experienced by a fictional character. This demo and all Nevermind content in general, may upset, disturb, and act as a trigger for some viewers/players. As always, your discretion is advised.\nNevermind is being built by Flying Mollusk - a small, multifaceted, close-knit team of experienced developers each dedicated to both supporting and pushing each other to create the immersive, polished, compelling experience that players deserve.\nFor more about Erin and her inspirations for Nevermind, check out this fantastic (and in-depth!) interview with Jonathan Holmes on the Destructoid 'Sup Holmes Podcast!\nAs a result of Intel\u2019s generous support to help get us started, every dollar you contribute to this Kickstarter will go directly into making our campaign goals a reality! Below is a brief breakdown of how our funding will shake out for our current goal (breakdown for stretch goals may vary):\n20% - Additional biofeedback sensor integration, R&D, and support (including support for Mac-friendly devices)\n20% - Oculus Rift development and support (mostly Engineering)\n20% - Xbox One / Kinect 2.0 integration, optimization and support (mostly Engineering)\n15% - Production, Design, and Art support as needed for aforementioned goals\n10% - Kickstarter and Amazon Fulfillment Fees\n10% - Taxes\n5% - Unfulfilled payments\nNOTE: This last entry is not an expense per se, but statistically ~5% of Kickstarter payments are never able to processed due to account issues, so alas, we need to take it into account.\nAll screenshots reflect \"Work In Progress\" content\nThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about Nevermind and it\u2019s potential to change the way we look at positive games, biofeedback technology, and horror games as a whole.\nJoin us in helping to make this revolutionary new experience a reality so we can share this game to help and entertain players around the world. We are extremely passionate about this opportunity, and all your support is hugely appreciated.\nHere's to continuing the journey ahead!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNevermind combines exciting, cutting-edge technology with the uniquely immersive experiences that video games have to offer. That said, much of this technology, has yet to be successfully integrated into a commercial video game. While we see this as an incredibly exciting challenge and are confident that we'll figure out solutions to any issues that arise (given our past experience with the proof of concept), it does present an element of uncertainty. \n\nIf we reach our funding goal, we will do everything in our power to research the current and future consumer-level biofeedback sensor options available. We will try our darnedest to make Nevermind as compatible as possible with as many sensors as possible - including sensors that are Mac-compatible, the Kinect 2.0 sensor, etc. However, at the end of the day, there is always a small chance that some of the sensor options available just won't work - and we won't know for certain until we have our hands on them and the dedicated time to deeply research them. It's a bit of a catch 22 because the Kickstarter funding will provide the resources necessary to this research and development, but it\u2019s also very likely that certain sensor options won't work as well as we'd like. \n\nIn particular, although we feel confident that we will be able to find at least one solution (both the Apple Watch and Affectiva Affdex software come to mind), we do not yet have a Mac-friendly biofeedback sensor solution fully tested.\n\nThe good news is that we already have one sensor fully working on Windows PC (the Garmin chest strap) and are in the process of integrating another sensor (the Intel RealSense 3D Camera). We've done a ton of research on other sensor options and wouldn't have launched this Kickstarter campaign if we weren't confident that there are many other very viable sensors out there just waiting to be hooked up to Nevermind.\n\nNonetheless, we want to make sure everyone is aware of the potential uncertainties of the adventure ahead!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Nevermind Merch!", "update_content": "Hi Everyone!\nGuess what?!

Check out this update.\nSome big names in games love our pitch!\nJerry Holkins of Penny-Arcade has some interesting stuff to say about Human Resources here.\n Want to destroy the world? Get in line.\nHuman Resources is a PC real-time strategy game that puts you in command of apocalyptic factions vying to conquer the drifting remains of a shattered Earth. Using humans as your resource, assemble giant armies to annihilate your foes, then feed the newly-cleansed Earthshards to your almighty leader. \nKey Features of Human Resources include: \nAsymmetrical factions! Play as ancient squid monsters from another dimension or as giant killer robots.\nInsanely huge battles! Command hundreds of units and conquer sprawling, fully destructible cities.\nBreathtaking visuals! A comic-inspired art style means the apocalypse has never looked so gorgeous.\nBlast from the past! The tone, character, and pacing of a Command & Conquer game mixed with the mammoth battles of an Annihilation game.\nThe Singularity is nigh. Newly-sentient automated factories churn out waves of giant robots, hell-bent on dismantling and recycling all of human civilization. The insect-like Machines can deploy into stationary modes, enhancing their shielding and firepower. They decimate their enemies with ranged energy weapons. \nThe humans invoke the tentacled Ancient Ones in a last-ditch effort to stem the Machine onslaught. This proves unwise. Now the Ancient Ones vie with the Machines to consume the last scraps of Earth. The Ancient Ones advance in fast-moving hordes, overwhelming their foes with fearsome melee attacks. An assortment of arcane spells and foul poisons rounds out their arsenal. \nWho knows what other factions may lurk in the void, waiting for the moment to strike? \nBattles unfold on floating fragments of Earth as they are ripped from the planet and pulled toward the waiting mouths of god-sized faction leaders. The cities that lie in your path are fully destructible, as is the terrain beneath them. Uproot buildings to use as clubs! Create mighty warriors that can cut the Earthshard in two! Bore giant holes through the ground! Summon your overlords to eat the whole thing!\nUp to eight players can duke it out on endlessly-varied procedural battlefields. Skirmish against up to seven AI adversaries on your own or fight multiple AI opponents alongside your friends. \nRandomly-generated terrain and cityscapes create new opportunities from battle to battle. A single game may encompass one or many Earthshards, crisscrossed by any number of human settlements. Unexpected bonus items lurk in randomly-generated structures throughout the battlefield, encouraging improvisation and risk-taking. \nHuman Resources\u2019 visual style is inspired by the clean color and precise linework of classic comic illustrators like Moebius, Herg\u00e9, and Geof Darrow. Clear silhouettes and easily-differentiated colors make it easy to navigate chaotic battlefields. We\u2019ve created a homebrew rendering system to make the apocalypse prettier than it\u2019s ever been before.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small-team environment. In 2010, Uber released its first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. Since then, we have released Super Monday Night Combat, Toy Rush, and Planetary Annihilation. \nPlanetary Annihilation was developed with the support of a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign (the Planetary Annihilation team will continue to support that project while a new team builds Human Resources). Having experienced the unprecedented creative control, autonomy, and IP ownership enabled by crowdfunding, we can\u2019t imagine going back to the old way of making games. With Kickstarter, we get to make the game we want, the way we want to make it -- and we get to work with you guys from day one. \nWith Planetary Annihilation, we think the results speak for themselves. The game is a beloved and critically lauded entry in the RTS canon, and we\u2019re extremely proud of it. Now we\u2019re ready to try something even more ambitious. \nHuman Resources evolves the powerful Planetary Annihilation engine to enable new innovations in gameplay, graphics, and world-building. We need your help -- not just as financial backers, but as partners who will shape key aspects of the game\u2019s design.  \nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on titles like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander, and Demigod. We are very passionate about RTS gaming and we can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\nJohn Comes - Lead Designer, Project Director\nJohn Comes has spent the better part of his 13 year professional career working on some of the biggest strategy titles out there. Titles like: Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth, Supreme Commander, Planetary Annihilation, and more. He wants to take this opportunity to combine all the best parts of all these games and incorporate them into one awesome experience. After all, he knows awesome! \nNate Simpson - Art Director\nNate Simpson\u2019s highlight reel includes Demigod, Supreme Commander 2, GoPets, and Starfleet Command 2. He also writes and draws Nonplayer, an Eisner Award-winning series published by Image Comics. His favorite games are Katamari Damacy and Shadow of the Colossus.

Planetary Annihilation has taught us a great deal about creating an executable timeline, designing deliverable rewards, and setting realistic goals.

One day she decides to run away, as she can\u2019t bear her duties as a future queen anymore.\nWhile playing Anya it\u2019s good to remember that each one of her spells applies a special debuff to the enemies it hits. It slows down an opponent and can be stacked up to three times. She can then use Ice Shatter to destroy all the stacks currently in play, dealing massive damage to all afflicted enemies. With Anya you can achieve the highest casting speed of all Warlocks thanks to her Freezing Slide skill, which reduces all her cooldowns. She is a very dynamic and powerful Warlock.\nSoul bound with an ancient creature, the last remaining Phoenix, Jake became a powerful Warlock. Even though he is not fully aware of his potential.\nJake is probably the easiest character to pick up for a new player. He doesn\u2019t need to execute any combos to deal damage and all his spells work very well on their own. The most popular of his skill builds is based on his Flame Rush, where he runs through or above enemy hordes leaving a trail of fire behind him and setting his enemies on fire. He can also protect himself with Fire Walls and then perform a moonwalk dancesummoning a Meteor Shower to crush his opponents. Jake brings mayhem and destruction to every \u2018versus mode\u2019 game.\nAfter shadow monsters had killed her sister, she sets on a journey to destroy the source of the Shadow virus once and for all.\nDue to her versatility Kheera is the most challenging character from the basic four to pick up. She can use a total of seven spells, instead of four. Each of her spells works with others for example: she can do a Knife Throw, Blink right next to her enemy silencing all nearby monsters, then cast Curse on that group of enemies, change to Defensive Stance and eject herself away to safety. All that before they manage to hit her. In co-op she may serve a support role for the rest of the team, thanks to her healing abilities and buffs.\nThese are only the first four characters. You will be unlocking the remaining six as you progress in the game\u2019s story.\nA world that is still fighting with the invasion. Here is where your adventure will begin.\nA destroyed world that witnessed the rise and fall of its once great race. You will need your wits to survive here.\nAn unexplored wild world filled with strange plants where you surely will not be welcomed.\nThese are only three of six of the worlds you will explore in the game.\nI wanted the music of Warlocks to be as badass and as fun as the gameplay, but more importantly, to be as varied and unique as the settings you explore and characters that inhabit those settings.\nThe soundtrack is rooted primarily in metal and electronica, combining heavy guitars and drums with synths and electronics, but will pull from many styles and influences as well, such as orchestral, folk, prog, fusion, and ambient. \n Each world you explore will have a unique musical identity; for example, the Greenfields, with its crumbling medieval ruins and cathedral, employs medieval instruments and tonality, whereas the Wasteland will be characterized by pounding industrial beats and glitchy synths. The sound design of the game will be effectively simple \u2013 expect to be fully immersed in the carnage you create as a rampaging warlock.\nExcitingly, each character will be fully voiced, and will have his or her own personality and backstory which will be reaveled through the interactions with the environment and the enemies one faces. In conclusion, the audio and music for Warlocks will be:\nbadass\nunique\nimmersive\n  Dushan Chaciej (game designer): 'Back in December 2013 I had played Risk of Rain for a few hours and got really excited about the idea of a \u201cRoR + wizards\u201d game. Since I was looking for a job at that time and had some free time I decided to fiddle with the idea.'\n'After a week I called it finished and forwarded it to a few friends to hear their thoughts. Turned out they liked it! Encouraged by the first wave of positive feedback I decided to put the game on the Internets - Gamejolt, IndieDB. The game had been downloaded by nearly three thousand people and to my surprise all the comments were positive. It was my first success and I was very happy that other gamers liked my work.'\nYou can download Risk of Death for free here and read a review here.\n'Afterwards it got even better - a wild artist appeared with a mock-up for a possible sequel. Wojtek happened to really dig Risk of Death freeware version! We then teamed up with my old friend Max and began working on Warlocks.'\n\u2018After a few months of working on the game after hours, in May 2014 we managed to showcase what was a very early version of Warlocks 'versus mode\u2019 to the public at Digital Dragons 2014. Tons of people passing by our stand gave the game a go. They loved the art style and the gameplay!\u2019\n'During the event we had met Radek from One More Level who also liked the game. We decided to join our forces in working on Warlocks.' \nRadek Ratusznik (game producer):\n'The next thing we wanted to do was to see if Warlocks had what it took to being truly great. The best way to do that was to go through Steam\u2019s \u2018Greenlight\u2019 program. We were very happy to learn that after two months of Steam\u2019s community positive feedback Warlocks got greenlit.'\n\u2018Thanks to our determination and a stroke of luck Warlocks was also shown at Europe\u2019s biggest game industry event Gamescom 2014 where visitors had the chance to enjoy four player DM battles. It was very satisfying to see that hardcore gamers from all over Europe enjoyed our game.\u2019\n\u2018With each day Warlocks comes closer and closer to its completion. Our next step will be to show the game at polish game industry event WGK 2014 and afterwards, depending on the outcome of the Kickstarter campaign, we want to show Warlocks to polish players during Pozna\u0144 Game Arena 2014.\u201d\nWe believe in our game.\nWatching how the game had blossomed since the early 2014 and how much other gamers enjoyed playing it made us confident that Warlocks will become a really good game. Our goal is for Warlocks to leave a mark and bring back the old good hot seat sessions back to PC gaming. Just like Castle Crashers did a few years back. We are excited about making the game as fun as possible and incorporating all the ideas that we bring in from totally different game genres. The best way to do it is through Kickstarter.\nThanks to funding that Kickstarter can provide us we can pick up our pace and focus on what matters to the gamers most \u2013 the game itself. This campaign will also be a great source of insight on the game from all the campaign backers and gamers interested in the project. For us Kickstarter is the way to be certain that what we are doing will be more than awesome.\nWarlocks already has our dedication, skills, experience and passion. Now it needs your support.\nDepending on the amount you are willing to back us up with there are many digital and physical rewards to be granted with.\nFormer IT student, passionate for video games and game industry since his very childhood.

Taking care of publishing and managing stuff.\nWe have joined forces with PR Hound (@pr_hound), who have helped fund many Kickstarter campaigns, as has been the case for MyDream, InSomia and Planets\u00b3, just to name a few.\nThe funds raised thanks to this campaign will be put into completing and polishing the game. There is still a lot of hard work to be done.\nFirstly, most of the funds will be spent on producing pixel art assets for the game and preparing in-game animations and finishing the game code so all the game\u2019s mechanics work well.\nSecondly, the characters will be fully voiced so we need to hire professional voice actors to add flavor and production value to the game.\nMoreover, part of the funds will be spent on testing the game thoroughly by \u2018on site\u2019 team of testers, starting with Steam\u2019s early access in November. We want to make sure that Warlocks works smoothly on your rig and laptop.\nSince there is a wide variety of physical rewards for backers who support Warlocks, part of the funds will be invested in manufacturing badges, figurines, CD\u2019s, printing t-shirts, art books and posters and packing and sending the rewards to their recipients all over the world.\nLastly, small part of the funds will be spent running our small office (which includes rent, media, internet, licenses) and answering to the demands of our office cat Mruczek.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign but Warlocks is not the first game our team was involved in.\n\nThe first challenge it to include all the planned features in the game and work on its balance so the outcome of \u2018versus\u2019 clashes will depend on players skill, not the characters attributes. We will tackle this issue with \u2018early access\u2019 version of the game that will be available on Steam in Q4 of 2014 and listening closely to what players will suggest.\n\nThe second challenge is preparing a solid Xbox One and Playstation 4 versions. We are using Unity so it is a matter of obtaining hardware needed, working on stability and user interface, fulfilling all the licensing requirements of both Microsoft and Sony and making sure the game utilizes each consoles features. We also need to reach to Sony and Microsoft to show them just how great Warlocks really are.\n\nThe third challenge is to supply all the pledgers rewards but we already have that worked out. The digital awards such as soundtrack, drm free versions, digital art book and game keys will be supplied directly through emails.\n\nTo prepare the limited edition figurines we are using a top quality 3D printer and the painting will be done by one of our talented artists. If the number of figurines needed is very large we will team up with one of Polish biggest figurine manufacturer to respond to the demand. Depending on the number of figurines the packing will be done by us directly or an external service provider will be used. The same goes for t-shirts and art books.\n\nT-shirts are manufactured by one of the most popular suppliers in USA.\nThere are always risks of falling short on health by someone on the team but having a solid community of game developers in Cracow we can assure you we will see the game completed and awesome.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Date of Warlocks vs Shadows full release on STEAM.", "update_content": "Hello guys,\n\nThe time has finally come, we are leaving Early Access :)\n\nWe will be releasing full version of Warlocks vs Shadows on August 19th."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "New gameplay mode - Horde Mode is live now!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nMany of you guys were asking us on our Steam Community Group about making a new gameplay mode.
