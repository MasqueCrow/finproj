[{"backer": "Gregory Crawford", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "This Kickstarter seeks to fund two releases in celebration of the tenth anniversary of Folklore Tapes. The first is an audiophile-grade reissue of one of the label's most sought after editions, Theo Brown and the Folklore of Dartmoor. The second is a new Ten Year Anniversary Book featuring essays and hitherto unseen photography from the collective's many fieldtrips, recording sessions and live performances.\nFolklore Tapes began in 2011 as a postal exchange between David Chatton Barker and Ian Humberstone. Ian had recently left Devon, while David remained. Feeling that they had only begun to scratch the surface of their potential for creative collaboration, the pair began a correspondence centred around their mutual interest in Devon folklore. The compositions and research notes they traded would later become the first Folklore Tapes release Two Witches, in the summer of 2011.\nDavid and Ian at Stanton Drew Stone Circle, 2015.\nFrom there, the project grew roots, knots and branches - much like a gnarled old oak tree. The initial 'Devon Folklore Tapes' series was soon joined by others delving into the arcana of different counties, while themed sets, such as 'Calendar Customs' and 'Megalithic Monuments', also emerged from the misty wraithlands. Folklore Tapes soon developed into a fully-fledged collective, with a large cast of contributors - including such luminaries as Sam McLoughlin, Mary Stark, Rob St John, and Arianne Churchman - spread throughout the UK.\nThe Folklore Tapes Tent at Port Eliot Festival, 2015.\nPerhaps the most well-received release to date has been Theo Brown and the Folklore of Dartmoor. This project saw Ian and David embark on fieldwork throughout Dartmoor, guided by the spirit of the late folklorist Theo Brown, whose manuscript collections - held at the University of Exeter - directed their endeavours. The project was released to widespread acclaim in 2014, as a box-set containing seven seven-inch records, a DVD, map, booklet, poster and postcards. The pressing sold out within six months and has remained a sought after collector's item ever since.\nFor many years, David and Ian pondered the best way to keep the release in print. Simply reissuing the box-set held little appeal. There was a sense that the mixes for the album - alongside the quality of its analogue-to-digital conversion - could be improved upon. As a result, for this new edition Ian went back to the original half-inch tapes and lovingly reworked the audio using analogue outboard equipment. New masters were then made by engineers Bill Sellar and Simon Heyworth at their studio located on Dartmoor itself. David, meanwhile, disinterred the project's 8mm film and artwork, and set about recapturing - though rewilding is perhaps the more appropriate term - their primal content in high definition.\nTheo Brown Tour Rehearsals, 2014.\nThe new edition of Theo Brown and the Folklore of Dartmoor takes the form of a 45rpm double LP set in a gatefold sleeve, with the quality of the audio greatly improved. Also included is a detailed booklet containing all the artwork, research notes and folk-tales featured in the original release. Tucked inside the sleeve are two download codes for the project's audio and film.\nThe second release being funded through this campaign is the Ten Year Anniversary Book, which is filled with hitherto unseen images and text. Over the past decade, Folklore Tapes have amassed a vast archive of 35mm and slide film photography, detailing their activities on stage during live performances, and on-site during fieldtrips. This behind-the-scenes material will finally see the light of day through this publication, which will also include a full retrospective of David's album and poster art for Folklore Tapes, alongside a history of the label penned by Jez Winship.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n((O))\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "Receive a full digital download of 'Theo Brown and the Folklore of Dartmoor' (DFTVI) four months ahead of the physical release.

Our backers are critical partners in all of our new projects for two reasons:\n1. We design our products (and experiences) in collaboration with our community. Your feedback as we build out The Cocktail Journey is crucial to delivering the kind of education and experience you need and want most. We like making things that people like to use. \ud83d\ude0a\n2. Building things is hard (and expensive). We\u2019ve already invested a lot to bring The Cocktail Journey to this stage of development, and give you a good taste of what\u2019s to come. In order to build on what we've started, we need the ongoing support of founding members so we can continue building a great team of people, produce more educational content, and improve the members-only experience.\n\nWhat's Done & What's Next\nWe\u2019ve already been putting the foundation for The Cocktail Journey in place. Here's our current road map:\n\nWhat We'll Do With Kickstarter Funds\nLike we said earlier: building things is hard, and EXPENSIVE. For this project, most of what we need to do is invest in the creative team that will produce the live events and educational content for The Cocktail Journey. We'll use Kickstarter funds for:\n People: we have an incredible team that is helping us to build education and amazing cocktail experiences for you -- and we need to be able to invest in those people. Most of our project funding will go to support our team so we can continue to build out the full Cocktail Journey Experience.\n Membership Site: we have a little more work to build out the members-only experience at thecocktailjourney.com, which will be the main hub for our community to access on-demand educational content, live events, members-only resources, and to connect with each other.\n Production Needs: the great news is, we already have a lot of the stuff we need when it comes to studio space and gear. We'll use a small portion of the funds upgrading a few things to improve the audio and visual experience and make production more efficient for the team.\n Funding & Stretch Goals\nOur funding goal is $25,000. This is the baseline we need in order to launch The Cocktail Journey and explore 52 cocktails in 52 weeks with you! \nWhat we'd like to create down the road is much bigger than this, and there is a lot more that we can do.  We have a 5-year roadmap to build out some really incredible things ---  but today and for this Kickstarter, we're only talking about what we can deliver in the next year. And some of that depends on how many members we get and what kind of funding we have to work with:\nAt $25,000, we'll be able to fully implement our vision of weekly cocktail recipes and live events to explore 52 cocktails in 52 weeks with you! We'll also be able to build out the membership site and members-only resources, and begin producing introductory on-demand content.\nAt $50,000, we'll be able to produce more in-depth and regular content sooner, and begin to expand beyond the 15-Bottle Bar to address other kinds of cocktail education (Think: tiki cocktails, bitters workshops, new craft spirits and liqueurs). \nAt $100,000+ we'll be able to invest in our team more fully and have enough resources to provide the visibility and financial runway to implement our 5-year plan (which is very exciting!!)\nWe'd really like to get closer to the $100k mark with The Cocktail Journey launch this month. If that doesn't happen on Kickstarter, we'll get there regardless with some post-Kickstarter growth strategies to reach the levels of membership we need to build and sustain a great experience. \nYou can help (a lot) by sharing this project early and often, and bringing your friends and fellow cocktail lovers along with you on your journey.\n\nCheers,\nRachel Eva & Shawn Michael\nRachel Eva and Shawn Michael at our home bar -- and studio set -- in San Diego, California", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRegarding Kickstarter Projects in General:\n\nThis will be our 5th Kickstarter Campaign. We take these projects very seriously, and have experience knowing what we can commit to, and how to communicate when things don't go exactly as planned. For anyone who's ever started something new, you know that things rarely go exactly as planned! We commit to communicating about any challenges that come up, and what we're doing to address them. We'll also ask for your input to be part of helping us solve challenges that may impact your experience.\n\nBacker Testimonial from Napier Jigger Project: \"I received my stainless and copper jiggers today. The quality and packaging are first rate. I know you put a whole lot of effort into delivering a high quality product, while overcoming a lot of obstacles. You did both, in addition to providing backers with great communications around the process and involving us in many decisions.\"\n\nFor The Cocktail Journey:\n\nThe biggest risk we see with this project is if we make our funding goal but don't make it to 1,000 members. In order for us to build out the full Cocktail Journey Experience, we need a good base of founding members to help us design and provide feedback on the build-out. If we have a small number of backers (even if we meet our funding goal), we'll be able to deliver on our baseline commitments, but will also need to make membership growth a big area of focus after the Kickstarter ends, which may impact how much content we are able to produce right away.\n\nOne of the challenges with building a sustained, long-term project like this is making sure we have the right team to help us get there - and that we have the right resources to invest in that team. We have a 5-year roadmap for what we want to see happen with The Cocktail Journey. For this Kickstarter, we're focusing on what we can accomplish in year 1. If we make it to our funding goal of $25,000 we'll definitely be able to Kickstart this project, but will have a lot of work to do to grow after the Kickstarter ends. We have a plan in place to do that, but it will be more challenging if we only have $25k to work with -- it gets a lot easier at the $50k and $100k funding and stretch-goal scenarios. At those higher funding scenarios, we're also able to deliver more value to backers more quickly: mostly in the form of more on-demand educational content released more frequently.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rachel Eva and Shawn Michael\n5 created \u00b7 42 backed\nRachel Eva and Shawn Michael are artists and designers with a passion for well-crafted goods.

When something goes horribly wrong and the magician gets himself into a bind he can\u2019t escape, you must step forward to claim the gifts that have been yours all along, before it's too late to help him \u2014 or anyone else.\n\nThe Shape Of Shadows is a connected path game about show magic and true magic, the tension of asserting yourself as an equal to someone taking you under their wing; and the price you are willing to pay to fly on your own.\nThe Shape of Shadows can be adapted for players who prefer to write with brevity, using a bullet journal style of notation.\nThe Shape of Shadows is about a magician's assistant who, for their own reasons, dedicates their career to pursuing stage and close up magic through the mentorship of the magician. Through the eyes of the character they create, players will learn how the magician's assistant started the path they're on, how they chose to work with the magician, and why the risks and danger of learning true magic were not enough to deter them from their studies. Through intricately constructed journaling prompts, image- and word-based puzzles, and utilizing a mundane day planner to create strange alchemical rituals, players will explore the magic of the world they move through, in and out of this connected path game. The core game is played solo, but alongside everyone else who opens the door to the adventure and mystery at the heart of The Shape of Shadows. No two players' stories will be the same, but every player will walk their connected paths together through their play experiences.\n\nA sampling of letters from former assistants for the players to discover in-game.\nConnected path and keepsake games are two terms coined by Shing Yin Khor and myself during our collaboration on our previous game, Field Guide To Memory. In a connected path game, players experience unique, solitaire games while simultaneously sharing in a community of others engaging in the same creative spirit alongside them. \n\nThe joy of playing a connected path the joy of show and tell: our intuitive desire to show each other what is precious to us, why we treasure it, and why we'd like to feel compelled to share it with the communities that are precious to us in turn. \nPlaytester feedback on The Shape of Shadows was almost unanimous in its enthusiasm.\nBoth the narrative and core game experience in The Shape of Shadows center on a day planner. As the magician's assistant, much of your time in character will be spent interacting with the magician's planner, scouring it for keys to the doors he\u2019s always kept closed to you, in order to learn what you need to restore him. \nAn example of how some players answered game prompts in their planner by using color-coded index cards.\nAs the player, you will choose one month in a weekly planner to keep track of your character's increasingly strange appointments, while the rest of the planner undergoes a metamorphosis in your hands. Every day of play offers something new. Some days are contemplative, focusing on memory and observation in the form of journaling; others are adventurous and may lead you outside to find a token you need for a ritual circle; and still others involve trying your hand at more tangible crafts. \n\nWhether you're learning the nuances of different forms of sigil magic and how to work them into the trick locks you use during your close up magic shows; reviewing the finer points of talisman crafting to shield you from hecklers at the comedy club; charming your playing cards so they never tumble from your hands during a waterfall shuffle; or developing alchemical formulas for transmutation (that you can actually make in real life at home during the game!), it all goes in your planner to turn it page by page into a true magician's spellbook.\nAs far as you can tell, the magician devoted the entirety of his life to seeing how far he could push his skills in the practical application of true magic, and honing the craft of his show magic. Alchemy, cardistry, divination, illusionism, close-up, conjuring \u2014 nothing is off the table for him. \nVarious letters from former magician's assistants over the years.\nOver the course of his life the magician accumulated a veritable dragon's hoard of research materials, ritual components, flotsam and jetsam both figurative and literal (an avid beachcomber, the magician uses his findings often), and piles and piles of correspondence (some of it quite personal).\nAlmost every day during the game, you will receive 1-2(or more!) photographs and documentation of these objects as part of your gameplay prompts.\nTwo reward levels (the ILLUSIONIST and the CONJURER) include physical packages of these curiosities, mailed to you as part of the game's closing narrative.\n\n\nLOCK, $15 (UNLIMITED) \nAt the $15 KEY level, you will get added to the player list for The Shape of Shadow's live run in late summer. For the duration of the game's run you'll receive an email with story and activity prompts Monday through Thursday. The game lasts for four consecutive weeks.\n\nKEY, $25 (UNLIMITED)\nAt the $25 LOCK level, you'll get everything associated with the live game, and a high resolution PDF of the full game text, sent to you after the live run wraps up. After her superlative layout work on Field Guide To Memory, Ruby Lavin will return to design The Shape of Shadows' PDF as well.\n\nSLEIGHT, $40 (UNLIMITED)\nAt this level backers will get entry into the live game and the full game PDF for two recipients. \n\nILLUSIONIST, $60 (UNLIMITED)\nPLAY\n\nAll digital versions of the game, including the emailed live game experience in late summer, the full PDF, and large envelope of strange and beautiful paper ephemera, as described in the \"Artifacts, Art, and Ephemera\" section. Includes ephemera from the game narrative that your character or others may encounter during play, a sheet of custom-illustrated sigil stickers, and a sheet of holographic stamps showing a white rabbit popping in and out of a magician's hat. I am mountaineering up an exciting new learning curve and making this reward level unlimited.\n\nCONJURER, $350 (LIMITED TO 60 BOXES)\nAn example of what a recipient of the Conjurer's box might receive.\nIn addition to everything at the ILLUSIONIST reward level, you will receive a literal one-of-a-kind collection of beautiful flotsam and jetsam just like the talismans and treasured detritus in the magician's office. Each box is numbered, since no two boxes are exactly the same, and all of them will have at least 1-2 pieces of my original art, in different mediums.\n\nWhen I conceptualized this reward level, the thought that came to mind was \"if a cabinet of curiosities could be ordered through delivery.\" The high level of care, craftsmanship, and artistic expression I want to put into each of these boxes is the kind of experiential feast I adore creating and sharing with people; and, in order to keep it sustainable, there is a strict limit of 60 of these boxes. \n\nEach collection box will be made, packed, lovingly fussed over, and shipped out a few at a time in order to avoid bottlenecking my home studio and office. If you back at this level, please note that another backer may receive their box long before you, depending on how many people end up supporting this level.\n\nCreative Contributors\nAmal El-Mohtar is an award-winning writer of fiction, poetry, and criticism.

The first stretch goal is to raise enough to hire a team of eight brilliant creators, all of them master magicians in their own right who understand the nature of true magic and will deliver it in their own unique ways to further build out the world with short fiction, in-character letters, clandestine texts, and other . Both this and the previous stretch goal will be made available to backers at all game levels. The incredible roster of writers and creators will be announced in stages once the stretch goal is met.\n\nMET! The campaign's second stretch goal is to hire a cover artist to create a memorable, beautiful piece of art to capture the spirit of the game.\nIsip Xin's conceptual sketch of their cover for the game\nMET! The third stretch goal is to award a 50% raise to every contributor I asked on board for our first goal. This stretch goal is about getting money to people I love and admire, and about building a fair and sustainable model for indie game compensation.\n\nMET! The fourth stretch goal is $50K, at which point I'll be able to make the Compendium: an appendix of supplementary mini games and multi-player ttrpgs that take place in the same world.\n\nMET! The fifth stretch goal is $54K, which is where I'll be able to afford creating two sets of sigils for all backers: one set of full color, high resolution digital downloads for players who are joining the live game or buying the PDF text, and high quality sticker sheets for players who are backing the physical ephemera reward levels.\n\nMET! At $60K, I'll be able to triple the base pay for all of the creative contributors on the game! \n\nMET! At $66K I'll be able to pay a bonus to literally everyone contributing to the game!\n\nStretch Goal no. 8: $72K Mid-week Intermission Game, live on Twitter!\nAt $66K, I'll make time to write a play-by-poll game on Twitter that dovetails with the core game experience, and is also run in real time.

This game builds further on the scaffold of everything I\u2019ve learned from those experiences.\n\nThe game is fully structured and written, albeit in an unedited late-stage draft. The Kickstarter funds will cover the cost of copy editing by Ryan Boyd, and layout design by Ruby Lavin (whose previous layout credits include Field Guide To Memory and Wanderhome), as well as giving me the time I need to attend to the creative and administrative tasks associated with the multifaceted nature of connected path games like this one. Short of Mailchimp\u2019s server going down or a street magician accidentally turning me into a rabbit, I anticipate fulfillment of the text and live game to stay on schedule.\n\nI do not currently have a fulfillment partner for the Illusionist reward level (the flat art and ephemera), but I'm in touch with two or three companies and will contract the most suitable once I know what quantity of printed goods I'll need to ship. While the USPS is generally reliable for domestic US mail, with any physical reward there is always the risk of packages getting delayed or lost in thin air. \n\nAdditionally, the future of international mail sent out of the US is currently hard to read in the cards. I fully intend to work with my future fulfillment partner to send out every single package that is backed and accounted for, but be aware that it could take a very long time for your rewards to reach you. (Due to various plant pressings and organic materials in the Conjurer's boxes, I cannot ship that reward level internationally and it will be limited to US backers.)\n\nMy aim is to fulfill this Kickstarter from late July to August, well before the stated delivery dates. Still, I left myself enough buffer to weather most unexpected changes.

This is our fifth letterpress artwork with our partner, Boxcar Press. \n \"So we beat on, boats against the current,  borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"  \nThe final line of The Great Gatsby, the Fitzgerald novel that defined the jazz age. It was the era that ushered in modernity, a time of material excess, liberation, and intoxication. But even in the midst of the party, Fitzgerald could sense the toll such decadence takes on the human soul.\nLike so many other Fitzgerald fans, we adore this quotation and its kaleidoscopic meanings. Gatsby, surrounded by unimaginable wealth, prestige and fanfare, dreams only of a future with Daisy that will recreate their past. And yet, his past is what prevents him from attaining that bright future. All pomp and circumstance aside, Gatsby is deeply relatable. Everyone, in their own way, aspires to their own vision of \u201cone fine day.\u201d Everyone is reaching toward the green light. And like Gatsby, we are all eventually borne, against our will, into the past.\nIn our illustration, a figure rows toward an ethereal, glimmering girl as her dress forms the bay. Her belt resembles a gleaming cityscape, and a green jewel dangles from a string of pearls.\n\n\"And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby\u2019s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\u2019s no matter\u2014tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further\u2026 And one fine morning\u2014\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"\nOUR PRINT PARTNER: BOXCAR PRESS\nWe've been working with Boxcar Press since our first letterpress run (and first Kickstarter project in 2017). Their work is meticulous and beautiful, and their master printers wow us every time. \nPLAY\n\nThe short video is a behind-the-scenes look at our first letterpress print run, and a glimpse of our first Fitzgerald illustration (see below). \n\"MARTINI\" \nThe roaring twenties, when booze was illegal and dresses were flappy. We love this quotation from This Side of Paradise; it reminds us of the headlong intoxicated rush into mutual obsession - the kind of love that usually ends badly. Here, the flapper dress transforms into a martini glass as it is unzipped. \nTHE LETTERPRESS PRINTS\nEach GATSBY 16x20 letterpress print will be hand pulled on gorgeous 100% cotton, 110lb Crane\u2019s Lettra paper and hand finished by the master printers at Boxcar press. Each limited edition print will be signed and numbered by the artist, Obvious State Cofounder, Evan Robertson. \nThe large prints make a bold, tactile statement and are made with archival inks and fine art paper that will last a lifetime. \nFITZGERALD NOTEBOOK: SET OF THREE\nOur pocket notebooks are printed and constructed in Portland, Oregon using vegetable-based inks and 100% recycled paper (a portion of which is from recycled books).

Here, the flapper dress transforms into a martini glass as it is unzipped.\nFrom his novel This Side of Paradise.\nThis particular quote serves as a great summary of the novel which is the coming of age story of a young romantic idealist. In addition to a typical third person narrative, Fitzgerald also uses epistolary letters, poetry and a play to tell the story, giving the narrative a un-manicured, disorienting beauty of a field of wildflowers.\nIn this illustration, the wind sways two wild flowers into a kiss.\nGATSBY 16x20 LETTERPRESS: SIGNED AND NUMBERED\nEach 16x20 letterpress print will be hand pulled on gorgeous 100% cotton, 110lb Crane\u2019s Lettra paper and hand finished by the master printers at Boxcar press. \n\nEach limited edition print will be signed and numbered by the artist, Obvious State Cofounder, Evan Robertson.\nMAY 14 - Campaign Closes\nMAY 15 - JUNE 15 Print Produciton\nJUNE 15 - JULY 1 Prints signed and packaged, rewards readied\nJULY 1 Prints and rewards ship\nABOUT US\nObvious State is a creative studio founded by husband and wife team Nichole and Evan Robertson in 2011.

Establishing the setting in science fiction games can sometimes feel overwhelming, but this system circumvents that \u2026 you start off in a realm that\u2019s almost GMless where everyone gets to take part in a generative brainstorm that naturally progresses into meaningful character roleplay.\u201d \n\u2013 Elizabeth Winkelhoff, playtester\nTomorrow on Revelation III is for 2-5 players and a gamemaster (GM), and can be played as a one-shot or a campaign. In a one-shot, you and your fellow players pick a specific aspect of the station to focus on improving. In a campaign, you build relationships and reconfigure the station over a long period of time, following your characters as they go about their lives.\nThe game uses its own easy-to-learn original system with a mixture of simple skill checks and moves. Each player builds a character by selecting a background and answering questions about their positionality on the station and relationships to one another. You might play as a merchant, with a penchant for making good first impressions and the inside scoop about the ongoings of the station. Or a freight worker, hauling cargo and befriending the station robots. Or a personal assistant, using your vocational connection to Deck A to secure information and resources your community couldn't otherwise access.\nYour character\u2019s background describes their profession and dictates most aspects of their life, such as their social class, the decks they live and work on, and their influence on different parts of the station.  Each background provides background-specific traits and 8 points of cultural capital that can be used on different decks.\nThe twelve backgrounds are:\nAdministrator\nEngineer\nHealthcare Worker\nMerchant\nArtist\nTeacher\nTradesperson\nFreight Worker\nLabor Supervisor\nPersonal Assistant\nChildcare Worker\nAgriculture Worker\nRevelation III is divided into six decks lettered A-F, with residents assigned to decks based on their occupation. These divisions is core to the station\u2019s function: Revelation III is primarily an agricultural station, and the continued existence not only of this station but of others belonging to Prodigy depends on the food production that occurs on Deck E. \nThe higher the deck, the better the circumstances. Residents may travel to lower decks freely, but up to higher decks only for specific activities and with specially granted permissions. Deck access is governed by key cards. Each deck has its own unique tensions, balancing intra-deck solidarity with competition for resources and mobility.  Genuine relationships of any kind between people across decks are rare and hard won. \nThis is all part of the reality you are working to change. \nTomorrow on Revelation III includes a two page, full color map by Tim Wilkinson Lewis detailing each of the decks described in the book.\nAfter character creation, Tomorrow on Revelation III is divided into two phases of gameplay: a downtime phase, and a mission phase. The downtime phase is one of collaborative storytelling about daily life on the station. Player characters (PCs) can seek out information to aid them in their upcoming objectives, build relationships that increase their cultural capital pool, alleviate conditions, and gather equipment. The mission phase represents the characters\u2019 efforts to improve life on the station. The characters select one or more realities related to surviving, negotiating, and overcoming capitalism that they would like to improve on the station, and collaborate to begin addressing this problem.\nTomorrow on Revelation III intentionally combines slice-of-life storytelling with mission-based gameplay. The responsibility for developing the world and setting elements is shared among the GM and the players. In the downtime phase, the whole group works together to paint a richer picture of the station: players freely incorporate their ideas about the setting and may portray non-player characters (NPCs) in scenes with one another. In the mission phase, the GM controls the setting elements and NPCs, and the players utilize their traits and ingenuity to navigate the adversarial station.\nWant to see the downtime phase in action? Check out this audio: \n Agriculture worker Eli (played by Liz), personal assistant Reighgynn (played by Alina), and teacher Riley (played by Dominique) are planning a heist\u2014they're going to steal medical supplies from the upper decks of Revelation III to redistribute on the underserved lower decks. In these two downtime scenes, the PCs hack the station's transit system with the help of Kettle the robot and conduct a black market deal to acquire supplies. GMing by CJ. Audio editing by Anna Hibbert.\nYour cultural capital pool is determined by your background, and starts off highest on the decks where you live or work. A Deck E agricultural worker has no cultural capital on Deck A (and a Deck A administrator has none on Deck E) because they have little to no experience with the deck in question.\nIn short, cultural capital is a numerical representation of a PC\u2019s cultural competency on, and general knowledge about, the decks of Revelation III. Cultural capital is applied to skill checks.\nTomorrow on Revelation III features:\nDesign by Dominique Dickey and Charles Jamie Linton \nGraphic and layout design by Vee Hendro \nCover illustration by Aleta P\u00e9rez \nMap illustration by Tim Wilkinson Lewis \nInterior illustration by Sadia Bies \nThe book includes the complete setting, rules, and a starter module for quick play.\nThe digital edition is a full color, illustrated PDF of the game.\nThe print edition is a 5.5\" x 8.5\" softcover book with a full color cover and a black and white interior.\nAt $9,750 stretch goal, the physical copies will be printed in color!\nHere\u2019s the budget distribution:\n $4,200 for layout, map, and art.\n $1,000 for printing and production.\n $800 for Kickstarter and BackerKit fees and taxes.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will be utilizing BackerKit, via which backers can manage pledges and pay for shipping.

Maybe it wasn\u2019t always, but it is now. And the world out there is darkening, like the sky before a late-summer storm.\nThese are good people, here in Stonetop. Your kith and your kin.\nIf you don\u2019t step up to protect them, who will?\nStonetop is a \u201chearth fantasy\u201d tabletop RPG set in an Iron Age that never was. The players portray the heroes of an isolated village near the edge of the known world. Their adventures focus on dealing with threats to the village and seizing opportunities. These aren\u2019t rootless mercenaries seeking fortune and glory; they\u2019re exceptional people, taking risks on behalf of their friends, family, and neighbors.\nLike most tabletop RPGs, Stonetop plays out as a conversation between the game master (GM) and the players, with dice being rolled at key moments to determine which direction the story goes. The game can be played in short runs of 2-4 sessions (each about 3-4 hours long), but is best experienced over a dozen or more sessions.\nStonetop is \u201cPowered by the Apocalypse,\u201d using a system and framework similar to games like Apocalypse World, Monster of the Week, or Masks: a New Generation. It started as a setting guide for Dungeon World, but over 5 years of development and playtesting, it\u2019s become a standalone game. Knowledge of Dungeon World may ease your entry into the game, but it's not a prerequisite for play.\nPrintable play aids include all of Stonetop's core \"moves\"\u2014the rules that drive the game.\nFeatures of the system include:\n A rich and well-realized world of gritty Iron Age fantasy adventure, providing enough detail to ground play immediately while leaving plenty of room for the players and GM to make the setting their own.\n 9 distinct types of player-character (see below), each with their own reasons to look out for their community and seek adventure beyond its walls.\n Rules for governing and improving the village itself across the seasons and over the course of years.\n Rules for overland travel that capture the excitement of setting out into the unknown and the relief of returning home after a long time away.\n Hand-drawn maps depicting the village of Stonetop itself, its immediate surroundings, and the extent of the known world.\n An extensive setting almanac covering important regions, points of interest, neighboring settlements, creatures of the wild, and eerie remnants of past civilizations.\n A collection of unique magic items, each with special rules for unlocking its mysteries, powers, and dangers.\n Guidelines and advice for the GM, including step-by-step processes for collaborative customization of the village, adventure creation, and shaping a developing campaign.\n\u201cI had a chance to play this with a small group, including one person who usually didn't enjoy RPGs. We only played one session, and he still talks to me about how special it was to him. I would play it again in a heartbeat.\u201d \u2014William H., Vox Arcana Podcast\nClick through for full-size page spread\nA close-knit community burns bright at the edge of the known world, surrounded by mystery and danger. Rainwater collects in the Cistern; iron is shaped at the forge; magic is rare and fearsome; the will of the gods is discerned from the shapes of the clouds. Only the bravest venture far from the Ringwall, but upon these few the future of the village depends. \nEnough setting detail is provided to start everyone on the same page, but as the players create and introduce their heroes, they begin to shape the world to their personal and collective interests. The game text establishes a foundation upon which each group builds their own unique version of Stonetop.\nAlthough extensive guides to the village, its environs, creatures, and other elements are included, this material is designed less as a \u201csetting bible\u201d and more as a toolkit full of prompts and resources for the players and GM to exploit.\nClick through for full-size page spread\n\"I love the setting, from the ancient ruins and wild places haunted by fae, spirits, and much stranger things (hypnotic baboon-headed snakes!) to the magic that demands sacrifice and promises terrible consequences.

There are nine different archetypes, each with a unique set of possible backgrounds, abilities, and connections to the village, all defined by the player during the first game session: \nEach playbook is designed to hold \"inserts\" for tracking things like inventory, the Marshal's crew, or the Ranger's animal companion:\nClick through for a PDF of the Seeker's playbook.\nInterior of the Seeker's playbook with inventory insert\n\u201cI love it. The character creation is evocative and really feels like play... It creates not only your character\u2019s backstory and relationship to other player characters, but also to Stonetop and the NPCs in Stonetop. When you are done with session zero, not only are you psyched to play your character and interact with the other player characters, but you are attached to the village.\u201d \u2014Christo Meid, playtester\nThe village of Stonetop has its own character sheet, or \u201cplaybook,\u201d with stats, traits, and improvements to be unlocked in play. This playbook drives much of the game. For example, the village\u2019s \"Fortunes\" directly affect what new threats or opportunities each new season brings, and the players must manage the community\u2019s \"Surplus\" to avoid disaster when winter comes. As a game of Stonetop progresses, the village playbook changes in response to the victories and failures of the player-characters. And as the village changes, so do the threats and opportunities that heroes face.\nClick through for a PDF of the steading playbook.\n\"I didn't know how much I needed a game that let me play out Our Town or Main Street or Gilmore Girls in a fantasy setting until I played Stonetop and realized it might be the only game I needed. Stonetop not only helps players create amazing adventures. It also creates a persistent, believable place. Players will come to care about that place and the people who live there deeply.\" \u2014Emily VanDerWerff, Vox\nThe game includes dozens of magic items and locations (\"arcana\") that the heroes can acquire and learn to use. Each has special rules for unlocking its mysteries, tapping its powers, and\u2014for the most powerful items\u2014the consequences of doing so.\nThese arcana are designed to be printed as two-sided cards, to be given to players as handouts.\nClick through for PDF examples of major and minor arcana (spoiler alert!)\n\"Stonetop's unique take on magic items\u2014requiring effort to understand and activate and each coming with their own set of costs and consequences\u2014is fresh, rewarding, and surprisingly intuitive. Each Major and Minor Arcana has a character of its own that drives its story forward, each one naturally forming a story hook that is as unique as the character who wields it.\" \u2014Chris Thompson, playtester\nThe goal of this campaign is to fund the printing of two high-quality hardback books:\n Book I: Stonetop contains the core rules and extensive guidance for the GM. ~400 pages.\n Book II: The Wider World and Other Wonders is a setting almanac that details the regions, sites, monsters, and arcana (magic items) unique to Stonetop. ~250 pages.\nThese books will be 5.5\"x8.5\" (\"digest\" size), hardback, printed offset, and jam-packed with beautiful pen-and-ink illustrations by artist Lucie Arnoux.\nHere's an early mock-up of the books to convey their intended size:\nMock-up for scale (cover designs not final)\nAnd here's a mock-up with a more stone-like feel, showing the stretch-goal slipcase that will be included with every set of books:\nClick through for a higher resolution image.\nAll backers will receive PDFs of both books and additional play aids. The PDFs will be thoroughly bookmarked and hyperlinked to maximize ease of use.\n\"What can I say about Stonetop that hasn\u2019t been said already? I could wax lyrical at length about the wild grandeur of the setting, the clarity of the GMing techniques, the evocative poetry of the playbooks, how well the moves bind the game around the village and its material human concerns, the balance it finds between unique worldbuilding and blank spaces crying out to be made your own.\n\"Instead I\u2019ll just say this: for four years now, this has been the game I come back to time and time again, always bringing new friends with me.

Each project has been slightly more ambitious than the last, which has allowed me to gradually improve my knowledge base and set reasonable goals.\n\nContent and art is 75% complete for Stonetop, so the main challenge I see is making sure that the printing and fulfillment of the two books goes smoothly. There may be delays, for instance, if I ask for extensive corrections after seeing the printer's proofs, or if other aspects of production don't meet my expectations. For previous projects I have shipped all rewards myself, so going with third-party fulfillment is also an unknown.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Stonetop - Digital Edition", "descp": "Both books (600+ pages total) and all play aids in PDF form.

It\u2019s also about crossing a surreal desert by train, visiting improbable cities, and experiencing sublime understanding among uncommon vistas. It\u2019s about homesickness and lumpy beds and brand new stew and finding a coda for the broken song in your heart.\nThe player characters are travelers from the City by the Sea, bound to mementos of the past. Even after their identities have been worn away by the endless desert, they seek Cerebos. Through motion, reflection, and the actions of their fellow passengers they rediscover who they were and decide who they will be when they reach the Crystal City.\nIllustration by Shel Kahn\nEach traveler is limited by their physical touchstones, but they are also empowered. Anyone lugging a coffin full of roses or a bismuth teapot through disorienting light and memory-shattering weather must have had a good reason \u2013 or at least what seemed like a good idea at the time.\nThose who travel the road to Cerebos do so for many reasons. A starting character might be:\nA choleric puppeteer with a flashy harlequin\u2019s cape. She carries a distressed marionette and a flask of bitter syrup.\nAn out-of-sorts gentleman of the road. He carries a hooded lantern, a satchel of mushroom jerky, and wears a tight hat.\nA wisp of a figure caught on the wind. They wear a broken monocle and an ironwood key and carry a parasol with a hidden compartment.\nThe travelers meet at a railway terminus. They experience flashbacks, overcome unexpected events, and ride the rails to the world\u2019s beautiful imperfections. Trust doesn\u2019t come easy when the dining car is infested with chandler beetles and the sister cities of Orm and Calyx are competing for sacred fools, but maybe it\u2019s the only thing that will keep everyone going.\nIllustration by Shel Kahn\nTravelers change based on new experiences, but their pasts have already been decided. Each player secretly determines another traveler\u2019s past, which is revealed in play through flashbacks. They may learn they\u2019re a demon (metaphorical or otherwise) with the power to foment change. Likewise, they may be a proponent of order and constancy.\nNeutrality is a sucker\u2019s game, whether the travelers lurch toward found family or explode in a pressure cooker of misfits and malcontents. By the second leg of the journey a traveler may discover:\nThe choleric puppeteer\u2019s family corrupted the City by the Sea. Cerebos is said to have a grand puppet theatre where the performers are all masked. She is a seeker of truth, the ideological linchpin of the journey.\nThe out-of-sorts gentleman is a gnome who misfiled his taxes and has been trapped in the body of a lighthouse keeper. The central tax office in Cerebos can clear up this misunderstanding. He is a saint, encouraging the seeker to hold true to her quest.\nThe windblown wisp was an ambitious scientist who extracted the memories of a dozen people before falling prey to their own procedure. The only cure, the last Human Optimization Project Encephalograph unit, has been shipped to the Crystal City. They are a demon, celebrating the freedom of the road and the limitless future.\nThe train\u2019s conductor moves the travelers along, setting the journey\u2019s tone and modifying the rules. An adventurous conductor guides the travelers through a world of danger and megafauna, cataloging the limits of human experience, while kindly ol\u2019 Mr. Wumpus is more suited to cozy, rabbit-shaped hijinks.\nIllustration by Cynthia Yuan Cheng\nCerebos is inspired by games like Sunless Sea, stories of fantastic cities like Invisible Cities and Kino\u2019s Journey, Infinity Train, family road trips, prog rock album covers, purgatory, and quarter-and-mid-life crises. These stories fuel a robust engine for telling stories about change, hope, stability, risk, stagnation, want, giant crabs, vichychoisse, and comfortable cushions.\nThe system is light and easy to learn, rewarding imaginative solutions and collaborative character growth. It requires two six-sided dice, character sheets, and name tags or another way of sharing private information. A typical story requires three to four players and an optional gamemaster and lasts one to two sessions.\nIllustration by Cynthia Yuan Cheng\nThe 80-page game includes:\nComplete rules. Incompatible with the world\u2019s most popular role-playing game!\nOver 30 Stops. Fantastic cities, deadly tourist traps, and more than a few works of giant stone anatomy, each with a unique travel keepsake. (Update 2021-04-03: Including all stretch goals met to date, the Stops tables will now have 78 entries.)\nOver 30 Events. Weather, fellow passengers, and unique properties of the rail, each with a unique travel keepsake. (Update 2021-04-03: Including all stretch goals met to date, the Events tables will now have 78 entries.)\n4 Conductors. Modify the genre and rules of the rail with Adventure, Psychogrit, a Musical Journey Through Space, or an All-Ages Fairy Tale. (Update 2021-04-03: Including all stretch goals met to date, the core rulebook will now feature seven Conductors.)\nAdvice for improvising collaborative scenes that support imagery-rich character growth\nPuns and textual delights for the discerning collector of RPG paraphernalia\nA catalog of inspirations, annotated to highlight the role of travel, cities, trains, and self-discovery within liminal spaces\nThe primary text is already written. If you'd like a closer look at the game, check out a preview of the text, the character sheet, and some sample Stops and Events.\nThe preview contains a summary of play, an introduction to conductors, traits, touchstones, the core dice mechanics, and what it means to be a saint or a demon.\nPre-release Reviews\n\"Cerebos is such a delightfully paced and thoughtful game about journeying and seeking, the unreliability of memory and the joys of collaborative myth-making. As a train enthusiast and lover of strange objects described well, this game was immediately compelling to me. The art by Shel Kahn and Cynthia [Yuan] Cheng and elegant and understated design work by Francita Soto makes the game absolutely shine. This game is going to burrow into the heart of anyone who has been dreaming of riding cross-country in the viewing car of an Amtrak train.\"\n \u2014 Shing Yin Khor, co-author of Field Guide to Memory\n\"A wonderful game about a neglected genre: the journey-as-metaphor.

This hardcover edition will be available only via this campaign, and will not be reprinted.\nIllustration by Cynthia Yuan Cheng\nNote: For backers outside Canada and the United States, physical rewards will be sent via surface freight. This is done to keep your shipping costs reasonable; under present conditions, international airmail would cost more than the reward. International backers should expect to receive their physical rewards 8\u201310 weeks after shipping begins.\nThe core rulebook isn't all we have in the works.

Add-ons are available only with the Limited Edition Hardcover reward level.\n$5 CAD \u2013 Quick-Reference Postcards\nThis add-on includes a double-sided summary of the structure of play, with page references to the core rulebook, plus a separate reference card covering the special genre rules associated with each Conductor.

Any physical add-ons that include these items will also be expanded at no extra cost as these goals are reached.\n$4000 CAD (reached!)\n\"Relics and Reclamations\" (Stops table) by Paul \"Ettin\" Matijevic \u2013 That which is lost often finds itself in the most peculiar circumstances. From an ancient observatory that contains a stolen star to a bath town built over a dumping ground for unwanted words, the travelers soon learn they\u2019re not the only ones wrestling with treasures from the past.\n\"Hauntings\" (Events table) by Will Mendoza \u2013 The desert is littered with bones and restless spirits. So is the train. A ghostly child cries softly in the dining car. A scraping sound emanates from an ancient suitcase. A grinning shape stands over the beds of sleeping passengers. Who are they and what do they want?\n$5000 CAD (reached!)\n\"Lost Aviaries\" (Stops table) by Pam Punzalan \u2013 Aviaries on the edge of lost possibilities float through the sky. Their massive flora could be from experiments gone rogue or magic long lost. Beyond a few settlers, all beings in the aviaries are delicate, clockwork beauties \u2013 or blindfolded, doll-like angels with mechanical wings that do nothing but watch.\n\"Surreal Coming-of-Age Anime\" (Conductor) by Ashley Flanagan \u2013 Although Duke Akira affects distant grace and charm, he rules every aspect of his train with uncanny intensity. His enigmatic obsession encourages a journey that grows darker as the train nears the Shining City. As the conductor manipulates the travelers into surreal, ominous situations, they must decide whether to rebel against his control \u2013 and how.\n$6000 CAD (reached!)\n\"Clearly Cursed Trees\" (Stops table) by Natalie Ash \u2013 Ranging from the almost-mundane to the truly fanatical, these trees have a mystical history explored in the relics left with them, and a strange present that could prove perilous to the unwary. Are they natural or created? Who enacted these strange rituals there and what did they leave behind?\n\"Shadows on the Tracks\" (Events table) by Amelia Gorman \u2013 Bats flutter, wolves howl, a full moon rises behind a crumbling garret... attached atop a locomotive? These Events bring the suspense and shadow of a good Gothic novel aboard the train. Unexpected letters, immured oddities, and strange ailments to train cars and passengers alike breed delightful unease and add a stronger sense of place to the train itself.\n$7000 CAD (reached!)\n\"Wayfaring Strangers\" (Events table) by Kevin Snow \u2013 Inspired by the historic development of the American west, travelers will encounter freighthoppers, attempted robberies, striking workers, and long, rolling landscapes that settlers claimed were barren.\n\"Folk Horror\" (Conductor) by Madeleine Ember \u2013 Grimlight is an unsettling horror. A nightmare in a person suit. Low, slow voice; mud seeping from under its collar. It incrementally sheds its disguise. It knows the secrets of this country, and seeks to escort passengers to where the mundane is peeled back, revealing the seriously strange beneath.\n$8000 CAD (reached!)\nJourneys give heart to the poet and the artist alike; at this level, the number of illustrations in the core rulebook will be doubled, providing further atmosphere and additional oddities to inspire your game.\n$13 000 CAD (reached!)\nCommunity copies \u2013 We believe in paying good fortune forward. At $13 000 CAD, we'll set aside twelve copies of the Cerebos limited edition hardcover to be donated to libraries, school gaming clubs, and other institutions. For every $2500 CAD beyond that, an additional three copies will be set aside. If you happen to be a librarian or gaming club supervisor, or if you know someone who is, you'll be able to recommend a recipient when the backer survey goes out.\n$14 000 CAD (reached)\n\"The Rolling Waves\" (Stops table) by Amelia Gorman \u2013 Countless tracks branch out from the City by the Sea like so many tentacles. Some routes cling tight to the coastline, where stops are shaped by the waves and tides. Pause to explore cities carved from dead leviathans, Sinkhole Village, or the Scented Lighthouse cooking messages on its signal fire.\n\"Snakes on a Train\" (Events table) by Ashley Flanagan \u2013 In a world where massive engines haul thrill seekers across a deadly wasteland, danger is a way of life. Violence and speed make every moment a potential climax. Introspection and doubt are well and good, but sometimes a train is just rigged to explode \u2013 or a deadly cargo stalks the passengers \u2013 or an elite group of aristocrats monopolizes the train\u2019s resources. Lock and load.\n$17 000 CAD (reached!)\nExpanded character folio by Francita Soto \u2013 Keep a record of your journey in style: the very talented Francita Soto will redesign the Cerebos character sheet into a print-and-play passport style character folio. Check out her porfolio to see some of her past RPG character sheet designs.\n$19 000 CAD (reached!)\n\"Coins for Kitsch\" (Stops table) by Kevin Snow \u2013 Any well-traveled route presents economic opportunities for storytellers in rural towns and communities left behind. Experience guided tours of regionally famous murders, supposedly sacred monuments, and oversized sculptures of obscure cryptids. Are their histories true or invented? Whatever you believe, be sure to grab a postcard.\n\"Onboard Amenities\" (Events table) by Paul \"Ettin\" Matijevic \u2013 The train is more than just a box to move travelers between strange lands. It\u2019s an environment in its own right, home to a collection of cars that unlock on their own timetables. The Conductor may have more information about the game hall where familiar diversions are stocked with forbidden pieces. But the dining car that serves up meals from travelers\u2019 pasts? It is a mystery!\n$22 000 CAD (reached!)\nRandom Touchstones table by Zach Welhouse \u2013 The Cerebos core rulebook will be expanded with a d666 table of random Touchstones to help inspire your traveler's mysterious past and portentous future. This colossal table will span six full pages and include 216 entries, ranging from the prosaic, to the preposterous, to the simply perplexing. What burdens will your traveler carry?\n$24 000 CAD (reached!)\n\"Once-Sacred Spaces\" (Stops table) by Natalie Ash \u2013 Still serene and tranquil, time and abandonment have obscured their sacred purposes. Who once worshipped in these halls, and to what gods or forces? what traces can be found and what stories can be gleaned?\n\"Performance (An Act in Six Parts)\" (Events table) by Madeleine Ember \u2013 Rejoice! An esteemed circus troupe is en route to Cerebos, and they\u2019ve made themselves at home. Marvel at the woman made of ribbon and her scintillating dance of wonder! Behold the cunning mouse circus and learn the secrets of your very own rafters! Meet a lion, a juggler, a shadow, and more!\n$27 000 CAD (reached!)\nIntroductory comic by Cynthia Yuan Cheng.

This time around, we're keeping it straightforward: simple rewards, simple add-ons, and stretch goals that just add more of what we're already doing. We've also taken several steps to ensure that nobody is left hanging:\n\nFirst, we're not trying to sell you the *idea* of a game. \"Cerebos: The Crystal City\" is already written, playtested, edited, illustrated, and has been given a first-pass layout, and that version of the game will be in your hands in digital form immediately after the campaign ends. If the project funds and the following week we all get run over by a train, you'll still have a playable (and very pretty!) game in hand.\n\nSecond, we've ensured that all physical rewards can be printed under one roof, and we've kept things local \u2013 as in within-driving-distance-of-our-office local \u2013 rather than going overseas for cheaper options. That means we've been obliged to make our physical rewards a little pricier than they've been in the past, but it also means that we have a level of accountability that wouldn't be possible otherwise. \n\nFinally, as always, Penguin King Games has a no-questions-asked refund policy for late projects. If we're even one day past our target delivery date, and you don't have 100% of your promised rewards in hand, you can ask for a refund and you'll get it within 24 hours.

The GM takes some time between sessions to link ideas and inspiration to each of the unique Story Tokens. During play the GM can see when players have these tokens in hand and quickly review their notes, so that when the Story Token is played they can weave in the connected ideas. That one play might trigger a subtle ongoing effect, a surprising twist, or a world-changing event!\nEvery session the makeup of The Well evolves - Tokens played and avoided are matched into the pool and the GM can add more Story Tokens based on their ongoing prep. \nThe Well in play\nThe Zine\nThe rules are complete and tested, and we are adding more examples of play as we head into layout. And while The Well looks great as a big bowl brimming with glass beads and trinkets, we can't quite pack all that in an envelope - the Zinequest edition will include a tear-out sheet with tokens and note sheets to plan your sessions. We have firmed up the layout at 24 pages, including a heavier cover and an example setup. The tokens will be an extra cardstock sheet included, tucked inside, so you don't need to chop up the zine to play the quickstart.\nI will be handling the printing locally and mailing personally to avoid delays & logistics issues and to roll my sleeves up making a zine. The PDF will be same content as the printed zine, in printer-friendly layout for duplication at home. If we expand content (i.e. with additional prewritten setups) beyond what can be mailed at the planned rates, we will making it available in the PDF.\nRewards\nKeeping it simple! Every pledge includes a PDF of the Zine, with delivery via Itch.io .\nPledges at the Physical (Hold it in your hands / Heaping Handful) levels include one PDF code for each physical copy, and the Heaping Handful level lets you team up with friends to soften the shipping. For physical I will be able to ship in standard document envelopes and avoid most of the nightmares of international borders.\nFunded! Onward and upward: Stretch Goals\n$666 - At this auspicious goal, printed versions will also get an unrelated but fun (dis)loyalty card to use with their Mork Borg* campaigns as a tracker for Miseries. These business card sized trackers will be laminated for reuse, if one apocalypse isn't enough! \nMork Borg Bonus Mockup\n$1000 - I will double up the pre-written setups, adding a second sheet of Story Tokens and connected prompts. These will be included for both print and PDF.\nAgain, simplicity is key here and I want to focus on the promised content of the zine!\n\nNotes: After development and launch I was notified of another project with the same \"The Well\" title. I'm glad our campaigns didn't overlap! So for clarity - the two projects are entirely unrelated, but you should also check out their game about delving and plunder.\n* Nechrubucks/Eskalating Eskatons is an independent production by Shawn McCarthy and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games or Stockholm Kartell.

Raze the Woodland to the ground as the fearsome Lord of the Hundreds, or recover precious relics from this destructive conflict as the Keepers in Iron. Explore dozens of faction combinations, including many new head-to-head matchups with the hirelings and advanced setup cards. New and experienced players have never had so many ways to enjoy Root!\nThe Keepers in Iron are an order of itinerant warriors who have come to the Woodland to recover ancient relics. To find them, they must manage their Woodland contacts carefully, as only the local animals know how to find the relics they seek. Paragons of discipline, their warriors sport pristine armor of a quality rarely seen here, making them a terror in battle. However, to keep their forces well-supplied and mobile, they must maintain a network of caravans and waystations.\nClaiming to be the true voice of the Woodland, the Lord of the Hundreds spreads distrust and division among its inhabitants, inciting torch-wielding mobs to destroy the enemies of their righteous dominion. His swarming army can overwhelm all but the toughest defense. By looting items from the undeserving and adding them to his towering hoard, his power grows as he develops an increasingly fearsome monomania.\nRoot's hirelings lend their services to factions willing to pay the price. Court the Marquise's infamous Forest Patrol or sway the rampaging Last Dynasty from the Eyrie to join your cause. Whether you are playing with two players or six, the hirelings are sure to offer you exciting new ways to play Root. \nDiscover new corners of the world of Root.  Fight for control of the cosmopolitan Free City of Root or attempt to secure influence over the Black Market. Build buildings among the Elder Treetops or secure the Legendary Forge. Each landmark offers players new strategic challenges and tactical possibilities. Best of all, they work with each of Root's four maps!\nWith your support in 2019, the Underworld Kickstarter brought Root to more players than ever before. In the years since the game\u2019s release, Root continues to enjoy a vibrant and welcoming community of old and new players alike.\nAt Leder Games, we are deeply grateful for this community. Because of you all, we can keep food on our tables and the lights on at the office. You also give us space to take risks and develop new games. And, perhaps best of all, your support means that we can continue exploring the world of Root!\nRoot: The Marauder Expansion is the next chapter in the series. The expansion offers two new factions: the Lord of the Hundreds and the Keepers in Iron. Both factions are designed to work seamlessly with all previous factions and provide players with unique gameplay challenges and the dramatic, narrative-first asymmetry that has become a hallmark of Root\u2019s design.\nThe expansion also introduces the hireling system. This is a gameplay option that can be used at any player count and faction mix. Hirelings are perfect for folks wanting the experience of Root as a two-player contest or who want to inject their multiplayer games with even more combos and color from the game\u2019s wider world.\nRoot is a fully asymmetric strategy board game designed by Cole Wehrle, lavishly illustrated by Kyle Ferrin, and brought to life by the team at Leder Games. Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. In Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability.    \nTo understand how Root integrates with all of our products in this campaign, as well as our current existing expansions, please refer to our New to Root Chart.\nRoot is currently in-stock and available on our webstore for most regions. (For North American backers, we have a pre-order open for late Spring delivery.) If you want to obtain a copy as fast as possible, check with your Friendly Local Game Store or consider ordering from our site. For other expansions and products, you can order directly from our webstore or visit your neighborhood game seller. We will not offer an \u201cAll-In\u201d pledge, or include previous releases as add-ons for this campaign. \nAt Leder Games, we are committed to sharing our design process openly. As with campaigns in the past, we'll be releasing preview kits both as print-and-play files and mods for Tabletop Simulator. The first kit will be released on Thursday the 25th, and the second will arrive on the week following. \nClick here to download the preview kit!\n\nIf you are looking for players, you can find a huge community over on Leder Games' official Discord channel, the Woodland Warriors. \nShipping will be charged post-campaign in Backerkit.\n\nCustoms and Duty-Free Shipping\nLeder Games will pre-pay the duties and taxes for the backers who receive their games in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia. All other countries or regions may be subject to additional customs fees upon delivery.\n\nFor our UK friends: At this time the UK has not provided a mechanism that will allow this type of pre-payment for crowdfunded projects fulfilling after June 2021. We are working with our VAT agency to find a solution, but at this time there is not one available. It is likely that by the time we\u2019re making plans for fulfillment there will not be additional VAT, but we cannot promise this with the ongoing legislation changes. We are keeping a close eye on developments, and will provide updates as we are able during the campaign and leading up to fulfillment.

Here is my story:\nLockdown has been tough on everyone, and people have tried to find different ways to fill their time whilst stuck in their homes. This is what led me to designing and writing Captain's Log.\nI was inspired by the classic opening moments of every episode of Star Trek TNG, and those immortal words..\n\"Captain's Log..\"\nThat always let you know, you were in for an out of this world adventure, and I wanted to simulate the fun and excitement of those missions.\n\nCaptain\u2019s Log is a solo journaling RPG where you find yourself in the command of a ship, its crew embarking on a vast mission through space. \nThe limits to this mission are defined by your imagination, and the stories you bring to life.\nPlaying the Captain's Log is simple and offers hours of creative storytelling fun.\n\nCaptain's log has two modes:\nCampaign\nA 50 entry mission journalling adventure where you will be given the scenario outline of each log entry. Each of these entries will journel a mission, a day and event of note onboard your very own ship.\nFrom there it's up to you to decide where the story goes and what twists and turns await the ship and its crew.\n\nScenario Generation\nThese are one off scenarios that can just be generated by simply using a 6 sided dice, or failing that the random number sheet located at  the end of this RPG.\nThis system will see you generate a unique combination that becomes your scenario.\nThe system will give you:\nA location\nA Plot Event\nA Subplot\nThen as with the campaign the rest is up to you. \nThese can be played in single stand alone missions, or perhaps you want to chain them together and make another campaign to take your crew on.\n \nThis project is for anyone who enjoys creative writing.\nOr perhaps someone with a simple love of SCI-FI, who doesn\u2019t know just how creative they can be.\nThe results of your \u2018Captain\u2019s Log\u2019 can be as public or as private, as long or as short as you decide. Writing each entry should be a way to challenge yourself into being creative. You might expand characters and plots over the full campaign, or might just take it one scenario at a time and see where you take your adventure.\n\nThis RPG can be played however you want, and I encourage you to be creative. \nBut every new scenario dictates an adventure, a fresh scenario for you to bring to life.\nThen with each entry you make the world around you and your characters will grow, becoming ever more vivid as you journal the history of your ship, and it\u2019s colourful crew.\nTo start the campaign:\nYou pick your crew\nYou design your ship\nYou create new alien races\nYou create a nemesis, and give them a back story\nYou decide your ships mission\nPerhaps you'll borrow ideas from mainstream SCI-FI?

Archival Print No. 5\nIt\u2019s no secret that Japan has been high on the destination hit-list of many travellers and travel magazines for a number of years. Japan has seen a boom in tourism numbers of the past decade, subsequently causing more problems than benefits in certain areas. Our focus at STORIED is on creating sustainable change - actively combatting the country\u2019s over-tourism by illuminating unique and boutique options and sharing with you, our readers, lesser-known areas of Japan. We think that this not only offers you truly exciting recommendations for travel, but also helps to foster a circular economy within local communities that want and need it. \nWe\u2019re reimagining the role of English language Japan-related content, moving away from stereotypical guides, to bring you a new take on what travel to Japan can be - intimate narratives from people who know Japan, delving deeply and broadly to bring tales of daily life and historic legacies, modern culture, and natural beauty. \nSo, whether your interest is travel, design or cultural heritage, let the pages of STORIED take you on a journey into the true heart of Japan.\n\nIndigo Skies in Kamishichiken by Rachel E T Davies. Archival Print No. 6\nAn Image from 'The Body, A Canvas' by Joe Keating. Archival Print No. 2\n\nFOUNDERS BIO\nRACHEL E T DAVIES & HANA TSUKAMOTO\nI\u2019m a British freelance journalist, photographer, and the founder of STORIED, based in Kyoto. I moved to Japan in January 2016 where I was instantly enthralled by the country where I began telling tales of Japan\u2019s storied culture; its people, places, and hideaways, both for international magazines like CN Traveler, Suitcase, and Lodestars Anthology, and my own blog, Girljin in Japan.\nIt was in 2019 that I thought of collating my knowledge into a coffee-table style journal telling stories from Japan, but it was last year, during the pandemic, that allowed me the time to focus my attention on STORIED. After meeting Hana Tsukamoto, founder of POJ Studio and Maana Homes - a design-led, vacation-home brand - in Kyoto, we realised that we were a perfect fit to bring STORIED to life, harnessing our combined cultural, travel, and design backgrounds.\nTogether we have a huge love for, and experience in, editorial design, photography, story-telling, and considered living. We want to stimulate our reader\u2019s interest in the incredible experiences that Japan has to offer, by way of a high-quality print publication whose focus is as much on design as it is on emotive and interesting content.\nPLAY\n\nPROJECT\nThis year has been strange to say the least. The State of Emergency in Japan gave us a chance to see the country in a way few of us would have before. We saw Kyoto devoid of tourists, tranquil, and beautiful. This got us thinking. Japan is a place that is often misunderstood, yet it is no longer the land of myth and mystery that it once was thought to be by outside travellers. The tourists, both domestic and foreign, which until last year arrived in droves, head to predetermined hotspots, all but ignoring the wider beauty of such a splendid archipelago. It seems like everyone is following the same itinerary, steered by media that churns out the same old content. And so it is with a conscientious heart and our own yearning to share truly new and intriguing insights into Japan, that we bring you our vision of what makes this country so spectacular.\n\nThe Kyoto Issue, 'The Tea Women of Wazuka' Mock Up\n\nWe collaborate with a talented team of creatives who call Japan home. Each issue brings you authentic content, engaging interviews, and intimate story-telling tailored to those amongst us who value the importance of investing in local communities. We want to both nurture new talent, and commission work from established creatives, so we\u2019ll be joining forces with well-known contributors, whilst also giving young talent the opportunity to have their work seen and celebrated.\nIyaGallery Orginal Watercolours by STORIED collaborator, Emilie Van Camp\nFor the launch of STORIED we were determined to include places rarely written about, rarely talked about, and rarely seen. Our first print issue takes us on a journey across Kyoto\u2014a setting of significance as the cultural heart of Japan and the place that we at STORIED call home. Here are a few of our upcoming stories: \n\nKyoto By the Sea by Rachel E T Davies\nContemporary Tea in Ancient City by Prairie Stuart-Wolff\nEveryday Kyoto: Beauty in the Otherwise Mundane by Joe Keating\nBeauty in Brevity by @Helvetica and Mitsuru Wakabayashi\nThe Body, A Canvas by Rachel E T Davies\nOtotojet's Culinary Guide to Kyoto\nThe Journey to Self-Sufficiency by Vince Ng\nSaving the City's Machiya by Rachel E T Davies\n\nThe Kyoto Issue, 'Everyday Kyoto' Mock Up\nThe Kyoto Issue, 'Considered Cloth' Mock Up\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019ve taken the decision to forgo advertising: this was a tough decision, but one which will allow us the freedom to make STORIED exactly as we want it. We know that people still love magazines and, although global print media sales have dwindled, independent magazines have seen a rise in figures. Why? Because people are longing for authentic publications like STORIED.\nWe want to launch STORIED\u2019s print journey on Kickstarter because of the sense of community this platform encourages, and we know just how much of a team effort it takes to bring a magazine to life. Travel, too, is a collection of like-minded people coming together to enjoy a shared interest and learn new things from one another - something of the utmost importance to us at STORIED. \nInvesting in STORIED as part of the Kickstarter campaign, rather than after we launch, means we can gauge print numbers and pay our contributors and printers up front. Following the initial campaign, subsequent issues will be released quarterly and become self-sustaining. STORIED will then be available direct from our website, as a direct-to-door subscription, as well as from select stores internationally.\nTranquil Temples by Rachel E T Davies.

The challenge left for us is to get an idea of pre-orders so that we can print enough copies to satiate the demand for STORIED, then we can turn our focus to making ISSUE 2 just as outstanding as our first.\n\nThere are no risks for us in completing STORIED Issue 1, however, within magazine printing and publishing there is always a small risk of a delay due to unexpected circumstances. Of course, there is always the risk that the funding target might not be reached and so this could affect the production of STORIED Issue 2. With the coronavirus pandemic still affecting travel and daily life, there is a risk that our travel pans, even within Japan may be postponed, but we endeavour to safely and legally embark upon trips for content creation, following all rules and regulations in place. \n\nFor anyone investing in a subscription, we feel that we have to be clear that we can only deliver the full set if we sell enough of our first issues. It is our aim to go above and beyond, creating some truly compelling content, to make sure that we achieve this goal. We are confident in our work, though there is always a small risk of this happening. \n\nWe are also aware that with the pandemic still causing havoc around the world, this could cause problems for STORIED, as for many others. This could include anything from delays to travel restrictions. We are working with a team of contributors on the ground here and a printer that has the ability to stay open whilst maintaining safe social distancing.

After six months of preparing and planning, we launched our online journal at the end of last year, and in January, we turned our attention to print. Volume One, The Kyoto Issue, is an ode to the place that we call home, a love-letter to the lesser-known places of the prefecture, and our first foray into a physical publication.\n\nI have had many a moment where I thought to myself, 'are we really launching a business during a pandemic?!\" Yet, here we are! And I am so proud of what we have created with STORIED.

My hope is that STORIED brings you closer to Japan.

After many trials, you turned your back on your family legend and your inheritance in the hopes of living a simple life. But now, at the reading of your father\u2019s will, you must make a choice: return to your lineage in order to receive a priceless boon, or forever turn your back to what could have been, in order to shed the burden of your destiny.\nThe Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe is a dark, narratively fraught keepsake game about family lineage, desire, and what it means to be honor-bound to legend. Keepsake games, a genre of game newly named and defined by Jeeyon Shim and Shing Yin Khor during their collaboration on Field Guide To Memory, are defined as games created in the spirit of collaboration between the game designer and the player, wherein the player builds a beautiful, memorable artifact through the process of playing the game. Just as no two players\u2019 experiences of play could ever be identical, no two versions of the game will be exactly the same.\n\n\nIn The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe, the keepsake that players create is a messy, memory-laden family album. Honoring both the DIY, black felt marker, cut-and-paste aesthetic of zines from the early 2000s along with Jeeyon\u2019s distinct voice as a writer and game designer, the player will choose one of two journaling options depending on whether they back the print-and-play version or the mobile-only version.\n\n\nIn the print-and-play zine, players print out sections of the game text to literally cut and paste them into a journal or notebook of their choice. The cut outs are numbered but out of order, and over the course of following directions the player will figuratively and tangibly build up the layers of secrets, dark paths, and old wounds that Gideon Blythe and his lineage created in the name of holding on to the family inheritance. A combination of handwritten prompts and player-generated ephemera create the chaotic path of their character\u2019s personal history.\n\n     In the mobile only zine, players follow screen-friendly directions to create a family album with handwritten prompts, sketches, and physical ephemera they already have at home. Using old books, magazines, newspapers, even bills and receipts, black out existing text to create scattered, uneven moments from their past intermingled with their saga. Written to be a related but different experience than the print-and-play zine, the mobile edition uses a combination of handwritten prompts and repurposed household paper goods to create the story of the character\u2019s remembrance of growing up in the shadow of their father.\n\n     Both editions of the zine share the same ending, with the same hard choice.\nExample of play, describing the terminal fate of the character's beloved. Each of the house descendant cards has three possible relationships, which you define by blacking out the ones that don't apply.\nExample of ephemera, repurposed and added to the family album in the mobile-friendly zine.\nThere are four different reward levels for The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe:\n  The two digital levels are the HEIR and the BENEFICIARY. \nThe HEIR, $5 (unlimited), is the print-and-play edition PDF of the game. The BENEFICIARY, $5 (unlimited) is the mobile-friendly edition PDF of the game.\nAn array of some of the ephemera a backer might receive with one of the physical reward levels.\nThere are a few limited edition physical reward levels. At these backer levels, players receive both PDF editions of the game along with original art and hand-selected physical ephemera, to be fulfilled and shipped after the release of the PDFs. Once fully backed, these reward levels will not be made again.\nThe three physical reward levels:\nThe NOTARY, $35 (strict limit of 60) includes both PDF editions, along with the full color house descendant cards in a 5\u201dx7\u201d envelope of hand-chosen physical ephemera, such as:\nA scrap of fabric from your mother\u2019s favorite dress.\nStrands of live Spanish moss, in real life lovingly tended and grown by Jeeyon; in fiction, tokens from the witch\u2019s forest where the descendants hold their first trial.\nA feather from the golden swan: an omen of true love, and the harbinger of your meeting with your beloved.\nA large wooden splinter from a descendant's shattered shield.\nSmall, ghostly original drawings on the envelope and inner board of the packet kraft paper envelope.\nOther odds and ends as inspirations strikes me.\nThe house descendant cards in play from the NOTARY reward level.\nThe EXECUTOR, $60 (strict limit of 45) includes both PDF editions, along with the full color house descendant cards in a hand addressed rigid mailer with original art and hand chosen physical ephemera, such as:\nGideon\u2019s last words to his son (your character) written on hand aged paper; each of these letters will be different, and no two players will receive the same message\na Last Will and Testament envelope, custom printed with the game title by Blumberg Excelsior, each with a blood-red original watercolor painting on the front, and sealed with a wax stamp bearing the Blythe family crest: a haloed raven shrouded in leaves.\nFeather from the golden swan, an omen of true love and his most prized possession.\nA scrap piece of sheet music from your mother\u2019s favorite song.\nOther odds and ends of my choosing, as inspiration strikes.\nDetail of the wax seal on the custom-engraved envelope bearing Gideon Blythe's will.\nThe ESTATE, $100 (strict limit of 45) includes everything in the NOTARY and EXECUTOR rewards, along with the key to your inheritance, hung on cloth cut from a dress cut from the dawn sky, which your father had to fetch in order to win your mother\u2019s hand. The inheritance key is iron skeleton key hung on silk chiffon ribbon in blush pink tones, that can serve as a prop or bookmark for future play.\nSpread of what an ESTATE level backer might receive.\n\nNOTE ABOUT PHYSICAL REWARDS: All art and ephemera will be sent out well after the PDFs are emailed to backers. Please note the estimated delivery dates before committing to these reward levels. Additionally, art and ephemera rewards are only available domestically in the United States. As leadership of the USPS changes for the better, future Kickstarters may offer international shipping.\n\nAbout The Designer\nJeeyon Shim is a game designer and outdoor educator based in Oakland, CA. Her work grounds itself in ideas of community and stewardship of the natural world. Her notables include her collaboration with Shing Yin Khor on their connected path game, Field Guide To Memory; 2019 artist in residence at Heart of the Deernicorn in Olympia, WA; and 2019 keynote speaker at Big Bad Con. She is an enthusiastic collector of bones, folktales, old keys, and plants.\nExample of the layered memory mechanic, where players write one memory in ink a similar color to the paper of their journal, then write a simpler, less truthful memory in contrasting ink over it.\nLayered memories in an entry from the print-and-play version of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCollectively, I\u2019ve successfully completed and fulfilled 2 Kickstarter campaigns totaling over $84,619. While this is my first solo Kickstarter, which could potentially introduce unexpected challenges, the core experience of the game is fully written. Laying out the raw text in both its print-and-play and mobile only formats can reasonably be done within a couple months of the end of this campaign. \n\nEach of the physical rewards are hand-made by me, and every aspect of their creation, handling, shipping, and fulfillment will be operated out of my home office and PO box. Depending on the scale of reward backing, this may result in an additional unexpected load on my production scale in spite of the hard limits, which could in turn extend shipping timelines.\n\nBecause The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe is a keepsake game, so long as players have one of the core game texts and a journal or notebook to write, cut out of, glue ephemera into, and otherwise embellish and play with, they will be able to play the game. \n\nIf you are deathly allergic to cats please do not back the physical reward tiers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe descendant cards are printed on uncoated paper and so, if unused and undesired, can be safely recycled.\nSustainable materials\nThe Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe either asks players to print their own materials at home or repurpose existing materials like catalogs or junk mail. Both have low negative environmental impact. The art and ephemera rewards are almost entirely made with materials I already had in my goblin hoard of feathers, fabric, and interesting scrap paper, and the only newly manufactured goods involved are shipping materials, the envelopes for the EXECUTOR and ESTATE rewards, and the Descendant cards.\n\nThe cards were printed with a very local printer (located eight blocks away), and I brought them home in a granny cart; the closer to home you can get things made, the lower the carbon footprint is. \n\nOverall, I feel very good about the environmental impact of this game.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "HEIR", "descp": "At the $5 BENEFICIARY reward level, you will receive the PRINT-AND-PLAY edition of the game as a high resolution .pdf document.

Some we know about, most we don\u2019t. Sometimes, in exceptional circumstances, an ordinary object becomes imbued with magic, giving it strange powers and turning it into a Curio. You are a Collector of Curios. Why? Well, everyone has their reasons...\n\nThe Collector is a solo storytelling game/guided creative exercise, inspired by Warehouse 13, The Librarians and Artefact.\n\nThe Game\nIn this game you will take on the role of a Collector of magical items. You will draw cards and look up the corresponding prompts in the tables provided, then let your imagination run wild! You can write and/or draw the magical item you are searching for, as well as the adventures you have as you attempt to obtain it.\nThis is a game in the loosest sense of the word, a more accurate description might be a guided creative exercise. But either way, it is entirely an excuse to live out your fantasies of being a Warehouse Agent or a Librarian!\n\nWhat you need to play:\n\u00b7 The Collector zine, either physical or digital edition\n\u00b7 A deck of standard playing cards, jokers included\n\u00b7 Something to write/draw on and with\n\u00b7 Lots of imagination!\n\nThe Zine\nThe printed zine will be a 16 page A6 saddle stitched booklet.\nIf we reach the initial funding goal of \u00a3100, the physical zine will be printed on 160gsm recycled paper, with a 300gsm brown Kraft paper front and back cover.\n\nThe Stretch Goals\n\u00a3250 - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach the stretch goal of \u00a3250 then the cover of the zine will be upgraded to a 270gsm colour paper (colour to be decided by backer vote) with a holographic foil detail on the front cover. Everybody say ooooooh, shiny! (This will be at no extra cost to backers, the cost of the physical reward will not change.)\n\u00a3300 - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach \u00a3300 I will commission the talented artist Ren Fong (@sinksanksockie) to create an illustration which will likely end up being the cover illustration.\n\u00a3650 - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach \u00a3650 funding, all backers at a physical reward tier will also receive an A6 notebook in which they can play The Collector. The notebooks will be 48 pages, with a 300gsm brown kraft recycled cover and 90gsm plain white recycled paper inside.\n\u00a31000 - TENTATIVELY UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach \u00a31000 funding I think that will be enough to also have the outer cover of the notebooks printed with shiny foil as well. Although this stretch goal is dependant on my having correctly estimated the shipping costs!\n\nThe Rewards\nDigital Version - \u00a32\nYou will receive a digital PDF of the game. In fact you will receive two PDFs, one standard version and one more accessible version with larger print and dyslexia friendly font and colours.\nAfter the campaign is over I will put the digital version of the game up for sale on itch.io, so even if this campaign is not successfully funded you will still be able to get your hands on this digital version if you would like to play.\nPhysical Version - \u00a34\nYou will receive a physical copy of the zine in the post (details above) as well as the digital PDF copies.\n2 x Physical Version - \u00a38\nIf you want to get a copy for you and a copy for a friend you can do that here.

The job: transport goods from one location to another while avoiding delays, hazardous traps and anomalies, dangerous weather effects, and those who would steal your precious cargo.\nSomeone you don't want to meet on the job...\nCourier is a solo RPG telling the story of your rise from a lowly single-bag-Courier all the way up to a Legendary Wasteland Deliverer. You will create your own company, logo, and style as you complete delivery jobs across the New North American continent. Along the way you will discover new contacts, jobs, charms, equipment and upgrades to your Courier Rig while growing your reputation as a reliable company.\n\nEach job you complete will reward you Reputation, a cryptocurrency of the near future. The more people respect you for doing a job well done, the higher your Reputation rises. All types of tools, equipment and accessories can be purchased with this currency to prepare you for everything the world has to throw at you. There are many jobs deemed too dangerous for many Couriers, but they need to get done and offer many higher rewards for those with the courage and know-how. \n\nYou get to choose which delivery missions to take, the length of the journey, and what you need to complete it by customizing your character. Along the way you may discover missing cargo left by would-be Couriers, which you can take to deliver at your end point and net extra Reputation or other rewards. Don't forget that dodging strange weather patterns, Scavengers, time-and-space anomalies and difficult terrain are all part of the Couriers job description. Something new lies around each corner...\nThe Gameplay\nThis zine will use a deck of standard playing cards, 2D6 dice, a player marker (meeple, coin, token, etc.), and your character sheet. Players will build their play field at the start of each mission. Each time you move a new location is revealed and event occurs - some offering choices for you to make. Each suit (Hearts, Spades, Clubs, Diamonds) will provide a balance of \"good\" and \"bad\" events while providing players a different experience each time they setup and play.\n\nPlayers are rewarded based on the mission difficulty, length, extra cargo they found and original cargo they had to deliver. Exploring more of the world offers more opportunities for a bigger payout and the chance to experience something in the world that you would have missed.\n\nEach choice will boost your skills as a Courier and stay with you through your entire playtime. All information is tracked on your character sheet, which acts as a historical record of you as a Courier and the company you have created in the world. Retire at any time and pick from the legacy list to have a lasting impact on the world for your next playthroughs! \nThe Zine\nMy previous project, Wandering Dreams, was printed in A5 format which I was very happy with for the total length, under 30 pages. I will do the same this time around but with improved paper and print quality to give an overall better feel, both done by a professional Canadian printer company.\n\nCover will be full colour on front and back. Interior is planned to be printed with black ink on off-white or coloured paper. I am also looking at foil font for the front and back cover if possible through my local printing companies!\nIllustrations\n\nIllustrations and artwork will be done by Sammy Winona (they/them). All artwork will be shared through updates over the campaigns length and beyond.

With every backer, at every level, I will be giving 2 copies to the community at no extra cost for the backers.\nStretch Goals\nThis project has a small goal in mind but can easily be scaled up for more exciting features and content! The current list:\n\n$801 CAD - Spotify Playlist (All Backers)\nFunded + $1! I will celebrate by creating a playlist for all backers on Spotify. This will mainly be the songs I have listened to while creating Courier and fit the ambience of the world I have envisioned.\n\n$1,000 CAD - Additional Character Sheet (All Physical Backers)\n2 copies of the character sheet will be included on high quality paper stock for all physical level backers.\n\n$1,250 CAD - Stickers (All Physical Backers)\nFeaturing chosen sketches from my final collection of art (TBD).\n\n$1,500 CAD - Postcards (All Physical Backers)\nMini-art prints on postcards! \n\n$2,000 CAD - More Artwork (All Backers)\nI will commission more art to be included across the entirety of the zine, allowing for a larger overall zine.\n\n$2,500 CAD - Upgraded Character Sheet (All Backers)\nThe character sheet will be upgraded with better layouts, art, and paper quality for physical backers.\n\n$3,000 CAD - Anomalies References (All Backers)\nA field guide to the anomalies found by Couriers across their travels.

They\u2019re not related but then suddenly they are.\n\nZine #1:\nFollow\n...is a game I first made and released for my patrons in 2016. It\u2019s a love letter to getting intentionally lost in strange cities, paying a playful kind of attention to one\u2019s surroundings, and to experiencing familiar places in new ways. It\u2019s for one player, but a group could each have their own experiences and then talk about it after. \nFollow is played by interpreting the prompts of a \u201cgeographic recipe,\u201d of which several are included. Here\u2019s one typed into the body of this kickstarter page:\n\nA Quiet Darkness\n1. Stand until you begin leaning in a direction, & walk that way. \n2. When you reach a lot of information, bear left. \n3. Follow the shadow-direction. \n4. Whistling? \n5. Go away from the big moving things. \n6. Go right around the barrier. \n7. Listening as the sound drops away. \n8. Low down. \n9. A quiet darkness. \n\nAnd the rules talk about how to interpret the steps, how to treat the list of prompts like a recipe and make appropriate substitutions for your particular situation. One can experiment with the same recipe in different contexts: imagine how that recipe would play in a public park, or in one\u2019s own living room.\nI really like this game, and it's been enjoyed by folks in a variety of places. A college professor uses the game to give incoming students unique moments on their new campus. Here\u2019s a link to a play experience by a fl\u00e2neur in Oslo.\n\n\"With each game Jackson designs, they brilliantly redefine what's possible in storytelling games, and Follow is no exception.\" Dr. Josh Laison, Mathematics, Willamette University \nAs far as the rules text is concerned, I\u2019ve got a few clarifications I want to make, including the addition of several more recipes. But it's mostly done. \n\n\nZine #2:\nFollowing yourself back from the edge of your life\nCONTENT WARNING: activities to safely navigate back from suicidal ideation. Maybe this zine is something you\u2019d rather avoid looking at, or maybe it's something to face directly. I bet that folks dealing with other forms of depression and anxiety will also find something useful here.\n\nWith the pandemic, loneliness, the climate catastrophe, winter, our personal mental health challenges, and abundant grief for all we\u2019ve already lost, we\u2019re living through a difficult time- and some folks are trying really, really hard to live through it.\nI've survived a couple of close folks' suicides and I deal with times of suicidal ideation myself, and I'm holding this weight in my heart and in my arms, and I can carry it. And I'm looking at all this dense emotion through my game designer lens, and I'm working with it, and this is the form it's taking right now.\nThis is a zine of reframes and activities that might help navigate those difficult paths; to help you walk back from the edge of your life. I\u2019ve got routines that I do when my suicidal ideation kicks up, and this zine includes stuff that I\u2019ve found helpful as well as stuff that a couple of friends have shared with me and new stuff I\u2019ve jotted down as I\u2019ve been pulling ideas together.\nIn some ways these activities are like the geographic recipes above: the idea is to modify them when necessary so they\u2019re appropriate to your own context and challenges. You\u2019ll probably find some that seem wholesome or fun regardless as to your brain\u2019s mental health challenges, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll read some and just shrug, like, why would that be useful. But maybe some will help. \nHey though: this isn't a robust and complete solution to suicidal ideation, it\u2019s just a zine.\nBut zines have always been lifelines, have always been ways for folks in turmoil to kindle sparks of hope inside themselves and take steps into a previously unimagined future. Much thanks to those zinesters who helped me get through my younger years. It wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\nThe Zines Themselves\nBoth of these zines will be simultaneously ULTRA FANCY and EXQUISITELY SHABBY, insomuch as I\u2019ll be revisiting the punk aesthetics of my early zinester days but sparkling them up with a bunch of foil accents which I am EXTREMELY excited about.\nCurrently each zine is 36 pages, we\u2019ll see if that changes.\nThe two are going to be a very handsome set together, sharing a design aesthetic & maybe a few other details.\nBlack & white & shiny, mmmm.\nThe pdfs won\u2019t be, like, shiny due to, you know, technology.\nBut they\u2019ll be great too in their own ways.\n\n\nWho\u2019s Doing This\nI\u2019m Jackson Tegu, I make games (patreon.com/jacksontegu) and I\u2019ve made a lot of other things at various points, including zines. I even did zine-making workshops at a youth center we all hung around at. Uh, I\u2019m non-binary, and that\u2019s like kinda new for me to share. (he or they) Wooo. I care very, very much about people and play and connection, and this winter has really been rather incredibly hard, but I\u2019m still here, and if you\u2019re reading this then you\u2019re still here too, and if that deserves applause then I\u2019m applauding.\nI\u2019m working with Aven from Tabletop Hotdish to print these two zines, and ey explained how the magic sparkly process works and my eyes lit right up. The excuse to work with em is a big part of why this project is actually coming to light. Tabletop Hotdish will also be handling the physical mail out.\nThe original pixel art logo was made by Graypawn, and seeing it in his \u2018unused\u2019 folder (when i visited him at a print shop where he worked, how classic) was the spark which started this project years ago. Thanks, Grapes!\nThere\u2019ll be some zine-y illustrations by a dear old punk friend who has barely succeeded in remaining alive on a few occasions, and I\u2019m so fucking glad they\u2019re still with us. They\u2019re deciding if they\u2019ll remain anonymous on this project.\nMaybe there\u2019ll be a few doodles and photos by me, or by other folks? I\u2019m flowing with the process, we\u2019ll see how it goes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaybe I\u2019ll be crushed by depression and never finish a game again. But somehow I peel myself off the floor pretty much every month to publish a new game via my patreon, so probably this won\u2019t happen. \n\nMaybe my perfectionism will freeze out my ability to move forward on this. Ok, but Aha! I\u2019ve given myself permission to make it exquisitely shabby, so I\u2019ll just bathe in the errors and be pleased about it. #LifeHacks \n\nWhat if the USPS gets shut down by the Postmaster General? Oh I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening anymore. \n\nWait, what if the foil accents don\u2019t heat-set properly and flake off quickly or gradually? Baby, this wretched old world tries to take the sparkle off of all of us, and you can turn your pages real gently, and you can enjoy the shine while it lasts, and you can also just break out the crayons and add some new accents when the old ones fall away.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nPaying queer entrepreneurs.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "PDF of Follow", "descp": "A few different PDFs of the game Follow for ease of screen reading, printing, etc.\nINCLUDES:\nPDFs of Follow", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 18 or more", "title": "PDFs of Follow & Following...", "descp": "A few different PDFs (for ease of screen reading, printing, etc) of the game Follow and also the activity & idea zine Following yourself back from the edge of your life.\nINCLUDES:\nPDFs of Follow\nPDFs of Following...", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["37 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Print zine of Follow", "descp": "The beautiful and shiny print version of Follow!

You'd just crossed over the Abyssal Shelf when a storm rose up from nowhere. The Sea batted your two-masted Ringrunner like a mouse in Her paws, and you went overboard without anyone's notice. Heedless, your little ship left you to drown in dark water., but that was not to be your fate. You were seized by a writhing, barnacled limb and shoved past wiry baleen. Eaten. Nestled, for a time, in a diaphanous bladder\u2014you felt the dive, the pressure, and the scraping as your gelatinous prison slipped through a crack in the sea floor.  Then you were coughed out onto alien sand. Foreign surf lapped at your feet. Unknown stars hung above in an endless twilight.\n\nWelcome to Glimmer's Rim.\n\nNo one finds themselves idly upon these shores. It is the island where the Ocean hides her heart, and she guards it jealously. A desert isle whose sand is sewn with gold, jewels and the bones of empires. Come and find your fortune. Escape, if you can.\nThe Rim is a gonzo treasure-trove of an island at the bottom of the sea, with ~25 distinct hexes and a short dungeon to explore. The players will find themselves the newly acquired pets of the Salt Mother, who is the sea. In search of a way home they will encounter ancient truths, unholy horrors and enough priceless artifacts that their escape will surely not go unnoticed by the god that they are robbing.\n\nOur goal with Glimmer's Rim is to create an adventure that is both practical in function and deeply enjoyable to read through. The hexcrawl is designed to be a systemless, free-form environment with memorable anchors that allow referees to quickly ingest a space and allow their players to explore it. The hexes are less important as a codification of space and distance, and more as a boundary within which the players will always find:\n\n Something to interact with,\nSomething obvious to explore, \n& something hidden to find. \n\nOn a hex-by-hex basis the referee should be able to rationalize \"the next logical thing happen\" upon each future visit and find plenty of fun interplay between hexes. It's like a pointcrawl with maximum interconnectivity.\n\n There will be dope black & white art on (almost) every spread, maps for the island and the corpse-dungeon that lies beneath it,  and monster stat cards for both 5e and a more easily-adaptable OSR system (Probably Labyrinth Lord or DCC but if y'all have strong enough opinions on that front leave us a comment and we'll take it into consideration).\n\n\nWIP of a spread from the Dunes showing layout, content & style\n\nSo. What do you get when you buy Glimmer's Rim? Here's the breakdown:\nAn easily utilized/repurposed/cannibalized pocket domain of a Sea God.\nA handful of misfit NPCs who's personalities engage and clash with each other--The Mockingbird, a clockwork mimic; Tuppence & Ponder, twin crustacean booksellers; Jacquese, a nautical storyteller, compelled to appear guilty of all crimes.\n ~30 bizarre & unique monsters that each have a novel effect on combat, including the Trapdoor Komodo, a swarm of Psychotropic Damselflies , & the Pariah Bear. \n Tables for useful, distinguishing artifacts & evocative treasure.\nFour distinct areas to explore, each subdivided into their own areas of interest.\nEach of these four areas has its own ecology, dangers, mysteries, and enticements:\n\nThe Dunes--A shining, technicolor crescent of beach, lapped by the wine-dark waters of the bay. Each scoop of sand holds coin and gem, painted china, chiseled marbled, hammered bronze. Statues poke scatter-shod in basalt mazes and pastel swirls of coral creep up the beach to breath salt air. A giant rusted cage sits half-buried at the treeline, and this is where the civilized castaways make their home.\n\nFar to the south, the brave may find a hidden cave yawn from between the ill-fitting embrace of two frozen waves of magma. Inside, there is truth to be found, hidden in natural mirrors of black glass.\nMidnight Pit by Robert Allen Burns\n\n\nBayou Vesper--Where roots soak black in stagnant silt, their rotten husks adorned in purple flowers. The scent of ripe persimmon steeps heavy in hot air.  Sick-sweet spice glints in the still water, eddying itself in secret patterns. Even skin contact is enough to loose your mind of the fetters of sanity. This is the realm of Dame Bailfaisante, The Exalted Maw, and the whole swamp is held in a phantasm of her creation. Even the trees sway and the earth itself hums to her tune.\n\n Deep within the bayou a light flashes through the vines, its colour indescribable. It is the knucklebone of a stillborn god, and no sun will bear to look upon it.\n\nThe Heliophage by Robert Allen Burns\nThe Tangle--The gnarled tail of a world-splitting tree reaches out its seed-encrusted roots like twisting, bony fingers  up into the eternal dusk. The pitiless thicket knots its branches ever tighter unto its center; where a core of bent bark spits loose a mountainous alien limb of fossil stone. The crook of an arm? A bent knee? Perhaps it is high conceit to presume a form familiar to that of a man.\n\nSomewhere in this labyrinthine corpse of a jungle, hides the last vestiges of the Salt-Pact. They kidnap, hunt or entice their victims, only wanting them for their meat. Flesh, bone, viscera and sinew--all grisly fuel to reanimate the mortal remains of their beloved Salt Mother. Speaking of...\nCharm Tree by Robert Allen Burns\n\n\nMother's Embrace--A cramped dungeon inside the Salt Mother's petrified corpse. At it's center lies the very core of the Rim, and the Salt Mother herself--The Heart of The Sea. The effects of the Pact's perverse sorcery are evident everywhere, and the Saltborn better hurry. The Pact isn't far from completing it's goals, and that's sure to enrage the Salt Mother. She shed her bones long ago. She had no desire to be returned unto them.\n\nShe is The Sea now.\n\n\n\nCheck out a sample PDF of The Dunes:\nIf you want to see more of our art & writing:\n We'll also be releasing some random sneak peeks throughout the campaign on our social media, so if you want some freebie monsters and items or to take a look at some of the sketches you can get by backing the $45 tier, you can check that out here:\n\n GLASS//CUTTER INSTAGRAM \n GLASS//CUTTER TWITTER \n TYLER'S TWITTER \nMock-up of the \"Revelers 'Neath the Star-Stone\" tier\nSince the planned page count for Glimmer's Rim stretches a little past the comfort zone of our current guillotine cutter & book stapler, we'll be printing our book via Mixam. If you're a regular purchaser of RPG zines, I bet you've already got some of their work on your bookshelf. Since I've never had any problems with their printing in the stuff I've purchased from others, that's what we're going with. \n\nRobbie has kindly offered his time to do some sketches for backers who throw us a couple extra bucks. They'll all be thematically linked to the Rim, being monsters, or characters, items or landmarks. \nOriginal inks for the \"Bearers of Welcomed Flesh\" tier. Cards and map are included in this tier!\n\nWe also have some original art from the book available for people who want to throw us some real cash.\n\nRight now, we only have two stretch goals planned:\n\n REACHED! $2000 - A Real Boy Map \nIt will be something that looks diegetic; like a prop from the world.  Marked up and full of notes from a past adventurer of the Rim. physical backers can expect a folded 11x17. It will, of course, also be included in pdf form for the Saltborn. \n\nOur maps will be drawn by our good friend Qwynto! (https://www.qwynto.com/)\n\n REACHED! $3500 - Individual Stat Cards \n Each monster will get it's own separate stat card so you can run 'em quick and easy at the table! They'll each be printed on tarot-dimension playing cards with art on one side (where applicable) and stats on the other.\nMock up of the 5e Stat Card for Myrka--a drowned revenant\nBecause Kickstarter makes it hard to indicate what tiers get cards once launched here's a list of what tiers you can back & expect cards:\nRevelers 'Neath the Star-Stone\nBearers of Welcomed Flesh\nZealous Librarians (Retailer)\nFaces of Dead Gods\nThe Rukh\nA Waterlogged Chest of Books\n\n $5000 - A Soundtrack! \nMe & Robbie will produce four ambient, looping tracks--one for each area of the Rim! \nThe Rookery by Robert Allen Burns\n\nIf you guys just love-bomb us with money, we'll come up with some more stretch goals, but we don't want to run into the Kickstarter trap of promising so much that the campaign gets slogged down in its newfound grandiosity. \nThe production team for Glimmer's Rim is just about as small as a team can be. We are:\n\nRobert Allen Burns: Art & Design\n\nTyler Lamb (me!): Writing, Editing, Layout, Cartography.\n\nAnd that's it! Per our stretch goals, we may bring in some more talent if we get enough attention, but for the most part it's a two-person team. Right now, I've got about 10,000 words done, which puts me at about halfway to completion. Robbie's got ~1/3rd of the art done. We want to be up front with you about how much work is left, but we feel we've got a reasonable timeline set for the campaign. Part of the beauty of Zine Quest (for us) is that we can make room in our freelancing schedule to knock out this adventure faster than we otherwise could.\n\nOur tentative Schedule looks like this:\nMarch - Kickstarter wraps, full draft of writing is completed.\nApril - Maps finished, Playtesting begins\nMay & June -  First round of edits, Beta tests, Final edit.\nJuly - Art complete, Final Layout complete.\nAugust - Trial print & revisions if necessary.\nSeptember - Start Shipping.\nBillets by Robert Allen Burns\nOur current shipping rates are $5 for US shipping and $12 for International.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe positive side of the logistical worries is that me and Robbie are experienced with producing and printing physical media.

Just \u20ac2,000 separates us from the record books (most funded wine publishing project ever on Kickstarter). Will we make it?\nWhat would you think of, if we said the words \"Portuguese wine\" to you? \nMost people would probably think of something sweet and red (port wine) or a bargain-priced, fizzy white (Vinho Verde).\n\nBut Portugal is so much more than just Port wine or cheap Vinho Verde. It's full of exciting and diverse wines, traditions and stories to tell. Yet we're consistently surprised at how few people have penetrated the surface of this rich culture and its vinous treasures.\nMaybe that's because there's never been a book that really penetrates the soul of Portuguese wine - a way for other people to fall in love with the country like we did.\nWe decided it\u2019s time to write that book. \n\nFoot Trodden will take you on a journey from Portugal\u2019s past to its future and from north to south. Over the last three years, we travelled the entire country to find the most compelling narratives and the winemakers who are putting Portugal on the global map. Now, we want to convey that experience to you, on the page.\n\nWe unearthed ancient traditions and winemaking methods (like foot treading) that look like they came from the last century. But we also met dynamic young winemakers who are taking this rich heritage and making it uniquely their own.\n\nFor a book to really transport you, it has to connect you with the story. Think of Foot Trodden more like a novel, less like a text-book. But while words are important, images convey emotions. So with a photogenic country like Portugal, we\u2019ve included a generous number of Ryan's specially taken photos to provide you with the ultimate armchair travel experience.\nBeautiful organic vineyards at Vadio, Bairrada\nFoot Trodden is our second collaboration. We crowdfunded our first book, Amber Revolution - How the world learned to love orange wine, right here on Kickstarter - and it\u2019s become one of the most successful wine books ever to launch from this platform.\n\nNot only did we deliver Amber Revolution on time and on budget, it also got top billing in the New York Times and won a coveted Roederer wine writing award. It's been translated into five different languages and is about to be reprinted for the third time.\nWill you help us make Foot Trodden an even bigger success?\n WHY ARE WE CROWDFUNDING? \nSelf publishing and crowdfunding allows us to have a direct link with you, our audience, and we believe that results in a better book. This model gives us far more creative and editorial control, so we can deliver the book that we know Portugal deserves.\n\nFoot Trodden isn\u2019t just for wine fans. It\u2019s a book about Portugal and its history, seen through the lens of wine.  We've put together the same crack team of designers and editors who brought you Amber Revolution, to ensure that it's a beautifully designed book too - one that you can't resist picking up and browsing, before settling in for a good read.\nIf you missed the opportunity to travel in 2020, Foot Trodden will help fill that gap, from the comfort and safety of your home.\n\nFor the wine-geeks amongst you, we haven't stinted on the technical information though! There's plenty of detail on the wines and the winemaking methods.\nFoot Trodden is for you whether you are wine curious or wine expert.\nExcerpt from Chapter 2 - D\u00e3o (click to enlarge)\nTHE REWARDS\nWhen you support this project, you'll be one of the first people on the planet to get this book in your hands (way before the official publication date). And every supporter gets their name printed in the acknowledgements section of the book, as an extra special thank you.\nThere are some special treats on offer. We\u2019ll be hosting an exclusive luxury tour of Portugal\u2019s Alentejo wine region in November 2021 (travel restrictions permitting). We\u2019ll take you into the vineyards with the winemakers to taste and discover the real Portugal for yourself.\nOur handpainted 'azulejo' tile with the Foot Trodden motif\nDon't miss the custom made azulejo-style tile. It's the perfect memento that you helped make this book happen, and a link to another of Portugal's artisan traditions. These tiles are being manufactured and hand-painted for us specially for this project\nThe tile features our foot treading motif from the front cover design. PLEASE NOTE - as the tile is hand-painted, you may notice small variations between the sample design shown above and the final item. This can include slight colour variations as this is a handmade item.\nMockup showing the framed art print\nWe love art prints, so we decided to make a super limited edition based on the book's front cover design. There are only (and will only ever be) 50 of these babies and they are gorgeous: Hand numbered and printed on heavy 300 gram archival paper, using the gicl\u00e9e technique to ensure they will last for many decades. You won't be disappointed, your walls will love you.\nFoot Trodden - Fine art print (image)\nWe're also offering a high quality 100% organic cotton T-shirt with our stylised tile design. You can select your size and cut at the end of the campaign!\nT-shirt front (logo) and back (text)\nWe will give you the chance to add additional rewards to your pledge, before the campaign ends. So if you decide you want to add an extra book or a T-shirt, we'll make it possible.\n\nIf you'd like a larger quantity of the book, or any other customised reward bundle, please contact us and we'll make it happen.\n WHAT'S IN THE BOOK \nThrough eight chapters and roughly 250 pages, Foot Trodden takes you on a journey from north to south, from the past to the future. The diversity of characters, landscapes and wines will have you salivating for your next bottle of Portuguese wine - and dreaming of the moment when you visit these historic winemaking regions.\nSome examples:\nMeet a Parisian with Portuguese heritage, who almost has a nervous breakdown as he tries to breath new life into century-old abandoned vineyards in the D\u00e3o.\nAn art teacher discovers a love of wine via his meetings with a Buddhist monk, and decides to grow grapes in the wettest part of Portugal, following Steiner\u2019s biodynamic philosophy.\nA winemaker near Lisbon keeps a unique medieval wine style alive, even though it took 20 years to convince the EU to give it legal status.\nIn the Alentejo, a secret society thrives in several small villages where a clay pot winemaking tradition lifts the lid on 2,000 years of history. \nProfessor Arlindo - a leading talha winemaker and his winemaker daughter Teresa\nExcerpt from Chapter 2 - Alentejo (click to enlarge)\n\nWHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?\nOur funding goal of \u20ac9,900 will cover the first printing of Foot Trodden. If we only raise this amount, we will fund additional costs (design, editing and layout) from other sources including our own pockets. Our core project costs total \u20ac18,500.\nIf we're able to raise additional funds thanks to your generous support, we can scale up various aspects of the project - including doing a larger first print run.\nWhen budgeting, we've taken a range of factors into account, including the fees and taxes that we need to pay on any amounts that we fundraise, and additional costs such as packaging materials and shipping from the printer to our fulfilment centre.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n #1 > EUR 12,000 - Goal reached!\nWe want Foot Trodden to be just as beautiful as Portugal itself.\nPortugal is all about handmade crafts and old traditions, and we want to express that on the book's cover. With a bit more budget, we'll use techniques such as a linen-weave hardback cover or embossing to add texture and interest.\nExtra spot colours and varnishing will also be used to lift the design.\nWith your help, we can make this book a work of art, as well as a fantastic read.\n\n #2 > EUR 17,500 - Goal reached!\nThere's an amazing wine story on the island of Madeira - and we'd like to include it in Foot Trodden.\nWhen the pandemic hit, all our plans for research in 2020 were delayed. Right now, we don't have the material we'd need to include a chapter about Madeira in the book, but we strongly believe it deserves to be included.\nWe're hopeful that we can travel to Madeira just before our print, layout and design deadlines, but it involves a number of additional costs - travel, accommodation, and the additional work on photography and layout for one more chapter.\n\n#3 > EUR 25,000 - Goal reached!\nNot just a book, also a podcast\nWe met so many amazing winemakers with stories to tell, and there is a wealth of material that won't fit in one book. So, this stretch goal will allow us to create, edit and publish a podcast featuring in-depth interviews with many inspirational winemakers and growers. Plus you can listen in to our discussions and find out how our ideas about Portugal and its wine developed.\nThe Foot Trodden podcast series (six episodes) will be available exclusively to Kickstarter supporters on its initial release.\n\n #4  > EUR 40,000 *NEW*\nFeast your eyes over the whole of Portugal on a fold-out map\nThere was always going to be a map or two in this book, but if we get to this level of funding, we're going to make it a whole lot slicker. We envisage a three-panel fold-out full-colour map, depicting all the regions in Portugal that are covered in the book.\nFor practical reasons, the map will show you Portugal in a horizontal format, similar to this antique example - looking up towards the Atlantic.\nWe have a designer lined up to create our re-imagining of this beautiful vintage map, clearly depicting all the wine regions and signposting the stories in the book.\n #5  > EUR 45,000\nAn exclusive web portal listing all our recommended wineries\nWe're constantly discovering new winery projects and promising winemakers. We can't squeeze them all into the book, and we didn't want to create a gazetteer-type of section, because it would be out-of-date by the time we go to print.\nSo instead we'll create an exclusive website, with access just for subscribers (that's you!), which lists all the wonderful winemakers whose wines we like to drink, together with information, contact and visiting details. This website will be part of the same platform that hosts our podcasts.\nIf you have a copy of our previous book, Amber Revolution, this will be a bit like the back-section of that book, but online and thus way more dynamic.\nIt's the perfect resource if you're planning a trip to Portugal, and we'll update it as we go along. \n\n #6  > EUR 50,000\nRecord breakers!\nIf we reach this level, we just became the most-funded wine publishing project on Kickstarter *ever* (topping out the amazing effort from Steve de Long's wine maps of the world project in 2019). This would mean so much, because of the profile that we can give to Portugal - and the message it sends out that people care about this wonderful wine nation.\nTHE SCHEDULE\nWe've been researching this book since 2018, and we're more than halfway with writing and photo editing. Here's how the schedule will unfold in 2021:\n WHO WE ARE \nSimon J Woolf is a British wine writer and author, currently based in Amsterdam. He is known as a specialist on topics such as natural wine, organic and biodynamic winemaking. Simon has written about Portugal for Punch, Decanter and Catavino amongst many others. He is the founder and editor of The Morning Claret, and is widely published internationally.\nRyan Opaz is an American based in Porto, and has been writing about and photographing the wines of Portugal and Spain for the past 15 years. Founder of the award winning wine blog Catavino.net and CEO of Catavino Tours, he now spends his time guiding travellers to the hidden culinary and vinous treasures of Portugal.\n OUR PREVIOUS WORK\nWe collaborated on Amber Revolution - How the world learned to love orange wine which was published in 2018. \n\nRyan was the photographer for Porto: Stories from Portugal\u2019s Historic Bolh\u00e3o Market (Surrey Books, 2018), a multi-award winning book which celebrates the culinary history of Northern Portugal in words and pictures.\n  Simon authored The Wine Lover's Bucket List: 1,000 Amazing Adventures in Pursuit of Wine (Universe, 2020), an inspirational compendium of ideas for global wine travel.\nWHAT THE EXPERTS SAY\n\"Simon and Ryan are experts at hunting down the stories that link iconic winemakers and terroirs to history, politics and culture. So who better to illuminate the secrets of Portugal's little understood but compelling wines?\"\nElin McCoy, Bloomberg / Decanter\n\n\"Age old traditions are the basis of Portugal's modern wine movement. Simon\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s new book is an opportunity to discover why Portugal\u2019s wine diversity is so exciting.\nAndr\u00e9 Ribeirinho, Adegga / Hugh Johnson Pocket Wine Guide\n\n\"A pivotal narrative digging through the deep roots of Portugal's ancient traditions. Insightfully portrayed by Simon J. Woolf's impeccable writing and the detailed eye of Ryan Opaz.\nBruno Almeida, Certified Master Sommelier / New York\n\n\"As a long-time lover of Portuguese wine, I'm excited to see this new book.  A beautifully creative endeavour that looks set to introduce a new public to Portugal's remarkable wine scene\"\nJamie Goode, The Wine Anorak\n\n\"Opaz and Woolf have a sure touch. A thoughtful exploration of winemaking in modern Portugal, and a very good read\"\nCharles Metcalfe, International Wine Challenge", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are experienced in book publishing (see our previous project on Kickstarter, Amber Revolution, for an example) and have done everything possible to ensure that we can deliver this project on time and on budget.\n\nHowever, there are always factors that are beyond our control:\n\n * During the pandemic, nothing is certain. We might find that our printing or delivery schedules are considerably disrupted. Also, travel and freight restrictions between heavily affected countries could also cause us delays.\n\n* We cannot guarantee that the tours will go ahead in November 2021, although we will do our utmost to ensure that they can - in a Covid-proof manner. But should the pandemic still be causing travel restrictions, we will discuss alternative dates with you, to fulfil these rewards.\n\n * Design and printing can throw up surprises. We have allowed plenty of time should there be delays during the design or printing processes but there could still be issues that cause our schedule to slip.\n\n* We will do our best to ship your book (or other reward) to you, wherever in the world you are. But there are some locations that are very challenging to ship to. These include war-torn countries or very remote parts of the world where shipping is very expensive. If you are based in one of these parts of the world, we may need to discuss the options and come up with alternatives.\n\n* We are looking into binding options for the foldout map (which we will only realise if we reach stretch goal #4) and there are likely to be some challenges. If our binder is unable to integrate the foldout map into the book's binding, we may need to supply it as a loose-leaf insert.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac29 or more", "title": "Just the book", "descp": "Receive the beautiful illustrated book at a discount on the published price and be one of the first to get it.\nYour name will be printed in the acknowledgements as our thank you for your support.\nINCLUDES:\nFoot Trodden - the book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["193 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Book double-pack", "descp": "You get two copies of the book - perfect for gifting one and keeping one.\nAnd your name will be printed in the book's acknowledgements as our thank you for your support.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Foot Trodden - the book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["60 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "Foot Trodden T-shirt and book", "descp": "Our tile design looks great as a shirt, and you'll get a 100% organic cotton T-shirt in your size (we'll check this with you when the campaign finishes) for a bit of wearable Portugal!\nYou'll also receive your copy of the beautiful book Foot Trodden, with your name printed in the acknowledgements as our thank you for your support.\nINCLUDES:\nFoot Trodden - the book\nOrganic cotton T-shirt", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac95 or more", "title": "Limited art print and book", "descp": "We made a fabulous large-format art print from the book's front cover motif.

The name itself comes from the colour blue ('azul' in Portuguese) - and the typical sky-blue colour is what you'll most often see."}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "518 backers pledged \u20ac50,765"}]}], "comment_no": 8, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonjwoolf/foot-trodden-portugal-and-the-wines-that-time-forgot", "project_name": "Foot Trodden - Portugal & the wines that time forgot"}}, {"backer": "Gregory Crawford", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Today I went for a nice long walk. I saw a bunch of crows that aren\u2019t usually in this neighbourhood. I made sage and rose tea when I got home\u2026 that always puts me in a good place. And in the evening I got a call from an old friend. It was so nice to catch up. Not a perfect day, but beautiful, and in ways I wasn\u2019t expecting.\nSo, how did that happen to Frogsworth?\n\nPrecious Little Animal is a one-player game about noticing the good things in your life, and sharing them with an imaginary animal friend.\nThe cover of the Precious Little Animal zine\n\nHow it Plays\nPlay for 15-30 minutes, at the end of each day, for seven days.\n\nIn Precious Little Animal, you\u2019ll take a few minutes at the end of the day to reflect on what happened that day: what you did, what you\u2019ll remember, and what you enjoyed. At the same time, you\u2019ll be writing a story about a cute little animal. You\u2019ll take a few things that happened to you each day, and have them happen to your animal, too.\n\nMake a little animal friend.\n\nOn the first day, you\u2019ll write about (or draw!) a little animal. On each day you\u2019re playing, you\u2019ll write down three good things that happened that day. Then you\u2019ll figure out how those things happened to your animal. Maybe your call with a friend was a visit from a friendly Raccoon. Maybe your hour of uninterrupted work time was their quiet hour in the vegetable garden. Maybe your moment of noticing just how blue and clear the sky can be happened just the same way to them.\n\nYour journal of your own life will also be a record of theirs.\n\nIn my experience, this practice of writing three good things has become more difficult during times of intense suffering and uncertainty - but also more vital and more satisfying. I hope that through this simple week of journaling, players will share my experience of being more attuned to moments of contentment, and find simple joys glittering and urgent like shards of glass in the dirt.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\"I had a lovely video call with 3 friends, and she had an owl, a hedgehog and a snake over for tea. I had a quiet night, and the mouse stargazed and wished on a shooting star. Precious Little animal helped me see goodness in my own life that I otherwise may have skipped over or forgotten.\" - Jenn Martin, game designer, and Production Manager for Bully Pulpit Games\n\n\"Precious Little Animal has been my treasured nighttime companion for the last week. Each night I get a chance to not only reflect on what I'm grateful for, but also to see those things through the lens of my animal, both interrogating and expanding on the source of my joy.\" - Sean Nittner, game designer, Big Bad Con organizer, Actual Play host, and project director for Evil Hat Productions\n\n\"There is something unquestionably wholesome and cozy about searching for the good things in your life with the aid of an an adorable animal avatar. I recommend taking the time to introduce yourselves to them and seeing your good fortune through their eyes.\" - Colin Young, playtester\n\n\"Playing this game was a gentle, consistent reminder to be sincere with myself.\" -  Sandbank Diner, playtester\n\n\"I felt really happy after playing.\" - baimo, playtester\n\nWhat\u2019s Included\nThis game is meant to be simple, accessible, and friendly, whether you love role-playing games or have never tried one before.\nSo it\u2019s a 6x9\u201d 24-page zine, printed in black and white on recycled paper, and stapled together. If, like me, you learned about everything from comics and music to sexual health and queer history from photocopied b&w zines, I think you\u2019ll love it.\nZine Quest is about reminding ourselves that making games doesn\u2019t necessarily mean years of development and production; sometimes you get a good idea down on paper and share it with the people who\u2019ll love it. For that reason, this is a very simple product. I\u2019m working with my campus printer to put some black ink on recycled paper, and that\u2019s it. All the illustrations and text were done by hand in about a week. I loved making this game.\n\nThe Digital Edition:\nWith a PDF copy of Precious Little Animal, you can read along on your screen, and make a play journal in a separate notebook or document. \nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition (PDF)\nESTIMATED DELIVERY: April 2021\nThe screen version of the PDF - you can use this on your computer, tablet, or phone to read through the game page by page.\nThe Print Edition:\nAll print backers will get the PDF version. In addition, you'll get one 24-page, 6x9\" staple-bound copy of Precious Little Animal. With that, and a pen or pencil, you can start playing right away.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition (PDF)\nPrint Edition (Black & White Printed Zine)\nESTIMATED DELIVERY: July 2021\n*NEW* Print for Two:\nAll print backers will get the PDF version. In addition, you'll get TWO 24-page, 6x9\" staple-bound copies of Precious Little Animal. With that, and a pen or pencil, you and a friend can start playing right away.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition (PDF)\n2x Print Edition (Black & White Printed Zine)\nESTIMATED DELIVERY: July 2021\n\nShipping\nPrint copies will be shipped out via Canada Post Lettermail.\nWhen you make your pledge, you\u2019ll be asked to select a shipping cost - it\u2019s $2 CAD for backers living in Canada, and $3 CAD for everyone else. Pretty simple! Because of the size and weight of this zine, I can ship it out inexpensively - but that means it may take a longer time than you might be used to.\nBackers in Canada should have their games within 2-3 weeks. Backers in the United States may need to wait up to a month. Backers in other countries may have to wait up to three months. If you\u2019re worried about this, get in touch with me and we can talk through the details more fully.\n\nKeeping it Simple\nThis game is done.\nIt\u2019s a beautiful pile of paper, at the moment. It\u2019s been playtested and enjoyed by enough people - including myself - that I\u2019m totally happy to send it out the door right now. The purpose of this Kickstarter campaign is to fund the print run and shipping, and hopefully get the game to more people than would have known about it otherwise.\nSo it\u2019ll stay simple. I hereby promise: no printing upgrades, no expansions, no merchandise. No stretch goals of any kind! In the true spirit of #ZineQuest, I just want to get this thing into your hands as quickly as possible.\n\nAbout Me\nPrecious Little Animal was written and illustrated by Alex Roberts.

I still love the things but hate figuring out how to store 'em.  From where I write this I can see a giant tub of zines dating back to the 80s and 90s, and shelves awkwardly stuffed with game and art zines.   Silkscreened and risograph zines just put me over the moon.  \nZine making, though, sort of fell away.  I made a zine as part of an artwork at Socrates Sculpture Park in NYC.  But it's not something I do anymore.  Why not?  WHY?  \nOkay, I will.  I will make a zine.  I want to do this.  I am excited. \n\n\n(three hours pass) \n\n\nI Made a Zine\nAnd I am zining the fuck out of this zine.  \nBack in my day, I hoarsely declaim while waving my cane, zines were quick and dirty and often embarrassingly personal.  Inside that majestic blue tub there is a possibly -infinite- number of diary zines detailing the random thoughts of punk rock teenagers in small towns in the midwest.  And that, THAT, that is what I am decanting into this thing I am making you.\nIt's a zine that I never made back when I was in high school, a fantastic imagining of what I might've done.  And it's a game.   A game for three players.  \nNay, not just a game, a simulator.  A teenaged Tim Hutchings almost-virtual-reality experience in which you and your two brave companions  (I am actually choking with laughter as I write this) get to be me for an evening.  And I tell you how to play D&D, among other things.  In fact, the name for this zine was originally Tim Hutchings Tell You How to Play AD&D because it's true and it's an homage to Rodney Anonymous Tells You How to Live, a music program hosted by the lead singer of the Dead Milkmen--my favorite band at the time described in this zine.  \nThere's a Gimmick?\nThis zine is being printed in three colors--red, blue, and yellow and the colors that blur in between.  It will come with three pieces of plastic gel--red, blue, and green.  When you hold a plastic piece to your eye you will experience ZINE MAGIC as the colors are, more or less, separated out and hidden drawings emerge!  Complementary colors turn black and the others (mostly) disappear.  Magic.\nSo the top image here is the opening page spread in the zine.  The three images below it are the same spread viewed through different colors of plastic.  I took these photos of the screen through a piece of plastic.  These are early test photos and I've improved the system since then.\nI'll say this again in a different way:  There'll be a mess of blue, red, and yellow lines, look at the pages through various colors of plastic and some lines will disappear while others emerge.  PLAYERS SEE DIFFERENT INFORMATION ON THE SAME PAGE THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF MAGIC AND SCIENCE THAT IS COLOR THEORY.  LIKE THIS.\nFYI this was stupidly hard to figure out, even with the groundwork laid down by Carnovsky and other sources.  I \nDisclaimer:  This is going to work, more or less.  The blues are pretty dark and you'll need a bright place to play.   But it should work.  But maybe it will fail?  Probably not.  \n\nThis is one of the three colored layers that make up one page spread.\nAre There Two Gimmicks?\nSort of.  Maybe the second isn't a gimmick so much as a stance.  This is a zine in concept and making.\nThis isn't really a gimmick as much as my commitment to the format:  I don't know if this zine is any good.  I am making it in character and that character is me.  I'm channeling young Tim and, to be frank, young Tim was an idiot.  He makes dull old Tim look like a genius.  \nZines are messy, they are poorly thought out, mistakes are fixed with white out and anger and the anger gets worse because the white out wasn't given enough time to dry and fuck I've ruined my pen.  Zines are shat out quickly and you don't look at it because it's gross, you just stuff it all into envelopes and mail it to other people like yourself and get things sent to you in return.\nThis zine is messy, its poorly thought out.  I had no white out so I only had anger to fix mistakes with and that doesn't work at all.  \nI sat down and wrote this zine in two or three hours, starting at 11pm.  I was bleary and confused by the end.  I worked like a teenager whose about to lose his access to free copies when his buddy goes off shift in half an hour.  \nIn short, it's a zine being a zine.\nAre You Being Some Sort of Elitist Grump About What Zines Are?\nNo!  Well, yes, but NO.   I'm telling you what zines mean to -me- and what games mean to -me-, and how my experience within the medium affects what I am making for you right now. \nBut for me a zine is something different.  The word 'zine' fires my blood in a way that ain't like most other folks making things here.   I don't want anyone to be disappointed because the thing I'm delivering has fundamentally different goals than  most of the ZineQuest 3 projects.\nOkay, Okay, Give Some Specifics.\nOkay, I guess I can do that.  \nYou're getting THREE digest-sized, sixteen page zines (they are all the same zine).  It'll be full color, probably printed by McNaughton Gunn--those are the same folks that printed Thousand Year Old Vampire.\nYou'll get three small squares of plastic with the zine which will allow the eyeball magic to emerge.  Probably they'll come in a little envelope that'll be tucked into the zine.  \nThis is a sort of game for three players.\nI am timing this so that the zine will come out of the printer at the same time as the secret TYOV companion book.\nUPDATE:  In the interest of gaming on the cusp of post-covid I am providing THREE copies of the zine to Kickstarter backers.  That way you don't have to hunker around one book and breath up each other's air.  You're still only getting one pack of plastic viewing bits though.\nSecret TYOV companion book?  \nYes, it's an add-on you can get when you Kickstart this project.  You'll also be able to pre-order it through the regular thousandyearoldvampire.com site.  Let's maybe talk about that in the faq or something.  \nSo There Are Add-ons and Stuff?\nYeah, that's new to me to.  Kickstarter has it set up now so that you pledge for a reward tier and then there are add-ons that should appear beneath the pledge.  You can add on copies of Thousand Year Old Vampire, the companion book, some pins (including a new one!) , and another zine game I'd made.  \nAgain, while one person is seeing this image the other two players are seeing coexisting images that are completely different.\nAll Right Then, So Tell Us About The Game.\nCan't you just trust me?  No?  Well, that's sensible I guess.  \nThe game is pretty light.  Three players peer through their plastic pieces and see information that is unique to their colored piece of plastic, more or less.  The players tell the story of a slightly idealized, barely remembered amalgam of summer evenings of youthful freedom when I could drive but still have no responsibilities.  And I go play AD&D with friends.  \nYou negotiate the story together, each player operating from a different body of information.  You might find a use for dice for part of the game, but they aren't required. The authorial voice in the zine flickers between the viewpoint of Young Tim, the memories of Old Tim, and a sort of dispassionate aping of zine makers I've absorbed into my being.  \nIs That Really A Game?\nOh don't be that fucker.  I mean, it doesn't really have rules or goals or even a real structure but neither do zines.   There's just an amorphous knowledge of how it works, an arc of excitement and disappointment.  \nCouldn't This Just Be Three Separate Booklets?\nOh jeez, you're right.  I, uh, guess that it wouldn't be as clever?  \nActually no, I'm going to double-down on the color thing.  It's important to the structure of the experience that you are given a messiness of information blended together on a single page and each player looks at that mess through a different lens and pulls out strings of meaning.  It's like a memory, which this game is about.  And it's like being a person who is a child and an adult and smart and an idiot all at once, flickering constantly between states as you move between different social spaces and nodes of responsibility.\nBut I guess that'll be the PDF format.  Three separate PDFs, one for each player to allow online or print-and-play.\nWere You Serious About This Being Made Quickly Or Is That A Fake Authenticity Thing?\nThe authenticity and roughness of the work process on this is me being true to my own understanding of what zines do in the world.  It's also me working off some of the hyperpolished perfection of that vampire game.  \nIt's an homage to John Porcellino, Funkapotamus, punk zines, and all the little diary zines with drawings of suburban landscapes that I do so love.\nAnything Else We Should Know?\nI'm excited about this!\nAnd don't poke yourself in the eye with the corner of a piece of plastic.

You create the story as you play, writing down some details, deciding how to care for the exhibits, and drawing cards to see what happens next. \nIt takes about an hour to play, using a booklet/PDF of about 22 A5 pages, a bunch of index cards, and a deck of regular playing cards.\nYou are the pilot of humanity's 2nd faster-than-light ship, reaching into interstellar space, ready to explore the great, dark unknown. \nSomething malfunctioned. The stars are wrong. And through the window you can see an old, dusty planet, from which a beam of light emerges to engulf your ship, and an alien presence integrates with your systems. Your gut lurches as you lose and regain consciousness\u2014now you are standing in a hall of groaning, rusty engines, a dead creature lying on the floor before you, old and dry. \nA burst of pain as a metallic arm retreats from your head, having implanted a cybernetic module in your brain. Through it, these old automated systems speak to you:  \nThis is the story of how you were compelled to try and eventually failed, as many have before you. \nMain inspirations are the episode \u201cStewtopia\u201d of Voyage to the Stars and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space. If you are familiar with some indie games, this plays on similar vibes to those of The Wretched or Mothership, but you manage a sad zoo.\nFirst you Discover the Grounds by drawing borders on some index cards (the blocks of your zoo) and randomly laying them in four-by-four grid. \nAnother Cycle Begins, and a new exhibit might arrive at the menagerie; you'll create this strange organism, then guide the machines to assemble a habitat for it.\nThen, Problems Pile Up: Draw a playing card to see what happens. A lot can happen. Answer provocative questions to create some weird fiction. \nThen, Do Your Part, to try and gain some control over this mess. \nThen, Another Cycle Begins\u2026 \nYou start with one control and try to get more, but fail, as deviancy increases relentlessly. Eventually either you gain 5 control or the last block is destroyed, and It All Ends. \nManaged by me, Eran (@nnesk), best known for the webcomic Crystal Heart and its successfully Kickstarted RPG, as well as for editing the (also successfully Kickstarted) RPG of legendary noir investigations, City of Mist.

It should be about managing visitors and giving them a great experience, attracting more visitors, and handling fun and weird exhibits.\nIf it happens, all backers will get this game in PDF, no printed version planned.\nWas there another stretch goal?\nSince we passed \u00a32,800 (about $3,800), I'm able to order an original audio piece several minutes long, like a theme music for the game, which will be given to all backers. I'll also build a public hour-long playlist which includes this and other suitable pieces, to listen to in the background as you play. \nCan I get another physical copy?\nYes, just add \u00a35 on your PDF & Print pledge, and contact me (through Kickstarter, in a tweet or in an email). My details are on the top right, and I'm very approachable! \nHow does shipping work?\nI'll be sending everything from my home (London, UK). It's a thin envelope and costs are expected to be low, so I believe any Brexit disruptions or taxes should be low as well.\nWhat are the Pre-Weird reward options?\nCreating your own strange alien organism is part of the fun, and the game provides you with provocative questions and inspirations. But maybe it's the end of a long work day, and you don't have it in you to imagine some new stuff right now, and you just want to push a few crazy beasts into the game and see what happens. \nBackers who invest in a pre-weird option will get twelve unusual organisms pre-weirded, for your use. The organisms include name and description, and they'll be sent by email or Kickstarter message, after the PDF is delivered.\nAnd the Personal Oddities? \nThese backers get the 12 pre-weird organisms along with six additional bizarre creations, unique to them.

It also happens to be your 20th reunion. Unbeknownst to you, there are seven other professional killers in attendance. You will mingle and reminisce, and then, when the time\u2019s right, you\u2019ll decide if you\u2019re ready to pull the trigger (or draw your sword or whatever.)\nPressure Drop is a one-shot larp (about 2-4 hours long) in the American Freeform tradition that explores what happens when people who do terrible things have to face those who knew them best. It's inspired by the film Grosse Pointe Blank though you needn't be familiar with that movie to enjoy the game.\nPlaying Pressure Drop \nHere's how play goes:\nBefore the game the facilitator will read through the game and familiarize themselves with the game, the workshop, and the safety tools. Then they'll prep the play materials (printing some stuff out, cutting a few things out, making a playlist, finding a stapler.)\nThen everyone gets together and gets ready to play. This means going over the safety rules to make sure everyone is taken care of (people are more important than the game!) and doing a little Action Sequence workshop to practice what it means to perform combat in this game (see below!)\nThen everyone gets together and makes their characters. There are eight assassin archetypes. I will not be stretch-goaling to a ninth assassin archetype. If I think of another one before the zine goes to the printer I'll include it. If you have an archetype you think I should include please send it to me and I won't even charge you more to include it if it's a good idea. Wow what a magnanimous game designer. If I don't think it's a good idea please don't cancel your pledge. You can also just hack it in there later, I have literally no control over what you do with this game once it's in your hands. Wow pretty scary stuff!\nOkay anyway then after you pick your archetype there's a sorta mad-libs-style character creation to generate your backstory (who you were in high school, who you have fond memories of, etc. etc.) this is collaborative and fun (people have told me it's fun if it's not fun please don't ask for a refund of your pledge.) You also find out who your target is (it's another player's secret identity.) You also find out what is Your Song while this song is playing you'll have to confess your secret identity to someone. Hope they're not also an assassin (they are.)\nThen there's a bit of introduction to the game and you start playing! It's almost as awkward as a real reunion, you get to see people you haven't seen before! Lie about who you are and what you've been doing with your life! Try to grab a bit of the fleeting emotion of the last time you were truly seen before your shitty job and lack of meaningful human connection ground you down to a thin paste! Typical reunion shit!\nThen you maybe get to try to kill each other.\nThen the game is over!\nSince the character generation is random, you could in theory play this game infinity times. At that price you can't afford not to buy this game! In all seriousness though I've facilitated this game like five times and it's still a blast.\nAction Sequence\nOne of the cool things about this game is at the end you get to decide if you want to partake in a action sequence to try to take out your target. Or maybe you decide not to or maybe you decide to just try to protect your best friend who you haven't seen in twenty years TWENTY YEARS!\nI was inspired by Evan Torner's Hell is Other Vampires for the low-speed/turn-based action sequence he devised to capture a bit of strategy without bogging the game down with a ton of rules. \nThe effect is a little bit of kids playing pretend (I get you with my sword! I shoot you with my SMG!) but wrapped in just enough game to let you think strategically. The playtest materials are available on itch pwyw if you're interested in checking them out.\nThe Zine\nI'm keeping this simpler than My Jam (which by the way we did before the first zinequest so if you think about it something something.) My goal with the layout is that you can just open up the staples and play if you want, or print the pdf or make copies or whatever.\nUnless this super blows up I'll be printing at home on a laser printer on French paper. Maybe the cover will be like neon green or something. I've been really into neon green lately. If this super blows up I'll find a printer to work with.\nI also wanna have some art! I think it's a nice little addition to the physical zine, and I love working with awesome artists! This art will only appear in the physical zine!\nFor this project, I'm working with Filipa Namorado an illustrator with a background in graphic design whose work is informed by shoujo manga and mid-century children\u2019s literature. They are passionate about fashion, gender and sexuality, having written and illustrated their own picture book about gender diversity. Here are some of the early sketches they've sent over of the eight character archetypes:\nDesign Process\nI watched Grosse Pointe Blank like a hundred times. Not really as part of the design process just because it's a brilliant film. It's so funny and violent and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.\nThen Jeff and I wrapped up My Jam and I was adrift with no design projects, so this kinda trickled in. You can probably see the relationship to My Jam. Both have music, both have high school.\nThen I wrote up some playtest materials and tried it out at Dreamation 2019. Got some good feedback, made a few small changes, then ran it again at Big Bad Con 2019. Then we stopped being able to do larps because of a global pandemic. Come to think of it why am I kickstarting a larp in the middle of a global pandemic. Anyway. Please ignore that and back my project anyway. I'm sure we'll be back to mingling with strangers in no time haha nervous laughter.\nAnyway the game is done. I don't plan to keep designing. I might edit the copy a bit from what's available on itch, but mostly I just need to do a print layout of the game as it exists.\nI wrote down a bit of my iterative process on my itch devlog for the game.

The designers who have agreed to help are:\nJack Harrison - Mousehole Press\nCreator of Artefact, Orbital, and Buckets of Bolts (which is on Kickstarter right now). \nMatt Sanders - Sealed Library\nCreator of The Sealed Library, Glittering Hoards, Dead Emperors, and much more\nChris Bissette - Loot The Room\nCreator of Wretched & Alone, Under The Floorboards, Dice Souls, and more\nThese guest expansions will take the form of A6 postcards with a few new ailments and reagents on each.\nHot damn those went quick.\nAlright, last one.\n\u00a38000 - Unlocked! - Soundtrack by Christopher Michael Roberts\nChristopher did the amazing soundtrack for Artefact and if we can get to this level, we'll be able to put together a 9 track OST with a beautiful ambient song for each locale. \nDigital Only - \u00a36 (RRP \u00a39)\nA PDF copy of Apothecaria and a Digital Postcard welcoming you to High Rannoc as well as a print file for an awesome papercraft of the purifying Moonstone by Fold Up Toys as pictured below.\n\nPrint+ PDF Bundle - \u00a312 (RRP \u00a315)\nAn A5 saddlestich print copy of Apothecaria with a copper foil cover and a Physical Postcard welcoming you to High Rannoc as well as the rewards from the Digital Only tier.

Thanks to the support I got for those games, I've been pushing forward with game design in every way I can from designing the Staff Playbook for Artefact to publishing one page games in the Monthly Microgame Feature for Tabletop Gaming Magazine.\nI am also a reviewer/ writer for Senet, Tabletop Gaming Magazine, The Board Game Book, Wyrd Science, and more.

It had, some speculated, been standing since the universe began. Maintained by a solitary keeper, the lighthouse has been keeping travellers and spaceships from falling off the edge. Its steady beam can be seen galaxies away and is used as a guiding star for navigators. \nYou are the current keeper of the lighthouse. Whatever happens, you must keep the light running. You and the lighthouse live perched on the edge of the universe. It is a rocky, mostly barren place (it would look like any rocky island back on earth) where it is beaten by solar winds and sometimes run into by space whales. Not all of it is terrible though, high in the top of the lighthouse you get to witness strange lights dance, the solar winds whispering fortunes in your ears, shoals of sky fish migrating past. Maybe you'll find some solitude and peace in the under the dark, lonely sky. Sometimes a lone traveller may even cross your path. \nThe Lighthouse is a solo journalling game best played at nighttime before bed or for when you can't sleep. The Lighthouse is about running a lighthouse in space. It is played with a dice, a coin and pack of cards. Roll the dice and flip a card to get a prompt. Flip a coin to see how you go about the task. Record your duties, thoughts and observations. Your notes in the logbook will be a record of your time in the lighthouse and the lighthouse itself. \nEach night in the lighthouse will be a little different, you may have less tasks to do or one task that takes a while. You have space to write as many or as little words as you would like, maybe you can only spare 15 minutes to play or maybe you have time to sit down and write a long entry. The game is designed to be played over and over as you and the lighthouse evolve, change and get to know each other. It is reflective and meditative.\nEach logbook entry begins with your observations of the weather. You and the lighthouse are at the mercy of the weather at the edge and so mishaps are very likely to happen. Maybe you'll need to fix something, replace a panel, clean up a breakage, refill the tea in your flask. The oil in the lamp will need refilling through the night and the wick may need to be tended to. Once you've done that, sit down and take some time to Observe those passing by from the lighthouse's balcony. Maybe you'll spot a pod of space whales migrating to the next galaxy or a spaceship going on its merry way.\nThe physical zine is currently 24 pages long and measures 148 x 105mm (A6 size). It will be stapled and will be a small zine! \nIf stretch goals are reached, the zine will be roughly 32 pages long. The cover design is not final and will probably change during revisions. \nThere is a little paper craft cut out of a lighthouse at the end that you can put over your phone light for some tiny ambience. The zine will be professionally printed on uncoated 150gsm matte stock with a 200gsm cover. \nVery rough test print of the zine! Layout and imagery may change in final revisions\nGoal\nThe funding goal covers printing for 80-100 zines plus a test print. I want to do a test print to ensure the final zine is perfect! I was going to skip this step but I really want to make sure I can deliver a great quality zine. \n\nShipping costs:\nShipping costs is not included in the pledges and are added on separately. Shipping will be sent with a stamp and does not include tracking. International shipping from Australia is very expensive and the stamp is the cheapest way to do it. The small zine size also makes it cheaper to ship. I'll be sending the zines in sturdy card mailers or thick envelopes (depending on what I can source) to protect from damage. \n\nSingle zine shipping costs:\nDomestic shipping (Australia): $3\nInternational shipping (Everywhere else): $5\n\nx2 zines shipping costs:\nDomestic shipping (Australia): $3\nInternational shipping (Everywhere else): $10\nSince this is my first kickstarter, I want to keep everything really simple! I'm offering a digital copy of the game or a physical copy with a digital copy thrown in. \n\nPDF copy: \nThis is a digital copy of the zine. If the stretch goal with the mini game is unlocked, the pdf will include it. PDFs will be delivered through itch.io!\n\nPhysical copy: \nThe physical copy of the game is currently 24 pages long, and will be extended to include the mini game if the stretch goal is reached. You have the option of buying one copy or two copies. Physical copies come with a digital PDF. \n\nAfter Kickstarter:\nThe game will be available on itch.io and I aim to sell physical copies of it on my online shop. The quality may be slightly different as I'll be printing it myself and I may change the graphics. So basically, this cover, imagery and print quality is a Kickstarter exclusive thing!\nThese stretch goals are really simple as I want to make it easy for me to achieve and won't impact the overall project timeline. \n\n $300 - UNLOCKED - A mini game: Beach combing on the Edge of the Universe \nThis mini game is about wondering along the edge of universe and collecting things that have found their way to the edge of the universe. This mini game is fully written and is a tiny exploring game. This game can be played after or before the main game.\n\n $400 - UNLOCKED - A postcard/mini art print  \nThis is a postcard that can also be a mini art print! (Will be A6 size 105x148mm) Postcards are awesome, and what a better way to send a little love to friends or family.\n\n $600 - UNLOCKED - Entries from keepers past \nMany keepers have disappeared from the lighthouse during storms or other mysterious events. The logbook has kept every one of their last entries and they will be collated in a little side zine or maybe to the back of the game. (Haven't figured this out yet) They will be little stories in the form of logbook entries of the strange events some have witnessed over the passing millennia. \n\nMore stretch goals may be added depending on funding levels!\nHere's a rough plan for the project. I will share images and updates when each task is finished! \nWriting & art needs to be completed. This should not take too long as the game is already 80% written and almost fully illustrated.\nOnce content is done, layout and design needs to be finalised. The layout is almost completed as it is!\nThe next step is to get a test print of the zines. I'm using a local printer that should take 1-2 weeks at the most to arrive. \nOnce the test print has arrived, I'll check over it for errors. Once everything is all good, I'll order the zines! Yay! \n When the zines arrive, it's packing time. I'll package and ship out the zines myself from my little studio. I have a planned delivery date for June to give me space just in case things take some time to complete or to get to me. \nHi, I'm Ella, a writer and graphic designer living at the bottom of the world. I write solo journaling games about strange worlds. I'm really not sure what I'm doing but making zines seems to be the thing I want to do at the moment! \nTake a look at my other work: lostwaysclub.itch.io \n\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf last year has taught us anything, it is that nothing is certain that's for sure! The pandemic is still going strong in many parts of the world and that is delaying shipping. I am very lucky to be living in Australia where the pandemic is some what under control. As I'm using a local printer for the zines, they should get shipped to me moderately quickly. I have not used this printer before, but I am confident they will do a good job! I am also going to get a test print of the zines before ordering them to minimise any errors or strange printing. \n\nThe game is almost fully written at the time this project launches and is on track to be finished by the end of the month. \n\nI have been running an online shop selling zines for a year now and have a good grasp on shipping and managing/packing orders to go out as fast as possible. \n\nI know the frustrating feeling of following/backing a project and have it fall off the face of the earth.

We called them Thrones. Ten survived that great war: ancient weapons with storied histories of battle and betrayal, but also symbols of dominance and entitlement. Possession of a Throne bestows wealth, power, and dominion over whole star systems.\nThat's why you're going to steal one. \nStealing the Throne is a tabletop roleplaying game of exciting mecha heist action for 3-5 players. It\u2019s GMless, and requires absolutely zero prep to play. In just a few hours you\u2019ll build a Throne, a titanic mech with a thousand years of drama-filled history. You\u2019ll devise the elaborate security systems that protect it, and then play to find out how your crew of thieves take them apart.  \nA mecha heist rpg / 3-5 players / GMless / 1-3 hours / zero-prep \nGameplay consists of three phases. In the Planning phase, you\u2019ll decide which of the ten surviving Thrones you\u2019re going to steal, and where you\u2019re going to steal it from. Together you\u2019ll learn a little about its history and its capabilities, and figure out why you have to steal it. \nMockup of the zine cover, featuring Glaive of the Cenotaph by Galen Pejeau.\nDuring the Heist, players take on one of three rotating roles: Throne, Thief, and Backup. The Throne sets a scene by describing the fiendish security measures the Thief must overcome to advance towards their prize. The Thief faces the challenge, making use of flashbacks and calling on assistance as needed. The Backup helps the Throne by adding details and roleplaying NPCs, and comes to the Thief\u2019s aid if the situation gets dicey.\nOnce the security measures are defeated and the Throne secured, the thieves make their Getaway. This is everyone\u2019s chance to finally take control of the giant mech in a rapid-fire montage of big action and (potentially) big reveals. Will your thief escape with the prize, go out in a blaze of glory, or perhaps reveal themselves a traitor?\nInspirations\nStealing the Throne is inspired by Ocean\u2019s 8, Fast Five, Rogue One and Leverage (\"Let's go steal us a giant mech\"). Add in some Battletech and a dash of the decommissioned Jaeger scrapyard sequence from Pacific Rim: Uprising. \nThe rules draw from Lovecraftesque by Becky Annison and Josh Fox, Sol Survivor by W.H. Arthur, HEIST: Get Rich or Die Trying by Allie Bustion, and John Wick\u2019s Wilderness of Mirrors.\nTry it now!\nThe basic rules for Stealing the Throne are available right now! You can find them in the December 2020 edition of the fantastic in*die zine. Just $4 gets you all the rules you need to try out Stealing the Throne, alongside five other games, supplements, articles, and even a photo-comic by excellent indie designers.\nSpread from the example of play. The final zine interior will be black and white.\nIf you\u2019re curious about how the game runs, you can find a detailed example of play here. In it, the thieves Alabaster, Berkeley, and Camden team up to steal Glaive of the Cenotaph from a gala event at the Museum of Art, Culture, and Warfare. \nWhat are people saying?\n\"At the end of our game of Stealing the Throne, we all sat back and thought \u2018damn, I want to see a movie of this!\u2019\" - Logan, Amble Studio\n\"We pulled off an epic heist with zero prep required. The prompts in the rule-book don't restrict you at all but make it easy to come up with unique and exciting story lines. I can't wait to see what the art will look like!\" - Mark Bowker, playtester\n\"It's like Macross meets Ocean's 8.\" - Marx Shepherd, host of Yes Indie'd Pod\n\"The game elements worked together beautifully to ensure a GM-less experience that was full of tension, surprise and challenge. From designing the mecha before we battled with it, to taking turns playing as the enemy, to having the option to self-sacrifice, it all came together to leave our group awestruck at the result.\" - Hailey Cooperrider, Amble Studio\n\"I was blown away by how much gripping story we created together with so few constraints. Play it! This one\u2019s a real narrative design gem.\u201d - Jason, Amble Studio\nThe zine will feature a gorgeous full-colour cover illustrated by Galen Pejeau. The interior will be black and white, 24-28 pages, staple bound. Printing will be handled by Mixam UK.\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll find inside:\nComplete rules for action-filled heist one-shots.\nFour sample Thrones to get you playing straight away.\nFunds from this Kickstarter will pay for beautiful full-page art of the sample Thrones, by four supremely talented artists: \n Galen Pejeau's illustration of Glaive of the Cenotaph already graces the cover. Inside the zine, he'll provide an illustration of Tensword (Twitter's darling).\n Sam Tung will work on Belly Laugh (a favourite amongst playtesters). \n Si Sweetman will bring us The Burning Soldier.\n Brandish Gilhelm will illustrate the final Throne, Justice Above.\nAlongside this artwork you\u2019ll find inspiration in the form of Throne-specific tables, prompts, mech systems, history, or defences. You can use them as quick-start playsets to launch your games, inspiration for building your own Thrones, or prompts to fall back on if you need a mid-game creativity boost.\nCommunity Copies\nEvery Throne and Ancient Hero backer, and every five backers at the Thief level will generate one digital community copy for folks who are unable to afford the cost of the zine. Any reason, at your discretion, absolutely no questions asked. Community copies will be made available at itch.io.\nI\u2019m Nick Bate, designer of Stealing the Throne.

In addition, I will work with you to develop your own unique Throne. You\u2019ll provide me with a name and some ideas, and I\u2019ll turn them into a playset like the other examples in the zine. The custom playset will be in PDF, separate to the final zine. Limited to 2 only!\nShipping\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter is complete, via Backerkit.

I promise to keep you informed as shipping approaches.\nNow that we're fully funded, it's time for stretch goals!\nFUNDED! - At \u00a31250 Jane Hermiston will join the team as layout consultant! Jane's considerable layout skills will help make the zine as gorgeous as it can be.\nJane loves the the playful, and the clever. They are a long time gamer with a creative design attitude; they're truly nerdy about creating unique visuals that spark your imagination. They've worked as layout artist - and now layout coordinator - for in*die zine, as well as on a range of other tabletop projects: from one-pagers to D&D. \nFUNDED! - At \u00a31650 Dr Melody Watson will join the team as editor! Melody will deploy her impressive editing skills to whip the game's text into the best possible shape.\nMelody is a specialist RPG editor, game designer and mech-loving science-fictionist from Adelaide, Australia. She's edited a diverse range of games, including Lancer, dungeonpunk, and the ENnie award-winning Thousand Year Old Vampire, and has written for numerous others. When she isn't polishing words, she serves the whims of three gremlinous cats and makes her own weird games about robots, history, and dogs in space. You can keep up with Melody's hijinks on Twitter and check out her portfolio at melodynova.com.\nFUNDED! - At \u00a32200 Galen Pejeau will provide additional interior art for the zine! We've already funded gorgeous full-page illustrations of four Thrones. If we hit this stretch goal Galen Pejeau will provide additional illustrations for the interior of the zine. Could be spot illustrations, could be border art. We'll figure something out!\nFUNDED! - At \u00a33000 I will develop rules for solo Throne heists! Solo RPGs are one of my favourite discoveries of the last few years. (I've even written one.) I think there's a solo play variant of Stealing the Throne just waiting to be designed. If we hit this stretch goal, I'll make it happen! (These variant rules will be supplied in PDF format for all backers at the Backup level and above.)\nAt \u00a34000 I will commission an illustrated star chart! This map might cover a stellar cluster, a galaxy, maybe even the whole Local Group. It will be filled with plot hooks from a thousand years of history: sites of ancient battles, mysterious objects, interstellar dominions. (This map will be supplied in PDF format for all backers at the Backup level and above.)\nAt \u00a34500 each contributor will receive bonus pay! Thanks to your generosity, each of the contributors to Stealing the Throne will receive a $50 USD bonus on top of their agreed rates. More pay for artists, layout experts, and editors!\nAt \u00a35000, even more bonus pay! Should we hit this frankly outrageous goal, each contributor will receive a further $50 USD bonus. Can we make it this far?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, and in the spirit of ZineQuest I\u2019m keeping things simple. The rules for the game are already written and playtested, and they\u2019ve been past the expert editors and designers in the in*die community. All that remains is to design the sample Thrones and layout the zine. I\u2019ll be doing the layout in Affinity Publisher, which I\u2019ve used for all of my previous games. \n\nThis is also the first time I\u2019ve printed a physical product. I\u2019ve been communicating with more experienced members of the local design community, some of whom have produced very similar zines. With their help and guidance, I\u2019m confident I can navigate the complexities of Mixam printing and shipping.\n\nLife can always throw up challenges, of course. The artists and I have already been in communication about timelines, but any significant changes in circumstances may cause delays. I\u2019ll be in touch with the artists regularly, and will make sure to communicate any complications with backers. The health and wellbeing of all contributors will be my main priority, of course.\n\nLastly, there are possible Brexit impacts. The zines will be printed in the UK, but the artists are paid in USD and CAD. Any falls in the GBP will therefore increase my costs.

I'd like to focus on games that can be satisfying to play in short bursts, or can be completed in 1 or 2 sessions.\nYou're doing this all by yourself?\nNo. I love writing but my Indesign and art skills are super limited. Luckily, I have a great team of creatives to help me deliver this project and make it look amazing, including:\nLayout by Vee Hendro - a graphic designer specialising in roleplaying and board game projects, based in Sydney, Australia. She's been an instrumental part of many projects including Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG (Storybrewers Roleplaying), Visigoths vs Mall Goths (Lucian Kahn), and Uk'otoa (Darrington Press). Vee is also an award-winning game designer and co-founder at Storybrewers Roleplaying. Her graphic design portfolio can be found at veerpgdesigns.com.\nArtwork by Nu\u0161a \u0160tiglic aka ginkgo.whale - a freelance illustrator, comic book artist and graphic designer from Ljubljana, Slovenia with 7+ years of experience.

All stretch goals included.\nLEVEL TWO (PDF & zine) - You'll get a PDF copy of ACP and an A5 physical zine as soon as professional layout and artwork is completed. All stretch goals included.\nLEVEL THREE (PDF, zine & stickers) - You'll get a PDF copy of ACP and an A5 physical zine as soon as professional layout and artwork is completed. All stretch goals included. I'll use some of the game\u2018s artwork to create a bundle of 3 stickers. This level is really to help fund the project, but stickers are fun right!?\nLEVEL FOUR (PDF, zine, stickers, custom dice and custom playing cards) - You'll get a PDF copy of ACP and an A5 physical zine as soon as professional layout and artwork is completed. All stretch goals included. I'll use some of the game\u2018s artwork to create a bundle of 3 stickers, 3 custom D6 dice featuring the ACP logo and a pack of custom playing cards. Everything you need to play ACP (except 2 to 4 awesome friends).  \nExample of the custom playing cards and card back\nLEVEL FIVE (5 zines, 10 stickers) - You'll get five A5 physical zines as soon as professional layout and artwork is completed. All stretch goals included. I'll also include a bundle of 10 stickers. This level is for anyone looking to buy several copies for a store or a gaming club at a discounted rate (equivalent of one free copy).\nALL LEVELS - Any kickstarter purchase of A Complicated Profession will fund an equal number of community copies of the game. This means that when the finished PDF is eventually launched on my itch.io page, anyone in need can claim a copy, no questions asked.\nShipping costs\nShipping fees are not included as part of your Kickstarter pledge. \nShipping will be calculated and collected after the campaign ends (using BackerKit).\nEstimated shipping:\nFor a single physical copy within the UK: around \u00a31-3\nFor a single physical copy outside of the UK: around $5-10 USD \nIf you\u2018re outside of the UK and worried about shipping costs, please do consider the PDF-only option in LEVEL ONE! \nDue to the changeable nature of international shipping, the LEVEL FOUR option may incur VAT charges if you do not live in the UK. Again, please consider backing a lower-level option if you're worried about incurring extra costs or hassle!\n \u00a31,500 - FUNDED - UNLOCKED! \nInitial artwork, printing and professional layout is covered and the best version of A Complicated Profession I can make will be in your hands or hard drives later this year.\n\n\u00a32,000 - MORE ARTWORK - UNLOCKED!\nI'll be commissioning 12 more pieces of artwork from Nu\u0161a. These will accompany all of the in game events/playbooks and replace all of the stock art I'm currently using.\n\n \u00a33,000 - LO-FI SOUNDTRACK AND ANIMATION - UNLOCKED! \nI'll be commissioning a 30-40 minute lo-fi beats soundtrack and looping animation for ACP. Music will be composed by Christopher Michael Roberts, creator of the critically-acclaimed soundtrack for Artefact by Jack Harrison (and the upcoming Orbital soundtrack).\n\n \u00a33,500 - PASSENGER NAME AND SPECIES GENERATOR - UNLOCKED! \nI'll be creating a quick reference sheet to help you come up with suitable names and species for your passengers when creating a contract.\nIf you backed the digital version, this will be included in the files. If you backed the physical version this will be a separate printed reference sheet (probably postcard-sized).\n\n\u00a34,000 - CUSTOM MIRO BOARD TEMPLATE FOR ONLINE PLAY - - UNLOCKED!\nI'll be creating a custom Miro template to help facilitate online play while COVID-times continue (or for when your friends don't live in the same city).\nMiro is a free online collaborative tool that is super user-friendly. You can sign up for free, add the template that I create and then invite your friends to join the board.\nIt will include all the player sheets that need to be filled in as you play, including character roles. So everyone will be able to see each others characters, your shared world, your ship assets, and contribute to filling in the contract notes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI already have the first draft of A Complicated Profession written and in a basic PDF layout.\n\nI\u2019ll need to wait for the full set of artwork and the professional layout to be completed. I may also make some design tweaks if I receive feedback from backers after the first edition is sent out.\n\nPrinting will be fulfilled by Mixam in the UK, which are an established company that many others use. \n\nThe main risks I can think of are postal issues, mostly outside of the UK. I have no idea if coronavirus is still going to affect shipping time or costs, but I hope the impact will be less by the time the physical zines are ready to ship later in the year. Brexit seems to have pushed up shipping prices outside of the UK, reflected in the estimated costs above. \n\nThis is my first kickstarter project, so there's a small risk I haven't thought of something important.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

This is the tried-and-tested, story-forward system of wonderful games from Apocalypse World to Masks: A New Generation to Bluebeard's Bride. It's perfect for low-prep and no-prep one-shot gameplay, though you can also use it to play a short campaign of two to three sessions if you want to delve deeper into the characters' journeys. All you need to play are three six-sided dice, three-to-five players plus a GM, and a willingness to spin an emotional fantasy yarn together.\nIn Back Again from the Broken Land, you play as small adventurers returning to your hometown after playing a humble but crucial role in the fall of Doomslord. The game begins after the great war with the Doomslord, and the the stories you tell with determine the details of the adventures you've had and the home to which you return.\nLike many Powered by the Apocalypse games, Back Again from the Broken Land has you build your character from a playbook. The following playbooks are available:\nPlaybooks of Back Again from the Broken Land\nOther key game elements of Back Again from the Broken Land are Moves, Burdens, and Stories.\nMoves are things you can do in the game that have important narrative and mechanical consequences. Sometimes you'll roll dice to see how the move goes. The game features homeward bound moves for the more reflective parts of your journey (these moves include chart a course, negotiate an obstacle, gaze into the distance, and share a meal) and peril moves for times when the Doomslord's vengeful Hunters are right on top of you (these moves include run, hide, and make a desperate stand).\nBurdens represent the physical and emotional tolls of your adventure. You begin the game with a few unnamed Burdens, and seek to give names to them by telling stories. (Moments of danger and difficulty can lay on more burdens.) Once given a name like \"a broken promise\" or \"a fallen comrade's cloak-pin,\" a Burden can be faced and cleared. The tone of your epilogue upon reaching home will be determined by how many named and unnamed Burdens you have left.\nStories are just that: stories you tell along the way, perhaps huddled round a campfire or in a moment of respite after a tense chase. Stories help define your past and give you ways to name and clear Burdens. The game includes lots of story prompts and evocative details to help inspire your stories. Some story prompts by way of example: \"How your weapon was shattered,\" \"The service you paid for with a song from home (and the verse you omitted),\" and \"How you made contact with the Doomslord in a place that should have been protected\"\n  To get a sense of the game in action, check out this Youtube playlist of Actual Play sessions!  \n You can also learn more about the game in this video review from Tony Vasinda of Plus One Exp, which he put together after playtesting the game! (The photos Tony uses in this video are from the Codex: Home version of the game, featuring art by Amanda Lee Franck and layout by Lu Quade.)\n Leah has written about designing GM materials for the game here on the Gauntlet Blog.\n Alexi has been a guest on two podcasts to discuss Back Again from the Broken Land. On Yes Indie'd he chats about the game, and on Plus One Forward he not only chats about the game but also runs a brief actual play segment:\n\nBack Again from the Broken Land was originally published as a feature in Codex magazine's fall 2020 issue Codex: Home. It met with an enthusiastic reception, and we are very excited to revise and expand it into a full zine.\nThe zine will be a 40-page, 8 \u00bd x 5 \u00bd saddle-stitched booklet. The basic version will include black-and-white wraparound cover art. The Kickstarter-exclusive special edition will feature a wraparound color cover. Our cover artist for both versions is Emily Cheeseman. Here are her in-progress sketches for the zine's cover:\nEmily Cheeseman's cover sketches for Back Again from the Broken Land\nLayout on the zine will be by Todd Crapper.

The burden of hope, the clarity of sacrifice, the soul-healing power of a lovingly made breakfast.\n\u2014Cow Shea\nHaving never played a role-playing game ever before, I didn't know what to expect! But my daughters (7 and 9 years old) and I had so much fun diving into Back Again from the Broken Land. They are desperate to play again.\n\u2014Haley Stewart\nBack Again from the Broken Land gave us a great framework to create characters and tell stories about how the heroes come home after their great adventure, what parts of themselves they left behind, and how maybe they didn\u2019t really want to make it back at all. It\u2019s versatile enough to let you tell a sad epilogue about a turncoat who hopes he\u2019s been redeemed at the same time as that of returning hero who may not remember how to be the person she used to be.\n\u2014Chris Newton (@inarvan)\nI wouldn't consider myself a fan of Tolkien, but Back Again from the Broken Land is one of my favourite fantasy RPGs I've played recently. What really makes it sing is the way it centres on telling stories: bittersweet, funny, melancholy, and sometimes tense, but always heartfelt.\n\u2014David Morrison\nBack Again from the Broken Land is a game that remembers that the heart of an enduring fantasy story isn't the swashbuckling or the spell-slinging, it's, well, heart. The mechanics brilliantly encourage players to view their current challenges through layers of backstory, so we really feel how the scenes at the table are so crucial in our characters' own narratives. I've never come out of a one-shot as invested in my party as when playing Broken Land.\n\u2014Brian Lagoda\nA character's backstory is often critical to understanding the meaning and emotional power of the situations that they are confronted with. This seldom finds expression in most games, given the focus on immediacy and action that necessarily dominates play. Back Again From the Broken Land lets us experience the act of one character getting to know another by requiring the characters to tell stories that are meaningful to who they are and who they wish to become.\n\u2014Brandon Brylawski\nAn emotional journey, with a bittersweet mood mixed with great friendships scenes. Those moments felt alive, thanks to the prompts and ideas of the game.\n\u2014Nicolas \"Gulix\" Ronvel\nIn Back Again from the Broken Land, the group jointly weaves a dense net of stories, a unique experience that I found very enjoyable and rewarding. Even a tiny story bit brought up in a half-sentence can grow to a thick strand of the emerging plot, all from the perspective of small but not-too-childlike people. Back Again from the Broken Land is often serious in its tone\u2014after all, threatening Hunters are on your heels\u2014but is seasoned with an ample amount of cozy and moments of surprise and wonder.\n\u2014Philipp Doebler\nUNLOCKED $1000\u2014New playbook: The Stargazer\nAt $1000, we'll add a new playbook to the game: The Stargazer. Back home, they called you a starry-eyed dreamer. How will you shoulder the burden of your foresight?\nUNLOCKED $1300\u2014Six new locations for Journey Path\nAt $1300, we\u2019ll add six new locations to the game: a whole second Journey Path to give you more variation and replayability! In the game as it appeared in Codex: Home, we included these locations:\nThe Steel-Sown Field\nThe Great Sapphire Bridge\nThe Frozen Maw of the Earth\nThe Torchlit Swamplands\nThe Labyrinthine Canyon\nThe Toadstool Forest\nIf we hit this stretch goal, we\u2019ll double the number of locations with another half-dozen sites for your fellowship\u2019s journey.\nUNLOCKED $2500\u2014Hand-drawn map of the journey home \nWhen we reach $2500, we\u2019ll commission a map from Stentor Danielson (check out their work at Mapsburgh) which will include all 12 Journey locations that you\u2019ve unlocked.\nAll pledge tiers will receive a printable PDF of the map, which we encourage you and your players to annotate along the way. By the end of your adventure, you\u2019ll have a record of your game that looks like what one of your characters may have left behind to inspire another generation of adventurers.\nAs for the print-tiers, we\u2019ll be adding the map as the endpapers to the zine, so that the moment you open the game, you\u2019ll get your first glimpse of the Broken Land, and what lies beyond it.\nUNLOCKED $3200\u2014Meguey Baker writes The Haunted\nIf we reach $3200, Meguey Baker of NightSkyGames will be creating The Haunted playbook for Back Again from the Broken Land. Meguey is the designer of Psi*Run and 1001 Nights, and the co-creator of Under Hollow Hills and, of course, Apocalypse World. The Haunted playbook is for a character hailed as a hero but plagued by doubts: \u201cWas it enough, did you really achieve what you set out to do?\u201d\nUNLOCKED $3800\u2014Print-and-play Deck of Details\nBack Again from the Broken Land comes with a list of evocative details for the players to draw on. Whenever you start to tell a story, you can incorporate a detail like:\nFire climbing a house like vines\nOars scattering silver water in the dawnlight\nThe face of a friend under the cloak of a stranger\nA drink with the scent of shorn grass\n When you draw on one of these details in a story you tell, you take Advantage on your roll.\nAt $3800 we\u2019ll add a print-and-play PDF deck of these details for backers at all levels. The deck makes it easier to consider your options, and can even be a tool for setting the tone of the game.\n UNLOCKED $4400\u2014Original Poem\nWe love the iconic poems that open great fantasy novels (\u201cThree rings for the elven kings\u2026\u201d \u201cWhen the Dark comes rising, six shall turn it back\u2026\u201d) and we think your game of Back Again from the Broken Land deserves an opening like that.\nAt $4400, we will write an original poem, \u201cThe Lay of the Broken Land,\u201d and include it in the zine.That means backers at all levels will get to enjoy an evocative verse from Alexi Sargeant, co-designer of the game and sometime paid sonneteer.\nUNLOCKED $5000\u2014Epidiah Ravichol writes The Imposter\nif we reach $5000, Epidiah Ravichol will create The Imposter, a stretch goal playbook for Back Again from the Broken Land. Epidiah Ravichol is a seasoned creator of indie games, responsible for the Jenga-based horror game Dread and the swords-and-sorcery blockbuster Swords Without Master.  The Imposter is someone who got swept up into the fellowship only because they were impersonating a folk hero for personal gain, but has since (perhaps?) found the hero within.\nUNLOCKED $6000\u2014Interior playbook art from Emily Cheeseman\nIf we reach $6000, our cover artist Emily Cheeseman will also create interior art. She\u2019ll do portraits for all nine of the included playbooks. Take a look at Emily's gallery to see why we're so excited about this prospect!\nUNLOCKED $7500\u2014Pay raise for everyone\nIf we reach $7,500, everyone working on the project will get a raise. We\u2019re thrilled about what our collaborators have brought to the game, and we want to share more of the profits with our fellowship. At that goal, we\u2019ll boost rates for everyone by 10% or $50, whichever is greater.\nUNLOCKED! $10,000\u2014Music for \"The Lay of the Broken Land\"\nAt $10,000, we\u2019ll sing in celebration\u2014literally. If we hit that final goal, we will hire a musician to set \u201cThe Lay of the Broken Land\u201d to music. Backers at all levels will receive the final recording.\nSocial Goal: 25 #BackAgainStories on Twitter\u2014Recipe PDF\nLearn about #BackAgainStories here. If we get 25 of them, we\u2019ll send all backers a PDF of a soup recipe\u2014something the adventurers tore in haste from a cookbook back home and brought along on their journey. The recipe will be something tasty you can make for real in your home, and the page will also have marginalia from an adventurer with modifications made to the recipe on the long journey.\nCloven Pine Games is an indie game design house.

I'm a farmer, educator and regenerative agriculture expert dedicated to helping folks make a good living farming, and live a good life whilst being of benefit to the whole.\nChances are you\u2019re here because you know me as the co-owner and director of Ridgedale Farm, from Youtube, or as the author of the groundbreaking manual Regenerative Agriculture, which raised over \u20ac380,000 in pre-sales on Kickstarter a year ago.\nHaving built up a wonderful and sincere following on social media and through my previous work, I want to use my platform to shine a light on some of the unsung heroes who are doing pioneering work and changing the face of local integrity food production.\nIn 2020 we interviewed around 70 of Europe's leading regenerative farmers, including many of our past students. I recently decided to compile their stories, in their own words, into a physical book. I had not initially planned to do this, but whilst putting together an ebook to accompany the summer tour, I was so touched and moved by the passion, innovation, and dedication of all that people were sharing.\nI want this book to be the first of a series, and so this Kickstarter serves as a 'proof of concept'. If there is a demand to bring this into print, I can imagine creating at least 1 or 2 further books as part of the project.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe draft of the book has already been created; and at around 275 pages, it features more than 40 European farmers across all manner of scales and different types of production. From vegetable growers to holistic graziers, pastured poultry to on-farm butchery; it's got a breadth of farms from less than a hectare up to hundreds of hectares. We gave the farmers a basic outline to structure their writing, but wanted people to also tell their stories in their own voices. To summarize, the book contains the 'do's, the don'ts and data' from all these incredible farms. The stories tell about land acquisition, investments, design, enterprise development, tricks and tips, economy, and advice for others following in their footsteps.\n\nWho is this book for?\nThis book is an incredible resource for;\nPeople wanting to start a career in regenerative farming.\nRegenerative farmers who are in the first years of their enterprise and are seeking inspiration, camaraderie, and insight into what others are doing.\nExisting farmers seeking to overhaul their business and land plans into smarter and more ecologically positive models.\nEducators in the field.\nWhy I think it is important\nThere is something vital about hearing from a diversity of people with entirely different budgets, access to land, visions, and contexts as well as cultural opportunities and limitations. People very easily get too focused on 'internet celebrities' and fall into the trap of thinking things 'need to look a certain way'. I want to support, connect, and uplift some of the amazing people you might never hear about, and normalize the reality that things can look anyway!\nThere is something very important about observing the first years of implementing farms and businesses that are lost later into maturity. The first years at Ridgedale allowed us to offer the most influential and powerful training in the field, and I have been acutely aware of exposing people to these early developmental phases. To hear reports, reflections, and advice from hundreds of other farmers across all contexts is a very powerful thing.\nWe need stronger communication and deeper sharing across the network. I have witnessed the power of promoting and connecting other farmers and wish to continue this.\nAs a leader in this field, I am constantly asked for references to people doing certain farming practices in different countries. These books aim to be a resource documenting all the best examples.\nWhat are the next steps?\nI have already successfully self-published two books and sold them to over 90 countries around the world over the last few years. We are running this Kickstarter to gauge interest in this book upfront, so we know that we can afford a print run.\nIf the interest is there, I would like to make the second book (also focused on Europe) in the next few months.\nIf this goes well I would like to make a third book focused on the USA/Canada, where a large part of my following is located, and where we have had quite an influence.\nIf that goes well I would consider a follow-up book covering other areas.\n  2020 showed the fragility of many fundamental systems to people all over the globe, even to those who were not already aware. Yet what I heard consistently over the year interviewing regenerative farmers was 2-300% increases in sales. There's never been a better time to get into farming, and the demand for local integrity food is constantly growing. I dedicated my life to documenting and sharing smart ways to go about farming as a business whilst restoring soils and ecosystems and producing better products than any store can offer. Now it's time to share the stories of many of our students and others who have forged their own place in regenerative farming.\n\nA note on shipping\nShipping physical books globally is not without its challenges. You'd probably be amazed how often books are delayed, damaged, or actually just disappear. Shipping from Sweden is extremely expensive, and throughout 2020 with COVID the postal services in different countries seemed to have somewhat of a meltdown, with delivery times reaching up to 3 months. We recently had a record of a book showing up 6 months later! Because of this, we are now switching over to FedEx to be able to offer much quicker shipping, tracking, and hopefully better-handled books. Let's hope it is a good choice!\nThanks for checking this out!\nRichard", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe draft of the book has already been created.

Each month, Pyramid delivered articles about a specific theme, from modern-day superheroes to post-apocalyptic gaming to magic on the battlefield. Most of Pyramid's articles are either generic, suitable for your game system of choice, or designed for GURPS, one of the best choices for serious gamers for over 20 years.\nDuring the magazine's PDF run (Volume Three), each issue of Pyramid was devoted to one of three general themes: past, present, and future.\nNow, with your support, we're launching the newest incarnation of this gaming magazine! Pyramid Volume Four, if this campaign is successful, will continue where the previous volume left off \u2013 with three new PDF issues covering the three classic themes of past, present, and future.\nNOTE: This campaign is for three new issues only and is not a promise of any issues beyond those produced as part of this Kickstarter project. If there is enough interest and demand, we may return to Kickstarter in the future to expand Volume Four beyond these three issues. \nDigital mockup, not 100% final. Details may change before release.\nIf we succeed, this latest Kickstarter campaign from Warehouse 23 brings three new issues of Pyramid to your library. The three issues (and the included articles at project launch) are:\n Fantasy/Magic I \u2013 Articles at Launch\nToxic Grimoire \u2013 Aleksei Isachenko [new spells for GURPS Magic]\nPandemonium \u2013 Michele Armellini [fantasy-themed alternate Earth]\nThe Cube \u2013 Steven Marsh [fantasy/GURPS Dungeon Fantasy encounter]\n Modern/Action I \u2013 Articles at Launch \nEl Rancho Fin del Camino \u2013 Matt Riggsby [ready-to-use locale, with map]\nDerelicts on Ice \u2013 Carolyn Ivy Stein and Steve Stein [ships to explore]\nSecret Masters \u2013 Rory Fansler [character options for an illuminated campaign]\n Sci-Fi/Tech I - Articles at Launch\nReign of Action \u2013 Roger Burton West [how to use GURPS Action with GURPS Reign of Steel]\nSpace Zombies! \u2013 J. Edward Tremlett [a new type of \"zombies\" for spacefaring campaigns]\nThe Murrinres Portals \u2013 Jason Brick [a campaign framework/device to allow travel between worlds]\nEach issue starts at 20 pages. Stretch goals (see below), when unlocked, expand the page count of each of the three different issues. \nDigital mockup, not 100% final.

This book truly defies description, but here's an excerpt from the back cover of the original 1985 Sun & Moon Press edition:\n\"For years, Manged Hands was passed among New York poets and fiction writers in manuscript form, and its author, Johnny Stanton, developed an underground reputation as one of the most gifted writers of the generation directly influenced by the New York Poets. . . . Mangled Hands stands between Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude in style and spirit.\"\nLeft: Cover of the new Tough Poets Press edition of MANGLED HANDS / Right: Author Johnny Stanton, mid-1980s (Photo by Anthony J Morenzi)\nI could only find one online review of the novel from the year it was originally published. This is what the Washington Post had to say:\n\"Johnny Stanton's Mangled Hands is such an oddity that it confounds description or comparison. . . . Mangled Hands is so unusual and original that many readers with a serious interest in fiction will find it liberating.\" (Click here to read the full review.)\nAnd here are some excerpts from reviews found on Amazon and Goodreads:\n\"This is perhaps the strangest, most visceral and mind-warping thing I\u2019ve ever read.\" // \"A singular reading experience.\" // \"As mad as it may seem to the conventional reader, this is a strange and wonderful novel that any purveyors of strange fiction should not miss.\" // \"It is a subliminal life changing book.\" // \"Great, great book . . . that brings to mind Burroughs and H Miller.\"\nABOUT THE NEW EDITION\nThis new edition of Mangled Hands contains the complete text of the 1985 edition published by Sun & Moon Press. Also included is a new introduction and recent interview with Stanton and his wife, the poet Elinor Nauen, by George Salis.   \nBook Specifications\nFormat: Paperback\nPages: 312\nDimensions: 8.27\" x 5.83\" x 0.78\"\nWeight: 0.75 lbs.\nABOUT JOHNNY STANTON\nJohnny Stanton was born in 1943 in Manhattan, the son of Irish immigrants from Galway. He was an altar boy and Eagle Scout who attended Catholic schools and eventually graduated from Columbia University, where he fell in with many poets and writers of the New York School, including Kenneth Koch, Ted Berrigan, Ron Padgett, and Paul Auster. He published many of them, some for the first time, in his Siamese Banana Press, which started as a newspaper in 1972 and ended as a performance gang in 1978. He is the author of many short stories and the novel Mangled Hands, neglected by critics yet highly acclaimed by the readers who discover it. He has lived in the East Village for 30 years with his wife, the poet Elinor Nauen, a cat (currently Lefty), and a lot of art.

I'm a visual artist obsessed with art technology, and more specifically the alchemy of hand-prepared, natural materials. From the most precious blue that has to travel all the way from Afghan mountains, to the humble and bountiful acorn, the making of colour to write or paint with is a magical process. Last year I made a book dedicated to historical art materials: Inks & Paints of the Middle-East, and you can check out the project and updates for a clear idea of what to expect from Wild Inks. This year, the focus is on preparing colours from foraged plants\u2014and some kitchen scraps\u2014but also all sorts of art-useful products that can also be homemade, from glue to bamboo pens.\nWild Inks is a very approachable handbook even for beginners, but it covers all the ground that a professional would want to know. Before starting on colour materials, you will learn about natural binders (why, what, how), colour modifiers, preservation, as well as what to expect from botanicals in terms of longevity (and ways to extend it, if any). You'll learn how to identify and prepare the plants covered, as well as how they can be stored for later use (if possible). \nThe obvious weakness of such a book is its connection to place: the materials it covers are those I can forage or obtain in the South-East of england where I live. They tend to be common from West Asia to North America, but that leaves out a large part of the planet: however, these other ecosystems do have counterparts to my local plants, containing the same pigments. Therefore it's especially important to clarify the chemistry behind it all, so that the methods can be tried on anything, anywhere.\nForaging (responsibly) is a wonderful practice, and also a deeply reassuring one in a world that's become so volatile and frankly insane: the cycle of seed, blossom, fruit and seed again proceeds no matter what, year after year. Falling into step with seasonality is equally transformative and an antidote to the artificially fast pace that is inflicted upon us. The practice of making one's own materials expands an artist's creative process, but it also cuts down on plastic and the chemical processes by which synthetic colours are prepared. Many of the pigments covered in my previous book are toxic minerals, but nothing hazardous is involved in Wild Inks. This means responsible children, who can be trusted to follow instructions and not put things in their mouth, can take part in the gathering and preparation.\nThe book's outline is still growing, but here's where it stands at the time of launch. Recipes/how-tos are included for everything that can be made:\nPART 1: INTRO\nForaging ethics\nTools\nSafety\nBinders\nModifiers\nWet and dry preservation\nLakes\nTesting for lightfastness\nPART 2: DYE PLANTS\nChemistry of plant colours\nDye extraction\nSPRING PLANTS\nSUMMER PLANTS\nAUTUMN  PLANTS\nWINTER PLANTS\nINGREDIENTS FROM THE PANTRY\nDyeing paper\nPART 3: PIGMENTS (Forageable or home-makeable only)\nOchres\nWhites\nBlacks\nPART 4: SUNDRIES\nBamboo pens\nQuill pens\nGlue\nSoap\nSample info page (may evolve as we go)\nIn terms of rewards, I'm following last year's tiers closely but keeping it simple more than ever. Postage has been raised three times over the past year and I have a feeling it's not over. I don't want folks to part with more money than strictly necessary, so I've planned all the reward tiers, save the highest, to fit the cheaper Large Letter postal format.

With white paisleys on a dignified gray background, these bandanas will be 100 percent cotton printed right here in the good-old USA using duplex printing like the quality bandanas I grew up with.

If there are no calamities, you should have your BADbandanas by April, 2021. Perhaps sooner. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds.\nSHIPPING\nJust the local neighborhood. Because shipping is extra slow and troublesome these days, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, some extras of these BADbandanas will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Peeved Paisleys there.\nTracking. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring your Peeved Paisleys during their next trip.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\n\nLOOSE ENDS\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nThanks for your amazing support.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com.

A joint might be ingeniously engineered or the result of garage tinkering. Designers, architects and engineers alike appropriate standard connectors; they assemble and personalise them. Sometimes, they invent new joinery from scratch. Truly multivalent, the joint is the kind of detail that holds the world together.\nBut because a joint is often invisible, hidden elegantly within an object, it can be overlooked. U-JOINTS sheds light on these hidden details in an in-depth survey of joints.\n\nU-JOINTS - Equations of a universal lifestyle exhibition, Salone del Mobile, Milano, 2018 \u00a9Delfino Sisto Legnani\nU-JOINTS - Equations of a universal lifestyle exhibition, Salone del Mobile, Milano, 2018 \u00a9Delfino Sisto Legnani\nU-JOINTS background\nThe U-JOINTS research project was initiated in 2018 with an exhibition. Called U-JOINTS \u2013 Equations of universal life, it took shape as an eclectic introduction to the topic of connections. Curators Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu broke joints open, organised them by material and production processes, reassembled them into prototypes, and used them in real-world applications. For eight days, U-Joints featured 919 exhibits by 50 international designers and industry professionals. On show was everything from the most common joints to design\u2019s most innovative ones, as well as those that have had the greatest influence on contemporary design and architecture.\nEncouraged by the exhibition\u2019s success and the remarkable attention and endorsement it garnered, the team launched an extensive research challenge: a comprehensive review of the world\u2019s joints and how they hold things together.\nEmploying an inclusive and collective approach from the very beginning, the ongoing research is shared with the public through a series of exhibitions in which contemporary designers, researchers, institutions and critics are invited to share their work with joinery.\nEach show reads like the chapter of a book.\nIn 2019, A taxonomy of nails, screws, rivets, bolts and nuts looked at basic fasteners and was held at Galerie l\u2019elac of ECAL/University of Art and Design Lausanne in Switzerland.\nNext, Adhesives and Fusions will open to the public on 6 March 2021 at the Gewerbemuseum Winterthur. Further exhibitions are being planned.\nFinally, after almost three years of work, we are excited to launch our comprehensive book on the topic. U-Joints \u2013 A taxonomy of connections will come out in 2021.\nU-JOINTS - A taxonomy of nails, screws, rivets, bolts and nuts exhibition, ECAL, Lausanne 2019 \u00a9Calypso Mahieu\nU-JOINTS - A taxonomy of nails, screws, rivets, bolts and nuts exhibition, ECAL, Lausanne 2019 \u00a9Calypso Mahieu\n U-JOINTS  the book\nU-JOINTS \u2013 A taxonomy of connections is an encyclopedic publication that looks at human history through its details, and invites us to see our built environment in whole new ways.\nWeighing in at more than 900 pages, this is the most far-reaching book ever published on the topic of joints. Comprehensive and interdisciplinary, the book features technical information about joinery as well as stories and commentaries. The heart of the book is a vast taxonomy of more than 1300 joints, organized into six main chapters: Basic fasteners, Mechanical joints, Knits and Knots, Wood joints, Adhesives, and Fused joints.\nEach chapter traces the macrocosm of joinery. Together, they create a vast overview of the most common joints as well as insight into joinery\u2019s unique solutions, historical and contemporary. Little known surprises and forgotten connecting methods abound.\nFurthermore, the book features 80 essays and interviews, as well as 120 anecdotes. These share the often-unknown stories of joints, from how they were invented to their many inventive applications. The book also includes more than 1000 images, 240 illustrations and numerous patents. 15 new photographic works by young and upcoming photographers reframe the overlooked details for readers to discover.\nThe book was compiled by a team of more than 50 authors, photographers, illustrators, researchers, experts, scholars, scientists and story tellers, enthusiasts, users, designers, architects, artists, writers and critics, dreamers and makers. Together we hope to bring the many fascinating facets of joints to life.\nThis is a prototype. The final cover and product may slightly differ. \u00a9Margot Sparkes\n\n\nThis is a prototype.

He combines his professional practise with ongoing research in the architectural and urban planning fields, and has published numerous editorial projects and articles. In 2011, Andrea opened his award-winning architecture studio in Milan and three years later, in 2017, he opened another in Shanghai. His work is recognised for its unexpected solutions, often juxtaposing different materials, which draw attention to the smallest of architectural details. The studio works internationally, developing complex projects on all scales, in collaboration with a qualified network of specialist consultants. His first investigation into urban culture\u2019s aesthetic and social influences was published as All City Writers (Critique Livre, 2009) and soon became a sought-after reference work for street culture. From 2018-19, he edited Domus magazine's \"Studio Visit\" column, which explored contemporary architecture studios\u2019 practices. Currently, Andrea\u2019s studio is engaged on behalf of the Vastushilpa Foundation of Ahmedabab to conduct a vast survey on the architecture of Balkrishna Doshi, Pritzker Prize 2018. https://www.andreacaputo.com\n\nAnniina Koivu is a design writer, curator, consultant and teacher, who divides her time between Milan and Lausanne. She works across a number of fields, from curation to art direction, product development, and editorial and research projects, which she develops for clients such as Kvadrat, Iittala, Vitra, Camper and the Shorefast Foundation of Fogo Island. Her latest publication is Vico Magistretti: Stories of Objects (Ecal/Triest, 2020), the result of an investigation of the little-considered moment in the lifespan of design products when production ends, with a focus on the reasons that lead up to this \u2018death\u2019 of the design object. She wrote the comprehensive monograph on Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec Works (Phaidon, 2011) and has edited and contributed to a number of publications such Materialising Colour: Journeys with Giulio Ridolfo (Phaidon, 2020), Atlas of Furniture Design (Vitra Design Museum, 2019), Industrial Facility (Phaidon, 2018), Arita 2016/ (Phaidon, 2017), The Walking Society (Lars M\u00fcller, 2015) and Pierre Charpin's Entre Les Vases (Birkh\u00e4user, 2009) among others. Serving as editor-in-chief, Anniina launched the first print issue of Interwoven (Kvadrat, 2020), an (online) magazine on contemporary culture and independent criticism.

The magazine dives into the stories and adventures of the most talented landscape photographers of our time, all of them having a unique set of experiences from which they have learnt from to become better professionals and human beings. Are exactly those tipping points which make their stories unique. While their words are full of wisdom, through their images these creators invite us into their lives. \nCONTENT & ARTISTS\nAlex Stead - @alex_stead: Long format interview including many photography & travel tips, editing incl. b/a, how to go from passion to profession, client work, etc.\nAsa Steinars - @asa_steinars: Icelandic female photographer in a male dominated sector, Iceland through the eyes of a local, vanlife, from office job to entrepreneur and freelance creator \nAndrea Ference - @vagabondhearts: Everything on back country camping 101, how to get started, safety & comfort items, sustainable camping principles, physical preparation and mental strength, Andrea's sources of happiness.\nThe Intercultural Nomad, an article about the history of nomadism, the importance of indigenous communities then and now and the impact of ethnic tourism. Including complementary interviews with travel photographer Cristoforo Perrone (@cristoforoperrone) and humanitarian documentary photographer Sebastian (@photosooky).\nNomadict Must Reads: A handful of the best stories shared this year on Nomadict. Inspiring and thought-provoking stories that invite you to reflect and delve deeper in the notion of travel and photography.\nExclusive soundtracks created by musician @javiwilliamss for a few of the interviews and stories, stimulating your imagination, creativity and inviting you to take your time and relax. \nFour hidden treasures of Russia by @alexskalin: full page photographs from the most epic locations in Russia.\nBest of the Week gallery: the 52 winners of 2020 are showcased in the magazine together with the most inspiring quotes and lessons shared by the winners, a few highlighted stories and of course the story behind the winning photograph including the secret of the winner's editing process! \nA interactive map of Central Norway with more than 45 photography spots and the GPS coordinates! By scanning the QR you will directly be virtually transported to Norway, allowing you to prepare your next adventurous trip. \n\nCelebrating the modern, nomadic lifestyle as a culture, the magazine showcases the most interesting individuals and their background to inspire those who follow the same passion. But it is so much more!\n\nNomadict magazine is the bridge \nThe Nomadict magazine is filling the gap between the nostalgia of an old travel journal, an atlas or an expedition diary and the desires of a modern traveller in the digital age. By enhancing the written content in the magazine with digital assets such as musical pieces exclusively composed to complement our stories, additional media through QR-codes or links to further reads, we create a perfect bridge between the analog and the digital to guide the reader through both worlds. \nCommunity centered\nBuilding a magazine on and around a community brings strong identification with it. People are consumers and contributors at the same time, which follows the concept of our modern social media platforms. Topics are chosen by the interests of the community or are completely built around them. Stories can start on a digital platform and then find their continuation in the magazine and the other way around. This culminates in the cover that is being chosen by the community over a year-long contest.\nHighly aesthetical\nPhotography is a very visual medium and its creators aim to achieve the most aesthetically pleasing outcome. We follow the same aspiration for beauty in the design of the magazine itself to present the photographs in a coequal way to the reader and match the high standards of our contributors. It comes in the style of a coffee-table book and convinces through a lot of love to details. \nStory focussed\nIn the days of instagram, photographers have found a great platform to present their work to the world. The fast paced consumption behavior of its users can become a crucial point though. Often times, it leads to a lack of background information to a certain picture that doesn\u2018t reach the consumer because of the way they consume or it is not even provided by the creator. We do the work here for you and cherrypick the very best stories behind the most stunning photographs and their creators.\nCreating value\nAs photographers and travel enthusiasts are always searching to improve, gain knowledge or find the next adventure, we want to assist them on their way and provide them with real value to achieve their goals. Embedded into our inspirational stories, we share helpful bits and pieces from the professionals with you. With tips and tricks all around traveling, photography and editing, making your passion a business or by providing precise locations of pictures featured in the magazine, we help the reader to find the right direction to follow their passion.\nTimeless\nWe don\u2018t build our stories upon current events, we create history that last. We don\u2018t focus too much on gear that might be outdated in a while, but the story and emotion that was created using it. We focus on the philosophy and mindset of a real traveller or professional creative. The lifespan and relevance of the magazine is therefore much bigger.\nAd free \nAn ad free magazine allows the reader to enjoy a pure experience from start to end. In this magazine there are no distractions, it is only about maximizing the experience of the reader. This is why you will find among many other things, three exclusive soundtracks for the different stories carefully created to enjoy the magazine at its best. \nComic\nWe have created a comic based on a well-known landscape photographer, Alex Stead. He is the main character of the comic, together with Noma, a young boy who is impressed by Alex and his camera. He secretly joins Alex on his hike toward a legendary sunrise spot in the mountains, until Noma gets in trouble and needs Alex' help...  \n\nWhat will you receive when you support the project?\n*The Rewards included in the different packages \n\n 1) The digital magazine:\n (camera and compass not included)\n\n2) The printed issue and the digital version: \n (camera and compass not included)\n\n 3) The printed issue, a limited edition comic carefully created for this first printed magazine and the digital version: \n(camera and compass not included)\n\n 4) The printed issue, a limited edition comic, a print* of your choice by Daniel Reuber (@skeye_photo) and the digital version: \n (camera, compass and frame of the print not included) *find print choices further down\n\n 5) The printed issue, a limited edition comic, a print* of your choice by Daniel Reuber (@skeye_photo), an honorable mention in the magazine and the digital version:  \n (camera, compass and frame of the print not included) *find print below\nIf you purchase the Art Bundle, you can choose one out of these four prints\n Funding Goals \n6.300\u20ac - Hooray!

I still remember when I was traveling and shooting four years ago, when I realized there were no platforms sharing the stories of some of the most inspiring content creators on social media. \nMoved by a strong curiosity, I thought to myself: \"Maybe I can change that?\" \n\nAletta: \"Meanwhile we have shared over 300 unique stories, originally told in different languages and by people with very diverse backgrounds, but all united by a love for the natural world and a passion for nature.\nTo us it is very special to be somehow invited into the life of photographers, to their artistic journey characterized by exploration, adventure and self discovery. Each story is a piece of wisdom, obtained through life experiences, sending out a message. \nAt Nomadict we want to give a stage to photographers to tell their story, visually and in words, to share learning and inspiration.\"\n\nAlejandro: \"That is exactly what makes this first issue special. We have put together for you some of the most inspiring stories and interviews of the year, and combined those with exclusive and valuable content so you can grow both professionally and personally, and hopefully be inspired to keep following your passion. So, if you think about it, we have created this magazine together with the community, for the community and for everyone who wants to become part of it.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFinishing the magazine: \nWe try our best and work extra time in, but delays can happen. We are working together with many different creators for the content of our magazine and it is challenging to manage sometimes - we want to respect their personal time and jobs as well and give them realistic deadlines that match our needs and their possibilities.\n\nPrinting:\nPrinting delays is our biggest challenge. and we also depend on the schedule of the printer.

Each of his fantastical characters is accompanied by a line of text, a poem or a brief story that captures their essence. These visual narratives are pulled to the surface through Allen\u2019s renowned mastery of storytelling and his use of graphite, pencil and oils. The result is a fascinating journey into the mind of this intriguing artist.\nCovenant Interior Sample Art\nAllen\u2019s strength comes from his mystical connection to his work. He views himself as a guardian and creates artistic personas that serve the well-being of others. At first sight, his mythological characters may look odd, monstrous or grotesque. Yet they represent the good that can be found when you look below the surface of an individual. Allen has always liked the underside of things. He embraces the bits of mortality that poke out from under the skin. The artwork collected here addresses Allen\u2019s need to face the challenges that surround him while projecting himself into the art. He is driven by creating images based on the strength of an individual\u2019s actions, regardless of how they may be perceived for not conforming to society\u2019s semblance of beauty.\nCovenant Interior Sample Art\nAll prints are available as add-ons to your book pledge.

Photo by Danin Drahos.\nAllen Williams is an award-winning illustrator, concept designer and fine artist. From a young age, he found that a pencil and paper provided an escape and a refuge. Now internationally known, Allen has applied his talents to everything from illustration for gaming companies and book covers to concept work for major motion pictures and television. His vision for such projects ranges from illustration to concept work, as well as creature and character designs.\nAllen\u2019s personal work has a strong basis in reality but always flows into otherworldly aspects. He primarily works in graphite, gouache and oils. Multilayered images arise in his work, in which the fragility and instability of our seemingly certain reality is questioned. Allen\u2019s drawings directly respond to his surrounding environment, and he uses everyday experiences and objects as a starting point for many of his pieces. These often feature framed instances and objects that would go unnoticed in their original context. By choosing mainly formal solutions, Allen tries to develop forms that do not follow logical criteria but are based only on subjective associations and formal parallels; these are meant to incite the viewer to make new personal associations within his work.\nCovenant Interior Sample Art\nAll book pledges come with an 6 x 8\" Ex Libris bookplate. (This will not be affixed in the book.) This item will be available nowhere else and is exclusive to this campaign. This is just one way we would like to thank you for supporting us!\nAll Kickstarter bonus items are limited to one per backer.\nStretch goals are a way for us to offer an additional thank you as the campaign grows. \nStretch Goal #1 Unlocked!\nWe are adding 16 more pages to the book.

This video will appeal equally to artists who are looking to advance their own craft, and to fans to get an inside look at how Allen makes a drawing. We will be making this video available online that you can stream from any of your devices.\nAdd-on anything to anything!

Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published nearly 100 books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nThanks to everyone has supported us.

Over the course of 10 days, you'll explore a remote area you find yourself trapped in. In responding to the journaling prompts, players are encouraged to draw parts of their responses, even if you don't think that your drawing skills are good. This is a game for you about falling out of your comfort zone.\nIt's important that players understand that below addresses many topics that could be upsetting to players. The narrative of the game addresses depression through metaphor, and as such, for players who aren't in a good place mentally, it may not be the game for you right now.\nIn below, you play someone exploring an area they used to love but no longer feel connected to. At the end of the first day, you fall into a dark, unfamiliar region and cannot find a way out. Over the course of the ten days of the game, you'll keep a record of your explorations through words and images as you endure.\nContent Warnings: below addresses, through metaphor, depression and the disconnection that comes along with it. There are prompts that address falling, being lost, not having food or water, nearly drowning, and harm to an animal caused by predation and its resulting suffering.\n\nThe game will be emailed to you on December 21st, the darkest day of the year.

If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?\nAs a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay!\n\nAs I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined!\n\nI realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries. \n\nNow I want to share this book with everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries and The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.\nThere is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.\nVsevolod  Co-founder of The Book\n\nThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to the Summa Technologiae of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration.\n\nOn the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won\u2019t stop thinking of what you saw.\nThis section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you\u2019ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You\u2019ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don\u2019t need it anymore. We\u2019ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We\u2019ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We\u2019ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.\nThe whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there\u2019s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it\u2019s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we\u2019ll reveal the most original one.\nResearchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that\u2019s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes\nIn all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we\u2019ve agreed that killing people isn\u2019t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still\u2026.The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You\u2019ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you\u2019ll become immortal (for a while).\nThe home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don\u2019t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you\u2019ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You\u2019ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you\u2019ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won\u2019t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)\n\nIt\u2019s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you\u2019ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You\u2019ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer. (Which will literally be the best beer in the world since you\u2019ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization)\nLife is not only about surviving; it\u2019s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won\u2019t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You\u2019ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We\u2019ll tell you how to make a vibrator.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It\u2019s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don\u2019t forget to ask about their notation too. \n\nRituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?\nA Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You\u2019ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.\n\nPeople had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep\u2019s stomachs. And don\u2019t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won\u2019t be able to make your new world fully civilized. \nThe intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world\u2019s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn\u2019t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.\nIn one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries you\u2019ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.\nThis book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

All the pages of the book will be printed on special thick 157gsm paper. This is a high-quality mat art paper, which definitely feels well and holds well. The Ultimate Guide will be a hardcover book and will have stunning matt laminated cover.\nThe Ultimate Guide contains knowledge of humankind and it can\u2019t come to life without the help of people. We need the support of enthusiasts who believe in the unique future of the human mind.\n                                                   In the first place, the raised money will go to the illustrators because The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries forms a collection of great detailed pictures. The budget also includes the work of content editors and the book\u2019s printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe Book project is promoted by REPROJECT.\n\n\nFB agencies:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The first and most important thing was to assemble the team of professionals. We spent some time looking for illustrators whose drawing style would be convenient and could match with others\u2019 styles. It was a big deal to find writers for this project as soon as our expectations were rather high and we had a huge number of unsuccessful attempts before we could find writers who can perfectly complement their texts with the illustrations. We also searched out for many researches who support both our writers and illustrators with all the needed technical information. We managed to find experts in scientific, medical, technical and social fields who constantly advise us on what information the book should include to provide readers precise and workable instructions. All in all, we have 36 people in our team, about 10 side experts and this number is constantly growing. After that came the second step of our work which unfortunately took more time and turned out to be more complicated than we expected. We all had to get used to each other to stabilize and optimize the working process. The problem on the technical side was that we\u2019re an international team of nearly 40 people living in different countries all over the world. Time lag challenged our determination and commitment to work together on this amazing project. Finally, we won this fight but there were many others yet to come. Sometimes it was a hard time for us to learn to hear each other, we could meet every day and argue about many small and insignificant thing for hours. We still meet every day but now we can proudly say that our meetings are more productive than ever before. At last, making process is synchronized and we\u2019re actively working on the book.

To bring this concept to life we\u2019re working hardly and experimenting on both levels of the book \u2013 illustrations and texts.\n\nWe think that the best way to describe our way of working process is to say that we use cut-and-try approach.

(What is Letterpress? You can find out here)\nThe previous Dictionary Story book and print were widely collected, finding their way into libraries such as the British Library UK, the Library of Congress US, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France FR, Deutsche Nationalbibliothek DE, as well as museums like the V&A museum UK and The Getty Research Institute USA, MoMA NY and the Tate UK.

Dictionary Story is a fairy tale as concrete poem, a typographical romance, filled with wit and tenderness.\u201d  Marina Warner - Author & Curator \nThe idea of a fluid language has been explored throughout Winston's 20 year practice and the project has taken many forms - including a full folded dictionary where he transformed the twenty volumes of the OED into a 80,000 folded page sculpture.\n\"Dictionary Story has always been close to my heart. I think we don't examine words well enough and presume we all share the same understanding of what things might mean. A Dictionary Story playfully explores this presumption - deep down into the subterranean world of letters and type.\" Sam Winston\nWe would love your support in bringing this new story to life. 2020 has been a year where \"Fantasy has been mistaken as Fact, Jokes have been reported as News and Literature itself has sometimes slipped into Trivia\u201d [a sample line from the new story].

Prove your worth by studying the documents, constructing the jigsaws, and solving the puzzles... and you\u2019ll be treated to a heartbreaking story that culminates in a shocking reimagining of the truth behind Mary Shelley\u2019s famous novel.\nCombining the best of escape rooms, board games, and immersive theater, Mother of Frankenstein is a 10-15 hour cooperative gaming experience for between 1 and 6 players, ages 13 and up. Mother of Frankenstein was designed to be as welcoming and fun for newbies as it is rewarding for experts, combining the narrative complexity of a good novel with the physicality and challenge of a puzzle-filled escape room. Throw in a couple of clue-strewn jigsaw puzzles, and our game truly has something for everyone!\nOur final stretch(es)!\nStretchy!\nMother of Frankenstein is divided into three volumes. Volume 1 concerns Mary\u2019s teenage years and her education by her iconoclastic father. Players must complete three assignments\u2014poetry, music, and astronomy\u2014each of which is presented in the form of a puzzle. Simultaneously, Mary embarks on a love affair with the dashing (but married) poet Percy Shelley. The course of their courtship is laid out over 15 love letters, though players must read closely to determine the order of events!\nIn Volume 2, the venue changes to Germany, and Castle Frankenstein, where a fancy ball is being thrown on a balmy night in 1814. Players begin by constructing a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle of the castle\u2019s floorplan, then use it\u2014along with gossip rags, billiard hall schedules, and original drawings by comic book artist Liana Kangas\u2014to track the events of the evening.\nFinally, in Volume 3, you\u2019ll construct an epic 3D puzzle of Castle Frankenstein and descend into the secret laboratory hidden therein, where you\u2019ll discover what Mary learned under the tutelage of the famous alchemist who called the place home, and how it inspired her to write what many call the first science fiction novel, Frankenstein. \nWhen our heroes tweet, we screencap.\nThe Standard Edition of Mother of Frankenstein contains the following: \n The Ultimate Edition adds our special printing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, featuring original art by comic book artist Liana Kangas (which has its own reward tier, if you just feel like a re-read!), as well as a ton of other fancy stuff.

Please note this information - both shipping payment and address - will be collected via BackerKit (our Pledge Manager) and any delay in providing that info may present a delay in receipt of product. \n\nFor those USA buyers that have been incorrectly charged shipping on our $949 and $999 tier, will will issue you a refund ASAP - please message us for any inquiries. \n\nYes, this is our first time making a tabletop game. However, this is not our first Kickstarter Campaign - check out THE LADDER Replayable Escape Room. Our core businesses are both based in live entertainment and production, so we have years of experience designing, building, and creating projects with lots of moving pieces - and massive budgets - such as escape rooms, live theatre including Broadway, and in Film and TV. \n\nAs for design, the team is already hired and assembled, so there are no unknowns there. The biggest potential issues are if more troubles crop up around COVID, though it's hard to imagine any that would get in the way of our work, which doesn't require much (if any) grouping in physical space.

Terry has been working 60-hour weeks finalizing the insanely complex imagery that goes into the 3D puzzle. Basically, Frankenstein's castle and its environs have been fully modelled in 3D. Then, through Terry magic, 2D textures are constructed to best simulate what it would \"feel\" like to be looking at this 3D castle from various angles, which are then applied to the facades.

Together, we\u2019ve created a brand-new edition of Don\u2019t Get Got with 120 new missions and an aggressively orange colour scheme.\nIf you don\u2019t own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect. Included in this \u00a320 box is everything you need to play.\nIf you DO own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect too! Think of this box as a very generous expansion, doubling the amount of missions in the base game and letting you play with up to 20 players. Imagine that! It would be carnage.\nCheck out SU&SD\u2019s glowing review!\nAre you the kind of hotshot who doesn\u2019t have 10 minutes to watch a video? Not a problem, here\u2019s a quick gif-stuffed overview:\nDon\u2019t Get Got is a game of secret missions for 2-10 players, and it takes place while you go about your day. Perfect places to break out Don\u2019t Get Got would be living with housemates, at work, on holiday, at parties, even at gaming conventions.\nEach player receives a cute little wallet full of unique missions, and then you just get back to living your life, except you\u2019re immediately going to start scheming like a mean scheme machine:\nHand out some random missions to each player\nEach mission will tell you what you\u2019ve got to try and trick the other players into doing...\nRead and insert the missions into your wallet\nEach time you succeed at this you get to (a) flip over the little mission in your wallet, which is super satisfying:\nNailed it!\nand (b) reveal your mission to the player who just got got, which is even more satisfying:\nPoint and rejoice\nBut there\u2019s a catch! If you ever get caught (which is as easy as another player asking if you\u2019re trying to trick them), that mission is flipped over to the \u201cFAILED IT\u201d side for the rest of the game.\nFailed it :'(\nThe first player to complete 3 missions wins!\nVictory\nThe writers at Shut Up & Sit Down have had a great time creating new expansions for some of their favourite party games, like Monikers and The Metagame. When Big Potato asked if we wanted to design a brand-new box for Don\u2019t Get Got, we leapt at the chance.\nIncluded in this Shut Up & Sit Down Special Edition are 10 plastic wallets, 1 collectible sticker and 120 missions, all of which were painstakingly entered into a spreadsheet by team SU&SD.\nIn all seriousness, we worked super hard on this, and went through several rounds of refinement and feedback with the original game\u2019s designers. The perfect Don\u2019t Get Got mission makes you smile when you receive it, and represents an interesting, open-ended puzzle as to how exactly you\u2019re going to pull it off. We aimed to deliver that with each and every mission.\n\n\nBut of course not! With enough pledges we will reveal not one, not five, but three stretchy goals that we\u2019d like to offer all of our backers for absolutely free.\nYou took that poor target and smashed it into pieces!\nAs a reward, you\u2019ve unlocked the \u2018EPIC MISSIONS\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions that require so much forethought, even a criminal mastermind would wince at them.\nSurprise extra stretchy goal unlocked! \nWe messed up with the shipping, so here\u2019s something to say sorry \u2014 all the cards from the original Don\u2019t Get Got game. That\u2019s 186 extra missions, carefully placed inside each and every copy of the Kickstarter special edition.\nYou want the rest? Well guess what, you can\u2019t handle the rest!\nOnly joking, of course you can. Introducing the \u2018GAME NIGHT\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions, all designed to be played while you\u2019re playing another board game.

The Castle Peak Dragon Kiln, a 20-meter long tunnel-like structure, was built in the 40s by an overseas Chinese named Szeto Nao Tao (\u53f8\u5f92\u6012\u6fe4). Initially a money-losing business, Szeto hired Leung Sum (\u6881\u68ee), a Shiwan kiln master who settled in Hong Kong in the 50s. Eventually, Leung and his workers took over the kiln and renamed it the \"Workers' Pottery Kiln\" (\u2f2f\u5408\u9676\u7aaf), firing functional ware of daily use until the 1980s. \n\u4e5d\u6bb5\u5668\u7269\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\uff0c\u4e5d\u500b\u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\n...\n\u300c\u9ede\u7172\u35ce\uff1f\u300d\n \u300c\u653e\u6652\u5572\u5622\u843d\u53bb\u54aa\u5f97\u56c9\u300d\n\n \u4e0d\u77e5\u600e\u6a23\uff0c\u5abd\u5abd\u7172\u7684\u6e6f\uff0c\u5473\u9053\u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u71ac\u591c\u6642\u559d\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u7897\u3002\u7591\u5718\u4e00\u76f4\u6c92\u6709\u89e3\u958b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u67d0\u5929\uff0c\u5abd\u5abd\u5230\u8a2a\u3002\n\n \u300c\u6897\u4fc2\u5514\u5f97\u5566\uff01\u7528\u74e6\u7172\u6162\u6162\u7172\u5148\u5920\u706b\u5019\u561b\u3002\u300d\n\n \u66fe\u7d93\uff0c\u6bcf\u500b\u5abd\u5abd\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u74e6\u7172\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u9019\u500b\u7576\u5e74\u54cd\u9f8d\u7aaf\u51fa\u7522\u7684\u3002\u4e0d\u904e\u4f9d\u5bb6\u74e6\u7172\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5c11\u898b\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u6709\u65e5\u9f8d\u7aaf\u6d3b\u5316\uff0c\u6703\u6709\u74e6\u7172\u61c9\u5e02\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e36\u4e00\u500b\u74e6\u7172\u7d66\u5abd\u5abd\uff0c\u54c1\u5690\u5abd\u5abd\u7684\u5473\u9053\u3002\n...\n\u300a\u5668\u8aaa\u2fd3\u7aaf\u300b\u8a34\u8aaa\u7684\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u689d\u9676\u7aaf\u548c\u4e00\u4e9b\u9676\u5668\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u8aaa\u7684\u66f4\u662f\u9999\u6e2f\u548c\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u300c\u2ed8\u2f2d\u2fd3\u7aaf\u300d\u71d2\u88fd\u9676\u5668\u54c1\u985e\u7e41\u591a\uff0c\u66fe\u51fa\u7522\u4e0d\u5c11\u5bb6\u5bb6\u2f3e\u2f3e\u5fc5\u5099\u7684\u2f47\u2f64\u9676\u5668\u3002\u300a\u5668\u8aaa\u2fd3\u7aaf\u300b\u7cbe\u9078\u4e5d\u4ef6\u7522\u81ea\u9752\u5c71\u9f8d\u7aaf\u3001\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u9676\u5668\uff0c\u8b93\u4e5d\u4ef6\u9676\u5668\uff0c\u5e36\u6211\u5011\u56de\u5473\u9999\u6e2f\u820a\u6642\u5149\ufe55\n\u7802\u7172 \u2014 \u5bb6\u50b3\u2f3f\u4f5c\u7802\u7172\u662f\u5bb6\u7684\u7368\u7279\u5473\u9053\n\u4e94\u52a0\u2f6a\u9152\u6a3d \u2014 \u6b66\u4fe0\u2f5a\u5916\u2f00\u6a23\u80fd\u66a2\u98f2\u7684\u4e94\u52a0\u2f6a\n\u7aaf\u78da \u2014 \u71d2\u9676\u5668\u7684\u9676\u7aaf\u5c31\u2f64\u9676\u6ce5\u9020\n\u2f54\u6e20 \u2014 \u96b1\u6c92\u65bc\u90fd\u5e02\u4e4b\u4e2d\u7684\u885b\u2f63\u57fa\u5efa\n\u9322\u7f4c \u2014 \u2f29\u6642\u5019\u70ba\u4e86\u2f3c\u982d\u597d\u6454\u7834\u7834\u4e86\u7684\u591a\u5c11\u500b\u9322\u7f4c\n\u2fa6\u5854 \u2014 \u6cdb\u8ac7\u6baf\u846c\u3001\u2ea0\u9593\u7fd2\u4fd7\u3001\u71d2\u9676\u50b3\u7d71\n\u74e6\u2f5a \u2014 \u6a38\u7d20\u5c4b\u7c37\u4e0b\u88fd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u7f8e\u9676\u74f7\u88dd\u98fe\n\u5323\u9262 \u2014 \u71d2\u7aaf\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u6b66\u5668\n\u2f6f\u7063\u516c\u4ed4 \u2014 \u7cbe\u7dfb\u50b3\u7d71\u85dd\u8853\u54c1\nNine Objects of the Kiln, Nine Stories of Hong Kong\n...\n\"How do you make your soup, mom?\" I ask. \"Just throw all the ingredients in....\" She says, all nonchalant. \nFor some reason, Mom's soup always had a unique flavour.

While it is a distinctly Hong Kong story, we want to share it with the world, so the volume is written in both traditional Chinese and English. It will showcase never-before-seen archival images, brand new photography, and original illustration that bring the olden days of the kiln to life. All our collaborators -- including researcher, writer, editor, photographer, illustrator, designer and publisher -- are local creatives. \nWe are grateful to have received funding from the Lord Wilson Heritage Trust and the Design Trust for a part of the book's funding. The purpose of this crowdfunding is to raise the remaining amount through a pre-sale of the book. Also, through your pledges, we will know how many copies to print,  thereby reducing waste. \nOur funding sources:\nLord Wilson Heritage Trust - 40%\nDesign Trust - 30%\nCrowdfund Pre-sale - 30% \nTotal - 100%\nWhat if we pass our target?\nIf pledges exceed the target, we will use the funds to print extra copies that will be sent for free to schools and libraries. If there are still funds left over after that, they will be used strictly for activities that help our Concern Group achieve our mission (see more about us below). Those activities include:\npublic exhibitions\npublic and school talks\nprinted material (e.g. catalogue, pamphlets, leaflets) supporting these events\ninterviews (video recording, editing, transcribing and translating) \nFor more information about our past activities, visit our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/hkdragonkiln.\n\u9999\u6e2f\u9f8d\u7aaf\u95dc\u6ce8\u7d44\n\u9999\u6e2f\u9f8d\u7aaf\u95dc\u6ce8\u7d44\u662f\u975e\u725f\u5229\u6c11\u9593\u7d44\u7e54\uff0c2017\u5e74\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u6210\u54e1\u96c6\u85dd\u8853\u754c\u3001\u5efa\u7bc9\u754c\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u754c\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u611b\u597d\u9676\u85dd\uff0c\u63a8\u52d5\u9f8d\u7aaf\u4fdd\u80b2\u53ca\u6d3b\u5316\u3002\u81f3\u4eca\u6240\u5f97\u3001\u4ee5\u81f3\u65e5\u5f8c\u7c4c\u5f97\u7684\u8cc7\u91d1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5168\u6578\u70ba\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0b\u5217\u76ee\u6a19\u6240\u7528\u3002\n\u95dc\u6ce8\u7d44\u56db\u5927\u76ee\u6a19\ufe55\n \u6d3b\u5316\u9999\u6e2f\u9f8d\u7aaf\uff0c\u95dc\u6ce8\u5176\u4fdd\u5b58\u53ca\u4fdd\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\n\u4fdd\u5b58\u9f8d\u7aaf\u76f8\u95dc\u8cc7\u6599\n\u63a8\u52d5\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u516c\u773e\u53c3\u8207\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\n\u8b93\u9752\u5c71\u9676\u7aaf\u6210\u70ba\u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u300cLiving Museum\u300d(\u6d3b\u7684\u535a\u7269\u9928\uff09\n\u300c\u9752\u5c71\u9f8d\u7aaf\u300d\u662f\u5c6c\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u689d\u5b8c\u6574\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u9f8d\u7aaf\uff0c\u9f8d\u7aaf\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u5c8c\u5c8c\u53ef\u5371\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u5011\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u4f9d\u9760\u8a18\u9304\uff0c\u5b88\u4f4f\u6211\u5011\u73cd\u91cd\u7684\u9999\u6e2f\u6b77\u53f2\u3002\nFacebook\ufe55@hkdragonkiln \nInstagram\ufe55@hongkongdragonkiln \nWebsite: hkdragonkiln.org \nHong Kong Dragon Kiln Concern Group\nThe Hong Kong Dragon Kiln Concern Group is a non-profit civil society organization.

Hopefully, we are going to publish this book in December 2020 in Hong Kong, but we still want to let you know about some risks and challenges of our project.\n\n1. Will we finish the project? \n\n40% of the text, 80% of photographs of our book have been completed. Our team of writers, editors, illustrators, translators, photographers, and designers have been working closely together on book production since last summer. We are working with MCCM Creations, one of the most creative independent book publishing houses in Hong Kong, to produce our book.\n\nWe have already received funding from Lord Wilson Heritage Trust and Design Trust. With your support for our project, we can ensure the completion of our project and our book reaching wider audiences.\n\n2. Can we handle the logistics of distribution?\n\nAll books will be sent via Hong Kong Post. Due to the coronavirus, airmail is currently not available. With our December launch, we hope and believe service will have resumed by then. If not, we will dispatch them as soon as service resumes. We will keep you updated on book delivery.\n\n3. Will you collect my personal information?\n\nIf the project is successfully funded, we will need to collect your name and address so we may send you the rewards. As such, and per Kickstarter's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, we would bear the responsibility of handling this personal information safely. We will use this information solely for the purpose of providing you the rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge HK$ 180 or more", "title": "\u3010\u96f2\u4e0a\u7802\u7172 Zero Carbon Footprint Bundle\u3011", "descp": "\u96a8\u8eab\u651c\u5e36\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\uff0c\u96a8\u6642\u95b1\u8b80\uff0c\u96f6\u70ad\u9996\u9078\uff01\nA digital copy of our book.
