[{"backer": "The Local Strangers", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "***EDIT (03/09/20): THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! We're over the moon with gratitude, and are moving on to a stretch goal of $9,000 by the end of our campaign on March 19! \nSeeing the outpouring of support, good wishes, and contributions so far has been pretty humbling\u2014we couldn't ask for a better community. We can't wait to share the results of this effort with you!\nThe initial $7,500 we've raised so far helps us cover our upfront recording expenses, but there are many more costs associated with a project like this. (See below for a detailed breakdown!) If you are interested in supporting the campaign or want to splurge on a new level of rewards, we'd love to have you on board to help us hit our new goal!\nWhen is the right time to take a chance?\nWe first sang together years ago along a sandy stretch of the Washington coast, on a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip with some friends. We were barely more than strangers, but our musical chemistry and connection was undeniable, as was our shared passion for and ambition around the music we were creating. After a few tentative starts\u2014writing our first song together, playing a few low-key gigs\u2014we decided to take a chance on one another and form a band.\nThat leap of faith started a musical journey that has blossomed into more than we ever could have imagined. 162 incredible Kickstarter backers helped us record and release our first full album, Through the Night, in 2017. Since then, we\u2019ve played our music on both coasts of the US, played on radio stations across the country, released two more critically-acclaimed music videos, and toured in Europe (twice!). Through the Night was everything we hoped it would be, both personally and professionally. We\u2019ve learned so much, and built a rich and fertile foundation of experiences to draw upon as we grow. Now, fueled by the work of the past two years, our sound and style has evolved and matured to the point that we\u2019re ready to go back into the studio to record our sophomore effort. We're dreaming big, and we need you to help bring this to fruition.\nPlaying at the Triple Door (July 2018). Photo credit: Tony Hammons\nHere are the real numbers of what creating this album is going to cost to record, mix, master, produce, distribute, and promote:\nRecording and mixing (18 days for 12 songs - roughly 1.5 days per song, which is standard): $10,800 \nMastering (approx. $50/song): $600 \nPaying our musicians (drums, bass, violin, cello, etc.): $1200 \nCopyright registration (US Copyright Office): $50 \nAlbum art/layout and graphic design: $600 \nPrinting and distribution (CD Baby, 1000 CDs): $1,500 \nReward fulfillment (t-shirts, art prints, etc.): $1,200 \nKickstarter fees (8-10% of total amount raised): $900 \nPromotion (radio and publicity campaigns to promote the album): $5,000\n  This adds up to $21,850 just to get these songs out to the world. (Putting that into perspective, labels will invest $50k+ at a minimum to create and promote an album.)\nWe are only asking for $7,500\u2014around 33% of the total cost to make this happen. Why is that not a crazy risk for us (and for you)? The short answer is that the success of our past work means that we are prepared to take responsibility for covering at least some of these costs ourselves, and we take this quite seriously. However, creating an album has significant upfront expenses: your support makes it possible for us to cover the initial costs of recording a high-quality album. If we reach our minimum required goal, anything above and beyond that will go towards our stretch goals, opening the door to more options than what the bare minimum can cover: a bigger investment in publicity and radio support, more videos and other creative work to support the album, access to better resources, etc.. \nWe need your help to get this album off the ground. We\u2019re prepared to make the rest happen through our own hard work. We have some of Seattle\u2019s best creative minds and most talented musicians working with us to make these songs come alive. Hopefully, we also have you!\nYou can stream our past releases by following the links below.

We are not going to cut corners, and are prepared to cover the costs of any additional expenses if and when they arise. But we need your help with the rest.\n\nWe really hope you will help us reach our goal of $7,500\u2014under the \"all or nothing\" Kickstarter system, this project will not be possible if we fall short.\n\nEvery donation, no matter how small, helps a lot and your generosity means the world to us!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Download the album", "descp": "A huge thank you, and a digital download of our new album - woohoo!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Be the first to get a hard copy", "descp": "A huge thank you, a physical copy of our album, AND a digital download!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Autographed CD + custom artwork", "descp": "An autographed hard copy plus a digital download of our album, plus a handwritten thank-you note on a piece of song-related custom artwork!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Oh hey, I like your style!", "descp": "An autographed hard copy plus a digital download of our album, a handwritten thank-you note on custom artwork, and a March to May t-shirt (we're getting the really soft ones)!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "VIP tickets + more", "descp": "An autographed hard copy plus a digital download of our album, a custom thank-you note, a March to May t-shirt, and two VIP tickets to our next big show\u2014come hang out with us backstage!\n*You can choose a concert date at any point in the next year, but note rewards listed will be delivered by November of 2020.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "The sneak peak: A special May concert", "descp": "Everything in the $75 reward, plus two tickets to an intimate pre-release listening party and performance in a beautiful historic home in Capitol Hill on Saturday, May 2nd, with gourmet hors d'oeuvres and beverages included.\n*Please note album, t-shirt and artwork will be delivered later in the year, as shown in the respective rewards.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers", "Limited (10 left of 25)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "Host a house concert!", "descp": "Host a house concert!

Therefore, we'd need to coordinate things very, very carefully. ...Let's just say throwing a global pandemic, an economic shutdown, and the need for social distancing into the mix did NOT make our job easier.

Here's a bit about us, the music we're making, and why we're asking for your help.\nWhat We're Up To\nWe've joined forces with an incredible team to create a new band, a giant sound, and our first EP. Produced by Eric Lilavois (Atlas Genius, My Chemical Romance, Saint Motel), engineered by Julian Anderson, and mastered by Ed Brooks (Pearl Jam, Death Cab for Cutie, R.E.M.), Lyle's new EP, Coward, is a force to be reckoned with\u2014but we need a little more help before we can bring it to your ears. \nWho's Lyle?\nLyle is a Seattle-based art rock band that began in the summer of 2018 as a twinkle in Arthur James and Lana McMullen's communal eye. The two had been writing and playing in the Seattle music scene for a few years, but they decided to band together with a group of local giants to make a bigger, bolder sound.\nOver the last year, the band's expanded to seven members, recorded a monster of an EP at the historic London Bridge Studio, and released a single, \"Get Me,\" which was premiered by Artist Home's Jake Uitti and played on Seattle's 107.7 The End.\nMeet the Band\nArthur James: Lead vocals, curator of whale sounds, lead guitar, writer\nLana McMullen: Lead vocals, harmony wizard, rhythm guitar, writer\nLeah Tousingnant: Vocals, keys, architect of beep-boop sounds, resident theory wiz pt. 1\nNate Peden: Purveyor of low frequency architecture, deliverer of bassy beats \nNatalie Gray: Violin, master of the stratosphere, composer\nMatt Price: Drummer, collector of resonant things, fan of found objects, resident theory wiz pt. 2\nPhil Hirshi: Cello, resident theory wiz pt. 3, composer\nWhy We Need Your Help\nFrom studio time to recording to mixing and mastering, there's a lot that goes into making a record\u2014and it all adds up fast! Below we've broken out our budget into what we're asking for, and why. \nMeeting the sum we've specified would mean a ridiculous amount to everyone in the band. It means we can produce this record right\u2014paying important folks who have made the whole thing possible. But the part you play is just as important\u2014because you bring the music from the soundboard into the speakers. And we can't do it without you. \nThe Monies\n$15,000: This amount goes directly into the hands of the people who captured the tunes\u2014Eric Lilavois, Julian Anderson, and Ed Brooks. And they are deserving hands.\n$250: The remaining amount we're paying our sound tech and videographers for a series of three live session videos\u2014each of which you'll see over the course of this campaign. The band has already paid $600 of the $850 total, with $250 left over.\n$1,050: This is the amount we need to pay the distribution company for physical copies of the EP, and to make sure our music ends up on digital platforms.\n$1,000: This amount gets us the shirts, hats, koozies, and printing supplies mentioned in the reward options as well as some other cool merch you'll see further down the line. \n$700: The amount that goes to Kickstarter in fees.\nAny amount we make past the $18,000-dollar total will go towards our tour in the summer of 2019, hiring promoters to make sure this EP gets the exposure it deserves, and into our band bank account to prepare for future expenses\u2014of which there are always many. \nHow You Can Help\nCrowd funding is a strange and beautiful thing. It's a pretty unreal representation of the power of community support, and an amazing example of the way many small contributions can make very big dreams happen. Any amount you can contribute to this project would mean the world to us.\nThe Risks\nThis is an all-or-nothing kind of thing. We have 30 days to raise $18,000, and if we don't end up reaching our total goal, we don't get any of the money we do raise. That's a big risk! But we completely believe in this project and the power of community.\nThe Rewards\nAlong the right-hand side of this page, we've put together some fun, eclectic reward packages at varying levels\u2014everything from set lists and beer koozies to backstage passes to Lyle's debut EP release show and admission to an exclusive listening party at London Bridge Studio. If you have any questions about the reward structure, please don't hesitate to contact the band. You can reach us on this platform, at lyleband.com, or at lyletheband@gmail.com. \nOnce you've made your pledge, share about it! Kickstarter is a crowd-funding platform, so for this project to be successful, we need as many people to see it as possible. Please spread the word in as many ways as you feel comfortable\u2014via word-of-mouth, facebook, twitter, instagram, tumblr, carrier pigeon, you name it. \nThe Logistics\nOnce you've pledged, you'll receive our update emails to keep you in the loop about the project and aware of when you can expect your reward in the mail. Again\u2014if questions come up during the course of the campaign, please don't hesitate to get in touch\u2014we'd love to hear from you.\nWebsite: lyleband.com\nFacebook: facebook.com/lyleband\nEmail: lyletheband@gmail.com\nTwitter, Instagram: @lyleband\nTHANK YOU.

I have a beautiful and talented group of musical minds in my corner to bring this music to life as a band.  And we have you, the listeners and supports to help us carry all this forward.

The result is something that I am happy to say resonated deeply with a number of people, and for that I am very grateful. More than anything I feel accomplished in having finally carried those song ideas into completion and proved to myself that I could actually make an album, which is something I felt excruciatingly discouraged about for many years.\nMaking music that people can connect with on the purest level is what I constantly aspire to do.  Hardly a moment goes by in my waking (and sometimes dreaming) life where my mind is not preoccupied with thoughts of how I can create sound that moves me and hopefully moves others. This has been my life's obsession since I picked up the guitar at age 10 and that is not likely to ever change.\nMy journey to try and become a better musician has been a very interesting and challenging one. To say least, it has been steady and slow burning. I started playing the guitar 18 years ago, and wrote my first actual song around 2000. Being deathly afraid to sing in front of people for years, I didn't play a show of original songs until 2006 at age 22. Since then, I have had some amazingly polar experiences in sharing my music with people. I've played shows that nobody came to, played rooms full of people where nobody listened, more times than I can count. I have also had absolutely magical moments, silencing crowded rooms to where you could hear a pin drop, and been blessed with opportunities to play shows alongside some of my favorite living musicians on the planet earth. A few weeks ago, I was asked to go on my first national tour, and I will be finally sharing my music with people outside of Washington in 17 cities across the country. (see http://kevinlongmusic.com/shows/ for dates) .\nThe last 2+ years of my life have been a very interesting time. A tremendous amount of healing took place within me. A lot of very incremental progress was made as a result of hard work and good choices. I finally got sober after a life-threatening , decade plus long battle with alcohol and drugs (Sep 21, 2009).  Much of this time has been frustrating and lonesome, but has also been the most rewarding time of my life so far. These are the things that the songs on the new album are about.\nI want nothing more than to keep this momentum going and to make another album. I am going to do this, hell or highwater, but it will be much easier if I am able to get some financial support this time around. The last album put a lot of strain on me and my family financially, and my aspirations are significantly higher this time around. I am setting the fundraising goal at $8,000 to cover the cost of tracking and to help compensate some studio musicians. Some of this money may also go to designing album artwork or other similar expenses.\nThe plan:\nI started some initial recording already in february 2012 in a Ballard studio with engineer Kevin Matley, who last year recorded Bryan John Appleby's incredible album \"Fire on the Vine\" which is what led me to work with him.\nDuring the process of the initial recording sessions I came to the realization that I needed to change my approach to how this second album is recorded. The most important thing to me is to capture raw emotion and energy.\nI plan to record as much of this record \"live\" as I can, at least the basic tracks. I realized that compositing 10 guitar takes done to a click track is not how I want this record to be made, that I want to trust myself as player and a writer, and to capture the essence of what happens when I am alone, playing and singing by myself in my bedroom or practice space, or when I am playing to a hushed crowd at a show, or when rocking out in the basement with my brothers.\nSongs I am planning to record (subject to/likely to change)\nLong time coming / Buena Vista / Goodnight Moon / Johannes / Teeth / Envy / Heir to the Throne / Winning Combination / Exactly What to Say / Forget Me (It's so easy) / New Ideas / +others\nI've got some great people on board to help me make this record a realit.  My brothers Curran & Riley long, accomplished string arranger Andrew Joslyn (Macklemore, Passenger String Quartet, Seattle Rock Orchestra), and several other magnificent musician friends.\nSince I have been amazingly blessed with the opportunity to go on my first nation-wide tour this May with Rocky Votolato,  I will be resuming recording of this album in June and hope to be done by August. I will certainly be updating backers of this project with news of our progress, video clips etc.\nThank you sincerely for taking the time to read this!\nYour friend in life and music, -Kevin Long", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Waiting on a CD to arrive in the mail?", "update_content": "Hello Kickstarter friends:\nIf you are waiting on a CD (you completed the email survey and supplied me with your shipping address), they are coming soon.

We asked them to create a 60-second trailer based on one of our songs from the album. We will be releasing these as we near our fundraising deadline. \nHere's the first one, by Tyler Kalberg, for \"Solstice Day Parade\"\nhttp://youtu.be/JX1ysN1GjGI\nJace Krause and Jake Rohr have been playing music together for nearly a decade. After their last band fizzled out, they set out to create the music they wanted to hear. They wanted to explore a new sonic landscape, and the result was Fort Union.\nIn September of 2010, they started recording in Krause's garage in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. Soon after, they enlisted the help of friend Ryan Lynch, a guitar maverick living in California. The result was a dreamy lo-fi folk rock sound. Then, the guys brought in even more friends to help round out a few extra drumming and singing parts. \nKrause and Rohr are no recording engineers, but they were pleased with the sounds they were getting, given their limitations of just a few microphones and a laptop. Recording at home is free, but making those home recordings shine is not. Krause hired Gary Mula to mix and shape the songs at the Bani-Love in Columbia City Theater. The band was able to pay Mula with money saved up from shows, in addition to tips and wages Krause earned while delivering pizzas.\nNow, the band is entering the final phase: printing. This is where we need the most help. We want to raise $2800 -- this will cover all of our printing costs, and it will also help defray some of the costs associated mixing and mastering. \nWhy vinyl? Isn't that an outdated medium?\nDepends on how you see it. We personally feel that the quality of music appreciation has gone down with the increasing digitization of the music industry. We want to give our fans something concrete and real that they can hold in their hands and appreciate with multiple senses. Plus, the music is physically embedded in the record! That is really cool! Digital files can get lost when your hard drive crashes. CDs end up on the floor of your car. But records are something that are still appreciated by music fans. And we feel a large proportion of our fanbase wants to get their music in this format.\nIn conjunction with our Kickstarter release, we are unveiling 4 trailers for our album, made by local filmmakers. We asked these filmmakers to make a 60-second trailer for our music, featuring instrumental sections of our songs. We will be featuring these trailers throughout the duration of the project. \nAnd remember, Kickstarter has an all or nothing model so we won't get any money if we don't reach our goal. Please help us get there.\nThank you so much for donating!\nSincerely,\nFort Union", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "We Did It!", "update_content": "Well, it's official.

When we finally got to sit down and listen and isolated the tracks, we realized that the bass parts had bled into the vocal mic as well as the drum mics!!! That doesn't make for very easy mixing- so we took that as a sign to change somethings around and thanks to Jason (who has some friends in high places) we headed downtown the following wednesday to Studio Nels and got vocals, guitar, and drums (Todd Gray) for 13 tracks! Such a wonderful experience.
