On Grim Peak, players are not tasked just with survival, but also satisfying the whims of the Peak's masters. Players will also find throughout the game that some monsters interact together, often worsening the situation. Adapting to these new threats will be key to your victory.\n\nTo defeat the peak, you will have to work together and plan the usage of your abilities wisely. Combinations set up between players can solve many problems on one turn. At other times, you may simply try to delay, distract or unsummon monsters to prevent yourselves being overwhelmed.\n\nGrim Peak will have artwork by Joseph Knight. Below are a werewolf enemy and a Chieftain player character by Joseph that will feature in the game. Some of the money raised in the Kickstarter will be to commission Joe for the rest of the game artwork (with the rest being to fund the first factory production run). You can find more of his artwork here.\nThose interested can take a look at a quick rules overview here. More detailed information on characters and monsters can be found lower on this page.\nThe miniatures included in the genteel and deluxe backer options are from Black Sun Miniatures. We have used them in testing and have found them very good. Some of them come with different weapons options too! Miniatures need some assembly (usually just 1 or 2 parts). Players getting the standard set will have 6 small wooden figures (kind of like meeples, but to our design) in different colours for the characters.\nCustom hand-painted wooden boards are available in the deluxe tier. They are painted in acryllic, which is water resistant and hard wearing, then painted with a few layers of gloss varnish for a slight shine finish and to further protect the board.\n\nBoards will come in base several designs and you will be able to choose the style and colouring. A small message or detail can be included on the board too if you wish. The board artist, Vikt\u00f3ria Murtinova, will work with you via E-mail to make sure any customizations you want will be suitable to paint onto the board.\nCharacters have a variety of powers. Special abilities can only be used once per game. Planning when and how to use player special abilities is often one of the keys to victory. A well planned combo can see several threats removed in one turn!\nYou can take a look at character powers below. The final game character cards will be redesigned around Joseph's artwork.\n The game includes 40 monsters. Many of these monsters have different effects, can interact and this can drastically change gameplay. A unique aspect of the game is that most monsters will continue in the direction they were initially summoned in. This means players can see where monsters will be in a few turns, and often work out strategies a few turns in advance and try to plan when best to use their powers. Sometimes you can delay or destroy many more monsters with epic combos planned over several turns.\nMonsters come in many types. Fast flying monsters provide threats that must be dealt with quickly. Player Hunting enemies will relentlessly hunt the closest player. Demons can, if left alone too long, end the game in a single turn. While dealing with these major threats, other minor monsters will be roaming the board, possibly summoning allies or being redirected by their kin.\nThe large number of different monsters mean that during most of the game, there are numerous interesting threats to deal with. It also offers good replayability, as each game plays very differently depending on the order the monsters appear (and characters selected).\nGames can be collected at the UK Games Expo 2019 if you don't want to pay shipping. If you wish to collect your game, please select 'Antarctica' as your shipping option.\nOtherwise, shipping will be done by Royal Mail and we will try to ship all games within the first week of receiving them from the manufacturer. Shipping times vary, but should be approx. 3 days UK shipping, 5 days European shipping and 7 days to the rest of the world.\nGames will be sent from the UK, so no customs charges will apply within the EU. Other countries may charge customs / taxes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have had quotes and time estimates for production and shipping of the game, the miniatures and artwork (including the artwork for customized game boards). I have worked with all involved artists (Joseph Knight on artwork and Vikt\u00f3ria Murtinova on custom boards) before and with Black Sun Miniatures. All parties have delivered in a timely fashion (in fact, they have been very good to work with!).\n\nI have consulted with some people with experience self-publishing in the board game industry and have been advised about some of the hidden pitfalls that await the unwary self-publisher.\n\nAlso, there is quite a long date for the arrival of your game, just in case there are any delays.

Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThis Kickstarter adds four new World Packs to The City of Kings allowing you to pick and choose the new content you want to have:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma  \nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nSide Quest Pack 1\nHero Pack\nEach Character Pack contains 2 new playable heroes with advanced skills, a new 3 story adventure, and more terrifying creature abilities creating new puzzles for you to solve. \nThe Side Quest Pack tells you more about the world by adding 50 new side quests to The City of Kings, introducing the new \"Get To\" and \"Build\" quests to the game.\nThe Hero Pack adds 6 miniatures to The City of Kings, so you can replace your hero standees with beautifully sculpted miniatures.\nFor those of you who already own The City of Kings, an Upgrade Pack will be sent to anyone selecting the \"Create your own\" or \"World Packs\" tiers containing free copies of the updated Rulebook and Quick Reference booklets.\nDigital versions will also be made available shortly after the campaign for anyone who would like them.\nIn addition to new content for The City of Kings, during this Kickstarter we are offering our new standalone game, Vadoran Gardens for the very first time!

By earning XP! For every \u00a320,000 we raise, you will earn 2xp, and every day we will be releasing daily quests via updates, Facebook, Twitter and on our website where you can help earn bonus XP!\nThe City of Kings can be played in 2 ways, by choosing either a story or a scenario.\n7 Stories  \nThere are 7 stories to play, each story has its own objectives and continues a narrative introducing you to the world and characters. Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\n12 Scenarios\nThe 12 scenarios provide quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go  \nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.  \nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\n Creatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love. \nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\n  You can read the full review by Geek & Sundry here.\n You can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\n You can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\nYou can read the full player report by Robert Yates here.\n The following full customisation options can be added to any reward, simply increase your pledge amount by the amount shown below.

Old V\u2019Sheel, the High Priestess of the Vadoran Gardens is retiring, and maybe one of you will take her place. Go out into the gardens, study her lessons in Life, Nature, and Wisdom to prove yourself worthy of such an honor.  \nVadoran Gardens is a standalone competitive card-drafting and tile-laying card game, set in The City of Kings universe. Players take it in turns to play cards while trying to connect similar tasks such as feeding animals, watering flowers and cleaning relics, as they try and complete the lessons set by Old V'Sheel.\nVadoran Gardens is played over 10 rounds, in each round you will be set a lesson restricting the cards you can play.  \nOn your turn, you will pick up the card you selected on your previous turn (or during setup if it\u2019s the first round), and then place 1 card in front of you.\nThe first card you play will be placed on the table, every following card you play must overlap the last column of the previously played card. The card does not have to overlap all 3 squares in the last column, but it does have to overlap at least 1, giving you 5 options each turn.\nAs you explore the gardens, you will want to connect areas of grass, soil and water to score points and avoid the sand. You will need to connect animals, flowers and statues in specific ways to complete achievements while trying to return lost animals, pendants and tools to their homes.\nOnce you have played a card, you will then need to place your Player Token on the card you want for the next round, this decides both the card you get and turn order for the next round. You will always know what cards you have available for this round and the next, along with what restrictions will be in place, so forward planning is essential.\nYou can download a draft version of the rulebook here.\nIf you would like to get both Vadoran Gardens and The City of Kings then please select the appropriate tier for The City of Kings content you would like, and increase your pledge by \u00a317. You can do this when you select your reward by manually increasing the amount shown by \u00a317, and at the end of the Kickstarter we will ask you to confirm the \u00a317 is for Vadoran Gardens. \nShipping for Vadoran Gardens will be free, when added to any The City of Kings or World Pack rewards.\n You can read the full article by Creaking Shelves here.\n All shipping is EU, America, Canada and Australia friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Brazil due to their customs regulations. If this should change I will let you know.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva works full time creating the artwork for The City of Kings Universe and creates nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nHeriberto Valle Mart\u00ednez is our primary sculptor and created the amazing miniatures available during this campaign.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\n We would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings, Vadoran Gardens or just gaming in general!

We will be running more playtests as the Kickstarter campaign runs, but we expect any further changes to be minor. \n\nArtwork\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few tokens and bits of graphic design to finish off for the expansions but otherwise we are good to go. \n\nMiniatures\nThis will be the first time we include miniatures in our campaign, but we have chosen to work with the same company that is used by CMON to produce their miniatures and are confident the end result will be amazing.\n\nEditing\nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now is copy editing and proof readings of all the new content and rule updates to make sure we catch as many spelling mistakes as possible. We\u2019ve allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nManufacturing\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in the first print and we are confident in their ability to manufacture a great second print.\n\nShipping\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during the first campaign, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other. There were a few minor issues which we have learned from and are confident our fulfilment partners will deliver on time.\n\nFinal words\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The City of Kings was an incredible journey, we all learned a lot and I hope you will join me in this next stage of the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Follow along with updates and take part in The School of Games!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["611 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Create your own", "descp": "If you would like a custom selection of World Packs, addons and Vadoran Gardens then this tier is for you!\nUse the \u201cFull Customisation\u201d menu on the campaign page to choose your items, add up the total and pledge here.\nShipping will be added after the campaign based on the shipping prices shown at the bottom of the page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["227 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a317 or more", "title": "Vadoran Gardens", "descp": "One copy of Vadoran Gardens.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Vadoran Gardens", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["168 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a367.50\nAll the new content for The City of Kings, for those who already own the game!\nINCLUDES:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\nSecond print upgrade pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,374 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "The City of Kings", "descp": "MSRP: \u00a375\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["182 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3155\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter and all Deluxe upgrades!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["175 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3109 or more", "title": "The City of Kings & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3142.50\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3145 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3222.50\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter, all Deluxe upgrades and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,301 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Chapter 2 complete", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nIt is time for us to wrap up the campaign, by now everyone should have received their games and I want to thank you all for the incredible journey that has been Ancient Allies and Vadoran Gardens.

All other players are the crew of the doomed mining starship Valley Forge. Lifeform can also be played alone with the solo expansion Dragon's Domain where the player fights to survive against the game itself. \nRacing against the self-destruct timer, the crew must search their labyrinthine ship for weapons and supplies to load onboard the escape shuttle, whilst the alien lifeform ruthlessly tears the crew apart one by one...\nNo marines. No power armour. Just terror...\nIt kills to live...\nLifeform is a standalone, diceless game that tells the tale of twelve commercial astronauts working on a battered mining starship, far away in space and time, who encounter an awesome galactic horror.\nWith an innovative self-destruct timer, unique hidden movement rules, and alternate playable endings, Lifeform delivers a tense, suspenseful adventure every game.\nIt lives to kill...\nIn the vast, forbidden seas of space\u2026 terror stirs.\nA Right Royal Playthrough!!\nWe are extremely pleased and honoured to welcome boardgaming royalty on board.

Because Alien is in a three-way tie for 2nd favorite movie, because asymmetrical hidden movement is totally my jam, and because Mark designed the only true board game adaptation of one of the other movies in that three-way tie.

Thanks to the thousands of generous backers who successfully funded Gloom of Kilforth originally, as well as its reprint and expansions, along with our second game 1066, Tears to Many Mothers, we have learnt a huge amount about the development process, design and file submission for the printers, and we will be working again in close partnership with our factories and fulfilment agencies to ensure the smoothest delivery of your games.\n\nProduction of the cards and game boxes will take a couple of months. \nThis will only be possible once all the art for the game has been turned in, but we have ALL of the art for this project completed ahead of time! This means we only have to finalise the graphic design and manufacturing files which should only take a couple of months.

For the last few years, I've decided to set myself a new challenge each Summer, and last years challenge, after realising my passion for Harry Potter and Monopoly could be combined, I found myself attempting to create a Harry Potter inspired board game similar to Monopoly. I realised as I was approaching the end of Summer that this was no longer a Summer project. This was much longer, as I wanted to strive for quality when it came down to the manufacturing of the board game, I wanted to be sure it looked and felt like a genuine board game that you may find on the market. With that in mind, I began to redraw all of my initial designs in far superior quality.\nNow, I'm not going to lie, at the start of the project, I was expecting it to be way easier than what it has been, myself currently being a university student, meant I was putting some of my student loan and some money from part time work over the holidays into this ambition. Initially, I thought I'd just make one copy for myself, but since then, other people have been showing interest from around the world, and I found myself with the real potential to make this big.\nI am now looking to raise sufficient funds that will enable me to bulk buy the products needed to assemble the board game.Board game items:\nBoard\nProperty Cards\nSpells Cards\nPotions Cards\nMoney\nHouses\nHotels\nCounters\nBox\nInstructions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are obviously going to be some risks associated with this project, firstly will be obtaining the rights and analysing what rights are needed in order to use the Harry Potter inspired places and the Monopoly inspired layout.

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD Homicide detectives that will do whatever it takes to solve the case, but one player will take on the role of The Chisel whose goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn. \nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a mystery and crime solving game unlike any other. \n    4 unique sculpts are included in the game. Prototype sculpts shown here.\n  Detective: City of Angels is a VRG Select title. This means that it will not be sold through normal retail channels. It will be available at the best price to backers of this Kickstarter campaign, for preorder/late pledge at a higher price through our pledge manager, and eventually through our website, at conventions, and/or through other direct partners. For more information see Update #9 here.\n          Each case is beautifully illustrated by renowned artist Vincent Dutrait, creating a rich and gritty noire atmosphere.\n  Detectives will explore every shadowy corner of the City of Angels, rendered in gorgeous and authentic detail on a massive 33x21 inch game board. The game board is based on an amazing public domain map created in 1932 by K. M. Leuschner, which Vincent has lovingly updated and adorned with his own touches.\n     Click here to download the rulebook for Detective: City of Angels. This is the rulebook that was sent to reviewers and uses prototype components and art. It is NOT the final version! \nWith 9 cases included and the option to play competitively, cooperatively (see below), or even solo (see below), Detective: City of Angels will provide hours of mystery-solving gaming.\nPlus, go all in for the Hardboiled Pledge level and get Bullets Over Hollywood, the first expansion which includes four additional cases, putting even more noir goodness on your table!\n      While we highly recommend the game be played competitively, the versatility of Detective: City of Angels is such that it can also be played cooperatively against \"The Chisel\" or Cooperatively/Solitaire with no Chisel player. \nPlaying cooperatively against the Chisel removes the \"corruption\" elements and the detectives become a team working together to solve the case. There is still competition with the Chisel though. \nAlternatively, this KS will come with a 64-page Solo/Cooperative case book and case grid cards that allows the game to be played without a Chisel player as the book will simulate the play of the Chisel. In particular, playing the game solo is a great way to prepare for your first game as The Chisel! \nDesign of solitaire case cards and solitaire paragraph book is not final.\nIn each of these modes of play the ARC system is in the spotlight and the competitive elements of the game, like scratch and bribe actions, are removed. The focus is primarily on solving the case and immersing yourself in the role of a detective.\nAn important question with scenario-based mystery solving games such as Detective: City of Angels is: how replayable is the game? \nWhile detective players will not be able to experience a given case again as a detective (since they'll already know the solution), anyone can play the same case multiple times as The Chisel. In fact, it even benefits The Chisel to have played a case more than once! The Chisel will understand how the mystery works and have a better grasp of how to mislead and delay the detectives during their investigation. \nIn fact, a case can unfold VERY differently depending on how the detectives pursue their investigations, always forcing The Chisel to stay on his or her toes even if it's a case he or she's already played.\nDetective player boards\n  Rahdo Runs Through\nThe below video has Richard \"Rahdo\" Ham's final thoughts on the game.

We endeavor to ship as inexpensively as possible while still being able to cover costs and get the games safely to you!\n  From Vincent Dutrait, the amazingly talented artist behind Detective: City of Angels: \n\"Detective is an epic journey! Because of the huge narrative aspect of the game, it's a real challenge to bring to life all the iconic characters and well-know places. I've never worked on a game with a \"film noir\" atmosphere before, and I did a lot a research to find precise documents and great references, all in support of helping the players immerse themselves deeply in the game and the city of Los Angeles in the 1940s. Another tricky challenge was to get the right tone and to capture the right mood! Working with Evan and the Van Ryder team has been incredibly rewarding as we worked so hard to share and convey our points of view with the players. We wanted to give them the chance to live out the stories and everyday life of Detectives & Mob characters.\"\n\"Technically, I really enjoy to working on 'fake' illustrations, imitating textures, objects, colors and lights of past periods, which is a unique opportunity. I also enjoy bringing the characters to life, giving them authenticity, truth and credibility! Furthermore, Detective is a fascinating project because of all the different component sizes and elements: I have to develop precise and accurate solutions for building the box, cards, boards and tokens in order to get the most cohesive ensemble!\"\nMiniatures\nWe would like to thank James Van Schaik for his incredible sculpting work on the miniature in Detective. Thanks to him, each player will have his or her own miniature to move around the City of Angels!\nJames has worked on many top grossing kickstarters including Gloomhaven, Defense Grid, Myth, Mercs, Relic Knights, Dreadball, and many more. As a sculptor, he has worked with Ral Partha, WizKids, Wyrd Miniatures, Games Workshop, Mantic, Megacon Games, Ninja Division, Soda Pop Miniatures, Pulp City, Battlefront, Gale Force 9, Dust Tactics, Reaper, Gloomhaven, and Lynnvander.\nSee the many projects he has developed here on Artstation.

They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go\nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.\nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\nCreatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love.\nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\nWe have spent the last 2 years building a world for The City of Kings, designing characters, writing stories and detailing events spanning 13,755 years. We wanted to go further than a theme and design a world which you can immerse yourself in for years to come.\nAs you play through the game you will experience the Cloud Keep War and learn about the key characters who came together for one last fight, as they tried to stop Vesh from claiming the entire world.\nYou will encounter survivors in need of assistance and they will offer you side quests further describing the world you are in.  \nThanks to unlocked stretch goals we can now add even more lore to the game by including back stories for each of the characters and all of the enemy factions.\nOver time we plan to release more stories, written materials, and much more as we continue to share this world with you.\nThe City of Kings was designed for both video and board gamers. The inspiration for the game comes from a life time of video gaming and many of the mechanics were inspired by MMORPGs. Combat is based around the holy trinity, character progression uses skill trees and creatures are procedurally generated.\n Retailers can find out more info about our retail options here.\nYou can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\nYou can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\n \"It is proper cracking.\" - Lucy\n\"I can't stress enough just how great it feels to play a game in which players become a close team through trying to beat the scenarios Frank has painstakingly worked on without enforcing co-operation... it's something else.\" - Jamie\n\"It reminds me of Mage Knight and Descent\" - Nick\n\"it\u2019s one of the funnest games I\u2019ve played. Especially as a video game player it feels like World of Warcraft as a board game. Heaps of praise for it overall. It\u2019s amazing how polished it is.\" - Ryan\nWe asked our playtesters what their favourite parts of The City of Kings were and put together a Top Ten Features list based on their feedback.\nYou can customise your pledge by clicking the 'manage pledge' option at the top right of the campaign page (it's green) and then manually edit your pledge amount, increasing it by the amount your customisations cost.\nAll customisations will be available after the campaign has ended but at higher costs and will incur extra shipping. You can save up to 50% on customisations by getting them during the campaign.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\n You can download the images here.\nWe have spent months planning our fulfilment process, arranging bulk shipping to warehouses around the world including the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. All with the goal of offering you the cheapest and most efficient shipping possible. But please keep in mind, this is a big game with over 1,000 components and is estimated to weigh between 5 and 6 kg (11 - 13lbs) so it is not cheap to ship, yet we are confident the level of replayability in the box will give you endless hours of gaming and offers great value for money.\nBackers may add multiple copies of the game to their pledge but must include the additional shipping fee for each additional copy, as listed above.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva is the amazing artist who spent the last 18 months creating all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\nWe would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings or just gaming in general! \nHere's where you can find us:\nTwitter | Facebook | YouTube | Instagram | Board Game Geek\nOur official website: www.thecityofkings.com\nThe long journey\nFrank first started posting about designing The City of Kings on Board Game Geek back in 2015, you can read the work in progress posts here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a large, ambitious project, but I am on Kickstarter today because I believe The City of Kings is ready and that I can live up to all the promises I am making on this page to deliver a great game.\n\nWhilst this is my first Kickstarter, I have backed over 150 other projects, spent months studying and preparing for manufacturing, shipping and fulfilment and have worked on many high pressure projects in the last 10 years.\n\nDesign\n\nThe game has been designed and tested by countless people spending hundreds of hours testing the game. There are still a few scenarios to finish off and the stories may be enhanced if we hit our stretch goals but I have allowed time for this in our plan and have no doubts the game will be finished on time.\n\nArtwork\n\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few icons and bits of graphic design to finish off prior to print but otherwise we are good to go. We have allowed time in our plan for any artwork needed for stretch goals to be produced without impacting the delivery dates.\n\nManufacturing\n\nWe have been working with manufacturers and getting quotes for nearly a year, we are confident we can deliver a high quality game for the prices stated and will be looking at blank samples and pre-production prints before starting mass production.\n\nOur prototype has had much praise for the quality of the components and we are convinced we will get an even better response with our end product.\n\nShipping\n\nWe have arranged shipping, importing and fulfilment around the world working with multiple companies who have been tried and tested by countless Kickstarters. There are always unknowns but I am confident we are as prepared as any Kickstarter can be.\n\nFinal words\n\nBeing this is my first campaign, I want to assure you I have picked over every detail, from rigorous playtesting of the game to having a full understanding of shipping logistics. Everything that can be done to make this successful and deliver on time has been done.\n\nThis is my passion, and I hope, the first steps to my future.

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing. It will be wonderful.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, three years ago, and its second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim in February.

They wrote 100% of this expansion, and the cards they came up with are hilarious and unexpected in all the ways Monikers cards should be hilarious and unexpected. It's sort of uncanny.\nPart of the idea behind Monikers has always been to take a game that has existed basically forever, and to make it feel like you and your friends just came up with the idea that night. It's really hard to get that tone right, but Paul and Philippa and Matt and Quinns completely nailed it. I mean AHHHHHH LOOK AT THESE CARDS THEY'RE SO GOOD\nAnd if you've never heard of Monikers, the rules are really simple: get your friends to guess the name on a card. The twist is that you play over three rounds, and each time, you have to give clues in different ways. So in the 1st round, you can say or do anything. In the 2nd, you can only use one word. And in the 3rd, you can only do charades.\nThe same cards are used in each round, so by the end of the game you've made up a bunch of silly jokes together.\n         The Shut Up & Sit Down Nonsense Box comes with 112 hilarious new cards. It's only $10. Which is legitimately a steal and probably dumb of us to keep doing. And like always, you can combine it with all your other Monikers sets, or just play it as a standalone party game.\nYou'll be cry-laughing they're so good.\nAnd like usual, we're working with some amazingly talented artists to illustrate some of the cards. Artists like:\nGemma Correll\nMarina Esmeraldo\nThomas Howes\nLaurina Paperina\nOh and ALSO as a thank you, for every pledge we're including a bonus pack of 12 Hopelessly Stupid Fourth Rounds For Monikers for free. Stuff like getting behind a couch and doing hand puppets. Or doing charades in pairs, but one person has to pose the other person. They're hilarious and weird and perfect for when you're having such a good time that you want a game to go on for just a little bit longer.\n  Basically, you can get any configuration of Monikers stuff you want. That *should* cover everything\u2014but if you're looking for multiple copies or whatever, just shoot us a message and we'll sort that out for you!\nAnd for international backers: shipping includes customs.\n\nOh and if you've gotten this far, there is a 90% chance you are wondering about a MONIKERS STORAGE BOX. We're planning a Kickstarter for that early this summer! It's going to be filled with some really weird stuff and, we assure you, quite capable of holding every Monikers card ever made. \nWe promise we're making it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've shipped tens of thousands of copies of Monikers to backers all over the world.

We all have a masters degree in engineering and therefore, are very meticulous when it comes to arranging little details that make manufacturing, fulfillment and shipping possible, affordable and sensible.\n\nWe have done the following to mitigate risks and make your support a 'safe bet', that you will surely receive your reward:\n- Three people can specialize and concentrate on separate fields: Gergely Kruppa does design and art direction, Andr\u00e1s Drozdy handles testing and manufacturing, while Gergely Gombos arranges business, shipping and marketing details.\n- We own a BV (LLC) in the Netherlands so that we can conduct business easily. This helps us with tax and customs issues as well. For example to make sure you are not charged additional VAT when receiving your reward.\n- We have a very detailed budget with multiple scenarios, so the project's funding goal is sensible and it is definitely possible to accomplish the project from this amount of funding.\n- We have already chosen a manufacturing partner from many great offers, and have already arranged most manufacturing details, including stretch goals.\n\nOur previous game, Saltlands has already been fulfilled for several backers, and the rest of the copies are already on their way to them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Antler Games\n5 created \u00b7 15 backed\nAntler Games is an indie board game publisher from Hungary.

As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. \nHere's a look at everything included in a base pledge:\nAnd all the Optional Buys you can get:\nClick to learn more about Dynasty Invasion, Playmat Board, Art Book, and Metal Coins.\nCreated by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage, with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey.\nChoose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle.\nEach of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies.\nKoi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable.\nKoi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nDragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next.\nDragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nBonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally.\nBonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nLotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray.\nLotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nTurtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces.\nTurtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nPlayed over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided.\nThe Political Mandates.\nDuring the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side.\nWhen players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits.\nKomainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite.\nOni of Skulls and Oni of Souls.\nOni of Hate and Oni of Blood.\nRiver Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure).\nThe miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic.\nAlliances are formed. Alliances are broken.\nAt the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances.\nDo not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale.\nThe Kami await the worshippers.\nWhen players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play.\nEach Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins. Sometimes losing a battle may win you the war.\nWhen Winter comes, all politics and fighting are over. Players gain extra points for winning battles in as many different provinces as possible, and also for certain upgrades they may have gathered. As the snow falls, the new Emperor will ascend! \nGame Components:\n58 Highly Detailed Miniatures, including 10 warriors for each clan and 8 huge monsters.\n40 Counter Bases\n137 Tokens\n5 Clan Screens\n5 Political Sheets\n53 Cards\n6-fold Gameboard\n1 Rulebook\nYou can take a look at the Work In Progress Rulebook HERE.\nFor $100 the Daimyo Pledge gets you a Rising Sun core game as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Phoenix monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock!\nThe Phoenix comes with its amazing miniature and Season card. \nThe Phoenix has otherworldly powers of resurrection. Whenever it is killed, it automatically reappears in the same province and raises the honor of its clan.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only. \nThe honorable CMON crew gathered to play a session of Rising Sun.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

You and up to five friends are cave explorers who have become trapped deep underground. You must quickly explore a tile-based cave system, utilise your character's specialist skills and carefully manage your actions to find the way out before your flashlights die and you're lost in the darkness forever.  \nYou'll need to work together to overcome deadly subterranean hazards - stick together for safety, or split up to cover more ground. One wrong step could knock you unconscious and your friends will need to stage a rescue. Light and hope are scarce. And worst of all, you don't think you're alone down here...\n Looking for the Stretch Goal announcements?\n  Let's descend...\n        Check out the how to play video below (courtesy of Toucan Play that Game), which outlines the game setting, objectives, gameplay and some strategies for attempting your escape!\nSub Terra is a team-based push-your-luck game. Together, you'll decide what risks are worth taking and when. The caves is a dangerous place - no matter how well you plan, things WILL go wrong, and your survival depends on how well you react to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE: Escape the cave before you run out of time.\n1) CAVERS: Everyone picks a caver, and gives that caver 3 health points. There are eight characters to choose from in Sub Terra - each has unique abilities that change how they play\n2) TILES: Cavers begin the game on the START TILE. You're all trying to get to the EXIT TILE, which is near the bottom of the TILE STACK.\n3) ACTIONS: Every round, each caver has two action points to spend (and can risk a health point for a third) \nThe basic actions are: \nReveal (Flip the top tile of the stack and place it a gap next to your current location) \nMove (Move to an adjacent connected tile) \nExplore (Reveal a tile, then immediately Move onto it. Faster, but riskier!) \nHeal (You or another caver on your tile regains one health point)\nRun (Move three times) \nTogether, you must place tiles as quickly as possible while not getting too spread out. Why not run off by yourself? Well\u2026\n4) HAZARDS: At the end of each round, resolve the top card of the HAZARD DECK. Each affects a certain type of tile: cavers on those tiles will lose health, and the tile may become harder to traverse. For example, GAS hurts cavers on GAS TILES a medium amount, whereas a FLOOD hurts those on WATER TILES only a little but makes the tile twice as costly to enter in the future.\n If you lose all your health points, you fall UNCONSCIOUS - you're unable to take further actions until another caver reaches your tile and HEALS you. If a friend is nearby, this won't take long. If you've strayed too far down a side passage, it might take some time to reach you. Why does that matter? Well\u2026\n5) RUNNING OUT OF TIME: When the hazard deck runs out of cards, your flashlights are nearly out of power: instead of resolving a card, each caver has a chance of getting lost in the darkness forever. Turns are precious - time spent rescuing fallen cavers or backtracking through difficult passages is time you'd rather spend uncovering more tiles and getting closer to the exit.\n6) HORRORS: You're not alone down here. Some hazard cards can spawn...things...which will relentlessly hunt you down. If they catch you, you'll immediately lose all health points and fall unconscious. If you try to fight them, you will die. RUN.\n7) MORE STUFF: Sub Terra also contains: cave-ins, squeezes, ledges, slides, ropes, rough treacherous terrain, tremors, dynamite, cave diving, \"geology\" and soul-crushing despair \n(soul-crushing despair supplied separately)\nEager to play Sub Terra?

The team is poised!\n\nMANUFACTURE:\nWe're partnering with Whatz games from Shanghai, the team behind Iello's manufacturing, they're fast, reliable and produce high quality games. We're confident they'll produce a box that helps us deliver the Sub Terra experience. I will personally review the blank samples, the pre-production samples, and if the budget permits, visit the factory itself to inspect the production run.\n\nFREIGHT & SHIPPING:\nWe're working with a specially honed team of fulfillment and shipping experts, in Hong Kong, Shanghai, the UK and elsewhere to ensure that we can offer leading backer shipping rates as well as deliver you your games speedily and in good condition. We're aiming to get a chunk of games once manufactured to the UK Games Expo in June, so we're aiming to get shipping on the go before then. November is our worst case scenario. We may obviously sell copies of the game at the UKGE before some backers get their copy elsewhere in the world. We're hoping that this doesn't happen but we want to be upfront, we can't afford as a small publisher to not take that opportunity.\n\nHORRORS:\nThere's a small chance the darkness will close in on the ITB team and the horrors will catch up to us. If this happens, we may not be able to ship your game, as we'll probably have been eaten.

Think of it as Two Rooms and a Boom on HARD MODE!\nWe wanted to make our first expansion special so we focused on four things that we thought would make the game incredibly fun for old fans and new fans alike:\nCharacter cards inspired by the master of horror, H.P. Lovecraft (we're talking the Cthulhu Mythos, here).\nEnhanced tension and play for seasoned Boomers (peeps that enjoy playing Two Rooms).\nIntroduces and encourages color sharing when playing with fewer than 11 players.\nSpecifically designed to make Two Rooms just as fun with few players. Only have 6 players? NO PROBLEM!\nNote: Necroboomicon requires Two Rooms and a Boom. This is NOT a standalone expansion.\nThe concept is super simple\u2014add Necroboomicon to your base game of Two Rooms and a Boom to create an evening of a Lovecraftian Horror Mystery. Suspicion and tension abounds. \n\"Just nine cards?\" you say? Yes. The most terrifying nine plastic character cards ever. If you're familiar with Two Rooms and a Boom, you're aware that just one character can change the entire game. Multiply that by nine, and your mortal mind will begin to comprehend the dire corruption these characters will inflict upon your feeble friends.\nThe player standing next to you, that player you think you can trust, could actually be an Elder God (like, say, Yog-Sothoth) with the power to end the game instantly. Everyone is free to share information with the players in the same room, but sharing too much just may complete the summoning ritual for YOUR DOOM!\nOver 8 cards filled with terror, madness, and nightmares. Also they are 100% plastic.\n  If you are unfamiliar with the base game of Two Rooms and a Boom, or you don't trust us when we tell you the game is fun, here are some words some reviewers' mouths said. Click the images for links to the full reviews and/or videos.\n                         $5 Gets you the foil pack expansion with 9 high quality plastic character cards. Just remember: this game requires a copy of Two Rooms and a Boom.\n$25 Gets you the expansion and a copy of the base game Two Rooms and a Boom. Now that's a deal! Why? Because Two Rooms normally costs $25. Now you're getting a copy AND we are throwing in the Necroboomicon expansion for FREE. Shipping rates still apply.\n  $50 Gets you the expansion and a signed copy of the base game Two Rooms and a Boom. Alan and Sean will write you a personal message on your game. This is limited to just 100 copies to celebrate Kickstarter's Make/100 thingy that they're doing. What will the personal message be? Who knows?!?\nWe don't have any! \"What the poop?!?\" Yeah, sorry about that. The truth is that stretch goals are a great way to entice people into sharing this project with others. But this expansion pack is DONE as is. We're talking about a foil pack with 9 beautiful plastic cards. Yeah, plastic... just like in the original game. That means these babies are damage resistant and waterproof. That means that you can play in the pool! This also means that if one room is the shallow end, and the other is the deep end, the deep end gets some exercise while playing. Pledge in the name of fitness! \nLegal Note: Tuesday Knight Games is not responsible for drowning or injuries received during play of our games.\nStill bummed about no stretch goals? Sorry, but we may have a mysterious trick up our sleeves. As a \"please share this project with your friends even though we don't have stretch goals\" apology, we are also including a mystery bonus! Yeah! I'm not just making this up. You'll get your expansion and say, \"Where is this mystery?\" Then after fiddling around with your expansion pack for awhile, you realize...\"WHOA! This is a most excellent mystery! This was way better than stretch goals.\"\nTuesday Knight Games will always do our best to keep you informed of the progress of your games. We will do this in several ways: \nOfficial updates here on Kickstarter. These updates will always be on a Tuesday and at least once a month. \n\"Mini\" updates on the comment section here on Kickstarter. Ask a question in the comment section, and Sean or I will do our best to answer it in a timely fashion. \nPrivate messages (PM) - Send me a message here through Kickstarter and I'll answer! \nTuesday Knight Podcast - We do a weekly podcast in which we provide updates, insights into running a small independent game company, and other games we've been playing. \nNewsday Night Newsletter - Free games and updates straight to your inbox? Yep. With every issue we send a free game along with a big Tuesday Knight Games announcement.\nFacebook - Have you heard of Facebook? We have.\nTwitter - If you think we talk too much, Twitter is perfect for you.\nBoard Game Geek - Play Two Rooms and a Boom online!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTuesday Knight Games is a company run by two friends. Yeah, they get on one another's nerves due to trying to run a company, but they've learned a few things about publishing a game.\n\nDelays are always a big challenge. But Sean McCoy and I (Alan Gerding) have learned from our previous mistakes publishing Two Rooms and a Boom. This time, we already have the art and design finished. We even had \"pre-release\" copies made to send to reviewers. This means we can GUARANTEE that you will get your copies of #Necroboomicon on schedule (pending some unforeseen tragedy...like pirates, murder, or Elder God damnation). So the biggest challenge for us will always be proving that we've learned our lessons by ensuring that our backers get their high quality games on schedule.\n\nThere is a chance that not all players will enjoy Two Rooms and a Boom, or especially this expansion of Necroboomicon. People are like snowflakes, each totally different. This is one of the reasons that we put so many dang character cards in the base game. Character cards greatly change the way the game is played, making Two Rooms more of a game system than a game itself. So while there is no character that every snowflake will love, there is a character for every snowflake to love. Necroboomicon is for those hardcore snowflakes that don't mind losing in an instant.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Necroboomicon Foil Pack", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,045 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Necroboomicon AND Two Rooms and a Boom", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack) + a copy of the base game, Two Rooms and a Boom!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,626 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Make/100 Signed Copies!", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack) + a copy of the base game, Two Rooms and a Boom, SIGNED BY THE CREATORS with a \"personal message.\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["89 backers", "Limited (11 left of 100)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "More Two Rooms coming soon -- and a new Mothership module on kickstarter!", "update_content": "More Two Rooms and a Boom?\nIf you've been at convention or two this year you might have seen Alan breaking out something pretty new for Two Rooms and a Boom.

I'm Jonathan W. Gilmour! Game designer type person!\nHow are you today? I've designed (or co-designed in some cases) a few games (Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, Vault Wars, Heroes and Tricks, Pocket Dungeon, Wasteland Express Delivery Service)! \nLet's make a limited edition board game!\nI am really inspired by the Make/100 idea! So I thought it would be cool to make 100 hand made games! What game is it going to be? I don't know yet! But you will get to help decide! I'll send out polls about theme, concepts, and things like that! Your feedback will help shape the game. You'll have access to the playtesting files, and the entire process. I'll still make decisions that I feel are best for the game, because my design priority is that I want the game to be fun! \nJust to be clear, no matter how good this game is, I will never sell it to a publisher, or in otherwise reproduce it. You're copies will be unique and I will make sure they stay that way! \nHow did you come up with the prices?\nI've been designing games for 5 years, so I know how much I will spend in materials throughout the process. I'm not a graphic designer, or artist, so I will have to pay other people to do those things. I also factored in valuing my time, and how much the final products are going to cost. I'm anticipating the game to be pretty good sized, with a myriad of tokens, dice, cards, boards, etc. If I end up designing a component light game, I will just design a second game to make it worth it for you!\nWhat are the different backer levels about?\nPrint and Play files: You'll get the files during playtesting (after I've run the game enough times I'm comfortable with it), as well as once the files are \"finalized\". So you can playtest it if you want, and give feedback, or just wait and make yourself a copy of the game once it's done.\nThank you card, and prototype components: I'll send you a card, thanking you for your support. I'll shove some prototype components in it, so you can have a neat little piece of the project. \nMake/100 Hand Made copies: These will be hand made by me. I'll cut, assemble, and do the whole caboodle. Components will be matte finished, so that it will hold up to multiple plays. The boards, etc will be made with foam core, the dice will be stickered, the cards will be printed on paper, and put into card sleeves, with old MTG cards as backing. I will do everything I can to make the game as nice as possible. Each copy will be signed and numbered as I make them. Here's a picture of a prototype that I worked on, it will be like this, but with better art and graphic design.\nMMMMMMM Foamcore.\nMake/100 Print on Demand copies: I will have 100 copies printed through a POD service. The main difference is that boards and cards will be made from Chipboard and Cardstock, rather than Foamcore and sleeved MTG cards. I'll ship them to me first, so that I Can sign and number them, before shipping them to you. I will be working closely with The Game Crafter to ensure these copies are as nice as possible! \nWhy aren't there any reviews?\nBecause this game doesn't exist yet. I've already started coming up with some ideas, and I'll fully start in on it once the project funds. \nStretch Goals?\nYes! Let's do some! I am going to structure these differently than other kickstarters, and will unlock them if the pledge levels get completely sold out. Upgrades will affect all versions of the game applicable! I'll add more here as I think of them! Feel free to suggest ideas! \nAll/100 Hand Made Copies - If all 100 slots get taken:\ni'll increase the money I have allocated for graphic design! Shiny! \nLet's upgrade this baby! I'll get a really nice box printed out to put the game into!\nAll/100 Print on Demand Copies - If all 100 slots get taken:\nI'll increase the art budget and spring for super swank art!\nHigh Quality - I'll upgrade the components as much as I can afford to! \nAdditional Stretch goals:\n$22,000 - I will purchase a 3D printer to Print components for the game with!  \n$26,000 - The 3d printer will be the liquid resin type, so that they 3d printed components are the highest quality I can manage.\nAdd-Ons!\nI've really racked my brain on trying to figure some out, so let me know how you feel about them! \nContent Creation Kit - $10 - I'll send you all of the templates needed to create your own content for the game. I'll also help you make sure that your components match what I produced, regardless of version. \nUpgraded components - $25 - This one was very tough for me to decide on, since I don't know what the components will be. I priced it lower than what I thought it would cost. What are upgraded components? I will 3d print anything that I can afford to for your copy of the game. Any place I can spend an extra dollar or two to make things nicer, I will. \n__________ the Card/Dice Game - $30 - I will design a lighter dice or card game based on the main game. I will try to have this done at the same time, to save on shipping, but I am not going to promise that. If it is not done at the same time, I will ship it separately. \n__________ the Expansion - $15/40/50 - Yup. I'll design an expansion for the game, and make it match your version of the game. Please add the appropriate amount that matches your version of the game: 15 for the print and play version, 40 for the hand-made version, and 50 for the POD version. My goal will be to have the expansion done very soon after the base game, and I would prefer to ship it together, so please be aware that adding this on *may* delay your copy just a little bit.\nThank you!\nI'm very excited to embark on this journey with you! Thank you for considering to help make it a reality! Here are some cute pictures of my kids and a cat helping out playtest games!\nMy kids helping to playtest a game we designed together!

As players move around the board and land on one of your power centers, they must pay you for being within your sphere of influence.\nIn order to obtain the Presidency, a player must first control five or more centers of power (squares on the game board) and twenty cronies (red game pieces).

We are definitely looking forward to playing this again!\" - Game and a Curry\n\"The scenario felt very true to something you would see in a Sharknado movie \u2013 an absurd story that makes no logical sense, but fits into the Sharknado world perfectly ... The game does a solid job of making you feel like you are actually working together to achieve a common goal.\" - The Chubby Meeple\n\"Sharknado is exactly the kind of game I wanted it to be: chaotic, absurd, and, above all, fun as hell. My Mexican wrestler had shinguards, a bike helmet, and a chain gun--and he and his friends saved the city... And beyond the insanity that is the theme, there's a really good co-op game that rewards multiple play styles. I'll be playing Sharknado very, very often.\" - Doug Levandowski, co-designer of Gothic Doctor and UnPub: The UnPublished Card Game and designer of You're Fired and Seven Minutes in Hell\n\"Every so often a game comes along that makes you look back at all that has been created and you wonder, 'Why hasn't anyone done this before?' This might be that game.\" - Tim Mattes, Games on Tape\n\u201cSharknado is a great game that will call out to both fans of the film and game players alike.

The characters, items and abilities are (ir)reverent enough to make the game fun, even if you're losing.\u201d - Ben Begeal, No one of consequence\n\"Sharknado is a game that knows its audience.

Also, the gear/dice system is sweet.\" - Jay Treat, game designer\n\"Why?\" - SMIF Networks\nPreviews & Reviews\n      Sharknado\u2122: The Board Game! is a new take on the co-op adventure genre. Even though it takes place in the Sharknado\u2122 universe, all of the Characters, and most of the scenarios, are completely original. Fans of the films will find familiar weapons, themes, and parallels, while gamers that haven't yet enjoyed the movies have appreciated the strategy and combat system. \nWhile we\u2019ve had this game favorably likened to Dead of Winter, the Forbidden games, Zombicide, and others, we'd like to point out some noteworthy features of Sharknado\u2122: The Board Game! \nNo specific turn order - The game plays in two phases: the Player phase and the Sharknado phase. During the Player phase, you and your team can take actions in whatever order works best for your strategy.\nAI-controlled Sharknado - The Sharknado is controlled by its own AI deck. Each turn it will move multiple times, rain sharks from the sky, flood the city, and cause carnage.\nLoss of limbs - Just like in the movies, airborne sharks are hungry. Losing arms and legs will slow you down, but don\u2019t lose your head or you\u2019re dead!\nCreate your own story - We\u2019ve included 8 scenarios in the base game, each with two difficulties, but we\u2019ll also include tips on creating your own scenarios for infinite replayability. \n  For a more detailed look at the game, without all that reading, check out the videos below!\nHow to play Sharknado: The Board Game!\nLive Playtests/Demos from Gen Con 2016 \n    Using our network of designers and industry contacts, we've done our best to establish the most cost-effective, customs-friendly ways of getting Sharknado\u2122: The Board Game! to your door. \nKickstarter automatically charges shipping at checkout based on location, but we'll also break them down for you here:\n  Make It Better for Everyone: By participating in community goals and by pledging to help us reach stretch goals, you are shaping and enhancing the core game and growing The Backer Pack for everyone!\nWe Listen to You: You are our collaborator--we value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game.

Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organise a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks, a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.\n  Days of Ire: Budapest 1956 is a historically inspired card-driven board game, playable by 1-4 people. It can be played both co-operatively or in a one-versus-many setting. It is set during the most explosive days of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, in Budapest, where the fighting was the most fierce. The revolutionary players collect cards and fighters to resolve events and other challenges posed to them by their Soviet opponent (real or simulated). In order to win, they must stay alive throughout the 7 days of fighting - while ensuring that the city doesn't fall to pieces\nDesigned by the crew of 2014\u2019s [redacted], embellished by the amazing art of Kwanchai Moriya, and brought to you by a team made up of people who worked on Anachrony, ...and then we held hands, The Pursuit of Happiness and Posthuman, Days of Ire has gameplay deeply rooted in its theme and setting, and mechanisms inspired by all-time classics such as Pandemic, Robinson Crusoe, and Twilight Struggle.\n    Best of both worlds - a historical wargame and a thematic cooperative board game combined. Perfect for a wargamer to play with his/her non-wargamer family and friends, or co-op players to take up a historical spin \nAccessible - the co-operative mode is comparable to Pandemic\u2019s complexity \nLight, card-driven wargame - half the time as Twilight Struggle, less cards to learn, yet similar feeling \nEngaging solo play - game designed from the ground up with solo play in mind. This is a solo mode not a solo variant. \nUnique, unexplored theme - exciting theme for history enthusiasts all over the world, deeply integrated into gameplay \nBeautiful and engaging art - master artist Kwanchai Moriya and our very own Katalin Nimmerfroh provide the perfect atmosphere through the gritty reality of the revolutionary cards and the idealised propaganda of communist SPA cards\nInterested in checking out the rules of Days of Ire: Budapest 1956?

Send them either as PDF annotations or as text in the email. \nYou may download the WIP PDF rulebook here.\nAfter we\u2019ve received comments from the community we will send the text off to our graphic designer and have a full PDF rulebook ready before the end of the campaign.\n Rahdo Runs Through\n\"It works so phenomenally well!\u201d [...]\u201cThis is a very very impressive game\"\n[About the Twilight Struggle meets Pandemic game setup]: \"That right there... is AMAZING! It's such an innovative and cool gameplay setup...\u201d\n[Talking about the coop mode]: \"It's fun! [...] If you get it solely for the coop experience, [...] it is a worthy game!\u201d\nGameplay runthrough (from the Soviet's point of view)\n Extended Gameplay (presenting the co-operative play)\n Final Thoughts (including thoughts on solo play)\nReviews on BoardGameGeek\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that your tactical decisions \u2013 tension between concentration and dispersal \u2013 have strategic effects [...] There are good peaks and troughs of tension as your plans unfold (or not!), and also a great build-up to a dramatic end point.\u201d - Alan Paull, Surprise Stare Games\n\"This doesn't play like your standard 1 vs many where the \u201cGM\" is encouraged to go easy and make sure everyone is having fun - this is a legit head to head strategy game where both sides don't feel like they have to pull any punches\u201d [...] \"This game brought to life an entire chunk of history I was previously unaware of, and did so in a memorable and interactive way\u201d Chad McCallum\nWho Dares Rolls \nConnect More\n   Dice Tower Summer Preview (Origins)\nWritten Reviews\n444 (HU) \nVolpe Giocosa (ITA)\nDice and Sorcery (HU)\nGame Rustlers (ENG)\nGioconauta.it (ITA)\nPodcasts\nNerdstravaganza\nDing & Dent\nWe have already put the maximum that we can include in the game right from the start, and we have made no compromises in terms of its design. The game comes ready with full fledged V.S., co-operative and solo modes out of the box. \nThe stretch goals, therefore, focus more on adding more variety, higher quality components and other enhancements to further improve the overall experience of the game. We\u2019re starting off with these, and then we\u2019ll announce more as we go along!\n    Get it before the rest - copies will ship to Kickstarter backers way before the game hits traditional distribution. \nLimited availability - the game will be manufactured in limited quantities based on the final number of backers.\nGet it cheaper - although the MSRP is not fully solidified yet (as it may go up if we unlock many stretch goals), the game is estimated to go for around $65 MSRP. \nBenefit from subsidised shipping - shipping is always a very challenging and expensive part of any Kickstarter. We have heavily subsidised the shipping costs to make sure we are able to offer an affordable deal to as many people as possible.\nMake it better for all of us - help unlock a number of stretch goals that will make the game even more enhanced and beautiful. \nWe can\u2019t do it without you! - we\u2019ve paid for the development, art, graphic design and gotten the game to where you see it today. But we cannot print and ship without you. Help make this unique game a reality. \n  We like to keep things simple. This is why we have one pledge level with heavily subsidised shipping all over the world. Shipping rates are as follows: \nUS: $4\nWestern EU: $6\nCentral/Eastern EU & Scandinavia (except Norway): $10\nCanada, Australia, parts of Asia, Norway, Switzerland & Russia: $15\nRest of the World: $30\nTo see exact shipping rates, click on the reward and then select your country. Shipping will be added automatically to your pledge!\nYou will not pay extra duty or taxes for packages delivered to US, EU, CA and AU.\nNOTE: Orders of more than a single copy to AU and CA may be subject to extra charges. ONE copy will not be charged anything, guaranteed.\nThese shipping rates are based on accurate shipping quotes. We believe you should not have any hidden costs, so what you see is what you get. \nThe game will be manufactured in factories we have worked with before and we are confident in their capabilities to deliver a good product. The fulfilment will be handled by Funagain and Ideaspatcher, companies with an amazing track record. Cloud Island might be a new company, but the people involved in this campaign have participated and even ran several other campaigns in the past. \nWe expect the game to be ready for Essen 2016, and we hope to have the game fulfilled before or during Essen. We've set the expected deadline to January 2017, this is to allow some time for potential delays that are outside of our control (factory delays, customs, Chinese New Year preparations etc). We prefer to under-promise and then over-deliver, than the other way round. Whatever the case, we will make sure that Kickstarter copies are fulfilled way before the game hits traditional distribution.

With our experience on previous projects, we are confident to be able to handle the challenges that come with launching a board game on Kickstarter.\n\nWe have done everything we can to minimise all risks from our side, however, board games are usually subject to some risks involving factory delays and customs delays which are completely out of our control. Nevertheless, we are working with partners who we trust and have previously delivered, and we are confident we can deliver the game in a timely manner.\n\nAll graphics and art is complete, all development and game design is finalised.

It can be anything (within reason!), be it a game mechanic or just something... strange. Details are in the rewards on the right. Here are a couple of examples to get you thinking:\n  Want to get yourself some bonus cards?\nEach backer who names you as the person that recommended them will earn both you and them a copy of Noisy Bot!\n(They must pledge for at least one copy of the game and their pledges must go through at the end of the project. Cancelling and re-pledging doesn't count. I reserve the right to refuse you the bonus cards if you're doing something else sneaky that I haven't thought of!!)\nSo if you have 5 friends who you refer to back the project, you will have 5 copies of the card and they will each have one as well. All that needs to happen once they've pledged, is each of you message me with the other's name.\nThis game really thrives on word of mouth and it often takes someone's recommendation or demonstration for people to see through the simplistic appearance to the depth of the game beneath.\nNoisy Bot - A sneak preview of the new 'wake' mechanic. When this card enters play, turn the highest face-down card of the chosen Stak to face-up! This not only lets you find out what card it is, it means it won't trigger once it gets to the top of the Stak.\nAs well as revealing cards and disabling entry effects, it is perfect for increasing the size of your Leader Bots. Or to find better cards to Levi or Ladder. Or bigger targets for Pulse, etc etc! Just don't use it on a Clumsy Bot!!\nFor each additional \u00a3500 above our initial goal, an additional Bot will be unlocked. Each pack will include a copy of every stretch goal Bot. \n(Please note that due to the short-run printing process used for the stretch goal Bots, they will appear slightly shinier than the other cards. They are still perfectly usable in-game). \n\u00a35500 - First in line is Recall Bot!\nRecall Bot was in the shortlist for the Red Expansion and its entry effect works brilliantly in combination with a lot of the other cards in the set. Fancy using that Spike Shot Bot again? Or saving up that big Elephant Bot to use later on when it's a bit safer? Well now you can. \n\u00a36000 - Next is the improved Spy Bot!\nSince its first appearance as a stretch goal option in the 'Yellow' expansion kickstarter, Spy Bot has learnt when it should and shouldn't reveal cards! Use it to boost Leader Bots, get bigger groups to sink with Crevice Bot, or just to find out what's lurking in a Stak and then sit and look smug about it. \nMeet the mighty medley of mechanical maniacs! Where possible we have included footage of the Bots from the Breakout game, so you can see some of what they're capable of! \nThis fiendish little scamp generates an EMP tuned to the frequency of the most powerful Bot (or Bots!) in play, regardless of where they are in their Stak. \nPLAY\n\n   When Juggler Bot enters play, it grabs the front 3 Bots of a Stak and deftly rearranges them into whichever position suits you best. No, it can't throw itself. \nArmour Bot has crafted itself an extra thick second skin made from the husks of fallen Core Bots. It is so tough it can completely ignore the feeble blows and shots of weak Bots. \nPLAY\n\n  Harbinger of synchronous entry effects, Avalanche Bot creates a flurry of face-up cards, with a new one appearing atop every single Stak. It is so exhausted from conjuring up such chaos that play then passes to the next player to resolve the first new entry effect.  \nIn basing the design of this Bot on its flesh and blood counterpart, an unfortunate side-effect was generated: an irrational fear of any Bot small enough to be a mouse, that causes the Elephant Bot to self-destruct when confronted! Power zero Bots have never been so damaging! \nPLAY\n\n  Here to give a helping hand to its Stakmates, Ladder Bot will force another face-up Bot in its Stak to rise to the top. Perfect for digging out specific abilities at a crucial time, but if there are no other face-up cards its invitation to ascend will fall flat. \nAs Pit Bot's larger and more manipulative sibling, Crevice Bot can drill up a crack in the ground large enough to swallow an entire front group of face-up cards. Why get rid of one problem card when you can get rid of all its friends as well? \nPLAY\n\n  A fearsome beast, Bounty Bot has the power to completely shift the balance of power in a game. Set it up to take down a string of weak Bots and you'll have a fistful of new cards to tinker with. \nIf you compact enough Spike Bots into a ball, it is possible to create a projectile prickly enough to replicate Spike's damage ability. Fire one of these at an opponent to eliminate two cards with one entry effect!\nPLAY\n\n  A generous gentle giant, Nice Bot will hand your opponent the gift of another card when it enters. Maybe they'll be less likely to attack you now?  \nWhen Shark Bot spys oil on the water, it moves in for the kill, destroying a damaged card when it enters play. Unfortunately, it doesn't distinguish between friend and foe. \nPLAY\n\n  Needy Bot absolutely hates being alone; it kicks up such a stink when it enters play that you're forced to silence it by playing another card on top of it. Another card like a Spur Bot for example...\nIf you can land a Bee on top of another of your Bots it will reset it, allowing you to use its effect a 2nd time later. If the Bee Bot has nothing nearby to sting, it will look elsewhere for a target and allow you to reset any other top card.\nPLAY\n\n   Like the other Leader Bots before it, Ram Leader will grow more powerful when placed with other face-up Bots. When it charges headlong into another Stak, the force of its collision will destroy the weakest surviving card in the Stak. But only if the card isn't stronger than the Ram. Yes it's complicated until you've seen it in action. Yes there will be example diagrams in the instructions. \n  PLAY\n\n    PLAY\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the 3rd set of Stak Bots that we have produced and we will be using the same printers, so we are very familiar with the process. \n\nThe Kickstarter rewards for the last expansion were delivered in full and on time, and we plan to do the same for this one. \n\nOnce the campaign has ended, the files go straight to Cartamundi for printing.\nFrom there, depending on whether any proof revisions are needed, it will be about 6 weeks until we take delivery of the games.

All these backers will receive a full version of the board game, Wasteland Justice.\nAt \u00a398 - Colourful Wastelander - Backers will receive the full version of the board game, Wasteland Justice. In addition we will hand paint an extra set of vehicle models for your own personal use. (Please note that the end result may vary but will be to the same level of quality).\nUnpainted models (These are 3D printed Nylon prototypes - Production models will be molded PVC)\n  Painted models\nAt \u00a3250 - King (or Queen)  of the Desert (example below) -  Our character artist (Andres) will create a unique Wasteland Justice driver based upon a supplied photo. These driver cards will either be added to the base game, if there is no impact on our production time scales, otherwise we will create a promotion pack for all backers to include these additional driver cards.  We will work with the backers to decide upon the drivers' unique ability, but Madbeard Games decision will be final to avoid any drastic game play changes.\nExample King of the Desert process (Thanks to Dustin for letting us share this)\nMerchants of the Wasteland - we will be contacting all backers at this level to provide evidence that they are a retailer.  This level this is for 5 full games. Once funded and before we confirm shipping, you may request additional copies of the game should you require.\nStretch Goals\n We would like to make Wasteland Justice the best game it can be, we have the following stretch goals lined up on the starting grid;\n\u00a335,000 - Don't get us wrong, we love the weight and feel of the cards currently, but that extra weight and linen feel will provide that tactile edge. (This will be in the box).\n\u00a350,000 - Ramming the same class vehicle and tired of waiting those few seconds to use the same die as your opponent?  Wait no longer!  We will add an extra set of the custom dice to the game. (This may be a KS exclusive and the dice may be a separate item to the core game in your delivery).\n\u00a375,000 - During standard game set-up, 1 wreck model is randomly placed per track piece. With more wrecks we will add into the rules alternative set-up of two wrecks per track piece for extra chaos mode. Surely no-one would try three wrecks pre track piece...that would just be bedlam! (This may be a KS exclusive and the extra wreck models may be a separate item to the core game in your delivery).\nDepending on interest, other stretch goals maybe added.\nShipping costs\nShipping is added on to each pledge (except for \u00a31 or more reward level), Wasteland Justice should weigh in at around 2.8kg.  These are the shipping costs for individual* game rewards that will be added to your pledge;\n If your location is not listed, please contact us and we will get a quote and try to add the shipping option in.\nWasteland Justice - Individual Game - Shipping rates\n  Wasteland Justice - Movement and Weapon Dice\n* Merchant shipping varies between 1.2x up to 2.5x the individual shipping cost.  Please check the reward level and shipping before you confirm your pledge.

The only caveat here is stretch goals, depending if we are successful to reach stretch goals they may extend our delivery estimate . \n\nAlthough great and fantastic bonuses in board games, stretch goals, can unbalance the core game and extend production times. We have therefore tried to view stretch goals/some bespoke rewards slightly differently from normal. These bespoke rewards or additional stretch goals if we unlock the initial 3, will either state \"in the box\" or \"in a separate packet.\"\n\nStretch goals \"in the box\" will not impact our production estimate. The stretch goals \"separate packet\" will be designed asap and produced in parallel (mainly due to additional art requirements) to the base game. The separate packet items will still be shipped with the core game but in a separate packet(s). \n\nMatthew and Joe are board gamers and have backed numerous games on Kickstarter, we have seen projects run well and projects run not so well. We would like to think we will be bringing the things we have seen done well and learning from those that have encountered some hiccups (in production, unforeseen costs, delays other timing oversights etc) and combining that into a well run project. \n\nDon't get this wrong, we will make mistakes, it would be foolish of us to believe we are perfect. However we will put our hands up when we go wrong and most importantly we will communicate every step of the way and provide regular updates. We strongly believe that our backers should know their upfront costs.

His books challenge everything about mainstream audiences. His novel Lullaby deploys necrophilia, gender-bending, and no-way-would-this-make-it-to-comfortable-TV satire. We want to make a movie that makes people feel uncomfortable enough to think original thoughts again, just like Chuck\u2019s novels do. To do that we need your help through Kickstarter. \nWe first got hooked on Chuck\u2019s novels in the late 90\u2019s, like some of you. We're fans first, and so like you, as directors and producers we want to make sure Lullaby is the film we all want it to be, and not some watered-down too easy commercial yawner. \nThis project is also important to Chuck. He began writing Lullaby during the trial of his father's murderer in 1999. The prosecutor came to Chuck and asked him if he wanted to advocate for the death penalty. This idea spawned the culling song, or the power of the word to cast a spell, and the story of Lullaby was created. \nToday, as co-writer of the Lullaby screenplay, Chuck has maintained his vision of what this story should be.  As an Executive Producer, he\u2019ll help us make sure that this film stays weird and challenging. \nHelp us make a movie that doesn\u2019t suck. \nSo What's It About?\nLullaby follows the life of Carl Streator\u2014an over the hill reporter whose family mysteriously died years prior. After being assigned to investigate a rash of mysterious infant deaths, he discovers the killer of his own family\u2014an ancient culling song published as a lullaby in a simple children's book. Carl sets out to destroy existing copies throughout the world but is surprised to learn that the people he once trusted to stop the deaths may be involved in the heinous acts.\nPraise for Lullaby\nTIME - \u201cDark riffing on modernity is the reason people read Palahniuk. His books are not so much novels as jagged fables, cautionary tales about the creeping peril represented by almost everything.\u201d\nThe Oregonian - \u201cPalahniuk conjures grief, confusion, mystery and fear from the unlikeliest sources . . . [and] teases amusement from the darkest corners of our culture.\u201d\nThe Daily News - \u201cTwisted and nihilistic . . .  the novel packs a dark comic wallop.\" \nPeople - \u201cAmong sick puppies, Palahniuk is the top dog . . . a unique talent.\u201d\nThe New York Times - \u201cMr. Palahniuk further refines his ability to create parables that are as substantial as they are off-the-wall.\u201d\nOur Plan\nOnce we successfully fund this project, we will start production immediately. We've been speaking with some amazing cast and crew, but to solidify any acting professionals, you need to have a budget locked down. We've scheduled the film and have done a lot of pre-production to make the process go quickly once funded.\nThe Timeline\nWe plan to shoot in late 2016 in Oregon\u2014we have 27 days planned of principal photography, giving us plenty of time to edit and add visual FX through 2017. If you are trying to be an extra, you'll need to be available during the later part of 2016.\nThe Budget - To shoot Lullaby, we've put together an initial budget of $250k, but we would like to increase this budget significantly. (Keep in mind, Fight Club was made for $63 million dollars.) \nWhy give to our project? We, as filmmakers, are dedicated to giving you the best film possible. In the end, a bigger budget will mean a higher quality production. This is where you come in! Here's what a larger budget would mean for the film:\nUpgraded visual effects! When it comes to talking cows, it can be a dangerous thing to underfund the VFX! We project an indie VFX budget of at least $200,000, but the bigger our budget, the better the effects, especially for scenes like the Judas Cow and the Seattle Ivy Inferno.\nAmazing locations! As Oyster would say, \u201cWhen you think about it, Johnny Appleseed was a fucking ecological terrorist.\u201d We agree with Oyster. Being that Lullaby takes place at various locations throughout the country, a realistic representation of the environment is important to portray contemporary America and the impact that we've had on our landscape. The bigger the budget, the better the locations.\nWorld class actors! A-list actors are expensive. When Chuck and Andy wrote the screenplay, they had some very notable actors in mind (take a guess at who we're thinking), and are currently in correspondence with these actors. Many of them have read the script and are interested in being a part of the film! That is, so long as we can pay them the salary that their talent demands. With every dollar our budget increases, the closer we move to securing one or more A-list actors.\nA kickass crew! Team Lullaby is committed to recruiting and hiring professional crew members, many of which are from right here in Portland, Oregon, but this also includes talented and diverse women and men from around the country. There\u2019s no doubt about it, a great film requires a great crew.\nInvested Money Multiplied\nWe are applying for IOPIF\u2014a film rebate and incentive program for Oregon filmmakers. We have the potential to receive a rebate of 10% on payroll and 20% on goods and services. We will reinvest the funds back into the production. For every dollar we earn, we have the potential of actually spending 120% in Oregon.\nDistribution and Film Release\nDepending on our festival invitations (wink, wink), we will premiere the film in late 2017 or beginning 2018 and release it publicly thereafter. Distribution usually happens within 18 months after a festival premiere. If we don't secure a distribution deal we are happy with, we will release the film ourselves using art house theaters through our relationship with the Art House Convergence\u2014ensuring that this film will be seen by the public.\nOur Key Team Members\nThe cool thing about our team is that they are all movie lovers. They have lots of experience working on independent films. Our director, Andy Mingo, and Chuck have worked on other projects together including a short, Romance, adapted from a short story of Chuck's, published originally in Playboy, the rights of which were purchased for a bottle of Whiskey and $1.\nDuring Romance's successful festival run, Andy met our producer, and fellow Oregonian, Josh Leake at Raindance Film Festival in London. They were introduced by the Mexican ambassador to the UN during a festival event. Needless to say, they became fast friends and founded their own production company called Mindpollen.\nAndy is currently directing the trailers for the Fight Club 2 graphic novel published by Dark Horse Comics with an expected June release date.\nYou can also see a documentary that our producer helped create on Showtime called Glena, with a feature film adaptation of that in the works. Leake is currently in postproduction on Zombie Day with George C. Romero, which is set to break the Guinness Book of World Records for the most extras in a short film.\nTeam Lullaby\nWe've pulled some talented friends together to help oversee the pre-production, creation and distribution of our rewards, and with your help, make Lullaby into a feature film. \nRewards\n WHAT IS A VIRTUAL PRODUCER?\nPLAY\n\n ARE THERE T-SHIRT COLORS OPTIONS?

The next best thing you could do is to help us build awareness for the game by following us and sharing our posts on Twitter and Facebook.\n                                                                                                                                      We've built in a small discount for ALL shipping. We like to be completely transparent about everything we do. Here's a breakdown of the shipping costs and the discount you're receiving for pledging on Kickstarter.\nIf you'd like to add-on additional copies of Quests of Valeria, you can add any number of copies by adding $19 for each additional copy. \nTo add more games beyond the first, manually enter the $$ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge. For example, if you're in the USA, enter \"$39\" for 2 copies of Quests of Valeria. \nOur previous games, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, ManaSurge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, and Villages of Valeria will be available to add onto your pledge in limited numbers, but they will not be delivered until February when Quests of Valeria is being fulfilled. These games will also not be discounted. We encourage you to ask your FLGS to order these games from Peachstate Hobby or Alliance in the USA and Esdevium in the EU.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact David at david@dailymagicgames.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe wanted to publish this game on our dime, but due to popular demand from our previous Kickstarter, Villages of Valeria, we are now bringing Quests of Valeria here so that the community can help us make an even better version than we had planned. Every dollar we make will go directly back in to making Quests of Valeria a better game. Our Stretch Goals are designed to add more content to the base game - so your pledge really makes a difference in making the best game possible.\nHere are some incentives we are offering to all our backers:\n32% off MSRP. Pay only $17 instead of $25.\nDiscounted Shipping.

We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of Updates post-Kickstarter.\nWe're happy to report that of our previous four Kickstarter games:\nSwinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge delivered one month late in December 2015 and is nearly sold out.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms delivered on time in January 2016 and it has been selling so well that we've ordered another print run! Woot!\nManaSurge is on a boat to the USA and on track to deliver on time in May 2016. \nVillages of Valeria is in to the printer and on track to deliver on time in September of 2016.\nWe like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital game background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed two successful board games: Sunrise City and Valeria: Card Kingdoms.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout the campaign, we will be as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Quests of Valeria is completed with the exception of stretch goal content. The art and design for the stretch goal content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nWe hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Our Newest Valeria-Universe Game", "update_content": "Live on Kickstarter Right Now!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Margraves of Valeria: Funded!", "update_content": "Greetings Questers...\nJust a quick note to let you know that our newest Valeria game, Margraves of Valeria, is now live on Kickstarter.

With your friends, you are fleeing from invading raiders, leaving your desert home: a plain left behind by a once great ocean, called the Saltlands.\nFlee from waves of invading raiders\nUse landsails, motorized vehicles and a multitude of weapons to make your escape\nExplore - the each time different - environment, collect victory items and investigate rumors in hopes of escape\nCompete or cooperate - who wins and who is left behind? \nHow you play and whether you survive is up to you: we did our best to create a challenging game with unconstrained player interaction and chair-gripping tension. Find out for yourself!\n\u201c...it\u2019s clear this is actually a streamlined and rugged bunch of mechanisms all purring together like a finely tuned V8.\u201d - Mike Barnes, Who Dares Rolls\nNumber of players: 1-6\nAverage playtime (classic mode, normal length): 90-120 minutes\nBeside the Classic (semi-coop) game mode, Saltlands can be played in a full cooperative, or in a full competitive mode. Each variant come in different length and difficulty, you can choose the most suitable for you.\nStrategic social interactions - You will almost certainly not be able to win this game as a lone wolf. But first player or group of players who win will leave the others to their fate. - you have to be one of them! Choose your friends and stick with them, or betray them at the right moment.\nChallenging but fair - There are no dice rolls in the game and the movement of the raiders is rather predictable: survival mostly depends on your strategy and who you cooperate with.\nReplayable and expandable - The desert is different each time you play, and combined with the expansion pack, Saltlands can bring you engaging exploration and surprising moments with every play.\nNot just a game, also a world - We endeavored to create an immersive, authentic desert realm where weapons are exotic, firearms are the remnants of a past age and landsails are ubiquitous. We worked hard on bringing you immersive visuals and have a Graphic Novel and some short stories to make Saltlands an especially memorable experience. Plastic miniatures help the Raider vehicles come to life.\nStreamlined, language-independent design - An intuitive system of pictograms and symbols make Saltlands accessible for multiple languages. With your help, we are planning to translate the rulebook to several languages.\n We are offering 3 editions of Saltlands.\nAll backers can instantly download the saltlands graphic novel \u201cTales on the Saltlands: Scorched Salt\u201d in digital form.\nSaltlands the Board Game for only \u20ac43 (~$49)\nSaltlands the Board Game and the Lost in the Desert Expansion together for \u20ac59 (~$66)\nCollector\u2019s Edition for \u20ac249 (~$280)\nSee details of each edition below.

All backers stay updated when the story continues.\nSaltlands the Board Game includes:\n36 plastic miniatures representing the six types of raiders chasing you,\n6 exciting characters from the three great colonies of the Saltlands,\n13 terrain tiles all illustrated individually,\n180 cards: native weapons, firearm relics, motorized vehicles, landsails, damage cards, rumors, and other items\nand much more...\nUnlocked stretch goal: raider bag\n  Saltlands the Board Game plus the Lost in the Desert Expansion \nFeatures 6 additional exciting characters for a total of 12 characters, each with a special ability and a special item:\nThe Thief & The Merchant from the Container Island\nThe Commander & The Marine from the Beached Mother Ship\nThe Shaman & The Twins searching for the Raider Camp\nAnd also advanced mechanics:\nArea-effect weapons, like the Grenade\nAdditional vehicles, such as the Wind Tractor\nAdditional Terrain Tiles enabling the...\nExtended EPIC gameplay mode!\nIn total Saltlands the Board Game plus the Lost in the Desert Expansion contain:\n214 Cards\n18 Terrain Tiles \n42 Plastic Miniatures \n12 Characters\nA printed copy of Tales on the Saltlands the graphic novel in the rulebook\nand much more...\n  The ultimate box of Saltlands, an outstanding item for your collection!\nThe Collector's Edition includes:\nSaltlands the Board Game and the Lost in the Desert Expansion in a single box,\nCollector's Edition box with a laser-cut, skull metal inlay,\n42 metal miniatures!\nThe plastic miniature sets from the normal editions\nAn insert with the names of all the Collector's Edition backers on it\nAn extra bag for the tokens\nThe box is signed by the game designers.\nSpot UV lettering (this is independent of the stretch goal as this box is a separate print run).\nthe Fan kit addon\nPlus the unlocked achievements:\nMetal Wind Tile\nSurvival Guide + Short Story Booklet (same as in the Fan kit addon)\nMetal Victory Markers\nPoster (same as in the Fan kit addon)\n12 Character sheets, explaining the character abilities (same as in the Fan kit addon)\nNote: The Collectors' Edition is a Kickstarter Exclusive! (Photos of our current prototype box do not represent the its final form, as they are still missing the spot UV.)\n(Prototype minis molded off of a 3D print. Final minis will have a finer finish.)\n    About the achievements:\nThe cast metal wind tile replaces the cardboard wind tile in the normal edition for a more substantial look.\nThe short story booklet contains 3+3 short stories about the colonies when the raiders arrive.\nThe custom cast metal victory markers, provide a unique look for each of the three exit points leading to the three mythical destinations.\nA unique poster lets you take a look at the Saltlands even when you're not playing...\nThe music CD contains the album 'Desert Overcrowded' by the Greek post-rock band Tuber. It's the music you hear in the campaign video... the perfect background music for playing Saltlands!\nAdd-ons\nYou've found the Saltlands Survival Guide. Its worn pages contain precious information, rumors and tales noted by fellow travelers throughout the decades. You learn that this booklet contains something else, too - somebody has jotted down stories that may very well be about the origins of the Colonies. Or are they just false gossips?\nThis add-on contains:\nThe KS-exclusive Survival Guide, merged with the short story booklet of the Colonies\n12 Character Sheets, explaining the character abilities (replacement item since the Cheat Sheets were unlocked)\nAn awesome KS-exclusive Saltlands Poster to remind you that Survival Is Not Enough!\nNote:\n1) Collectors' Edition backers will get this add-on as part of their reward.\n2) The Cheat Sheets stretch goal was unlocked, so you will get 12 Character Sheets explaining the character abilities instead.\nYou love to paint beautiful miniatures of all kinds, and love collecting KS-exclusive, unique stuff. You want to have the option to play Saltlands with something other than paper player standees. This add-on is for you! Give each vehicle a unique look.\nUse the landsails as a starting vehicle and after painting, the extra raider minis when players switch over to raider vehicles. (Because each vehicle has 2 vehicle cards in the Supply Deck, the extra minis are enough and you won't end up with less miniatures for the spawning raiders.)\nThis add-on contains:\n6 KS-exclusive, 3D printed landsail miniatures\nTwo sets (2x6) of raider miniatures\nNOTE: the landsails seen on the picture are illustrations and the final model is going to be similar in appearance but different in details. They will be marked in some way if you do not wish to paint them.\nThe raider miniatures are going to have the same color as the other raiders (probably black, see the FAQ), the landsails may differ in color due to the different manufacturing method.\nThe landsails are going to be manufactured with a low-quantity manufacturing method, most probably 3D printing. Expect proper build quality - we don't want to deliver low-quality miniatures anywhere.\nEach box comes with Raider miniatures! The raiders use 6 different vehicles:\nthe Hover-chevy\nthe Beetle-mod\nthe Pickup\nthe Monsterjeep\nthe Trooper-track\nthe Trailer Truck\nThe miniatures are made of injection molded plastic except in the Collector's Edition with its exclusive metal miniatures. (Miniatures pictured are 3D printed prototypes and from molds off of them. The production miniatures will have a finer finish.)\nClick here to see and rotate the miniatures in 3D.\nCheck out the reviews section below for more information about the game mechanics.\nMythical destinations - The characters have heard of three mythical locations, where they can possibly make a living in peace away from the raiders. To find the path to one of these locations (exit points) the protagonists follow a trail of rumors exploring the Saltlands. When enough rumors have been revealed the exit points activate. Each time a player finds a rumor he has a choice concerning the exit point locations.\nRace to Victory - The first group of players to reach an exit point with the necessary equipment, and clear out the raiders there wins. They escape, and leave the rest to their fate. However, there are no fixed teams; the first player, or players to achieve this goal wins. So players have to decide whom to work with and whom to stab in the back.\nLandsails - The hard flat plain of the Saltlands and the prevailing winds provide an excellent terrain for landsails. The game has a simple wind movement mechanic, which follows real sailing principles: Your speed is determined by the strength and direction of the wind. You are sailing the fastest on a broad reach (downwind, but not directly downwind). You can not go directly against the wind, but must zig-zag (tack) to make progress in that direction.\nTough decisions - Decide what to keep and what (or who) to leave behind in the Saltlands. Save helpless souls in the desert and they will aid you during your journey. Or just ditch them when you don't need them anymore. There is only so much space in your vehicle.\nRaiders on the hunt - The raiders are following you with gas guzzling machines. They always move towards the nearest target and attack them if they catch up. Each player must activate a type of raider at the end of their turn (one that has not moved yet). Thus they can determine the order in which the different types of raiders move. By choosing which raider to activate they can help or hinder the other players.\nSwarming Horde - The Horde of raiders is coming and it seems like there is no escape. More and more raiders join the pursuit as time passes, spawning at the end of of each phase. You must decide when to flee and when to fight the Raiders that are after you. If you kill them you get their equipment and can even use their vehicle, but linger too long and you will be overwhelmed. Find the exit soon or your life is going to be even shorter than expected.\nRulebook & Translations\nThe final version is not yet available, but you can download revision 2.15.

Players race against the clock, raiders flood the Saltlands and kill everyone if they can\u2019t escape soon enough.\nThe Classic game mode is semi-cooperative. Players are free to form alliances or fight alone. The first group of players to fulfill the winning conditions wins, and leaves the other players to their fate. The winning group can consist of any number of players, even one.\nThe Competitive game mode is for lone wolves. Players may fight the raiders together, but only one player wins. The first player who collects enough equipment to escape wins alone, and leaves the others behind.\nDifficulty levels\nIn the Easy mode, players aren\u2019t out of the game after death. They lose their equipment, but they respawn at another location as another survivor.\nIn the Normal mode, players have one respawn option and then are out of the game.\nThere is no place for mistakes in the Hard mode: players have only one life. This is recommended for experienced players only, If they are not careful enough they can quickly die.\nLength variations\nTutorial mode is developed specially for rookies. It\u2019s only available in easy mode, since the purpose of this is to learn the basics of the game mechanics fast.\nNormal game length is 90-120 minutes. This option grants the whole challenging game experience with many hard decisions.\nThe Epic mode is for players who are looking for an extended experience. It comes in a bigger map in the Lost in the desert expansion. Players have to optimize their hand for a long trip and for more raiders.\nThe Transporter\n\"Though others choke from it, I love when the smoke of burning tires irritates my throat.

Even more reviews are coming soon!\nWho Dares Rolls\n\u201c...it\u2019s clear this is actually a streamlined and rugged bunch of mechanisms all purring together like a finely tuned V8.\u201d\n\u201c...this is one of those times that I\u2019ve felt I was looking at a project that had really been refined and developed. The design feels tight and lean there\u2019s no flab or needless mechanics this is a product that\u2019s been nurtured and loved.\u201d- Mike Barnes, Who Dares Rolls (click here)\nBONUS: Audio interview with the developers\nClub Fantasci\n\u201cAs a strategy game, Saltlands is a post-apocalyptic chess match, offering unique challenges.\u201d - Maurice Fitzgerald, Club Fantasci (click here)\nindex.hu\u201cHard but winnable, you need to stay on your toes and choose the right tactics depending on the characters, environment and wind direction. [\u2026] But after all, someone\u2019s going to bite the ground and that\u2019s why the game is so exciting.\u201d - D\u00e1vid Saj\u00f3, index.hu [HUN]\ngeekz.444.hu\nThe greatest virtue of Saltlands is that it puts you into a dangerous and mean post-apocalyptic world, where you chase mythical destinations while fighting for survival. The game mechanics suitably mirror this theme with dynamic exploration and victory conditions, and the various available strategies bring along complex action.\nPixelFlood.it - interview with the developers [ENG+ITA]\nBox of Delights\n\u201cA wonderful, climactic experience, a stylized game\u201d - Ricky Royal, The Box of Delights:\nThe Kwarenteen \nSaltlands preview from Mitchel Lurcook - The Kwarenteen:\nSit Down Standard\"If you like thematic games that give you meaty choices, this is definitely an excellent game.\"\n  We're from Europe, and we hate expensive, non-friendly shipping just as much as you do. We have decided for the \"Stonemaier method\" of shipping: using local fulfillment centers to deliver Saltlands in an easy, affordable way.\nFor the USA, Canada, Australia, and the European Union we are going to provide intraregional shipping which means we take care of duties and taxes. We pay for VAT, GST, and other three-letter acronym taxes.\nShipping costs:\nUSA: Free shipping!\nCanada: \u20ac3\nAustralia: \u20ac5\nEU: \u20ac7\nRest of the world: \u20ac20\nThe shipping cost is the same for the base game and the base game plus the Lost in the Desert Expansion pack.\nWe are a small team of close friends and also engineers doing their best to bring their beloved game to life. Playing and designing board games is our passion.\nSaltlands have been in development for almost a year, we've spent endless days on playtesting, graphic design and engaging with the boardgaming community to receive valuable feedback about the game.\nWe became so excited that the two of us have even quit our day jobs just to do this - out of love for gaming.\nOur goal was to create not just a good game but a polished, aesthetically appealing work of art - while keeping an eye on shipping and manufacturing so that the price can be kept at an affordable level.\nNow it's your turn, it's up to you to support us and the Saltlands project to make it a reality. We've been working on Saltlands for months, but we can't cover the costs of the minimum order quantity of game manufacturers. That is why we're doing a crowdfunding campaign in the first place.\nSaltlands can't and won't happen without you, but your involvement can take it even further. In addition to backing, you can help us by spreading the word during the campaign. We'd also love to hear your feedback in the Comments section - we'll definitely try to answer every question that you might have!\nSpecial thanks to Attila Bal\u00e1zs for helping us with press appearances!\nAbout the funding goal\nThe funding goal has been carefully calculated to cover a minimum print run and make sure that we can fulfill our backers properly, truly making Saltlands a reality.\nEverything that has happened before the campaign is 'on us', so the funding goal mirrors our post-Kickstarter expenses.\nThe cost breakdown of the funding goal is the following:\n8% Do any necessary graphic design modifications\n63% Making a minimum order quantity print run at our manufacturer + manufacturing an injection molding tool for the miniatures\n18% Shipping games\n8% Kickstarter fees\n3% Provision", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAntler Games is a team of three enthusiastic guys. We all have a masters degree in engineering and therefore, are very meticulous and elaborate when it comes to arranging little details that make manufacturing, fulfillment and shipping possible, affordable and sensible.\n\nWe have done the following to mitigate risks and make your support a 'safe bet', that you will surely receive your reward:\n\n- Three people can specialize and concentrate on separate fields: Gergely Kruppa does design and art direction, Andr\u00e1s Drozdy handles testing and manufacturing, while Gergely Gombos arranges business, shipping and marketing details.\n\n- We've set up a BV (LLC) in the Netherlands so that we can conduct business more easily. This helps us with tax and customs issues as well. For example we make sure that you are not charged additional VAT when receiving your reward.\n\n- We have a very detailed budget with multiple scenarios, so the project's funding goal is sensible and it is definitely possible to accomplish the project from this amount of funding, including getting quotes for the stretch goals.\n\n- We have been discussing manufacturing details with Panda Games for months and expect that we will be working with them because we think they can deliver a high quality product on time.\n\nNevertheless, shipping and manufacturing delays may occur.

In Victoriana, players take the role of famous Victorian characters. Following a trail of clues through sprawling 19th century London, these characters must investigate a dire conspiracy that threatens Queen and Country. If all three elements of the conspiracy- Mastermind, Plot, and Locale- are discovered before Big Ben chimes midnight, the players have a chance to engage in a climactic confrontation for the fate of the British Empire. God save the Queen!\nLondon, 1899- The board for Victoriana\nTension that builds throughout the game: As the three elements of the conspiracy are revealed, so are Agents of the Mastermind. This results in a game that gets more challenging the closer you are to victory.\nTime made tangible: Each time the clock advances a quarter hour, all the Leads in play physically turn a quarter turn clockwise. If a Lead ever returns to the 12 o\u2019clock position, it is lost forever. Players use this visible timer to prioritize their actions.\nMultiple resources that need to be managed: Players must balance abilities, movement, and trauma in order to stop the conspiracy before time, the most limited resource of all, runs out.\nFantastic variety: With more than 100 unique Leads, 20 possible Plots, 13 fearsome Masterminds, and the whole of 19th century London as the setting, Victoriana will never play the same way twice.\nEngaging theme: Combining characters from Victorian literature with real-world scientists, politicians, occultists, and more, Victoriana offers a rich, exciting world for players to experience.\nOne of the many nefarious plots\nThe Goal of Victoriana\nDiscover the three elements of a vast conspiracy that threatens London- Mastermind, Plot, and Locale- before the clock strikes midnight!\nThe Gameplay of Victoriana\nInvestigate Leads: Lead cards represent information on the conspiracy! Spend your political, scientific, underworld, and occult resources to collect these leads. But hurry- take too long to investigate a lead and it will go cold!\nDiscover the Plot: Spend leads to eliminate plot cards. Players are rewarded for each plot they eliminate, but beware- a dangerous agent of the conspiracy lurks in the plot deck as well.\nReveal the Mastermind: Each mastermind is protected by three henchmen. Spend leads to put these villains away for good.\nTraverse London: Avoid sinister agents! Collect help from Scotland Yard! Explore the darkest corners of London until you have revealed the conspiracy's locale!\nFoil the Conspiracy: Once all three elements of the conspiracy are revealed, gather your investigators for a final confrontation.\nCheck out Update #2 for a more detailed look at the gameplay of Victoriana, check out the playthrough videos to see these features in action, and check out the rules for a complete how-to-play!\nPlaythrough Part 1: https://youtu.be/HI5UtCbIwF8\nPlaythrough Part 2: https://youtu.be/RUj83lL_y2s\nPlaythrough Part 3: https://youtu.be/OdA4HOVCQtI\nRulebook: While the layout, editing, and art is still in process, the rules are finalized.

That means Kickstarter backers will get a board game with high-quality components, stellar art and graphic design, and engaging gameplay at the best possible price.\nStretch Goals for Everyone: There are no Early Bird pledge levels, no add-ons or day 1 expansions, and no extra money required to unlock stretch goal rewards. Every stretch goal we unlock will be included for every backer at the $49 pledge level and above, for free.\nBackers First: We will ensure Victoriana backers receive their games before a single extra copy is sold. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be asking for your opinion on potential component upgrades and expansion ideas to make sure you get the game experience you\u2019re most interested in.\nWe Need You!: The game is ready, the art is looking great, but we can\u2019t finish the production of Victoriana without your support. Help us make Victoriana a reality.\nA Mastermind and his Henchman\nEach card in Victoriana is unique, providing a different experience every time.\n$1: Every little bit helps! We truly thank you for your support. We'll continue to update you on Victoriana's progress!\n$49: Every pledge at this level or above receives a copy of Victoriana. Not only is the $49 level a significant discount, but you get ALL unlocked stretch goals- new investigators, extra content, component upgrades, the works. Retail consumers will have to pay extra for these add-ons; you get them for free and earlier than anyone else as our special \"thank you\" for helping make the game a reality.   \n$69: As Victoriana is inspired in part by the literature of the period, why not create some literature of your own? Write the flavor text for one card that will be included in every copy of Victoriana. We'll give you the name of the card and you supply the reaction of our Investigators! You'll also receive credit in the rulebook for your contribution plus a copy of the game with all the unlocked stretch goals. \n$149: Ever wanted to try your hand at game design? Join us in creating a Lead card that will be in every copy of Victoriana. You come up with the name, effects, and flavor text of the card, we test it to make sure it's balanced, and you receive credit in the rulebook for your creation. Not to mention a copy of Victoriana and all unlocked stretch goals, of course!\n$240: SIX copies of Victoriana plus all unlocked stretch goals- a deep discount. Suitable for group buys, gifting, and people who have a compulsive need to buy things in sixes! You'll save on shipping, too. \n$249: What good is a Mastermind without their Henchmen? Work with us to design one of these bothersome cards, a copy of which will be included in every copy of Victoriana. You'll receive full credit for your creation, a copy of the game plus all unlocked stretch goals, and the ever-lasting hatred of your friends for creating such a devious impediment to their success.\n$499: Now for the SERIOUS design business. Work with us to create one of the most fearsome and challenging cards in Victoriana- an Agent of the conspiracy. These Agents have distinct personalities and far-reaching effects on gameplay. Are you up to the challenge? If you are, you'll receive full credit, a copy of Victoriana plus all unlocked stretch goals, and the terrible knowledge that you may have created the card that eventually costs you the game.\n$1000: Are you a die-hard fan of Gothic literature? Love the idea of a protagonist with intelligence AND anger issues? Help us create a new Investigator that embodies both- the strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Create unique abilities, resources, and even drawbacks that will bring this classic character to life for Victoriana gamers across the world.

Finalizing the art could take longer than anticipated. Printing and shipping could be delayed by forces outside of our control. We trust our production partners and ourselves to finish Victoriana in a timely fashion, but the unexpected may occur. \nIn order to solve these issues before they occur, we have taken every opportunity to research the production process in order to build a realistic timeline for delivery. We have purposefully limited pledge options to simplify the fulfillment process. Not only that, we have included in our timeline a generous buffer in case of unexpected delays.

You play as ghosts scaring visitors away from a hotel that used to be YOUR haunted house! Are you the scariest ghost of the night?\nUPDATE: FUNDED! Now lets unlock those Stretch Goals!\nLinks:\nReviews!\nBGG Page\nPress Page (inc Press Release)\nRulebook\nRulebook in German (coming soon!)\nRulebook in French (coming soon!)\nPrint and Play\nCreepstone Manor has been closed for nearly a hundred years, standing dark and silent above the town of Creepstone, and that\u2019s just the way resident ghost Spookie likes it! But now, the manor has been reopened and turned into a hotel for the living. You play the part of one of Spookie\u2019s ghostly minions, charged with ridding the house of these warm-bodied usurpers. Use your skills of terror to send them fleeing into the night and win Spookie\u2019s patronage. Who will be top ghost?\nAccessible: Ghostel has been designed to be inclusive from the ground up. The approachable theme (who doesn\u2019t love a haunted house!?), coupled with a straightforward ruleset mean players with a range of ages and abilities will enjoy an evening of spooky play.\nDepth of Strategy: Ghostel\u2019s ease of learning and lighter mechanics disguise a game with many player choices and interactions. Planning ahead and adapting your strategy to your opponent\u2019s decisions are vital to scoring big in the ghost house.\nIntuitive: We\u2019ve worked hard to reduce text to a minimum on the cards in play, using instinctual iconography to keep the game clear yet beautiful.\nPlaytesting: We\u2019ve taken Ghostel to many, many playtests over the two years it\u2019s been in development and logged literally hundreds of games at events such as the UK Games Expo, Playtest UK, Chaos Unpub and DragonDaze. The result is a game that feels mechanically tight with dollops of fun included.\nEducational: For younger players, Ghostel represents a fantastic way to strengthen numeracy skills through addition, subtraction and multiplication tasks throughout gameplay, as well as tactical reasoning and forward planning.\nTwo Player: The rules for a 2-player variant of the game have been carefully crafted and playtested to make sure Ghostel is just as fun for two players as it is for higher number, see a review about it here.\nStandard and Challenge Solo Modes\nThe game of Ghostel is made of rounds, and each round is split into a Day phase and a Night phase. During the Day, new people will enter the hotel whilst those who already spent the Night and survived will calm down from their night-time visitations. Meanwhile, the ghosts are hiding in the attic, preparing for the next Night by buying Terror bonuses, Scare tactics to improve their frightfulness and Spookie favours to give that extra little edge. \nDuring the Night, the ghosts walk the rooms, using all their cards and dice to frighten the humans away and show off for Spookie himself. At the start of the Night phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that Night. Players can move one room per round, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total on all dice in a room exceeds the courage score of the human in residence of that room, they\u2019re scared out of the house! Players then score based on who placed the highest scoring dice; however, scoring is graduated so even a single pip die will still score the canny player some victory points.\nFor a full version of the rulebook as a pdf, please follow this link.\n                                                     Happy to comply Nate\n  Our youngest reviewer liked it too!\n Breacher18 Preview\nSmarter Backer / Daniel Zayas\nThe Bearded Meeple Reviews\nUndead Viking Videos Reviews\n\"Those ghost meeples are SO DANG CUTE\" - Toy & Game Expo\n                                                                                            - 1 Game Board featuring the hotel rooms and the score tracker\n- 4 cute and custom Ghost figures\n- 12 Phobia tokens\n- 8 Ghostly Barrier tokens\n- 4 Score tokens\n- 87 Cards\n      - 30 Guests, each with individual artwork featuring caricatures of real people!\n      - 4 player aid cards\n      - 20 Scare Tactics with creepy phobia icons: what do you fear?!\n      - 21 Spookie Favours that give your ghosts a little bonus\n      - 12 Terror Bonus cards to help make your scare more efficient!\n- 32 six-sided Terror dice\n- 4 eight-sided Terror dice\nWe're very lucky to have found artist Tyler Johnson (Sketchgeek.com) to produce the illustrations and Rachel Dobbs (Waggle Dance) taking care of the graphic design. Between the two of them they've produced a gorgeous looking game.\nTyler has drawn the Guests as caricatures of the Tinkerbot Games Crew and three lucky competition winners from earlier in Ghostel's development, and they look amazing! Tyler has extended his fun and vibrant art style to the box and tokens included in the game, producing a cohesive and eye-catching set of images that fully realise the light-hearted yet darkly atmospheric theme of Ghostel.\nRachel has worked on some great games, and has brought that experience and enthusiasm to Ghostel. Rachel has been instrumental in reducing the text on all the cards to produce a more intuitive game whilst keeping the style set by Tyler with his excellent illustrations. Her layouts and knowledge of the industry have both meant her designs are produced efficiently and beautifully, making the visuals really 'jump' off the cardboard!\nAll Pledges: NAME OUR GHOSTIES!\nOur four ghosts don't have names!

We have reduced the price of the shipping as low as we can to make sure we don\u2019t make a loss on each copy of the game we make so we can\u2019t offer reduced shipping on pledges of five games or less. If you*are* thinking of ordering more than 5 copies (what would be considered a case of games), please send us a message here on Kickstarter or to bevan@tinkerbotgames.com and we\u2019ll help you figure out the amount to pledge depending on where in the world you are.\nExtras!\n\u00a315: A GLOW-IN-THE-DARK UPGRADE\nWould you like a little more spookiness to your special meeple?

We're going to add an additional 10 cards that can be substituted or simply added to the Guest deck. The new cards feature a new mechanic, the Pentacle Sign, that give bonuses to players who take the lowest scores from these new Guests.\n\u00a320,500 - New score trackers: We're going to upgrade those slightly boring wooden cubes to awesome translucent plastic ones, to better realise the spooky theme of Ghostel and improve how the game looks on the table.\nTop secret upgrades: We've got a couple of extras we'd like to keep a secret for now. Needless to say, you'll love them when you see them!\nBreaking from the norm\nConventional advice tells us that we shouldn\u2019t announce our stretch goals and costs at the beginning. The risk is that we may reach them all very early on and miss the opportunity to raise more money by announcing them as the project runs (i.e. if we raise \u00a319k early, we announce the \u00a319k stretch goal afterwards at \u00a321k). Though this may help us raise additional funds, one of our core missions for this campaign is to bring you the best quality game at the best value. We\u2019ve announced these stretch goals at these prices because that\u2019s how much they\u2019ll cost us to bring them to you, so that\u2019s how much we need to raise, and no more. We want to reward you for believing in us and Ghostel and supporting us when you did, so as a thanks we won\u2019t be artificially raising the stretch goal values to make more money. We've kept a couple of them a secret but that's just for a bit of fun, the value of the stretch goals are fixed and won't be changing.\nGame designer Bevan has been designing for several years now, ever since he caught the full strength gaming bug in his heady higher education days. His P&P designs have been well received (including the popular Tinker Tactics micro game) and his entry into the UK Games Expo redesign competition has seen him as a finalist in both 2014 and 2015.\nFor Ghostel, Bevan has written a series of designer blogs explaining his thought-processes when designing this eerie game of ghostly goings-on. If you fancy learning more about his methodology and the nuts and bolts behind Ghostel, feel free to check these out (we promise they aren\u2019t too long!).\nThat isn\u2019t to say we\u2019ve closed the book on Ghostel in terms of design. We love to hear what other people think about our work. If any of the information on this Kickstarter project has inspired you, we want to hear from you! Not only that, there is also an opportunity for you awesome peeps to get your face in our game via the CREEPY PORTRAIT and GRUESOME TWOSOME Pledge levels.\nThe Designer: Bevan Clatworthy\nThis displaced Cornishman spent his early life bouncing around Europe as a member of the Army Brat Brigade before settling back on his native soil of Cornwall. His love affair with gaming blossomed upon his return, as he later escaped again to Cardiff where the gaming bug really took hold, a heady mix of new friends, new funds and no bedtime.\nThe gaming cycle was fulfilled, as natural progression led Bevan to turn his hand and imagination to designing games of his own. Bevan now spends his time dreaming up new ideas whilst infecting those who stand still too long with his gaming lurgy.\nGino and Tony approached Bevan following success in the UK Games EXPO Redesign competition, bringing Ghostel with him.\nThe Developer: Gino Brancazio\nOriginally training as a teacher, Gino's interest in board games grew from a fascination with how different games facilitate unique experiences for players, especially around innovative use of mechanics when limited by components.\nAfter finding that Bevan had been designing board games, Gino decided to have a go himself, especially after playing a particularly difficult game of Arkham Horror, surely easier games could be designed...\nWorking on their first design, Epic Lab Time, Gino and Tony were finalists in the UK Games Expo redesign competition and were hooked on the game design process. Joining forces with Bevan, he has helped develop the game and create this Kickstarter campaign to help bring Bevan's first game Ghostel onto the gaming tables of families around the world.\nThe Other Developer: Tony Beard\nBorn into a highly competitive family, it\u2019s no surprise that this man was buying houses and hotels, solving murders, catching aces and fishing from a very early age. After a stint of studying on a farm in Shropshire, this Welsh boy travelled around a bit, from Blackpool to France and in between, but it was in Surrey that he fought his first \u2018colour out of space\u2019 and then the \u2018real\u2019 gaming bug took hold.\nNow back in good old South Wales, Tony splits his time between amateur theatre, dungeon mastering and board gaming, oh and sometimes a bit of paid work too! Tony loves the excitement of a new game, and a new story to be told, and hasn\u2019t lost the competitive edge although the desire to win has been tempered somewhat by games like Arkham and Eldritch Horror where gruesome and horrifying death is far more likely.\nBevan, Tony and Gino\nThe Full Version of our Campaign Video\nWith Hidden Horror Movie Game Included!\n 13 Hidden Horror Movie Titles REVEALED\n Why an \u00a317,850 target?\nWe've done the maths, read as much research as we can get our hands on (thanks Jamey Stegmaier & James Mathe!) and spoken to many producers, printers, transporters and smart folks to figure this out. \nProducing a board game is an expensive task. We've done our best to prepare for all eventualities and to make, produce and ship a game like Ghostel it's going to cost \u00a317,850. The bulk of the cost is from producing the game itself, and international freight from our manufacturers in China to the fulfilment centres around the world. On top of the cost of producing the game, we need to pay for the remaining artwork, graphic design, customs, taxes, shipping to backers from the distribution centres* and numerous other charges and fees along the way.\nBelow you can see a pie chart that tells you where the money is going to be spent.\nIt may seem like a high target to reach, but similar projects in the past have succeeded and surpassed this number so with your help we're hoping to make Ghostel a reality and see photos of it appearing on your tables around the world.\n*You may wonder why we've included freight in our campaign target when there's also additional shipping to pay on the pledges. This is because we've absorbed the international freight from the manufacturer to the distribution centres into the campaign funds to reduce the cost to the individual; your shipping fee will only be spent on getting your copy from the distribution centre to you. This is a bit of a gamble on our part as it makes it harder to reach our target, but we felt making the game more affordable for individual backers was worth the extra risk.\nOur Thanks\nThanks to Tyler Johnson for the amazing images \nRachel Dobbs for her graphic design and iconography \nJon Morgan-Heath of Black Jam Circus for the music for our video \nJamie Gibbs of Geeks in Wales for the gifs\nSami Al-Nashee for help with the audio on the videos\nDustin Schwartz for help editing the rules \nOur playtesters (too many to name!) for helping us refine the game\nThe reviewers for their excellent feedback \nOur FLGS Rules of Play for sponsoring our podcast, hosting our Ghostel events and general awesomeness in the name of board gaming\nThe Game Crafter for producing our top quality prototypes\nWinGo for help with many, many quotes, production and shipping info\nOur friends and family for supporting us this far, it's been a long two years and many late nights\nAnd finally, thanks to you for being part of this campaign with us, for supporting us with a pledge or a share, and for getting this far down the Kickstarter page. Good work!\nSocial Avatars!\nWould you like to show that you're part of the Ghostel team? Want to help raise awareness for this campaign? Then take one of our avatars below and make it your facebook or twitter! Does your scary face match one of our guests? Or perhaps you share one of their fears? There's plenty to choose from!\n Social Media\nIf you want to grab us on social media you can find us on:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nBGG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and Challenges\n\nThis is the first time we've had to organise a Kickstarter. Fortunately, both Gino and myself are experienced project managers in our day jobs where we often have to organise complex programmes with integrated budgets. It is these key skills that we will be bringing to the campaign. However, as with any project there will be challenges:\n\nSHIPPING\nWe know that the backbone of any successful campaign is making sure that the backer rewards reach their owners in a timely manner and in great condition. We've done hours of research and built relationships with several reputable fulfilment centres around the world ahead of launching this campaign to make sure we get the best deal for you. This includes shipping from within regions where possible to remove the issue of customs charges. \nHowever, there will always be events that are out of our control; strikes, storms and the unforeseen. Rest assured we will do our best to rectify these issues if they rear their heads but please be aware that our delivery estimate is just that; an estimate based on the best of our knowledge.\n\n\nMANUFACTURE\nAs with shipping we've done our homework, choosing the excellent WinGo Games to manufacture our games. Their reputation is solid and the feedback we've had from previous clients has always been positive.\nManufacture in China is not without challenges. The timezone issue and the busyness of a manufacturing schedule can cause a few delays in communication. We also have custom components included in Ghostel which also come with teething problems as we adjust and quality control until we get the best for you, the backers. Whilst we don't foresee any delays, past experience in our day jobs coupled with our discussions with industry moguls have given us a taste of what to expect and that any project (especially one as complex as a board game) will have some 'tricky bits'.\n\nTHE THANK YOU VIDEO\nFor our video, we're going to be filming at a haunted location, at the dead of night. This may be tempting trouble if the ethereal residents we'll be filming alongside decide we are not welcome (some ghosts are notorious prima donnas), which may result in our 'disappearance'.\nTo address this risk, both myself and Gino will ensure we leave Ouija boards and the contact numbers of a reputable medium with our spouses. In this way we hope to be able to continue communication with the living world and ensure manufacture and fulfilment go ahead. It will make attending the UK Games EXPO convention a trial, but hey what's unlife without a bit of tribulation!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Haunticulture Kickstarter - It's ALIIIIIIIIVE", "update_content": "Hello there awesome backers!\nWe hope you folks are having a wonderful spooky season, and getting lots of creepy gaming in to boot!

Each scenario presents different quests that must be fulfilled in order to be victorious, and various monsters the heroes will need to defeat on their way. The monsters react to the heroes' actions, so no one is stuck playing the role of game master.\nThe Heroes of Arcadia!\nAs the heroes defeat their enemies and accomplish quests, their guilds rake in the coins, which will then allow them to acquire all sorts of powerful loot! From legendary weapons and armor, to new abilities and magic items. The combination of each hero's unique ability with all the different upgrades they earn through the campaign allows players to create amazing and unexpected combos!\nThe Monsters of Inferno!\nInferno is a standalone box, but also fully compatible with previous Arcadia Quest boxes. It contains a full campaign with 12 scenarios for players to explore. As players progress through the circles of Inferno, deeper and deeper into the Underworld, the campaign branches into two distinct paths. The path not taken results in quests the players will not fulfill, and therefore consequences that will come back to haunt them towards the end of the campaign.\nThe Angels. Will they help or hinder you?\nOne such key choice are the Angels. These secret protectors of Arcadia have been imprisoned by the Underlord, who is trying to corrupt them. If players rescue these Angels, they become powerful additions to their Guilds. But beware, the Angels that are abandoned to their fate will be consumed and come back as monsters to seek revenge on the heroes!\nProduction plastic miniatures of the Inferno monsters, angels, and heroes.\nGoing down into the infernal depths presents the heroes of Arcadia with a new set of challenges and opportunities, in the form of Damnation! This dark power permeates everything in Inferno, and daring heroes may want to use it to their advantage (and face the consequences). Weapons and equipment found in Inferno may become more powerful if a hero takes Damnation, monsters may offer the choice of taking Damnation instead of wounds (or flat out dealing Damnation to their target). However, accumulating Damnation may come at a high price. Some Upgrades are more effective against heroes with Damnation, some monsters more powerful against them, and specially Brimstone cards scattered through the scenarios may activate monsters to attack heroes who dabble too much in the dark powers!\nMany of the Upgrade cards use Damnation to punish or reward heroes.\nArcadia Quest: Inferno comes with:\n36 highly detailed figures, including:\n  12 Hero figures\n  5 Angel figures\n  19 Monster figures (6x Demoness, 6x Harpy, 2x Demon Pitcher, 2x Cerberus, Belly'aal, The Judge, The Underlord)\n12 color plastic bases\n8 Attack dice \n6 Defense dice \n9 double-sided game tiles \n4 guild dashboards \n276 cards\n300+ tokens\nCampaign Sheet pad\nRulebook\nCampaign Book\nExplore a brand new campaign, and add Pets to any Arcadia Quest experience with the Optional Buy Arcadia Quest: Pets expansion!\nFind out everything about the Pets Optional Buy box HERE.\nIf you wish to extend your campaign beyond the 6th scenario, don't miss out on the ultimate showdown with the Frost Dragon expansion box!\nFind out everything about the Frost Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nThe mad fight against the Chaos Dragon also takes place after the 6th scenario and brings a whole new epic experience to Arcadia Quest!\n Find out everything about the Chaos Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nNo epic campaign can end without a showdown against the majestic Fire Dragon!\nFind out everything about the Fire Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nHell of a Pledge - $100\nThe Hell of a Pledge gives you an Arcadia Quest: Inferno core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero King David III, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nKing David III is a natural born leader. Well, at least he was born into leadership as the rightful ruler of Arcadia, but now most of his power has shifted to the Guilds. He's still able to rally his comrades in a fight, though, allowing his guild to activate another Hero if he ends his movement in the same space.\nProduction plastic miniature of King David III.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON crew gathered their guilds and went down into the depths of Inferno in order to produce a gameplay video for you.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. \n  $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.

After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will treat it as abandoned and will refund or ship on a case by case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.

Go to www.secrethitler.com for the most up-to-date information. There you can also read the full rules and download the game to print-and-play for yourself right now!\nSecret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u2019s too late.\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\nSecret Hitler is designed by Max Temkin (Cards Against Humanity, Humans vs. Zombies) Mike Boxleiter (Solipskier, TouchTone), Tommy Maranges (Philosophy Bro) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Letter Tycoon, Penny Press).\nIn Secret Hitler, each player is randomly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists know in advance who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is. Since the liberal team always has a majority, the fascists must play like moles, gaining the trust of the liberals to sabotage their plans and make them suspicious of each other.\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass 5 liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass 6 fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after 3 fascist policies have passed.\nEach round, the President selects a Chancellor. The whole table votes \"Ja!\" or \"Nein!\" on their ticket; if a majority of players vote \u201cJa!,\u201d the elected President and Chancellor take the following actions to pass a new policy:\nThe President draws 3 policies from a random deck.\nThe President discards 1 policy and passes 2 to the Chancellor.\nThe Chancellor discards 1 policy and enacts the final one as law.\nIf a fascist policy passes, the President gains a new power that she must use immediately. These include:\nIf Hitler is executed, the game ends immediately in a Liberal Victory.\nSecret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre.\nThe first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\u2019s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team.\nThe second new mechanic is the \u201cHitler\u201d identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\u2019 trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.\nSecret Hitler is a love letter to hidden identity games like Werewolf/Mafia, The Resistance, and Avalon, but it's also a new design that fixes some of our biggest problems with those games.\nNo moderator: Secret Hitler doesn't require a moderator - everyone can join in the game.\nNo early player elimination: We love the suspense of player elimination, but Secret Hitler saves that drama for the very end\u2014assassinated players will rarely have to wait more than ten minutes before the game ends.\nIn games like Werewolf, you can only act on your gut feeling. Secret Hitler creates a much more heady experience - there's almost enough information that you can solve the game like a puzzle, but not quite enough. Players always have enough information to make meaningful choices, but we've simplified the decisions to avoid analysis paralysis; each round the President nominates a Chancellor, and the table votes yes or no to that ticket.\nSecret Hitler is enormously replayable because the ways the presidential powers are used and the table position of the players is never the same twice. We've played hundreds of rounds of Secret Hitler, and the metagame is still evolving in very exciting ways.\nWhy is Secret Hitler set in 1933 Germany? We believe that the theme and setting of a game work best when they help explain the story and mechanics.\nHitler\u2019s takeover was, for a dictator, surprisingly political: he wasn\u2019t a general who subverted a popular revolution, he wasn\u2019t backed by foreign interests, there wasn\u2019t a total collapse of government he took advantage of. He used the rickety systems of the Weimar Republic to gain power mostly legally; he was handed the Chancellorship by men who thought they could \"control\" him.\nHitler and his allies spent years manipulating the levers of democracy, accumulating power in a snowball effect. He divided and intimidated his rivals. He used national crises to strengthen his own position. His followers were organized and brutal, and his rise was equally engineered and opportunistic. There were good men who didn't understand how dangerous he was until it was too late, and there were bad men who wanted power for themselves but were outmaneuvered.\nSocial Deduction games are about a well-coordinated minority trying to convince a confused majority to vote against its interests. It's an inherently political genre.\nWe set out to make a game to help us reflect on the ways that others - good, bad, indifferent - were complicit in Hitler's rise to power. Our game doesn't model the specifics of German parliamentary politics. Instead, we try to model the paranoia and distrust he exploited, the opportunism that his rivals failed to account for, and the disastrous temptation to solve systemic problems by giving more power to the \"right people.\"\nSecret Hitler has a unique capacity to create intense, memorable play sessions. Frankly, none of us had ever playtested a game that gets this kind of a reaction before.\nAt Gen Con in 2015, we were shocked to see demo sets of Secret Hitler sweep through an industry party full of game designers. By the end of the night, every single table was playing, with people jumping out of their seats to shout and and cheer at the end of each game.\nWe played Secret Hitler at San Diego Comic Con 2015 with Richard Stevens (creator of Diesel Sweeties) who monitored his heart rate on a Apple watch throughout the game. By the end, he was registering 121 BPM - that's on the high end of what an astronaut will experience during a shuttle launch.\nRichard Stevens' heart rate during a game of Secret Hitler\nHere's what some of our playtesters had to say about the game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'd been playtesting Secret Hitler for nearly a year when we launched this Kickstarter, and we're so excited to get it into your hands.\n\nOur team has a lot of experience manufacturing and shipping games.

Check out their webpages, they're pretty spectacular.\nDepictions of nightmares contain some unsettling images. In particular the depictions of mutilation may not be suitable for children. There's also some mild nudity, which seems less important but we respect that there are some cultural differences in this regard.

The first attempts to explore inside it ended in disaster.\nGuide the remaining survivors through the sprawling passageways of the Nullpoint. Explore, scavenge, and survive long enough, and you may uncover the story of the ill-fated expeditions, and the dark secrets of the Nullpoint itself. \nFor anyone to escape the Nullpoint, sacrifices will have to be made. New survivors can always be found to replace the fallen. But beware: there are no reloads, and backup isn\u2019t coming. If your survivors all die, you\u2019ll have to start again from the beginning.\nQuick Overview\nPlatforms: PC / MAC\nReal-Time Tactics - Control up to 5 survivors with a scheme familiar to any RTS player.\nSurvival Horror Elements - Scavenge for limited supplies, but keep a lookout for things that lurk in the darkness. Gauge carefully whether to fight, run, or hide based off of your team's resources.\nShip-based & On-foot Exploration - Guide your ship between docks in the Nullpoint, then disembark and take your survivors on loot runs.\nShip Upgrade Meta - Use scavenged resources to upgrade & repair your ship's internal systems.\nRoguelike Gameplay Loop - Getting through the Nullpoint will be difficult, and the stakes are high. If all survivors in the party die, the game will reset and the dungeons will re-randomize.\nProcedural, Real-time Tactics Dungeon Crawling:\nCommand up to 5 survivors using RTS-style controls through the vast, procedurally-generated levels of the Nullpoint. No two runs will be the same unless you choose to share your world seed with a friend.\nScavenge for Resources:\nResources are scarce. Your band of survivors will rely on scavenging what supplies remain from the ruined expedition outposts scattered throughout the Nullpoint.\nExploring beyond the base camps could yield even better rewards, if you\u2019re willing to risk venturing into the deepest, darkest parts of the facility.\nUpgrade Your Ship:\nYour survivors have only one shelter - a transport shuttle left behind by one of the prior expeditions. This will be your teams\u2019 only refuge from the Nullpoint\u2019s punishing, hostile environment. Treat it with care. You only get one.\nOn board the ship, you\u2019ll navigate through the Nullpoint, re-equip, and heal your crew. However, the benefits your ship offers are limited based on where you invest resources.  \nDo you repair the healing systems or the item dispenser? Do you rig together a station to upgrade your weapons instead? Or, do you play it safe, and repair the ship\u2019s fraying outer hull?\n\n\nMourn The Dead, Protect the Living:\nThe Nullpoint is a cold, brutal place. Survivors will die, but as long as at least one stays alive, the story continues.\nThat sole survivor might go on to rebuild the team and keep the hope of escaping the Nullpoint alive.\nIt all began by chance. A deep space probe on its way out of the solar system reported a strange, blank spot in the background radiation scans. Follow-up scans confirmed the deadzone, but nothing could penetrate or identify it.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know what, but something was unmistakably out there, floating quietly in loose orbit just past Saturn.\nThe next probe was sent, equipped and prepared to photograph the dark spot, and the results were explosive. The Nullpoint, as the media called it, wasn\u2019t an asteroid or a gas cloud. It was a structure. Whatever it was, it was massive, capable of absorbing every wavelength outside the visible spectrum, and not built by human hands.\n\nThe prospect of alien technology prompted several governments and corporations to assemble fleets and make the year-long journey out to the Nullpoint, to lay claim to a piece of this new milestone in human history.\n\nThey ventured into the Nullpoint prepared for anything - diplomacy, research, war.\n\nThe truth of what they found remains buried in the Nullpoint with them.\n\n\nExplore at Your Own Pace:\nThe Superstructure is massive. Finding the shuttle doesn't mean finding a way out.\nThe Nullpoint\u2019s interior is broken up into two biomes: Superstructure and Substrates. The Superstructure is comprised of cavernous interior passageways big enough that humanity\u2019s capital ships were able to easily fly inside them.\nDotting the Superstructure are numerous access points to the Substrates: a maze of corridors and passageways that can only be explored on foot.\nAbandoned camps in the Substrates are a great place to scavenge.\nYou will guide your survivors and their ship through the Superstructure in search of docking points where your survivors can then disembark to search for supplies.\nSecure the dock when you first disembark... or risk being cut off from the ship on the way back.\nSome Substrates contain valuable forward base camps that can be looted, while others will contain the alien control consoles needed to unlock the next Superstructure layer and advance the game. It\u2019s up to you to which of these Substrates you\u2019d like to risk exploring, and how deep you venture into them before turning back to the ship.\nFight, Outsmart, or Sneak Past the Horrors of the Nullpoint:\nResources are scarce, and even the most basic monsters can be deadly. You will have to develop strategies for carefully managing your limited supplies. Your team's lives depend on conserving ammunition, and rationing your first aid kits.\nStrategic Monster Design:\nEvery being in the Nullpoint has a story, and a unique set of abilities and behaviors. Some monsters are deaf and blind. Others can hear a gunshot from a mile away. Some won\u2019t attack you at all\u2026until, for some reason, they do. Some monsters will even fight each other, given the opportunity.\nIt\u2019s up to you to study their behavior, and discover how to best avoid, fight or exploit them.\nCurrently we're targeting a PC and MAC release. \nWe're planning to release on Steam, but definitely want to provide a DRM-free option as well.\nWe are a group of veteran game developers working at Schell Games in Pittsburgh, PA. \nNullpoint is a project we\u2019ve been working on in our spare time for nearly a year. We\u2019re ready to share what we\u2019ve been working on with the world, and ultimately Kickstart a fully-realized version.\nThe Nullpoint team is bolstered by the circle of support here at Schell Games, including developers like Marc Tattersall (Diablo II), Michael Giam (Twisted Metal), Tim Sweeney (City of Heroes), Harley Baldwin White-Wiedow (Tomb Raider: Underworld), Matt Mahon (Dungeon Siege II), and Jesse Schell (Art of Game Design).\nAs a team, we\u2019ve been heavily influenced by games like Darkest Dungeon, Faster Than Light, The Binding of Isaac, and Dark Souls. We love hard games \u2013 games that force you to evaluate your choices carefully, and give your choices meaning by raising the stakes on what you stand to lose.\nSchell Games has agreed to cover two thirds of our development costs. That\u2019s enough for us to cover basic functionality like saving and loading, survivor persistence, AI, menus, and all the other things few people initially think about when imagining game development. After further discussion, we determined we\u2019d need more than that to really make a game worth playing.\nAll of the funds from Kickstarter (apart from Kickstarter\u2019s 8% cut, and the costs of our rewards) will go directly toward adding features and content to the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- The Risk of Making Something Weird.\nThere\u2019s always risk involved when building something completely new and different. Part of why we so badly want to make this game is because we\u2019ve never played something quite like it before. It\u2019s sitting in between a few genres, but doesn\u2019t quite follow any existing game formula.\n\nBecause of our game\u2019s uniqueness, we have already faced and will continue to face unique technical and design challenges. Things that sound fun at first might turn out to be annoying or repetitive. We\u2019ve been planning our features conservatively to make sure we have enough iteration time to pivot and adjust to feedback on these features as they become a reality.\n\n- Feature Risk.\nWe\u2019re building a systems-heavy game, and we know games like this thrive on having a robust feature set. That said, we\u2019re also committed to making a solid and compelling experience. Because of that, we\u2019re more willing to cut features than we are to cut the overall quality of the game.\n \nThis means if something goes wrong in development, some features might slip in the interest of making sure that what we do ship is fun to play.\n\n- Risk of Challenge vs. Frustration.\nWe\u2019re intentionally making a challenging game. Nullpoint is not a game that\u2019s meant to be beaten on the first try, and that challenge is what makes getting to the next level of (or beating) the game rewarding.\n\nOf course, the risk with challenging games is that they can end up being more frustrating than rewarding to play. We are reserving time to iterate and react to feedback from the early-access community for exactly this issue, to make sure Nullpoint doesn\u2019t become that kind of game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Schell Games\n3 created \u00b7 6 backed\nSchell Games, an independent game studio founded in 2002 by world class game designer and award-winning author Jesse Schell, is made up of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Thunderclap Link", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nI apologize, but the link we sent out yesterday was broken.
